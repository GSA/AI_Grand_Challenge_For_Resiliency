      Explanation
      The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
      Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
      
        Title 1 through Title 16 
        as of January 1
        Title 17 through Title 27 
        as of April 1
        Title 28 through Title 41 
        as of July 1
        Title 42 through Title 50 
        as of October 1
      
      The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.
      
        LEGAL STATUS
        The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).
      
      
        HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
        The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
        To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.
      
      
        EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
        Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.
      
      
        OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

        The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.
      
      
        PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
        Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.
      
      
        “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
        The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.
      
      
        INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
        
          What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
        
          What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
        (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
        (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
        (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
        
          What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.
      
      
        CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

        A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
        
        An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
        The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
        A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

            Central organization.
            (a) Central office. The national office of the Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, is located in the Auditors Building, 14th and Independence Avenue, SW. Washington, DC. It consists of the Office of the Chief and Associate Chief, and a Deputy Chief for each of the following five activities: Programs and Legislation, National Forest System, Research, State and Private Forestry, and Administration. All communications should be addressed to the Forest Service, Department of Agriculture, P.O. Box 96090, Washington, DC 20090-6090.
            (b) Chief of the Forest Service. The Chief of the Forest Service, under the direction of the Secretary of Agriculture, administers the formulation, direction, and execution of Forest Service policies, programs, and activities.
            (c) Deputy Chiefs. The major activities of the Forest Service at the headquarters level are divided into five Deputy Chief areas with each further divided into staff units. The programs and functions of staff units are directed by staff directors and may be subdivided into groups headed by group leaders. A description of the major activities of each Deputy Chief follows:
            (1) Programs and legislation. Overall planning of Forest Service programs, policy formulation and analysis, budgeting, legislative development, reporting and liaison, and environmental coordination.
            (2) National Forest System. Administration of National Forest System lands and management of natural resources within the principle of multiple use and sustained yield. Management includes planning, coordinating, and directing the national resource programs of timber, range, wildlife, recreation, watershed, and mineral areas; and support activities of fire, engineering, lands, aviation, and computer systems. The National Forest System includes:
            
            
              155 Proclaimed or designated National Forests
              20 National Grasslands
              51 Purchase Units
              8 Land Utilization Projects
              20 Research and Experimental Areas
              33 Other Areas
            
            
            The first four classifications listed above are administered as 121 Forest Service Administrative Units, each headed by a Forest Supervisor. National Recreation Areas, National Forest Wildernesses, and Primitive Areas are included in the above land classifications.
            (3) Research.

            § 200.2
            Field organization.
            The field organization of the Forest Service consists of regions, stations, and areas as described below:
            (a) Regions of the National Forest System. For the purpose of managing the lands administered by the Forest Service, the United States is divided into nine geographic regions of the National Forest System. Each region has a headquarters office and is supervised by a Regional Forester who is responsible to the Chief for the activities assigned to that region. Within each region are located national forests and other lands of the Forest Service.
            (1) National Forests. Each Forest has a headquarters office and is supervised by a Forest Supervisor who is responsible to the Regional Forester. Two or more proclaimed or designated National Forests, or all of the Forests in a State, may be combined into one Forest Service Administrative Unit headed by one Forest Supervisor. Each Forest is divided into Ranger Districts. The Alaska Region is composed of two National Forests without Ranger Districts; with one Forest divided into three areas, each administered by a Forest Supervisor.
            (2) Ranger districts. Each district may include a portion of a national forest, a national grassland or portion thereof, a national recreation area, a wilderness or primitive area, and other lands administered by the Forest Service. Each district has a headquarters office and is supervised by a District Ranger (or Area Ranger in some cases) who is responsible to the Forest Supervisor.
            (b) Forest and rangeland research coordination. The field research program is coordinated by six research stations, the national Forest Products Laboratory, and the International Institute of Tropical Forestry. Each has a headquarters office and a Director who is responsible to the Chief for all research activities within a geographical area of the United States or its territories. Scientists are based at Research Work Units with laboratories located in 36 lower States, Hawaii, Alaska, and Puerto Rico. Scientists primarily conduct their work within a given geographical area, but due to the integrated and cooperative nature of the research program, they make work nationwide and internationally.
            (c) State and private forestry cooperation. Field level cooperation between the Forest Service, States, and the private sector on forestry activities is accomplished by the Northeastern Area State and Private Forestry for the Northeastern States; and by the National Forest Regional Offices in the Southeastern and Western States. The Northeastern Area is supervised by an Area Director who is responsible to the Chief for State and private forestry activities within the Area. Regional Foresters in Regions 1 through 8 and Region 10 are responsible for State and private forestry activities within those regions.
            (d) International Institute of Tropical Forestry. The Institute is managed by a Director who is the senior Forest Service official in Puerto Rico. The Director is responsible to the Chief for planning and directing research, science and technology exchange, technical assistance to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and international cooperation on natural resources concerning tropical forestry.
            (e) Field addresses. The addresses of Regional Foresters, Station Directors, and Area Directors are given below. Under each Regional Office address is a list of National Forest Administrative Units by States with locations of Forest Supervisor headquarters. Headquarters locations for Ranger Districts, National Grasslands, and National Recreation Areas are not listed but may be obtained from Forest Supervisors or Regional Foresters.

          Subpart B—Functions and Procedures
          
            § 200.3
            Forest Service functions.
            (a) Legislative authority. The basic laws authorizing activities of the Forest Service are set forth in the U.S.C. in title 7 (Agriculture), chapters 14, 17, 33, 55, 59, and 61; title 16 (Conservation), chapters 2, 3, 4, 5C, 6, 23, 27, 28, 30, 36, and 37; title 29 (Labor), chapter 17; and title 43 (Public Lands), chapters 22 and 35.
            (b) Work of the Forest Service. Under delegated authority from the Secretary of Agriculture, the broad responsibilities of the Forest Service are:
            (1) Leadership in forestry. The Forest Service provides overall leadership in forest and forest-range conservation, development, and use. This involves determination of forestry conditions and requirements, and recommendations of policies and programs needed to keep the Nation's private and public lands fully productive.
            (2) National Forest System administration. (i) The Forest Service administers and manages the National Forest System lands in accordance with the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of June 12, 1960 (16 U.S.C. 528-531); the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of August 17, 1974 (16 U.S.C. 1600-1614); and the National Forest Management Act of October 22, 1976 (16 U.S.C. 472a, 476, 500, 513-516, 521b; 576b, 1600-1602, 1604, 1606, 1608-1614).
            
            (ii) The National Forest System comprises about 188 million acres of land in the National Forests, National Grasslands, and other areas which have been transferred to the Forest Service for administration. On these public lands:
            (A) Forestry methods are applied in growing and harvesting timber,
            (B) Forage is scientifically managed for the use of domestic livestock whose numbers are kept in balance with the carrying capacity of the range,
            (C) Wildlife habitat and species are managed,
            (D) Watersheds are managed to safeguard the water supply and stabilize streamflow,
            (E) Recreation resources are managed for public enjoyment and benefit,
            (F) Many forms of land and resource use are granted under permit or lease, and
            (G) Physical and resource improvements needed to develop, protect, and use all resources are built and maintained.
            (3) Cooperative forestry. The Forest Service carries out cooperative forestry programs for public benefit through programs initiated by State, county, and other Federal agencies in accordance with the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of July 1, 1978 (16 U.S.C. 2101-2111). These programs are directed at the protection, development, and sustained production of all forestry resources, both public and private.
            (4) Forest research. The Forest Service conducts research on problems involving protection, development, management, renewal, and continuous use of all resources, products, values, and services of forest lands in accordance with the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Research Act of June 30, 1978 (16 U.S.C. 1641-1647). Research is conducted on:
            (i) Forest and range management, including the five basic resources of timber, forest soil and water, range forage, wildlife and fish habitat, and forest recreation,
            (ii) Forest protection from fire, insects, and disease,
            (iii) Forest products and engineering, and
            (iv) Forest resource economics including forest survey, forest economics, and forest products marketing.
            [44 FR 37505, June 27, 1979]
          
          
            § 200.4
            Administrative issuances.
            (a) The regulations of the Secretary of Agriculture governing the protection and administration of National Forest System lands and other programs of the Forest Service are set forth in Chapter 2 of Title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
            (b) Administrative policy, procedure, and guidance to Forest Service employees for the conduct of Forest Service activities are issued as directives, or through correspondence, by the office of the Chief of the Forest Service and by the field officers listed in § 200.2.
            (1) Directives are issued through the Forest Service Directive System, which is comprised of the Forest Service Manual and related Forest Service Handbooks. The Directive System codifies the agency's policy, practice, and procedure affecting more than one unit and the delegations of continuing authority and assignment of continuing responsibilities; serves as the primary administrative basis for the internal management and control of all programs; and is the primary source of administrative direction to Forest Service employees.
            (2) In contrast to direction issued through the Directive System, guidance issued to one or more organizational units through letters and memoranda relate to decisions or interpretations on specific activities, cases, or incidents or to other matters of agency business, especially those matters of short-term duration or immediate interest.
            (c) Forest Service Directive System issuances are published under delegated authority as follows:
            (1) The Forest Service Manual and Forest Service Handbook issuances to all Forest Service units are published by the Office of the Chief.

            (2) Forest Service Manual and Forest Service Handbook issuances may be supplemented as needed for field office use by a Regional Forester, a Regional Special Agent in Charge of Law Enforcement and Investigations, a Research Station Director, the International Institute for Tropical Forestry Director, the Area Director, or a Forest Supervisor.
            (d) Guidance issued through letters and memoranda must be issued in accordance with signing authorities delegated through issuances to the Forest Service Directive System.
            (e) An alphabetical index of the contents of the Forest Service Manual and related Forest Service Handbooks is published in Forest Service Handbook 1109.12, Directive System Handbook. The index contains a listing of all Series, Titles, and Chapters in the Forest Service Manual and a listing of all Forest Service Handbooks in the Directive System.
            (f) Forest Service Handbook 6209.11, Records Management Handbook, outlines and indexes the filing system for all correspondence and other records.
            (g) Forms and reports used by the agency are listed in, and instructions for their use are issued throughout, the Forest Service Directive System and are collated in Forest Service Handbook 1309.14, Information Requirements Handbook.
            [62 FR 33367, June 19, 1997, as amended at 74 FR 19143, Apr. 28, 2009]
          
          
            § 200.5
            Indexes.
            Publication of the indexes described in § 200.4 is deemed both unnecessary and impractical because of the large volume of material involved. However, copies of the indexes are available for public review in the Forest Service headquarters office in Washington, DC, and at field offices listed under § 200.2(d). The Forest Service will provide copies of any index upon request at a cost not to exceed the direct cost of duplication.

            § 200.6
            Information available; inspection, copying, and charges.
            (a) In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 7 CFR 1.2, the Forest Service shall make available for public inspection and copying all published or unpublished directives, forms, records, and final opinions, including concurring or dissenting opinions and orders made in the adjudication of cases. Charges for information requested from the Forest Service are set out in paragraph (d) of this section and vary according to the type of information requested.
            (b) Information made available pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section may be obtained at the Office of the Chief, or the office of any Regional Forester, Research Station Director, Area Director, Institute Director, Forest Supervisor, or District Ranger. The addresses of these offices are set forth in §§ 200.1 and 200.2. Forest Service personnel at these offices will assist members of the public seeking Forest Service records. However, Research Station and Institute Directors and District Rangers may not have all volumes of the Forest Service Manual and Handbooks. When the information requested is not available at a given location, the personnel where the request is received will direct the requester to another office where the information may be obtained.
            (c) Inspection and copying availability is as follows:
            (1) Facilities for inspection and copying are available at the offices listed in §§ 200.1 and 200.2, during established office hours for the particular location, usually 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday. Copying facilities may not be available at all Forest Service offices.
            (2) Requesters for information may make copies of available information without charge if they elect to bring their own copy equipment to the appropriate offices listed in §§ 200.1 and 200.2.
            (3) Requesters should make prior arrangements for using agency copying facilities or for bringing in copying equipment and, in the later case, should get advance approval from the office.

            (d) Any request for information pursuant to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act must be submitted in accordance with §§ 200.7 and 200.8. The Forest Service charges a fee for copies of records not generally made available to the public but released pursuant to a FOIA request in accordance with a schedule of fees established by the Department of Agriculture at 7 CFR Part 1, Subpart A, Appendix A. These fees do not apply to information that is generally and routinely made available to the public upon request, such as recreational brochures, pamphlets, maps, and technical guides as well as agency directive issuances. Separate charges for such general information are established in the agency's Directive System (§ 200.4). For example, some pamphlets and small segments of the Forest Service Manual and Handbook may be provided at no cost, but maps of the National Forest System and larger sections of the Manual and Handbook are available for a charge. Current charges are explained at the time the request is made.

            § 200.7
            Request for records.
            Requests for records and the processing of those records are governed by the rules at 7 CFR 1.6. Agency officials are authorized to receive and act on requests for records as follows:
            (a) The Regional Forester, Regional Special Agent in charge, Research Station Director, Area Director, and Institute Director at the field locations and addresses listed in § 200.2; the Director of Law Enforcement and Investigations, other Staff Directors, or other officials whom the Chief may authorize, located in the Washington Office, are authorized to receive requests for such records, to make determinations regarding whether records exist, and to grant or deny requests for records exempt from disclosure under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552(b).
            (b) Each of the officials listed in paragraph (a) of this section also is authorized to take the following actions:
            (1) Extend the 10-day administrative deadline for reply pursuant to 7 CFR 1.14;
            (2) Make discretionary releases pursuant to 7 CFR 1.17(b) of records exempt from mandatory disclosure;

            § 211.5
            Emergency fire suppression assistance.
            (a) Definitions. For the purpose of this subpart these definitions apply:

            (1) Prescribed fire means a fire burning under a set of specified conditions which will accomplish certain planned resource management objectives.
            (2) Escaped prescribed fire means a prescribed fire which has either exceeded the prescription or has rekindled after it has been declared to be out.
            (b) In the absence of a written reciprocal agreement with any fire organization or in situations outside the scope of an agreement, the Forest Service is authorized to render emergency assistance in suppressing fires and in preserving life and property from the threat of fire within the vicinity of Forest Service fire protection facilities under the following conditions:
            (1) If a prescribed fire initiated on lands administered by the Forest Service escapes onto lands not administered by the Forest Service, the Forest Service may commit personnel, materials, and equipment without reimbursement or consideration of the fire's continuing threat to National Forest System lands or resources.
            (2) When requested, the Forest Service may commit personnel, materials, and equipment on a reimbursable basis on lands not administered by the Forest Service without regard to the fire's threat to National Forest System lands or resources.

            § 211.6
            Cooperation in forest investigations or the protection, management, and improvement of the National Forest System.
            (a) Purpose and scope. Forest Service officers, when engaged in cooperative activities otherwise authorized, may receive monies from cooperators only for cooperative work in forest investigations or for the protection, management, and improvement of the National Forest System and only in accordance with written cooperative agreements. Management of the National Forest System may include such work as planning, analysis, and related studies, as well as resource activities.
            (b) Reimbursements. Agency expenditures for work undertaken in accordance with this section may be made from Forest Service appropriations available for such work, with subsequent reimbursement from the cooperator, in accordance with established written agreements. Forest Service officers shall issue written bills for collection for cooperator reimbursement payments within the same fiscal year as Forest Service expenditures.
            (c) Bonding. Each written agreement involving a non-Government cooperator's total contribution of $25,000 or more to the Forest Service on a reimbursable basis, must include a provision requiring a payment bond to guarantee the cooperator's reimbursement payment. Acceptable security for a payment bond includes Department of the Treasury approved corporate sureties, Federal Government obligations, and irrevocable letters of credit. For the purposes of this section, a non-Government cooperator is an entity that is not a member, division, or affiliate of a Federal, State, local government, a federally recognized Indian Tribe (as defined by the Federally Recognized Indian Tribe List Act of 1994 [25 U.S.C. 479a]), or other organizations funding a Forest Service agreement with pass through funding from an entity that is a member, division, or affiliate of a Federal, State, local government, or federally recognized Indian Tribe.
            (d) Avoiding conflict of interest. Forest Service officers shall avoid acceptance of contributions from cooperators when such contributions would reflect unfavorably upon the ability of the Forest Service to carry out its responsibilities and duties. Forest Service officers shall be guided by the provisions of 18 U.S.C. parts 201-209, 5 CFR part 2635, and applicable Department of Agriculture regulations, in determining if a conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest exists in a proposed cooperative effort. Forest Service ethics officials or the designated Department of Agriculture ethics official should be consulted on conflict of interest issues.

            § 212.5
            Road system management.
            (a) Traffic rules. Rules set forth under 36 CFR part 261 and this section shall apply to all National Forest System roads under the jurisdiction of the Forest Service except when in conflict with written agreement.
            (1) General. Traffic on roads is subject to State traffic laws where applicable except when in conflict with designations established under subpart B of this part or with the rules at 36 CFR part 261.
            (2) Specific. The following specific traffic rules shall apply unless different rules are established in 36 CFR part 261.
            (i) The load, weight, length, height, and width limitations of vehicles shall be in accordance with the laws of the States wherein the road is located. Greater or lesser limits may be imposed and these greater or lesser limits shall be established as provided in 36 CFR part 261.
            (ii) Roads, or segments thereof, may be restricted to use by certain classes of vehicles or types of traffic as provided in 36 CFR part 261. Classes of vehicles may include but are not limited to distinguishable groupings such as passenger cars, buses, trucks, motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles, 4-wheel drive vehicles, off-highway vehicles, and trailers. Types of traffic may include but are not limited to groupings such as commercial hauling, recreation, and administrative.
            (iii) Roads, or segments thereof, may be closed to all vehicle use as provided in 36 CFR part 261.
            (iv) Additional rules may be imposed as provided in 36 CFR part 261.
            (b) Road system—(1) Identification of road system. For each national forest, national grassland, experimental forest, and any other units of the National Forest System (§ 212.1), the responsible official must identify the minimum road system needed for safe and efficient travel and for administration, utilization, and protection of National Forest System lands. In determining the minimum road system, the responsible official must incorporate a science-based roads analysis at the appropriate scale and, to the degree practicable, involve a broad spectrum of interested and affected citizens, other state and federal agencies, and tribal governments. The minimum system is the road system determined to be needed to meet resource and other management objectives adopted in the relevant land and resource management plan (36 CFR part 219), to meet applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, to reflect long-term funding expectations, to ensure that the identified system minimizes adverse environmental impacts associated with road construction, reconstruction, decommissioning, and maintenance.
            (2) Identification of unneeded roads. Responsible officials must review the road system on each National Forest and Grassland and identify the roads on lands under Forest Service jurisdiction that are no longer needed to meet forest resource management objectives and that, therefore, should be decommissioned or considered for other uses, such as for trails. Decommissioning roads involves restoring roads to a more natural state. Activities used to decommission a road include, but are not limited to, the following: reestablishing former drainage patterns, stabilizing slopes, restoring vegetation, blocking the entrance to the road, installing water bars, removing culverts, reestablishing drainage-ways, removing unstable fills, pulling back road shoulders, scattering slash on the roadbed, completely eliminating the roadbed by restoring natural contours and slopes, or other methods designed to meet the specific conditions associated with the unneeded road. Forest officials should give priority to decommissioning those unneeded roads that pose the greatest risk to public safety or to environmental degradation.
            (c) Cost recovery on National Forest System roads. The Chief may determine that a share of the cost of acquisition, construction, reconstruction, improvement, or maintenance of a road, or segment thereof, used or to be used for commercial hauling of non-Federal forests products and other non-Federal products, commodities and materials, should be borne by the owners or haulers thereof. The Chief may condition the permission to use a road, or segment thereof, upon payment to the United States of the proportionate share of the cost and bearing proportionate maintenance as determined to be attributable to the owner's or hauler's use in accordance with § 212.9. This condition to use roads would apply where the owners or haulers:
            (1) Have not shared in the cost of acquisition, construction, reconstruction, or improvements, and
            (2) Have not made contributions to pay their proportionate share of the costs.
            (d) Maintenance and reconstruction of National Forest System roads by users—(1) Maintenance. The Chief may require, but not in conflict with an existing permit, easement, contract, or other agreement, the user or users of a road, including purchasers of Government timber and other products, to maintain the roads in a satisfactory condition commensurate with the particular use requirements of each. The maintenance to be borne by each user shall be proportionate to total use and no individual user shall be required to perform or bear the costs of maintenance other than that commensurate with his use.
            (2) Reconstruction. The Chief may require, but not in conflict with an existing permit, easement, contract, or other agreement, the user or users of a road to reconstruct it when, at the time the use is requested, reconstruction is determined to be necessary to accommodate his use.
            (3) Deposits in lieu of performance. If the maintenance or reconstruction cannot be so provided or if the Chief determines that maintenance or reconstruction by a user would not be practical, the Chief may require that sufficient funds be deposited by the user to provide his portion of the total maintenance or reconstruction costs. Deposits made to cover maintenance or reconstruction of roads shall be used for the purposes deposited, except that:
            (i) Deposits received for work on adjacent and overlapping areas may be combined when it is the most practicable and efficient manner of performing the work, and cost thereof may be determined by estimates, and
            (ii) Unexpended balances upon accomplishment of the purposes for which deposited shall be transferred to miscellaneous receipts or refunded.
            (e) Deposits for making delayed payments to cooperator. Any fees or other collections received by the Chief under the terms of an agreement or other document providing for delayed payments to the Government's cooperator for use of a road shall be placed in a fund available for making these payments.

            (a) Policy in acquiring and granting access. To assure effective protection, management, and utilization of lands administered by the Forest Service and intermingled and adjacent private and public lands, and for the use and development of the resources upon which communities within or adjacent to the National Forests are dependent, the Chief shall as promptly as is feasible obtain needed access thereto and shall grant appropriate access across National Forest and other lands and easements administered by the Forest Service to intermingled or adjacent landowners. Construction, reconstruction or maintenance of a road or highway requires written authorization.
            (b) Actual settlers and other persons residing within the National Forests and other areas administered by the Forest Service. Actual settlers and other persons residing within the National Forests and other areas administered by the Forest Service shall be permitted ingress and egress over the same and use of existing National Forest System roads and trails in order to reach their homes and to utilize their property: Provided, such ingress and egress or use shall conform to rules and regulations governing the protection and administration of the lands and the roads or trails to be used.
            (c) Others. Entering upon the National Forests and other lands administered by the Forest Service and use of existing National Forest System roads and trails shall be permitted for all proper and lawful purposes subject to compliance with rules and regulations governing the lands and the roads or trails to be used.

            § 212.7
            Access procurement by the United States.
            (a) Existing or proposed forest roads that are or will be part of a transportation system of a State, county, or other local public road authority. Forest roads that are or will be part of a transportation system of a State, county, or other local public road authority and are on rights-of-way held by a State, county, or other local public road authority may be constructed, reconstructed, improved, or maintained by the Forest Service when there is an appropriate agreement with the State, county, or other local public road authority under 23 U.S.C. 205 and the construction, reconstruction, improvement, or maintenance is essential to provide safe and economical access to National Forest System lands.
            (b) Acquisition of easements and rights of use. Except as otherwise provided in the regulations of this part, easements for road and trail construction across non-Federal lands and easements or rights of use over non-Federal roads and trails will be acquired in the name of the United States of America and its assigns. The easements or rights of use may be acquired by purchase, condemnation, donation, or as a reciprocal for permits or easements for roads or trails to be constructed or for easements over or permits to use existing roads or trails.
            (c) Methods of compensation for easements and rights of use acquired by the United States. Compensation in negotiated acquisitions may be:
            (1) By payment from appropriated funds;
            (2) Pursuant to reservation in the grant of easement to the United States whereby the grantor reserves the right to require haulers of Federal timber or other Federal products over the road conveyed or thereafter constructed by the grantor to make payments to the grantor in accordance with the terms of the reservation;
            (3) By granting reciprocal rights; or
            (4) By a combination of these methods.
            (d) Cooperative construction and use agreements. Where areas, partly lands administered by the Forest Service and partly private or other ownership are undeveloped or inadequately developed by roads, the Chief will, to the extent feasible and advantageous to the United States, join in planning, constructing, reconstructing, improving, maintaining, and using an adequate road system on the basis of each party bearing the proportion of the cost attributable to the anticipated benefits as set forth in § 212.9.
            (e) Condemnation. Where access across non-Federal land or over a non-Federal road or trail cannot be obtained through negotiations with reasonable promptness, condemnation will be undertaken.
            (f) Access over non-Federal land and use of non-Federal roads or trails on a temporary basis. The Chief may negotiate a temporary agreement for access over non-Federal land and for use of an existing non-Federal road or trail where there is immediate need for temporary access for limited purposes that can be economically met by such procedure, or where the foreseeable need does not justify the expenditures necessary to provide a permanent road or trail.
            (g) Use and control of interests in roads, trails, and easements acquired by the United States. Interests in roads, trails, and easements acquired by the United States shall be under the control of the United States, subject to approved reservations, limitations and other provisions set forth in the easement, permit, or other indenture. This control by the United States may include restricting or conditioning the use of the interest owned by the United States in the road, trail, or easement where necessary.

            (a) Permission to construct or use roads across lands and assignable easements owned by the United States and administered by the Forest Service. If a reciprocal benefit is needed by the United States, permission to construct or use a road across lands and across assignable easements owned by the United States and administered by the Forest Service will be conditioned, except as provided in this section, for any applicant who seeks a permit to construct or use a road across the same, upon the grant to the United States of a reciprocal benefit. Such benefit shall bear:
            (1) A reasonable relation to the management of lands administered by the Forest Service; and
            (2) A value substantially similar to the value of the estate or interest in lands or easements applied for. In those instances where the values of the interests needed by the United States exceed those applied for by the applicant, the additional interests required by the United States will be acquired as provided in § 212.7(b) and (c). Where values needed by the applicant exceed those needed by the United States, the difference in values will be determined under principles set forth below and in §§ 212.5(c) and 212.9. If a reciprocal benefit is not needed by the United States, or the applicant shows good cause why the reciprocal benefit needed by the United States cannot or should not be granted by him, or the applicant declines to grant the reciprocal benefit requested by the United States or if a bona fide emergency exists, permission to construct or use a road across lands owned by the United States may be conditioned for any applicant upon reasonable charges and all other terms and conditions required by the Chief to protect the interests of the United States. Permits for such road construction or use will be non-exclusive and will be conditioned upon compliance with their terms and conditions and with the rules and regulations governing the protection and administration of the lands and those applicable to such roads.

            (2) Upon application to the Chief, an easement shall be granted under paragraph (d) of this section as a replacement for any stipulations for ingress and egress issued under the Act of June 4, 1897 or permit or other document evidencing the applicant's right to use a road: Provided, The applicant has met the requirements for obtaining such easement as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.
            (d) Easements for roads crossing lands or easements administered by the Forest Service. (1) Applications for permanent or temporary easements for specified periods or otherwise to be granted under the Act of October 13, 1964 (78 Stat. 1039, 16 U.S.C. 533), over lands or easements administered by the Forest Service, or over roads thereon will be approved by the Chief for those applicants who have conveyed or provided appropriate easements over roads, assignable easements and lands owned or controlled by them to the United States of America and its assigns and who have already constructed, or will, as scheduled by agreement, construct their proportionate share of the road or road system of which the segments described in the application are parts. The Chief, after approval of the application and the grant of the easement, will cause the same to be entered in the records of the Forest Service, and delivered to the applicant.
            
            (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the Chief may grant to the applicant a permanent or temporary easement for specified periods or otherwise upon such exchange of easements or share-cost arrangement or other reasonable consideration as he may deem appropriate.

            (3) The Chief may grant to a State or local subdivision thereof; easements for roads over lands or easements administered by the Forest Service and over roads thereon, when the roads thereon or roads to be constructed thereon will serve said lands and are, or will become a part of the road system maintained by such State or local subdivision for general public use: Provided, That easements shall not be granted under authority of this act (78 Stat. 1089), 16 U.S.C. 533 which may be granted under the Highway Act (72 Stat. 916, 23 U.S.C. 317), as amended. The easements shall contain such provisions, terms, and conditions as the Chief may determine are necessary to retain and protect the interests needed by the United States.
            (4) All instruments affecting permanent interests in land executed pursuant to this paragraph (d) of this section shall be recorded in each county where the lands are located. Copies of all instruments affecting interests in lands reserved from public domain shall be furnished by the Chief to the Secretary of the Interior.
            (5)(i) The Chief may revoke any easement granted under the provisions of the Act of October 13, 1964 (78 Stat. 1089, 16 U.S.C. 534):
            (A) By consent of the owner of the easement;
            (B) By condemnation; or
            (C) Upon abandonment after a 5-year period of nonuse by the owner of the easement.
            (ii) Before any easement is revoked upon abandonment, the owner of the easement shall be given notice and, upon the owner's request made within 60 days after receipt of the notice, shall be given an appeal in accordance with the provisions of 36 CFR part 214.

            § 212.9
            Principles for sharing use of roads.
            The use of roads under arrangements for sharing costs or performance shall be in accordance with the following:
            (a) Road improvement. Use of a road for commercial hauling, except occasional or minor amounts, will be conditioned upon improvement or supplemental construction of the road to safety and economically serve the contemplated use, unless the Chief determines that the safety and economy of the established and foreseeable use by the United States, its users and cooperators will not be impaired by the use for which application is being made. With the consent of the Chief the applicant may deposit funds in the estimated amount required for the improvements or supplemental construction in lieu of performance. Such funds will be used by the Forest Service to do the planned work. The cost of the improvements or supplemental construction will be taken into account in determining any otherwise required contribution to cover the proportionate share of the cost of road acquisition, construction, reconstruction or improvement attributable to the use.
            (b) Corresponding benefits. Corresponding benefits which may be accepted by the Chief for sharing road use will be those which bear a reasonable relation to the management of lands administered by the Forest Service. They may be in the form of:

            (1) Deposit of funds with the Forest Service for use in paying the cost of road construction, reconstruction, or improvement to be borne by the user;
            
            (2) The grant of a reciprocal right of substantially similar value to the road use sought;
            (3) Construction, reconstruction, or improvement by applicant of a road needed for access to and use of lands administered by the Forest Service; or (4) any combination of these.
            (c) Cost determinations for roads cooperatively constructed under agreements. When roads are constructed under cooperative agreements to meet mutual needs of the United States and others for access, determinations of the shares of costs to be borne by the United States and the cooperating parties will include consideration of:
            (1) The standard of road required for the planned hauling;
            (2) The share of planned use;
            (3) The location and volume of tributary timber owned by each party and expected to be hauled over the road or roads;
            (4) The tributary areas owned or controlled by each party;
            (5) Expected use by the public; and
            (6) Other appropriate considerations.
            (d) Cost recovery by the United States from others. When roads are used under permit for commercial hauling instead of under cooperative agreement, any cost to be recovered by the United States will be calculated in proportion to the planned use of the road. The road cost used in such calculation will be the amount or estimated amount expended in the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, and improvement of that capacity of the road required to serve the use needs of all parties that are or reasonably can be expected to use the road. The road costs shall not exceed the replacement value of the road. Such road share-cost payments will be through deposits in advance of use unless the user provides a payment bond satisfactory to the Chief guaranteeing that payments will be made promptly upon billing by the Forest Service.
            (e) Cost sharing with a cooperator. The costs to achieve the agreed upon road or road system may be met by:
            (1) Use of appropriated funds;
            (2) Construction, reconstruction, or improvement of roads or segments of roads by purchasers of products from lands administered by the Forest Service or other users;
            (3) Use of deposits made by cooperator with the Forest Service to cover cooperator's agreed share;
            (4) Agreement with cooperator pursuant to which cooperator does more than his agreed share of constructing, reconstructing, or improving a road and recovers costs incurred in excess of his agreed share by charging purchasers of products from lands administered by the Forest Service an equitable amount within the limits and to the total amount specified in the agreement; or
            (5) A combination of the aforementioned methods.
            (f) Road maintenance and resurfacing. Cooperators will share the road maintenance and resurfacing costs under suitable agreements to perform, arrange for performance by others, or by making deposits with the Forest Service which will be used to pay the cost of work necessary to keep such roads in satisfactory condition commensurate with use requirements of each cooperator. No cooperator shall be required to perform or bear such costs other than those occasioned by its individual use. Other users will bear costs in accordance with § 212.5(d).
            (g) Interests to be acquired by the United States in roads or easements therefor. Where the United States is to bear or share the cost of constructing or improving, or acquiring a road system, a road, or a segment thereof, or acquires an easement therefor, the interest acquired will:
            (1) Be for perpetual use unless the road use falls within the limited classes where temporary roads or roads for limited periods are acceptable;

          (1) Stay request. To obtain a stay, an appellant must include a request for a stay in the appeal pursuant to § 214.8(b)(2) and a statement explaining the need for a stay. The statement must include, at a minimum:
          (i) A description of the adverse impact on the appellant if a stay is not granted;
          (ii) A description of the adverse impact on National Forest System lands and resources if a stay is not granted; or

          (iii) An explanation as to how a meaningful decision on the merits of the appeal could not be achieved if a stay is not granted.
          
          (2) Stay response. The Responsible Official may support, oppose, or take no position in the responsive statement regarding the appellant's stay request. Intervenors may support, oppose, or take no position in the intervention request regarding the appellant's stay request.
          (3) Stay decision. The Appeal Deciding Officer shall issue a decision granting or denying a stay request within 10 days after a responsive statement or an intervention request is filed, whichever is later. The stay decision shall be in writing and shall briefly explain the basis for granting or denying the stay request.
          (c) Automatic stays. The following decisions are automatically stayed once an appeal is filed by a holder, operator, or solicited applicant:
          (1) Decisions to issue a written authorization pursuant to a prospectus;
          (2) Decisions to recalculate revenue-based land use fees for a special use authorization pursuant to an audit issued after June 5, 2013; and

          (e) Modification or lifting of a stay. The Appeal Deciding Officer or a Discretionary Reviewing Officer may modify or lift an authorized stay based upon a written request by a party to the appeal who demonstrates that the circumstances have changed since the stay was granted and that it is unduly burdensome or unfair to maintain the stay.
        
        
          § 214.14
          Conduct of an appeal.
          (a) Evidence of timely filing. The Appeal Deciding Officer shall determine the timeliness of an appeal by the following indicators:
          (1) The date of the U.S. Postal Service postmark for an appeal received before the close of the fifth business day after the appeal filing date;
          (2) The electronically generated posted date and time for email and facsimiles;

          (b) Computation of time. (1) A time period in this part begins on the first day following the event or action triggering the time period.
          (2) All time periods shall be computed using calendar days, including Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays. However, if a time period ends on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the time period is extended to the end of the next Federal business day.
          (c) Extensions of time—(1) In general. Parties to an appeal, Appeal Deciding Officers, and Discretionary Reviewing Officers shall meet the time periods specified in this part, unless an extension of time has been granted under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. Extension requests from parties to an appeal shall be made in writing, shall explain the need for the extension, and shall be transmitted to the Appeal Deciding Officer.
          (2) Time periods that may not be extended. The following time periods may not be extended:
          (i) The time period for filing an appeal;

          (3) Time periods that may be extended. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, all time periods in this part may be extended upon written request by a party to an appeal and a finding of good cause for the extension by the Appeal Deciding Officer. Written requests for extensions of time will be automatically granted by the Appeal Deciding Officer where the parties to an appeal represent that they are working in good faith to resolve the dispute and that additional time would facilitate negotiation of a mutually agreeable resolution.
          (4) Decision. The Appeal Deciding Officer shall have 10 days to issue a decision granting or denying the extension request. The decision shall be in writing and shall briefly explain the basis for granting or denying the request.
          (5) Duration. Ordinarily, extensions that add more than 60 days to the appeal period should not be granted.
          (d) Procedural orders. The Appeal Deciding Officer may issue procedural orders as necessary for the orderly, expeditious, and fair conduct of an appeal under this part.
          (e) Consolidation of appeals. (1) The Appeal Deciding Officer may consolidate multiple appeals of the same decision or of similar decisions involving common issues of fact and law and issue one appeal decision.
          (2) The Responsible Official may prepare one responsive statement for consolidated appeals.
          (f) Requests for additional information. The Appeal Deciding Officer may ask parties to an appeal for additional information to clarify appeal issues. If necessary, the Appeal Deciding Officer may extend appeal time periods per paragraph (c)(3) of this section to allow for submission of the additional information and to give the other parties an opportunity to review and comment on it.
          (g) Service of documents. (1) Parties to an appeal shall send a copy of all documents filed in the appeal to all other parties, including the appellant's sending a copy of the appeal to the Responsible Official, at the same time the original is filed with the Appeal Deciding Officer. All filings in an appeal must be accompanied by a signed and dated certificate of service attesting that all other parties have been served. Prospective intervenors shall send a copy of their request to intervene to all parties to the appeal at the same time the original is filed with the Appeal Deciding Officer. Each party and prospective intervenor is responsible for identifying the parties to the appeal and may contact the Appeal Deciding Officer for assistance regarding their names and addresses. Filings in an appeal shall not be considered by the Appeal Deciding Officer unless they are accompanied by a certificate of service.
          (2) All decisions and orders issued by the Appeal Deciding Officer and the Discretionary Reviewing Officer related to the appeal shall be in writing and shall be sent to all parties to the appeal.
          (h) Posting of final decisions. Once a final appeal decision or discretionary review decision has been issued, its availability shall be posted on the Web site of the national forest or national grassland or region that issued the appealable decision or on the Web site of the Washington Office for Chief's decisions.
          (i) Expenses. Each party to an appeal shall bear its own expenses, including costs associated with preparing the appeal, participating in an oral presentation, obtaining information regarding the appeal, and retaining professional consultants or counsel.
        
        
          § 214.15
          Resolution of issues prior to an appeal decision.
          (a) The Responsible Official may discuss an appeal with a party or parties to narrow issues, agree on facts, and explore opportunities to resolve one or more of the issues in dispute by means other than issuance of an appeal decision.
          (b) The Responsible Official who issued a decision under appeal may withdraw the decision, in whole or in part, during an appeal to resolve one or more issues in dispute. The Responsible Official shall notify the parties to the appeal and the Appeal Deciding Officer of the withdrawal. If the withdrawal of the decision eliminates all the issues in dispute in the appeal, the Appeal Deciding Officer shall dismiss the appeal under § 214.10.
        
        
          § 214.16

          (e) Availability. Oral presentations may be conducted during appeal of a decision, but not during discretionary review.
          (f) Scheduling and rules. The Appeal Deciding Officer shall conduct the oral presentation within 10 days of the date a reply to the responsive statement is due.

          (i) The day after the date the reply to the responsive statement is due if no oral presentation is conducted;
          (ii) The day after the oral presentation is conducted if no transcript of the oral presentation is being prepared; or

          (e) Except where a decision to conduct discretionary review has been made and a discretionary review decision has been issued, the appeal decision shall constitute USDA's final administrative decision.
        
        
          § 214.19
          Procedures for discretionary review.
          (a) Initiation. (1) One day after issuance of an appeal decision, the Appeal Deciding Officer shall send a copy of the appeal decision, appeal, and appealable decision to the Discretionary Reviewing Officer to determine whether discretionary review of the appeal decision should be conducted.
          (2) One day after issuance of a Chief's decision that is eligible for discretionary review under § 214.7(b)(2), the Chief shall send the decision to the Discretionary Reviewing Officer to determine whether discretionary review should be conducted.
          (b) Criteria for determining whether to conduct discretionary review. In deciding whether to conduct discretionary review, the Discretionary Reviewing Officer should, at a minimum, consider the degree of controversy surrounding the decision, the potential for litigation, and the extent to which the decision establishes precedent or new policy.
          (c) Time period. Upon receipt of the appeal decision, appeal, and appealable decision or Chief's decision, the Discretionary Reviewing Officer shall have 30 days to determine whether to conduct discretionary review and may request the appeal record or the record related to the Chief's decision during that time to assist in making that determination. If a request for the record is made, it must be transmitted to the Discretionary Reviewing Officer within 5 days.
          (d) Notification. The Discretionary Reviewing Officer shall notify the parties and the Appeal Deciding Officer in writing of a decision to conduct discretionary review. The Discretionary Reviewing Officer may notify the parties and the Appeal Deciding Officer of a decision not to conduct discretionary review within 30 days. If the Discretionary Reviewing Officer takes no action within 30 days of receipt of the appeal decision, appeal, and appealable decision or Chief's decision, the appeal decision or Chief's decision shall constitute USDA's final administrative decision.
          (e) Scope of discretionary review and issuance of a discretionary review decision. Discretionary review shall be limited to the record. No additional information shall be considered by the Discretionary Reviewing Officer. The Discretionary Reviewing Officer shall have 30 days to issue a discretionary review decision after notification of the parties and Appeal Deciding Officer has occurred pursuant to § 214.19(d). The Discretionary Reviewing Officer's decision shall constitute USDA's final administrative decision. If a discretionary review decision is not issued within 30 days following the notification of the decision to conduct discretionary review, the appeal decision or Chief's decision shall constitute USDA's final administrative decision.

            § 218.3
            Reviewing officer.
            (a) The reviewing officer is the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) or Forest Service official having the delegated authority and responsibility to review an objection filed under this part. For project or activity proposals made below the level of the Chief, the reviewing officer is the Forest Service line officer at the next higher administrative level above the responsible official, or the respective Associate Deputy Chief, Deputy Regional Forester, or Deputy Forest Supervisor with the delegation of authority relevant to the provisions of this part. When a project or activity proposal is made by the Chief, the Secretary of Agriculture or Under Secretary, Natural Resources and Environment is the reviewing officer.
            (b) The reviewing officer determines procedures to be used for processing objections when the procedures are not specifically described in this part, including, to the extent practicable, such procedures as needed to be compatible with the administrative review processes of other Federal agencies, when projects are proposed jointly. Such determinations are not subject to further administrative review.
          
          
            
            § 218.4
            Proposed projects and activities not subject to objection.
            Proposed projects and activities are not subject to objection when no timely, specific written comments regarding the proposed project or activity (see § 218.2) are received during any designated opportunity for public comment (see § 218.5(a)). The responsible official must issue a statement in the Record of Decision or Decision Notice that the project or activity was not subject to objection.
          
          
            § 218.5
            Who may file an objection.
            (a) Individuals and entities as defined in § 218.2 who have submitted timely, specific written comments regarding a proposed project or activity that is subject to these regulations during any designated opportunity for public comment may file an objection. Opportunity for public comment on a draft EIS includes request for comments during scoping, the 40 CFR 1506.10 comment period, or other public involvement opportunity where written comments are requested by the responsible official. Opportunity for public comment on an EA includes during scoping or any other instance where the responsible official seeks written comments.
            (b) Federally-recognized Indian Tribes and Alaska Native Corporations are also eligible to file an objection when specific written comments as defined in § 218.2 are provided during Federal-Tribal consultations.
            (c) Comments received from an authorized representative(s) of an entity are considered those of the entity only. Individual members of that entity do not meet objection eligibility requirements solely on the basis of membership in an entity. A member or an individual must submit timely, specific written comments independently in order to be eligible to file an objection in an individual capacity.
            (d) When an objection lists multiple individuals or entities, each individual or entity must meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. If the objection does not identify a lead objector as required at § 218.8(d)(3), the reviewing officer will delegate the first eligible objector on the list as the lead objector. Individuals or entities listed on an objection that do not meet eligibility requirements will not be considered objectors. Objections from individuals or entities that do not meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section will not be accepted and will be documented as such in the objection record.
            (e) Federal agencies may not file objections.
            (f) Federal employees who otherwise meet the requirements of this subpart for filing objections in a non-official capacity must comply with Federal conflict of interest statutes at 18 U.S.C. 202-209 and with employee ethics requirements at 5 CFR part 2635. Specifically, employees must not be on official duty nor use Government property or equipment in the preparation or filing of an objection. Further, employees must not use or otherwise incorporate information unavailable to the public, such as Federal agency documents that are exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552(b)).
          
          
            § 218.6
            Computation of time periods.
            (a) Computation. All time periods are computed using calendar days, including Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays. However, when the time period expires on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the time is extended to the end of the next Federal working day as stated in the legal notice (11:59 p.m. in the time zone of the receiving office for objections filed by electronic means such as email or facsimile).
            (b) Starting date. The day after publication of the legal notice required by § 218.7(c) is the first day of the objection-filing period.
            (c) Publication date. The publication date of the legal notice of the EA or final EIS in the newspaper of record or, when the Chief is the responsible official, the Federal Register, is the exclusive means for calculating the time to file an objection. Objectors may not rely on dates or timeframe information provided by any other source.
            (d) Extensions. Time extensions are not permitted except as provided at paragraph (a) of this section, and § 218.26(b).
          
          
            
            § 218.7
            Giving notice of objection process for proposed projects and activities subject to objection.
            (a) In addition to the notification required in paragraph (c) of this section, the responsible official must disclose during scoping and in the EA or EIS that the proposed project or activity is:
            (1) A hazardous fuel reduction project as defined by the HFRA, section 101(2), that is subject to subparts A and C of this part, or
            (2) A project or activity implementing a land management plan and not authorized under the HFRA, that is subject to subparts A and B of this part.
            (b) The responsible official must promptly make available the final EIS or the EA, and a draft Record of Decision (ROD) or draft Decision Notice (DN) and Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI), to those who have requested the documents or are eligible to file an objection in accordance with § 218.5(a).

            (c) Upon distribution, legal notice of the opportunity to object to a proposed project or activity must be published in the applicable newspaper of record identified as defined in § 218.2 for the National Forest System unit. When the Chief is the responsible official, notice must be published in the Federal Register. The legal notice or Federal Register notice must:
            (1) Include the name of the proposed project or activity, a concise description of the draft decision and any proposed land management plan amendments, name and title of the responsible official, name of the forest and/or district on which the proposed project or activity will occur, instructions for obtaining a copy of the final EIS or EA and draft ROD or DN as defined in § 218.2, and instructions on how to obtain additional information on the proposed project or activity.
            (2) State that the proposed project or activity is subject to the objection process pursuant to 36 CFR part 218; identify whether the special procedures of subpart B or subpart C of this part are applicable; and include the following:
            (i) Name and address of the reviewing officer with whom an objection is to be filed. The notice must specify a street, postal, fax, and email address, the acceptable format(s) for objections filed electronically, and the reviewing officer's business hours for those filing hand-delivered objections.
            (ii) A statement that objections will be accepted only from those who have previously submitted specific written comments regarding the proposed project during scoping or other designated opportunity for public comment in accordance with § 218.5(a). The statement must also specify that issues raised in objections must be based on previously submitted timely, specific written comments regarding the proposed project unless based on new information arising after designated opportunities.

            (iii) A statement that the publication date of the legal notice in the newspaper of record or Federal Register notice is the exclusive means for calculating the time to file an objection (see §§ 218.26(a) and 218.32(a)), and that those wishing to object should not rely upon dates or timeframe information provided by any other source. A specific date must not be included in the notice.
            (iv) A statement that an objection, including attachments, must be filed (regular mail, fax, email, hand-delivery, express delivery, or messenger service) with the appropriate reviewing officer (see §§ 218.3 and 218.8) within 30 days of the date of publication of the legal notice for the objection process if the proposal is an authorized hazardous fuel reduction project, or within 45 days if the proposal is otherwise a project or activity implementing a land management plan. The statement must also describe the evidence of timely filing in § 218.9.
            (v) A statement describing the minimum content requirements of an objection (see § 218.8(d)) and identify that incorporation of documents by reference is permitted only as provided for at § 218.8(b).

            (d) Within 4 calendar days of the date of publication of the legal notice in the newspaper of record or, when applicable, the Federal Register, a digital image of the legal notice or Federal Register publication, or the exact text of the notice, must be made available on the Web. Such postings must clearly indicate the date the notice was published in the newspaper of record or Federal Register, and the name of the publication.
            (e) Through notice published annually in the Federal Register, each regional forester must advise the public of the newspaper(s) of record utilized for publishing legal notice required by this part.
          
          
            § 218.8
            Filing an objection.
            (a) Objections must be filed with the reviewing officer in writing. All objections are available for public inspection during and after the objection process.
            (b) Incorporation of documents by reference is not allowed, except for the following list of items that may be referenced by including date, page, and section of the cited document, along with a description of its content and applicability to the objection. All other documents must be included with the objection.
            (1) All or any part of a Federal law or regulation.
            (2) Forest Service directives and land management plans.
            (3) Documents referenced by the Forest Service in the proposed project EA or EIS that is subject to objection.
            (4) Comments previously provided to the Forest Service by the objector during public involvement opportunities for the proposed project where written comments were requested by the responsible official.
            (c) Issues raised in objections must be based on previously submitted specific written comments regarding the proposed project or activity and attributed to the objector, unless the issue is based on new information that arose after the opportunities for comment. The burden is on the objector to demonstrate compliance with this requirement for objection issues (see paragraph (d)(6) of this section).
            (d) At a minimum, an objection must include the following:
            (1) Objector's name and address as defined in § 218.2, with a telephone number, if available;
            (2) Signature or other verification of authorship upon request (a scanned signature for electronic mail may be filed with the objection);
            (3) When multiple names are listed on an objection, identification of the lead objector as defined in § 218.2. Verification of the identity of the lead objector must be provided upon request or the reviewing officer will designate a lead objector as provided in § 218.5(d);
            (4) The name of the proposed project, the name and title of the responsible official, and the name(s) of the national forest(s) and/or ranger district(s) on which the proposed project will be implemented;
            (5) A description of those aspects of the proposed project addressed by the objection, including specific issues related to the proposed project; if applicable, how the objector believes the environmental analysis or draft decision specifically violates law, regulation, or policy; suggested remedies that would resolve the objection; supporting reasons for the reviewing officer to consider; and
            (6) A statement that demonstrates the connection between prior specific written comments on the particular proposed project or activity and the content of the objection, unless the objection concerns an issue that arose after the designated opportunity(ies) for comment (see paragraph (c) of this section).
          
          
            § 218.9
            Evidence of timely filing.
            (a) It is the objector's responsibility to ensure timely filing of a written objection with the reviewing officer. Timeliness must be determined by the following indicators:
            (1) The date of the U.S. Postal Service postmark for an objection received before the close of the fifth business day after the objection filing period;
            (2) The agency's electronically generated posted date and time for email and facsimiles;
            (3) The shipping date for delivery by private carrier for an objection received before the close of the fifth business day after the objection filing period; or
            (4) The official agency date stamp showing receipt of hand delivery.

            (b) For emailed objections, the sender should receive an automated electronic acknowledgement from the agency as confirmation of receipt. If the sender does not receive an automated acknowledgment of receipt of the objection, it is the sender's responsibility to ensure timely filing by other means.
          
          
            § 218.10
            Objections set aside from review.
            (a) The reviewing officer must set aside and not review an objection when one or more of the following applies:
            (1) Objections are not filed in a timely manner (see §§ 218.7(c)(2)(v) and 218.9).
            (2) The proposed project is not subject to the objection procedures in §§ 218.1, 218.4, 218.20, and 218.31.
            (3) The individual or entity did not submit timely and specific written comments regarding the proposed project or activity during scoping or another designated opportunity for public comment (see § 218.5(a)).
            (4) Except for issues that arose after the opportunities for comment, none of the issues included in the objection are based on previously submitted specific written comments and the objector has not provided a statement demonstrating a connection between the comments and objection issues (see §§ 218.8(c) and 218.8(d)(6)).
            (5) The objection does not provide sufficient information as required by § 218.8(d)(5) and (6) for the reviewing officer to review.
            (6) The objector withdraws the objection.
            (7) An objector's identity is not provided or cannot be determined from the signature (written or electronically scanned) and a reasonable means of contact is not provided (see § 218.8(d)(1) and (2)).
            (8) The objection is illegible for any reason, including submissions in an electronic format different from that specified in the legal notice.
            (9) The responsible official cancels the objection process underway to reinitiate the objection procedures at a later date or withdraw the proposed project or activity.
            (b) The reviewing officer must give prompt written notice to the objector and the responsible official when an objection is set aside from review and must state the reasons for not reviewing the objection. If the objection is set aside from review for reasons of illegibility or lack of a means of contact, the reasons must be documented and a copy placed in the objection record.
          
          
            § 218.11
            Resolution of objections.
            (a) Meetings. Prior to the issuance of the reviewing officer's written response, either the reviewing officer or the objector may request to meet to discuss issues raised in the objection and potential resolution. The reviewing officer has the discretion to determine whether adequate time remains in the review period to make a meeting with the objector practical, the appropriate date, duration, agenda, and location for any meeting, and how the meeting will be conducted to facilitate the most beneficial dialogue; e.g., face-to-face office meeting, project site visit, teleconference, video conference, etc. The responsible official should be a participant along with the reviewing officer in any objection resolution meeting. Meetings are not required to be noticed but are open to attendance by the public, and the reviewing officer will determine whether those other than objectors may participate.
            (b) Reviewing officer's response to objections. (1) A written response must set forth the reasons for the response, but need not be a point-by-point response and may contain instructions to the responsible official, if necessary. In cases involving more than one objection to a proposed project or activity, the reviewing officer may consolidate objections and issue one or more responses.
            (2) No further review from any other Forest Service or USDA official of the reviewing officer's written response to an objection is available.
          
          
            § 218.12
            Timing of project decision.
            (a) The responsible official may not sign a ROD or DN subject to the provisions of this part until the reviewing officer has responded in writing to all pending objections (see § 218.11(b)(1)).

            (b) The responsible official may not sign a ROD or DN subject to the provisions of this part until all concerns and instructions identified by the reviewing officer in the objection response have been addressed.
            
            (c) When no objection is filed within the objection filing period (see §§ 218.26 and 218.32):
            (1) The reviewing officer must notify the responsible official.
            (2) Approval of the proposed project or activity documented in a ROD in accordance with 40 CFR 1506.10, or in a DN may occur on, but not before, the fifth business day following the end of the objection filing period.
            (d) When a proposed project or activity is not subject to objection because no timely, specific written comments regarding the proposal were received during a designated opportunity for public comment (see § 218.4), the approval of a proposed project or activity documented in a ROD must be in accordance with 40 CFR 1506.10 and 36 CFR 220.5(g), and the approval of a proposed project or activity documented in a DN must be made in accordance with 36 CFR 220.7(c) and (d).
          
          
            § 218.13
            Secretary's authority.
            (a) Nothing in this section shall restrict the Secretary of Agriculture from exercising any statutory authority regarding the protection, management, or administration of National Forest System lands.
            (b) Projects and activities proposed by the Secretary of Agriculture or the Under Secretary, Natural Resources and Environment, are not subject to the procedures set forth in this part. Approval of projects and activities by the Secretary or Under Secretary constitutes the final administrative determination of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
          
          
            § 218.14
            Judicial proceedings.
            (a) The objection process set forth in this subpart fully implements Congress' design for a predecisional administrative review process. These procedures present a full and fair opportunity for concerns to be raised and considered on a project-by-project basis. Individuals and groups must structure their participation so as to alert the local agency officials making particular land management decisions of their positions and contentions.
            (b) Any filing for Federal judicial review of a decisions covered by this subpart is premature and inappropriate unless the plaintiff has exhausted the administrative review process set forth in this part (see 7 U.S.C. 6912(e) and 16 U.S.C. 6515(c)).
          
          
            § 218.15
            Information collection requirements.
            The rules of this part specify the information that objectors must provide in an objection to a proposed project (see § 218.8). As such, these rules contain information collection requirements as defined in 5 CFR part 1320. These information requirements are assigned OMB Control Number 0596-0172.
          
          
            § 218.16
            Effective dates.
            (a) Effective dates for HFRA-authorized projects. (1) Provisions of this part that are applicable to hazardous fuel reduction projects authorized under the HFRA are in effect as of March 27, 2013 for projects where scoping begins on or after this date.

            (2) Hazardous fuel reduction project proposals under the HFRA for which public scoping began prior to March 27, 2013 may use the predecisional objection procedures posted at http://www.fs.fed.us/objections.
            
            (3) Hazardous fuel reduction project proposals that are re-scoped with the public or re-issued for notice and comment after March 27, 2013 are subject to this part.
            (b) Effective dates for non-HFRA-authorized projects. (1) Project proposals with public scoping completed, but that have not had legal notice published. The applicable provisions of this part are in effect as of March 27, 2013 where public scoping was previously initiated for project proposals, but legal notice of the opportunity to comment has not yet been published; unless scoping or other public notification of the project (e.g. Schedule of Proposed Actions) has clearly indicated the project to be under the former 36 CFR part 215 appeal process.

            (2) Project proposals which have legal notice published, but a Decision Notice or Record of Decision has not been signed. If a Decision Notice or Record of Decision is signed within 6 months of March 27, 2013, it will be subject to the 36 CFR part 215 appeal process. If the Decision Notice or Record of Decision is to be signed more than 6 months beyond March 27, 2013, the project proposal will be subject to the requirements of this part. In this case, the responsible official will notify all interested and affected parties who participated during scoping or provided specific written comment regarding the proposed project or activity during the comment period initiated with a legal notice that the project proposal will be subject to the predecisional objection regulations at 36 CFR part 218. All interested and affected parties who provided written comment as defined in § 218.2 during scoping or the comment period will be eligible to participate in the objection process.
            (3) Project proposals are subject to the requirements of this part when initial public scoping, re-scoping with the public, or re-issuance of notice and comment begins on or after March 27, 2013.
          
        
        
          Subpart B—Provisions Specific to Project-Level Proposals Not Authorized Under Healthy Forests Restoration Act
          
            § 218.20
            Applicability and scope.
            This subpart includes provisions that are specific to proposed projects and activities implementing land and resource management plans and documented with a Record of Decision or Decision Notice, except those authorized under the Healthy Forests Restoration Act (HFRA). The sections of this subpart must be considered in combination with the general provisions of subpart A of this part for the full complement of regulatory direction pertaining to predecisional administrative review of the applicable projects and activities.
          
          
            § 218.21
            Emergency situations.
            (a) Authority. The Chief and the Associate Chief of the Forest Service are authorized to make the determination that an emergency situation exists as defined in this section.
            (b) Emergency situation definition. A situation on National Forest System (NFS) lands for which immediate implementation of a decision is necessary to achieve one or more of the following: Relief from hazards threatening human health and safety; mitigation of threats to natural resources on NFS or adjacent lands; avoiding a loss of commodity value sufficient to jeopardize the agency's ability to accomplish project objectives directly related to resource protection or restoration.
            (c) Determination. The determination that an emergency situation exists shall be based on an examination of the relevant information. During the consideration by the Chief or Associate Chief, additional information may be requested from the responsible official. The determination that an emergency situation does or does not exist is not subject to administrative review under this part.

A scanned signature or other means of verifying the identity of the individual or entity representative may be used for electronically submitted comments.
            (v) Individual members of an entity must submit their own comments to establish personal eligibility; comments received on behalf of an entity are considered as those of the entity only.
            (4) Evidence of timely submission. When there is a question about timely submission of comments, timeliness shall be determined as follows:

            (i) Written comments must be postmarked by the Postal Service, emailed, faxed, or otherwise submitted (for example, express delivery service) by 11:59 p.m. in the time zone of the receiving office on the 30th calendar day following publication of the legal notice for proposed projects or activities to be analyzed and documented in an EA or the 45th calendar day following publication of the NOA in the Federal Register for a draft EIS.

            (ii) Hand-delivered comments must be time and date imprinted at the correct responsible official's office by the close of business on the 30th calendar day following publication of the legal notice for proposed projects or activities to be analyzed and documented in an EA or the 45th calendar day following publication of the NOA in the Federal Register for a draft EIS.
            (iii) For emailed comments, the sender should normally receive an automated electronic acknowledgment from the agency as confirmation of receipt.

          Subpart A—National Forest System Land Management Planning
          
            § 219.1
            Purpose and applicability.

            (a) This subpart sets out the planning requirements for developing, amending, and revising land management plans (also referred to as plans) for units of the National Forest System (NFS), as required by the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974, as amended by the National Forest Management Act of 1976 (16 U.S.C. 1600 et seq.) (NFMA). This subpart also sets out the requirements for plan components and other content in land management plans. This part is applicable to all units of the NFS as defined by 16 U.S.C. 1609 or subsequent statute.

            (b) Consistent with the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960 (16 U.S.C. 528-531) (MUSYA), the Forest Service manages the NFS to sustain the multiple use of its renewable resources in perpetuity while maintaining the long-term health and productivity of the land. Resources are managed through a combination of approaches and concepts for the benefit of human communities and natural resources. Land management plans guide sustainable, integrated resource management of the resources within the plan area in the context of the broader landscape, giving due consideration to the relative values of the various resources in particular areas.
            (c) The purpose of this part is to guide the collaborative and science-based development, amendment, and revision of land management plans that promote the ecological integrity of national forests and grasslands and other administrative units of the NFS. Plans will guide management of NFS lands so that they are ecologically sustainable and contribute to social and economic sustainability; consist of ecosystems and watersheds with ecological integrity and diverse plant and animal communities; and have the capacity to provide people and communities with ecosystem services and multiple uses that provide a range of social, economic, and ecological benefits for the present and into the future. These benefits include clean air and water; habitat for fish, wildlife, and plant communities; and opportunities for recreational, spiritual, educational, and cultural benefits.
            (d) This part does not affect treaty rights or valid existing rights established by statute or legal instruments.
            (e) During the planning process, the responsible official shall comply with Section 8106 of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (25 U.S.C. 3056), Executive Order 13007 of May 24, 1996, Executive Order 13175 of November 6, 2000, laws, and other requirements with respect to disclosing or withholding under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) certain information regarding reburial sites or other information that is culturally sensitive to an Indian Tribe or Tribes.
            (f) Plans must comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including NFMA, MUSYA, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Wilderness Act, and the Endangered Species Act.
            (g) The responsible official shall ensure that the planning process, plan components, and other plan content are within Forest Service authority, the inherent capability of the plan area, and the fiscal capability of the unit.
          
          
            § 219.2
            Levels of planning and responsible officials.
            Forest Service planning occurs at different organizational levels and geographic scales. Planning occurs at three levels—national strategic planning, NFS unit planning, and project or activity planning.
            (a) National strategic planning. The Chief of the Forest Service is responsible for national planning, such as preparation of the Forest Service strategic plan required under the Government Performance and Results Modernization Act of 2010 (5 U.S.C. 306; 31 U.S.C. 1115-1125; 31 U.S.C. 9703-9704), which is integrated with the requirements of the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974, as amended by the NFMA. The strategic plan establishes goals, objectives, performance measures, and strategies for management of the NFS, as well as the other Forest Service mission areas: Research and Development, State and Private Forestry, and International Programs.
            (b) National Forest System unit planning. (1) NFS unit planning results in the development, amendment, or revision of a land management plan. A land management plan provides a framework for integrated resource management and for guiding project and activity decisionmaking on a national forest, grassland, prairie, or other administrative unit. A plan reflects the unit's expected distinctive roles and contributions to the local area, region, and Nation, and the roles for which the plan area is best suited, considering the Agency's mission, the unit's unique capabilities, and the resources and management of other lands in the vicinity. Through the adaptive planning cycle set forth in this subpart, a plan can be changed to reflect new information and changing conditions.

            (2) A plan does not authorize projects or activities or commit the Forest Service to take action. A plan may constrain the Agency from authorizing or carrying out projects and activities, or the manner in which they may occur. Projects and activities must be consistent with the plan (§ 219.15). A plan does not regulate uses by the public, but a project or activity decision that regulates a use by the public under 36 CFR Part 261, Subpart B, may be made contemporaneously with the approval of a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision. Plans should not repeat laws, regulations, or program management policies, practices, and procedures that are in the Forest Service Directive System.
            (3) The supervisor of the national forest, grassland, prairie, or other comparable administrative unit is the responsible official for development and approval of a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision for lands under the responsibility of the supervisor, unless a regional forester; the Chief; the Under Secretary, Natural Resources and Environment; or the Secretary acts as the responsible official. Two or more responsible officials may undertake joint planning over lands under their respective jurisdictions.
            (4) A plan for a unit that contains an experimental area may not be approved without the concurrence of the appropriate research station director with respect to the direction applicable to that area, and a plan amendment applicable to an experimental area may not be approved without the concurrence of the appropriate research station director.
            (5) The Chief is responsible for leadership and direction for carrying out the NFS land management planning program under this part. The Chief shall:
            (i) Establish planning procedures for this part in the Forest Service Directive System in Forest Service Manual 1920—Land Management Planning and in Forest Service Handbook 1909.12—Land Management Planning Handbook.
            (ii) Establish and administer a national oversight process for accountability and consistency of NFS land management planning under this part.
            (iii) Establish procedures in the Forest Service Directive System for obtaining inventory data on the various renewable resources, and soil and water.
            (c) Project and activity planning. The supervisor or district ranger is the responsible official for project and activity decisions, unless a higher-level official acts as the responsible official. Requirements for project or activity planning are established in the Forest Service Directive System. Except as provided in the plan consistency requirements in § 219.15, none of the requirements of this part apply to projects or activities.
          
          
            § 219.3
            Role of science in planning.
            The responsible official shall use the best available scientific information to inform the planning process required by this subpart for assessment; developing, amending, or revising a plan; and monitoring. In doing so, the responsible official shall determine what information is the most accurate, reliable, and relevant to the issues being considered. The responsible official shall document how the best available scientific information was used to inform the assessment, the plan or amendment decision, and the monitoring program as required in §§ 219.6(a)(3) and 219.14(a)(3). Such documentation must: Identify what information was determined to be the best available scientific information, explain the basis for that determination, and explain how the information was applied to the issues considered.

The responsible official shall provide opportunities to the public for participating in the assessment process; developing a plan proposal, including the monitoring program; commenting on the proposal and the disclosure of its environmental impacts in accompanying National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) documents; and reviewing the results of monitoring information. When developing opportunities for public participation, the responsible official shall take into account the discrete and diverse roles, jurisdictions, responsibilities, and skills of interested and affected parties; the accessibility of the process, opportunities, and information; and the cost, time, and available staffing. The responsible official should be proactive and use contemporary tools, such as the Internet, to engage the public, and should share information in an open way with interested parties. Subject to the notification requirements in § 219.16, the responsible official has the discretion to determine the scope, methods, forum, and timing of those opportunities. The Forest Service retains decisionmaking authority and responsibility for all decisions throughout the process.
            (1) Outreach. The responsible official shall engage the public—including Tribes and Alaska Native Corporations, other Federal agencies, State and local governments, individuals, and public and private organizations or entities—early and throughout the planning process as required by this part, using collaborative processes where feasible and appropriate. In providing opportunities for engagement, the responsible official shall encourage participation by:
            (i) Interested individuals and entities, including those interested at the local, regional, and national levels.
            (ii) Youth, low-income populations, and minority populations.
            (iii) Private landowners whose lands are in, adjacent to, or otherwise affected by, or whose actions may impact, future management actions in the plan area.
            (iv) Federal agencies, States, counties, and local governments, including State fish and wildlife agencies, State foresters and other relevant State agencies. Where appropriate, the responsible official shall encourage States, counties, and other local governments to seek cooperating agency status in the NEPA process for development, amendment, or revision of a plan. The responsible official may participate in planning efforts of States, counties, local governments, and other Federal agencies, where practicable and appropriate.
            (v) Interested or affected federally recognized Indian Tribes or Alaska Native Corporations. Where appropriate, the responsible official shall encourage federally recognized Tribes to seek cooperating agency status in the NEPA process for development, amendment, or revision of a plan. The responsible official may participate in planning efforts of federally recognized Indian Tribes and Alaska Native Corporations, where practicable and appropriate.
            (2) Consultation with federally recognized Indian Tribes and Alaska Native Corporations. The Department recognizes the Federal Government has certain trust responsibilities and a unique legal relationship with federally recognized Indian Tribes. The responsible official shall honor the government-to-government relationship between federally recognized Indian Tribes and the Federal Government. The responsible official shall provide to federally recognized Indian Tribes and Alaska Native Corporations the opportunity to undertake consultation consistent with Executive Order 13175 of November 6, 2000, and 25 U.S.C. 450 note.
            (3) Native knowledge, indigenous ecological knowledge, and land ethics. As part of tribal participation and consultation as set forth in paragraphs (a)(1)(v) and (a)(2) of this section, the responsible official shall request information about native knowledge, land ethics, cultural issues, and sacred and culturally significant sites.
            (b) Coordination with other public planning efforts. (1) The responsible official shall coordinate land management planning with the equivalent and related planning efforts of federally recognized Indian Tribes, Alaska Native Corporations, other Federal agencies, and State and local governments.
            (2) For plan development or revision, the responsible official shall review the planning and land use policies of federally recognized Indian Tribes (43 U.S.C. 1712(b)), Alaska Native Corporations, other Federal agencies, and State and local governments, where relevant to the plan area. The results of this review shall be displayed in the environmental impact statement (EIS) for the plan (40 CFR 1502.16(c), 1506.2). The review shall include consideration of:
            (i) The objectives of federally recognized Indian Tribes, Alaska Native Corporations, other Federal agencies, and State and local governments, as expressed in their plans and policies;
            (ii) The compatibility and interrelated impacts of these plans and policies;

            (iii) Opportunities for the plan to address the impacts identified or to contribute to joint objectives; and
            
            (iv) Opportunities to resolve or reduce conflicts, within the context of developing the plan's desired conditions or objectives.
            (3) Nothing in this section should be read to indicate that the responsible official will seek to direct or control management of lands outside of the plan area, nor will the responsible official conform management to meet non-Forest Service objectives or policies.

            § 219.5
            Planning framework.
            (a) Planning for a national forest, grassland, prairie, or other comparable administrative unit of the NFS is an iterative process that includes assessment (§ 219.6); developing, amending, or revising a plan (§§ 219.7 and 219.13); and monitoring (§ 219.12). These three phases of the framework are complementary and may overlap. The intent of this framework is to create a responsive planning process that informs integrated resource management and allows the Forest Service to adapt to changing conditions, including climate change, and improve management based on new information and monitoring.
            (1) Assessment. Assessments rapidly evaluate existing information about relevant ecological, economic, and social conditions, trends, and sustainability and their relationship to the land management plan within the context of the broader landscape. The responsible official shall consider and evaluate existing and possible future conditions and trends of the plan area, and assess the sustainability of social, economic, and ecological systems within the plan area, in the context of the broader landscape (§ 219.6).
            (2) Plan development, plan amendment, or plan revision.
            
            (i) The process for developing or revising a plan includes: Assessment, preliminary identification of the need to change the plan based on the assessment, development of a proposed plan, consideration of the environmental effects of the proposal, providing an opportunity to comment on the proposed plan, providing an opportunity to object before the proposal is approved, and, finally, approval of the plan or plan revision. A new plan or plan revision requires preparation of an environmental impact statement.
            (ii) The process for amending a plan includes: Preliminary identification of the need to change the plan, development of a proposed amendment, consideration of the environmental effects of the proposal, providing an opportunity to comment on the proposed amendment, providing an opportunity to object before the proposal is approved, and, finally, approval of the plan amendment. The appropriate NEPA documentation for an amendment may be an environmental impact statement, an environmental assessment, or a categorical exclusion, depending upon the scope and scale of the amendment and its likely effects.
            (3) Monitoring. Monitoring is continuous and provides feedback for the planning cycle by testing relevant assumptions, tracking relevant conditions over time, and measuring management effectiveness (§ 219.12). The monitoring program includes plan-level and broader-scale monitoring. The plan-level monitoring program is informed by the assessment phase; developed during plan development, plan amendment, or plan revision; and implemented after plan decision. The regional forester develops broader-scale monitoring strategies. Biennial monitoring evaluation reports document whether a change to the plan or change to the monitoring program is warranted based on new information, whether a new assessment may be needed, or whether there is no need for change at that time.
            (b) Interdisciplinary team(s). The responsible official shall establish an interdisciplinary team or teams to prepare assessments; new plans, plan amendments, and plan revisions; and plan monitoring programs.
          
          
            § 219.6
            Assessment.
            The responsible official has the discretion to determine the scope, scale, and timing of an assessment described in § 219.5(a)(1), subject to the requirements of this section.
            (a) Process for plan development or revision assessments. An assessment must be completed for the development of a new plan or for a plan revision. The responsible official shall:
            (1) Identify and consider relevant existing information in governmental or non-governmental assessments, plans, monitoring reports, studies, and other sources of relevant information. Such sources of information may include State forest assessments and strategies, the Resources Planning Act assessment, ecoregional assessments, non-governmental reports, State comprehensive outdoor recreation plans, community wildfire protection plans, public transportation plans, State wildlife data and action plans, and relevant Agency or interagency reports, resource plans or assessments. Relevant private information, including relevant land management plans and local knowledge, will be considered if publicly available or voluntarily provided.
            (2) Coordinate with or provide opportunities for the regional forester, agency staff from State and Private Forestry and Research and Development, federally recognized Indian Tribes and Alaska Native Corporations, other governmental and non-governmental parties, and the public to provide existing information for the assessment.
            (3) Document the assessment in a report available to the public. The report should document information needs relevant to the topics of paragraph (b) of this section. Document in the report how the best available scientific information was used to inform the assessment (§ 219.3). Include the report in the planning record (§ 219.14).
            (b) Content of the assessment for plan development or revision. In the assessment for plan development or revision, the responsible official shall identify and evaluate existing information relevant to the plan area for the following:
            (1) Terrestrial ecosystems, aquatic ecosystems, and watersheds;
            (2) Air, soil, and water resources and quality;
            (3) System drivers, including dominant ecological processes, disturbance regimes, and stressors, such as natural succession, wildland fire, invasive species, and climate change; and the ability of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems on the plan area to adapt to change;
            (4) Baseline assessment of carbon stocks;
            (5) Threatened, endangered, proposed and candidate species, and potential species of conservation concern present in the plan area;
            (6) Social, cultural, and economic conditions;
            (7) Benefits people obtain from the NFS planning area (ecosystem services);
            (8) Multiple uses and their contributions to local, regional, and national economies;
            (9) Recreation settings, opportunities and access, and scenic character;
            (10) Renewable and nonrenewable energy and mineral resources;
            (11) Infrastructure, such as recreational facilities and transportation and utility corridors;
            (12) Areas of tribal importance;
            (13) Cultural and historic resources and uses;
            (14) Land status and ownership, use, and access patterns; and
            (15) Existing designated areas located in the plan area including wilderness and wild and scenic rivers and potential need and opportunity for additional designated areas.
            (c) Plan amendment assessments. Where the responsible official determines that a new assessment is needed to inform an amendment, the responsible official has the discretion to determine the scope, scale, process, and content for the assessment depending on the topic or topics to be addressed.
            [77 FR 21260, Apr. 9, 2012, as amended at 77 FR 44145, July 27, 2012]
          
          
            § 219.7
            New plan development or plan revision.
            (a) Plan revisions. A plan revision creates a new plan for the entire plan area, whether the plan revision differs from the prior plan to a small or large extent. A plan must be revised at least every 15 years. But, the responsible official has the discretion to determine at any time that conditions on a plan area have changed significantly such that a plan must be revised (16 U.S.C. 1604(f)(5)).
            (b) New plan development. New plan development is required for new NFS units. The process for developing a new plan is the same as the process for plan revision.
            (c) Process for plan development or revision. (1) The process for developing or revising a plan includes: Public notification and participation (§§ 219.4 and 219.16), assessment (§§ 219.5 and 219.6), developing a proposed plan, considering the environmental effects of the proposal, providing an opportunity to comment on the proposed plan, providing an opportunity to object before the proposal is approved (subpart B), and, finally, approving the plan or plan revision. A new plan or plan revision requires preparation of an environmental impact statement.
            (2) In developing a proposed new plan or proposed plan revision, the responsible official shall:
            (i) Review relevant information from the assessment and monitoring to identify a preliminary need to change the existing plan and to inform the development of plan components and other plan content.
            (ii) Consider the goals and objectives of the Forest Service strategic plan (§ 219.2(a)).
            (iii) Identify the presence and consider the importance of various physical, biological, social, cultural, and historic resources on the plan area (§ 219.6), with respect to the requirements for plan components of §§ 219.8 through 219.11.
            (iv) Consider conditions, trends, and stressors (§ 219.6), with respect to the requirements for plan components of §§ 219.8 through 219.11.
            (v) Identify and evaluate lands that may be suitable for inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation System and determine whether to recommend any such lands for wilderness designation.
            (vi) Identify the eligibility of rivers for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, unless a systematic inventory has been previously completed and documented and there are no changed circumstances that warrant additional review.
            (vii) Identify existing designated areas other than the areas identified in paragraphs (c)(2)(v) and (c)(2)(vi) of this section, and determine whether to recommend any additional areas for designation. If the responsible official has the delegated authority to designate a new area or modify an existing area, then the responsible official may designate such area when approving the plan, plan amendment, or plan revision.
            (viii) Identify the suitability of areas for the appropriate integration of resource management and uses, with respect to the requirements for plan components of §§ 219.8 through 219.11, including identifying lands that are not suitable for timber production (§ 219.11).
            (ix) Identify the maximum quantity of timber that may be removed from the plan area (§ 219.11(d)(6)).
            (x) Identify questions and indicators for the plan monitoring program (§ 219.12).
            (xi) Identify potential other content in the plan (paragraph (f) of this section).
            (3) The regional forester shall identify the species of conservation concern for the plan area in coordination with the responsible official.
            (d) Management areas or geographic areas. Every plan must have management areas or geographic areas or both. The plan may identify designated or recommended designated areas as management areas or geographic areas.
            (e) Plan components. Plan components guide future project and activity decisionmaking. The plan must indicate whether specific plan components apply to the entire plan area, to specific management areas or geographic areas, or to other areas as identified in the plan.
            (1) Required plan components. Every plan must include the following plan components:
            (i) Desired conditions. A desired condition is a description of specific social, economic, and/or ecological characteristics of the plan area, or a portion of the plan area, toward which management of the land and resources should be directed. Desired conditions must be described in terms that are specific enough to allow progress toward their achievement to be determined, but do not include completion dates.
            (ii) Objectives. An objective is a concise, measurable, and time-specific statement of a desired rate of progress toward a desired condition or conditions. Objectives should be based on reasonably foreseeable budgets.
            (iii) Standards. A standard is a mandatory constraint on project and activity decisionmaking, established to help achieve or maintain the desired condition or conditions, to avoid or mitigate undesirable effects, or to meet applicable legal requirements.
            (iv) Guidelines. A guideline is a constraint on project and activity decisionmaking that allows for departure from its terms, so long as the purpose of the guideline is met. (§ 219.15(d)(3)). Guidelines are established to help achieve or maintain a desired condition or conditions, to avoid or mitigate undesirable effects, or to meet applicable legal requirements.
            (v) Suitability of lands. Specific lands within a plan area will be identified as suitable for various multiple uses or activities based on the desired conditions applicable to those lands. The plan will also identify lands within the plan area as not suitable for uses that are not compatible with desired conditions for those lands. The suitability of lands need not be identified for every use or activity. Suitability identifications may be made after consideration of historic uses and of issues that have arisen in the planning process. Every plan must identify those lands that are not suitable for timber production (§ 219.11).
            (2) Optional plan component: goals. A plan may include goals as plan components. Goals are broad statements of intent, other than desired conditions, usually related to process or interaction with the public. Goals are expressed in broad, general terms, but do not include completion dates.
            (3) Requirements for the set of plan components. The set of plan components must meet the requirements set forth in this part for sustainability (§ 219.8), plant and animal diversity (§ 219.9), multiple use (§ 219.10), and timber (§ 219.11).
            (f) Other content in the plan. (1) Other required content in the plan. Every plan must:
            (i) Identify watershed(s) that are a priority for maintenance or restoration;
            (ii) Describe the plan area's distinctive roles and contributions within the broader landscape;
            (iii) Include the monitoring program required by § 219.12; and
            (iv) Contain information reflecting proposed and possible actions that may occur on the plan area during the life of the plan, including: the planned timber sale program; timber harvesting levels; and the proportion of probable methods of forest vegetation management practices expected to be used (16 U.S.C. 1604(e)(2) and (f)(2)). Such information is not a commitment to take any action and is not a “proposal” as defined by the Council on Environmental Quality regulations for implementing NEPA (40 CFR 1508.23, 42 U.S.C. 4322(2)(C)).
            (2) Optional content in the plan. A plan may include additional content, such as potential management approaches or strategies and partnership opportunities or coordination activities.

            § 219.9
            Diversity of plant and animal communities.

            This section adopts a complementary ecosystem and species-specific approach to maintaining the diversity of plant and animal communities and the persistence of native species in the plan area. Compliance with the ecosystem requirements of paragraph (a) of this section is intended to provide the ecological conditions to both maintain the diversity of plant and animal communities and support the persistence of most native species in the plan area. Compliance with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section is intended to provide for additional ecological conditions not otherwise provided by compliance with paragraph (a) of this section for individual species as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. A plan developed or revised under this part must provide for the diversity of plant and animal communities, within Forest Service authority and consistent with the inherent capability of the plan area, as follows:
            (a) Ecosystem plan components. (1) Ecosystem integrity. As required by § 219.8(a), the plan must include plan components, including standards or guidelines, to maintain or restore the ecological integrity of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and watersheds in the plan area, including plan components to maintain or restore their structure, function, composition, and connectivity.
            (2) Ecosystem diversity. The plan must include plan components, including standards or guidelines, to maintain or restore the diversity of ecosystems and habitat types throughout the plan area. In doing so, the plan must include plan components to maintain or restore:
            (i) Key characteristics associated with terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem types;
            (ii) Rare aquatic and terrestrial plant and animal communities; and
            (iii) The diversity of native tree species similar to that existing in the plan area.
            (b) Additional, species-specific plan components. (1) The responsible official shall determine whether or not the plan components required by paragraph (a) of this section provide the ecological conditions necessary to: contribute to the recovery of federally listed threatened and endangered species, conserve proposed and candidate species, and maintain a viable population of each species of conservation concern within the plan area. If the responsible official determines that the plan components required in paragraph (a) are insufficient to provide such ecological conditions, then additional, species-specific plan components, including standards or guidelines, must be included in the plan to provide such ecological conditions in the plan area.
            (2) If the responsible official determines that it is beyond the authority of the Forest Service or not within the inherent capability of the plan area to maintain or restore the ecological conditions to maintain a viable population of a species of conservation concern in the plan area, then the responsible official shall:
            (i) Document the basis for that determination (§ 219.14(a)); and
            (ii) Include plan components, including standards or guidelines, to maintain or restore ecological conditions within the plan area to contribute to maintaining a viable population of the species within its range. In providing such plan components, the responsible official shall coordinate to the extent practicable with other Federal, State, Tribal, and private land managers having management authority over lands relevant to that population.
            (c) Species of conservation concern. For purposes of this subpart, a species of conservation concern is a species, other than federally recognized threatened, endangered, proposed, or candidate species, that is known to occur in the plan area and for which the regional forester has determined that the best available scientific information indicates substantial concern about the species' capability to persist over the long-term in the plan area.

            § 219.10
            Multiple use.
            While meeting the requirements of §§ 219.8 and 219.9, a plan developed or revised under this part must provide for ecosystem services and multiple uses, including outdoor recreation, range, timber, watershed, wildlife, and fish, within Forest Service authority and the inherent capability of the plan area as follows:
            (a) Integrated resource management for multiple use. The plan must include plan components, including standards or guidelines, for integrated resource management to provide for ecosystem services and multiple uses in the plan area. When developing plan components for integrated resource management, to the extent relevant to the plan area and the public participation process and the requirements of §§ 219.7, 219.8, 219.9, and 219.11, the responsible official shall consider:
            (1) Aesthetic values, air quality, cultural and heritage resources, ecosystem services, fish and wildlife species, forage, geologic features, grazing and rangelands, habitat and habitat connectivity, recreation settings and opportunities, riparian areas, scenery, soil, surface and subsurface water quality, timber, trails, vegetation, viewsheds, wilderness, and other relevant resources and uses.
            (2) Renewable and nonrenewable energy and mineral resources.
            (3) Appropriate placement and sustainable management of infrastructure, such as recreational facilities and transportation and utility corridors.
            (4) Opportunities to coordinate with neighboring landowners to link open spaces and take into account joint management objectives where feasible and appropriate.
            (5) Habitat conditions, subject to the requirements of § 219.9, for wildlife, fish, and plants commonly enjoyed and used by the public; for hunting, fishing, trapping, gathering, observing, subsistence, and other activities (in collaboration with federally recognized Tribes, Alaska Native Corporations, other Federal agencies, and State and local governments).
            (6) Land status and ownership, use, and access patterns relevant to the plan area.
            (7) Reasonably foreseeable risks to ecological, social, and economic sustainability.
            (8) System drivers, including dominant ecological processes, disturbance regimes, and stressors, such as natural succession, wildland fire, invasive species, and climate change; and the ability of the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems on the plan area to adapt to change (§ 219.8);
            (9) Public water supplies and associated water quality.
            (10) Opportunities to connect people with nature.
            (b) Requirements for plan components for a new plan or plan revision. (1) The plan must include plan components, including standards or guidelines, to provide for:
            (i) Sustainable recreation; including recreation settings, opportunities, and access; and scenic character. Recreation opportunities may include non-motorized, motorized, developed, and dispersed recreation on land, water, and in the air.
            (ii) Protection of cultural and historic resources.
            (iii) Management of areas of tribal importance.
            (iv) Protection of congressionally designated wilderness areas as well as management of areas recommended for wilderness designation to protect and maintain the ecological and social characteristics that provide the basis for their suitability for wilderness designation.
            (v) Protection of designated wild and scenic rivers as well as management of rivers found eligible or determined suitable for the National Wild and Scenic River system to protect the values that provide the basis for their suitability for inclusion in the system.
            (vi) Appropriate management of other designated areas or recommended designated areas in the plan area, including research natural areas.
            (2) Other plan components for integrated resource management to provide for multiple use as necessary.

            § 219.11
            Timber requirements based on the NFMA.
            While meeting the requirements of §§ 219.8 through 219.10, a plan developed or revised under this part must include plan components, including standards or guidelines, and other plan content regarding timber management within Forest Service authority and the inherent capability of the plan area, as follows:
            (a) Lands not suited for timber production. (1) The responsible official shall identify lands within the plan area as not suited for timber production if any one of the following factors applies:
            (i) Statute, Executive order, or regulation prohibits timber production on the land;

            (ii) The Secretary of Agriculture or the Chief has withdrawn the land from timber production;
            
            (iii) Timber production would not be compatible with the achievement of desired conditions and objectives established by the plan for those lands;
            (iv) The technology is not currently available for conducting timber harvest without causing irreversible damage to soil, slope, or other watershed conditions;
            (v) There is no reasonable assurance that such lands can be adequately restocked within 5 years after final regeneration harvest; or
            (vi) The land is not forest land.
            (2) The responsible official shall review lands identified in the plan as not suited for timber production at least once every 10 years, or as otherwise prescribed by law, to determine whether conditions have changed so that they have become suitable for timber production. As a result of this 10-year review, the plan may be amended to identify any such lands as suitable for timber production, if warranted by changed conditions.
            (b) Timber harvest for purposes of timber production. A plan that identifies lands as suitable for timber production must include plan components, including standards or guidelines, to guide timber harvest for timber production or for other multiple use purposes on such lands.
            (c) Timber harvest for purposes other than timber production. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the plan may include plan components to allow for timber harvest for purposes other than timber production throughout the plan area, or portions of the plan area, as a tool to assist in achieving or maintaining one or more applicable desired conditions or objectives of the plan in order to protect other multiple-use values, and for salvage, sanitation, or public health or safety. Examples of using timber harvest to protect other multiple use values may include improving wildlife or fish habitat, thinning to reduce fire risk, or restoring meadow or savanna ecosystems where trees have invaded.
            (d) Limitations on timber harvest. Whether timber harvest would be for the purposes of timber production or other purposes, plan components, including standards or guidelines, must ensure the following:
            (1) No timber harvest for the purposes of timber production may occur on lands not suited for timber production.
            (2) Timber harvest would occur only where soil, slope, or other watershed conditions would not be irreversibly damaged;
            (3) Timber harvest would be carried out in a manner consistent with the protection of soil, watershed, fish, wildlife, recreation, and aesthetic resources.
            (4) Where plan components will allow clearcutting, seed tree cutting, shelterwood cutting, or other cuts designed to regenerate an even-aged stand of timber, the plan must include standards limiting the maximum size for openings that may be cut in one harvest operation, according to geographic areas, forest types, or other suitable classifications. Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section, this limit may not exceed 60 acres for the Douglas-fir forest type of California, Oregon, and Washington; 80 acres for the southern yellow pine types of Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Oklahoma, and Texas; 100 acres for the hemlock-Sitka spruce forest type of coastal Alaska; and 40 acres for all other forest types.
            (5) Timber will be harvested from NFS lands only where such harvest would comply with the resource protections set out in sections 6(g)(3)(E) and (F) of the NFMA (16 U.S.C. 1604(g)(3)(E) and (F)). Some of these requirements are listed in paragraphs (d)(2) to (d)(4) of this section.
            (6) The quantity of timber that may be sold from the national forest is limited to an amount equal to or less than that which can be removed from such forest annually in perpetuity on a sustained yield basis. This limit may be measured on a decadal basis.

            (i) The plan may provide for departures from this limit as provided by the NFMA when departure would be consistent with the plan's desired conditions and objectives. Exceptions for departure from this limit on the quantity sold may be made only after a public review and comment period of at least 90 days.
            
            (ii) This limit may be based upon increases in harvest levels based on intensified management practices, such as reforestation, thinning, and tree improvement if such practices justify increasing the harvests in accordance with the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960. The plan must require that such harvest levels be decreased at the end of each planning period if such practices cannot be successfully implemented or funds are not received to permit such practices to continue substantially as planned.
            (iii) The Chief must include in the Forest Service Directive System procedures for estimating the quantity of timber that can be removed annually in perpetuity on a sustained-yield basis, and exceptions, consistent with 16 U.S.C. 1611.
            (7) The regeneration harvest of even-aged stands of trees is limited to stands that generally have reached the culmination of mean annual increment of growth. This requirement would apply only to regeneration harvest of even-aged stands on lands identified as suitable for timber production and where timber production is the primary purpose for the harvest. Plan components may allow for exceptions, set out in 16 U.S.C. 1604(m), only if such harvest is consistent with the other plan components of the land management plan.
            [77 FR 21260, Apr. 9, 2012, as amended at 77 FR 44145, July 27, 2012; 78 FR 23492, Apr. 19, 2013; 81 FR 90737, Dec. 15, 2016]
          
          
            § 219.12
            Monitoring.
            (a) Plan monitoring program. (1) The responsible official shall develop a monitoring program for the plan area and include it in the plan. Monitoring information should enable the responsible official to determine if a change in plan components or other plan content that guide management of resources on the plan area may be needed. The development of the plan monitoring program must be coordinated with the regional forester and Forest Service State and Private Forestry and Research and Development. Responsible officials for two or more administrative units may jointly develop their plan monitoring programs.
            (2) The plan monitoring program sets out the plan monitoring questions and associated indicators. Monitoring questions and associated indicators must be designed to inform the management of resources on the plan area, including by testing relevant assumptions, tracking relevant changes, and measuring management effectiveness and progress toward achieving or maintaining the plan's desired conditions or objectives. Questions and indicators should be based on one or more desired conditions, objectives, or other plan components in the plan, but not every plan component needs to have a corresponding monitoring question.
            (3) The plan monitoring program should be coordinated and integrated with relevant broader-scale monitoring strategies (paragraph (b) of this section) to ensure that monitoring is complementary and efficient, and that information is gathered at scales appropriate to the monitoring questions.
            (4) Subject to the requirements of paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the responsible official has the discretion to set the scope and scale of the plan monitoring program, after considering:
            (i) Information needs identified through the planning process as most critical for informed management of resources on the plan area; and
            (ii) The financial and technical capabilities of the Agency.
            (5) Each plan monitoring program must contain one or more monitoring questions and associated indicators addressing each of the following:
            (i) The status of select watershed conditions.
            (ii) The status of select ecological conditions including key characteristics of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.
            (iii) The status of focal species to assess the ecological conditions required under § 219.9.

            (iv) The status of a select set of the ecological conditions required under § 219.9 to contribute to the recovery of federally listed threatened and endangered species, conserve proposed and candidate species, and maintain a viable population of each species of conservation concern.
            
            (v) The status of visitor use, visitor satisfaction, and progress toward meeting recreation objectives.
            (vi) Measurable changes on the plan area related to climate change and other stressors that may be affecting the plan area.
            (vii) Progress toward meeting the desired conditions and objectives in the plan, including for providing multiple use opportunities.
            (viii) The effects of each management system to determine that they do not substantially and permanently impair the productivity of the land (16 U.S.C. 1604(g)(3)(C)).
            (6) A range of monitoring techniques may be used to carry out the monitoring requirements in paragraph (a)(5) of this section.
            (7) This section does not apply to projects or activities. Project and activity monitoring may be used to gather information for the plan monitoring program, and information gathered through plan monitoring may be used to inform development of projects or activities. But, the monitoring requirements of this section are not a prerequisite for making a decision to carry out a project or activity.
            (b) Broader-scale monitoring strategies. (1) The regional forester shall develop a broader-scale monitoring strategy for plan monitoring questions that can best be answered at a geographic scale broader than one plan area.
            (2) When developing a monitoring strategy, the regional forester shall coordinate with the relevant responsible officials, Forest Service State and Private Forestry and Research and Development, partners, and the public. Two or more regional foresters may jointly develop broader-scale monitoring strategies.
            (3) Each regional forester shall ensure that the broader-scale monitoring strategy is within the financial and technical capabilities of the region and complements other ongoing monitoring efforts.
            (4) Projects and activities may be carried out under plans developed, amended, or revised under this part before the regional forester has developed a broader-scale monitoring strategy.
            (c) Timing and process for developing the plan monitoring program and broader-scale strategies. (1) The responsible official shall develop the plan monitoring program as part of the planning process for a new plan development or plan revision. Where a plan's monitoring program has been developed under the provisions of a prior planning regulation and the unit has not initiated plan revision under this part, the responsible official shall modify the plan monitoring program within 4 years of the effective date of this part, or as soon as practicable, to meet the requirements of this section.
            (2) The regional forester shall develop a broader-scale monitoring strategy as soon as practicable.
            (3) To the extent practicable, appropriate, and relevant to the monitoring questions in the plan monitoring program, plan monitoring programs and broader-scale strategies must be designed to take into account:
            (i) Existing national and regional inventory, monitoring, and research programs of the Agency, including from the NFS, State and Private Forestry, and Research and Development, and of other governmental and non-governmental entities;
            (ii) Opportunities to design and carry out multi-party monitoring with other Forest Service units, Federal, State or local government agencies, scientists, partners, and members of the public; and
            (iii) Opportunities to design and carry out monitoring with federally recognized Indian Tribes and Alaska Native Corporations.
            (d) Biennial evaluation of the monitoring information. (1) The responsible official shall conduct a biennial evaluation of new information gathered through the plan monitoring program and relevant information from the broader-scale strategy, and shall issue a written report of the evaluation and make it available to the public.
            (i) The first monitoring evaluation for a plan or plan revision developed in accordance with this subpart must be completed no later than 2 years from the effective date of plan decision.

            (ii) Where the monitoring program developed under the provisions of a prior planning regulation has been modified to meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the first monitoring evaluation must be completed no later than 2 years from the date the change takes effect.
            (iii) The monitoring evaluation report may be postponed for 1 year in case of exigencies, but notice of the postponement must be provided to the public prior to the date the report is due for that year (§ 219.16(c)(6)).
            (2) The monitoring evaluation report must indicate whether or not a change to the plan, management activities, or the monitoring program, or a new assessment, may be warranted based on the new information. The monitoring evaluation report must be used to inform adaptive management of the plan area.
            (3) The monitoring evaluation report may be incorporated into other planning documents if the responsible official has initiated a plan revision or relevant amendment.
            (4) The monitoring evaluation report is not a decision document representing final Agency action, and is not subject to the objection provisions of subpart B.
          
          
            § 219.13
            Plan amendment and administrative changes.
            (a) Plan amendment. A plan may be amended at any time. Plan amendments may be broad or narrow, depending on the need for change, and should be used to keep plans current and help units adapt to new information or changing conditions. The responsible official has the discretion to determine whether and how to amend the plan and to determine the scope and scale of any amendment. Except as provided by paragraph (c) of this section, a plan amendment is required to add, modify, or remove one or more plan components, or to change how or where one or more plan components apply to all or part of the plan area (including management areas or geographic areas).
            (b) Amendment requirements. For every plan amendment, the responsible official shall:
            (1) Base an amendment on a preliminary identification of the need to change the plan. The preliminary identification of the need to change the plan may be based on a new assessment; a monitoring report; or other documentation of new information, changed conditions, or changed circumstances. When a plan amendment is made together with, and only applies to, a project or activity decision, the analysis prepared for the project or activity may serve as the documentation for the preliminary identification of the need to change the plan.
            (2) Provide opportunities for public participation as required in § 219.4 and public notification as required in § 219.16. The responsible official may combine processes and associated public notifications where appropriate, considering the scope and scale of the need to change the plan. The responsible official must include information in the initial notice for the amendment (§ 219.16(a)(1)) about which substantive requirements of §§ 219.8 through 219.11 are likely to be directly related to the amendment (§ 219.13(b)(5)).
            (3) Amend the plan consistent with Forest Service NEPA procedures. The appropriate NEPA documentation for an amendment may be an environmental impact statement, an environmental assessment, or a categorical exclusion, depending upon the scope and scale of the amendment and its likely effects. Except for an amendment that applies only to one project or activity, a proposed amendment that may create a significant environmental effect and thus requires preparation of an environmental impact statement is considered a significant change in the plan for the purposes of the NFMA and therefore requires a 90-day comment period for the proposed plan and draft environmental impact statement (§ 219.16(a)(2)), in addition to meeting the requirements of this section.
            (4) Follow the applicable format for plan components set out at § 219.7(e) for the plan direction added or modified by the amendment, except that where an amendment to a plan developed or revised under a prior planning regulation would simply modify the area to which existing direction applies, the responsible official may retain the existing formatting for that direction.

            (5) Determine which specific substantive requirement(s) within §§ 219.8 through 219.11 are directly related to the plan direction being added, modified, or removed by the amendment and apply such requirement(s) within the scope and scale of the amendment. The responsible official is not required to apply any substantive requirements within §§ 219.8 through 219.11 that are not directly related to the amendment.
            (i) The responsible official's determination must be based on the purpose for the amendment and the effects (beneficial or adverse) of the amendment, and informed by the best available scientific information, scoping, effects analysis, monitoring data or other rationale.
            (ii) When basing the determination on adverse effects:
            (A) The responsible official must determine that a specific substantive requirement is directly related to the amendment when scoping or NEPA effects analysis for the proposed amendment reveals substantial adverse effects associated with that requirement, or when the proposed amendment would substantially lessen protections for a specific resource or use.
            (B) If the appropriate NEPA documentation for an amendment is a categorical exclusion or an environmental assessment accompanied by a finding of no significant impact (§ 219.13(b)(3)), there is a rebuttable presumption that the amendment will not have substantial adverse effects.
            (6) For an amendment to a plan developed or revised under a prior planning regulation, if species of conservation concern (SCC) have not been identified for the plan area and if scoping or NEPA effects analysis for the proposed amendment reveals substantial adverse impacts to a specific species, or if the proposed amendment would substantially lessen protections for a specific species, the responsible official must determine whether such species is a potential SCC, and if so, apply section § 219.9(b) with respect to that species as if it were an SCC.
            (c) Administrative changes. An administrative change is any change to a plan that is not a plan amendment or plan revision. Administrative changes include corrections of clerical errors to any part of the plan, conformance of the plan to new statutory or regulatory requirements, or changes to other content in the plan (§ 219.7(f)).
            (1) A substantive change to the monitoring program made outside of the process for plan revision or amendment may be made only after notice to the public of the intended change and consideration of public comment (§ 219.16(c)(6)).
            (2) All other administrative changes may be made following public notice (§ 219.16(c)(6)).

            § 219.14
            Decision document and planning records.
            (a) Decision document approving a new plan, plan amendment, or revision. The responsible official shall record approval of a new plan, plan amendment, or revision in a decision document prepared according to Forest Service NEPA procedures (36 CFR part 220). The decision document must include:
            (1) The rationale for approval;
            (2) A statement of how the plan, plan amendment, or plan revision applies to approved projects and activities (§ 219.15);
            (3) The documentation of how the best available scientific information was used to inform planning, the plan components, and other plan content, including the plan monitoring program (§ 219.3);
            (4) The concurrence by the appropriate research station director with any part of the plan applicable to any experimental forests or experimental ranges (§ 219.2(b)(4)); and
            (5) The effective date of the plan, amendment, or revision.
            (b) Decision document for a new plan or plan revision. In addition to meeting the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, the decision document must include an explanation of how the plan components meet the sustainability requirements of § 219.8, the diversity requirements of § 219.9, the multiple use requirements of § 219.10, and the timber requirements of § 219.11.
            (c) Decision document for a plan amendment. In addition to meeting the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, the decision document must explain how the responsible official determined:

            (1) The scope and scale of the plan amendment; and
            
            (2) Which specific requirements within §§ 219.8 through 219.11 apply to the amendment and how they were applied.
            (d) Planning records. (1) The responsible official shall keep the following documents readily accessible to the public by posting them online and through other means: assessment reports (§ 219.6); the plan, including the monitoring program; the proposed plan, plan amendment, or plan revision; public notices and environmental documents associated with a plan; plan decision documents; and monitoring evaluation reports (§ 219.12).
            (2) The planning record includes documents that support analytical conclusions made and alternatives considered throughout the planning process. The responsible official shall make the planning record available at the office where the plan, plan amendment, or plan revision was developed.
            [77 FR 21260, Apr. 9, 2012, as amended at 81 FR 90738, Dec. 15, 2016]
          
          
            § 219.15
            Project and activity consistency with the plan.
            (a) Application to existing authorizations and approved projects or activities. Every decision document approving a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision must state whether authorizations of occupancy and use made before the decision document may proceed unchanged. If a plan decision document does not expressly allow such occupancy and use, the permit, contract, and other authorizing instrument for the use and occupancy must be made consistent with the plan, plan amendment, or plan revision as soon as practicable, as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, subject to valid existing rights.
            (b) Application to projects or activities authorized after plan decision. Projects and activities authorized after approval of a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision must be consistent with the plan as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.
            (c) Resolving inconsistency. When a proposed project or activity would not be consistent with the applicable plan components, the responsible official shall take one of the following steps, subject to valid existing rights:
            (1) Modify the proposed project or activity to make it consistent with the applicable plan components;
            (2) Reject the proposal or terminate the project or activity;
            (3) Amend the plan so that the project or activity will be consistent with the plan as amended; or
            (4) Amend the plan contemporaneously with the approval of the project or activity so that the project or activity will be consistent with the plan as amended. This amendment may be limited to apply only to the project or activity.
            (d) Determining consistency. Every project and activity must be consistent with the applicable plan components. A project or activity approval document must describe how the project or activity is consistent with applicable plan components developed or revised in conformance with this part by meeting the following criteria:
            (1) Goals, desired conditions, and objectives. The project or activity contributes to the maintenance or attainment of one or more goals, desired conditions, or objectives, or does not foreclose the opportunity to maintain or achieve any goals, desired conditions, or objectives, over the long term.
            (2) Standards. The project or activity complies with applicable standards.
            (3) Guidelines. The project or activity:
            (i) Complies with applicable guidelines as set out in the plan; or
            (ii) Is designed in a way that is as effective in achieving the purpose of the applicable guidelines (§ 219.7(e)(1)(iv)).
            (4) Suitability. A project or activity would occur in an area:
            (i) That the plan identifies as suitable for that type of project or activity; or
            (ii) For which the plan is silent with respect to its suitability for that type of project or activity.
            (e) Consistency of resource plans within the planning area with the land management plan. Any resource plans (for example, travel management plans) developed by the Forest Service that apply to the resources or land areas within the planning area must be consistent with the plan components. Resource plans developed prior to plan decision must be evaluated for consistency with the plan and amended if necessary.
          
          
            § 219.16
            Public notifications.
            The following public notification requirements apply to plan development, amendment, or revision. Notifications may be combined where appropriate.
            (a) When formal public notification is required. Public notification must be provided as follows:
            (1) To initiate the development of a proposed plan, plan amendment, or plan revision;
            (2) To invite comments on a proposed plan, plan amendment, or plan revision, and associated environmental analysis. For a new plan, plan amendment, or a plan revision for which a draft environmental impact statement (EIS) is prepared, the comment period is at least 90 days, except for an amendment that applies only to one project or activity. For an amendment that applies only to one project or activity for which a draft EIS is prepared, the comment period is at least 45 days unless a different time period is required by law or regulation or authorized pursuant to 40 CFR 1506.10(d). For an amendment for which a draft EIS is not prepared, the comment period is at least 30 days;
            (3) To begin the objection period for a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision before approval (§ 219.52);
            (4) To approve a final plan, plan amendment, or plan revision; or
            (5) To announce whenever a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision process initiated under the provisions of a previous planning regulation will be conformed to meet the provisions of this part (§ 219.17(b)(3)).
            (b) Project or activity plan amendments. When a plan amendment is approved in a decision document approving a project or activity and the amendment applies only to the project or activity, the notification requirements of 36 CFR part 215 or part 218, subpart A, applies instead of this section.

            Effective dates and transition.
            (a) Effective dates. (1) A plan or plan revision is effective 30 days after publication of notice of its approval.
            (2) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, a plan amendment for which an environmental impact statement (EIS) has been prepared is effective 30 days after publication of notice of its approval; a plan amendment for which an EIS has not been prepared is effective immediately.
            (3) A plan amendment that applies to only one specific project or activity is effective on the date the project may be implemented in accordance with administrative review regulations at 36 CFR parts 215 and 218.
            (b) Plan amendment and plan revision transition. For the purposes of this section, initiation means that the Agency has issued a notice of intent or other notice announcing the beginning of the process to develop a proposed plan, plan amendment, or plan revision.
            (1) Initiating plan development and plan revisions. Plan development and plan revisions initiated after May 9, 2012 must conform to the requirements of this part.
            (2) Initiating plan amendments. All plan amendments initiated after May 9, 2012, are subject to the objection process in subpart B of this part. With respect to plans approved or revised under a prior planning regulation, including the transition provisions of the reinstated 2000 rule (36 CFR part 219, published at 36 CFR parts 200 to 299, revised as of July 1, 2010), plan amendments may be initiated under the provisions of the prior planning regulation for 3 years after May 9, 2012, and may be completed and approved under those provisions (except for the optional appeal procedures of the prior planning regulation); or may be initiated, completed, and approved under the requirements of this part. After the 3-year transition period, all plan amendments must be initiated, completed, and approved under the requirements of this part.
            (3) Plan development, plan amendments, or plan revisions initiated before this part. For plan development, plan amendments, or plan revisions that were initiated before May 9, 2012, the responsible official may complete and approve the plan, plan amendment, or plan revision in conformance with the provisions of the prior planning regulation, including its transition provisions (36 CFR part 219, published at 36 CFR parts 200 to 299, revised as of July 1, 2010), or may conform the plan, plan amendment, or plan revision to the requirements of this part. If the responsible official chooses to complete an ongoing planning process under the provisions of the prior planning regulation, but chooses to allow for an objection rather than an administrative appeal, the objection process in subpart B of this part shall apply. When the responsible official chooses to conform an ongoing planning process to this part, public notice must be made (§ 219.16(a)(5)). An objection process may be chosen only if the public is provided the opportunity to comment on a proposed plan, plan amendment, or plan revision, and associated environmental analysis.
            (c) Plans developed, amended, or revised under a prior planning regulation. This part supersedes any prior planning regulation. No obligations remain from any prior planning regulation, except those that are specifically included in a unit's existing plan. Existing plans will remain in effect until revised. This part does not compel a change to any existing plan, except as required in § 219.12(c)(1). None of the requirements of this part apply to projects or activities on units with plans developed or revised under a prior planning rule until the plan is revised under this part, except that projects or activities on such units must comply with the consistency requirement of § 219.15 with respect to any amendments that are developed and approved pursuant to this part.

            Plans, plan amendments, or plan revisions not subject to objection.

            (a) A plan, plan amendment, or plan revision is not subject to objection when the responsible official receives no substantive formal comments (§ 219.62) on that proposal during the opportunities for public comment (§ 219.53(a)).
            (b) Plans, plan amendments, or plan revisions proposed by the Secretary of Agriculture or the Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment are not subject to the procedures set forth in this section. A decision by the Secretary or Under Secretary constitutes the final administrative determination of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
            (c) A plan, plan amendment, or plan revision is not subject to objection under this subpart if another administrative review process is used consistent with § 219.59.
            (d) When a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision is not subject to objection under this subpart, the responsible official shall include an explanation with the signed decision document.
          
          
            § 219.52
            Giving notice of a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision subject to objection before approval.
            (a) The responsible official shall disclose during the NEPA scoping process and in the appropriate NEPA documents that the proposed plan, plan amendment, or plan revision is subject to the objection procedures in this subpart. This disclosure is in addition to the public notice that begins the objection filing period, as required at § 219.16. When a responsible official chooses to use the objection process of this subpart for a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision process initiated before the effective date of this rule, notice that the objection process will be used must be given prior to an opportunity to provide substantive formal comment on a proposed plan, plan amendment, or revision and associated environmental analysis.
            (b) The responsible official shall make available the public notice for the beginning of the objection period for a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision (§ 219.16(a)(3)) to those who have requested the environmental documents or are eligible to file an objection consistent with § 219.53.
            (c) The content of the public notice for the beginning of the objection period for a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision before approval (§ 219.16(a)(3)) must:
            (1) Inform the public of the availability of the plan, plan amendment, or plan revision, the appropriate final environmental documents, the draft plan decision document, and any relevant assessment or monitoring evaluation report; the commencement of the objection filing period under 36 CFR part 219 Subpart B; and the process for objecting. The documents in this paragraph will be made available online at the time of public notice.
            (2) Include the name of the plan, plan amendment, or plan revision, the name and title of the responsible official, and instructions on how to obtain a copy of the appropriate final environmental documents; the draft plan decision document; and the plan, plan amendment, or plan revision.
            (3) Include the name and address of the reviewing officer with whom an objection is to be filed. The notice must specify a street, postal, fax, and email address; the acceptable format(s) for objections filed electronically; and the reviewing officer's office business hours for those filing hand-delivered objections.
            (4) Include a statement that objections will be accepted only from those who have previously submitted substantive formal comments specific to the proposed plan, plan amendment, or plan revision during any opportunity for public comment as provided in subpart A.

            (5) Include a statement that the publication date of the public notice in the applicable newspaper of record (or the Federal Register, if the responsible official is the Chief) is the exclusive means for calculating the time to file an objection (§ 219.56).
            (6) Include a statement that an objection, including attachments, must be filed with the appropriate reviewing officer (§ 219.62) within 60 days, if an environmental impact statement has been prepared, otherwise within 45 days of the date of publication of the public notice for the objection process.
            (7) Include a statement describing the minimum content requirements of an objection (§ 219.54(c)).
          
          
            
            § 219.53
            Who may file an objection.
            (a) Individuals and entities who have submitted substantive formal comments related to a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision during the opportunities for public comment as provided in subpart A during the planning process for that decision may file an objection. Objections must be based on previously submitted substantive formal comments attributed to the objector unless the objection concerns an issue that arose after the opportunities for formal comment. The burden is on the objector to demonstrate compliance with requirements for objection. Objections that do not meet the requirements of this paragraph may not be accepted; however, objections not accepted must be documented in the planning record.
            (b) Formal comments received from an authorized representative(s) of an entity are considered those of the entity only. Individual members of that entity do not meet objection eligibility requirements solely based on membership in an entity. A member or an individual must submit substantive formal comments independently to be eligible to file an objection in an individual capacity.
            (c) When an objection lists multiple individuals or entities, each individual or entity must meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. Individuals or entities listed on an objection that do not meet eligibility requirements may not be considered objectors, although an objection must be accepted (if not otherwise set aside for review under § 219.55) if at least one listed individual or entity meets the eligibility requirements.
            (d) Federal agencies may not file objections.
            (e) Federal employees who otherwise meet the requirements of this subpart for filing objections in a non-official capacity must comply with Federal conflict of interest statutes at 18 U.S.C. 202-209 and with employee ethics requirements at 5 CFR part 2635. Specifically, employees may not be on official duty nor use government property or equipment in the preparation or filing of an objection. Further, employees may not include information unavailable to the public, such as Federal agency documents that are exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552(b)).
          
          
            § 219.54
            Filing an objection.
            (a) All objections must be filed, in writing, with the reviewing officer for the plan. All objections must be open to public inspection during the objection process.
            (b) Including documents by reference is not allowed, except for the following list of items that may be referenced by including the name, date, page number (where applicable), and relevant section of the cited document. All other documents or Web links to those documents, or both must be included with the objection, if referenced in the objection.
            (1) All or any part of a Federal law or regulation.
            (2) Forest Service Directive System documents and land management plans or other published Forest Service documents.
            (3) Documents referenced by the Forest Service in the planning documentation related to the proposal subject to objection.
            (4) Formal comments previously provided to the Forest Service by the objector during the proposed plan, plan amendment, or plan revision comment period.
            (c) At a minimum, an objection must include the following:
            (1) The objector's name and address (§ 219.62), along with a telephone number or email address if available;
            (2) Signature or other verification of authorship upon request (a scanned signature for electronic mail may be filed with the objection);
            (3) Identification of the lead objector, when multiple names are listed on an objection (§ 219.62). Verification of the identity of the lead objector if requested;
            (4) The name of the plan, plan amendment, or plan revision being objected to, and the name and title of the responsible official;
            (5) A statement of the issues and/or the parts of the plan, plan amendment, or plan revision to which the objection applies;

            (6) A concise statement explaining the objection and suggesting how the proposed plan decision may be improved. If applicable, the objector should identify how the objector believes that the plan, plan amendment, or plan revision is inconsistent with law, regulation, or policy; and
            (7) A statement that demonstrates the link between prior substantive formal comments attributed to the objector and the content of the objection, unless the objection concerns an issue that arose after the opportunities for formal comment (§ 219.53(a)).
          
          
            § 219.55
            Objections set aside from review.
            (a) The reviewing officer shall set aside and not review an objection when one or more of the following applies:
            (1) Objections are not filed in a timely manner (§ 219.56);
            (2) The proposed plan, plan amendment, or plan revision is not subject to the objection procedures of this subpart pursuant to §§ 219.51 and 219.59;
            (3) The individual or entity did not submit substantive formal comments (§ 219.53) during opportunities for public comment on the proposed decision (§ 219.16(a)(1) and (a)(2));
            (4) None of the issues included in the objection is based on previously submitted substantive formal comments unless one or more of those issues arose after the opportunities for formal comment;
            (5) The objection does not provide sufficient information as required by § 219.54(c);
            (6) The objector withdraws the objection in writing;
            (7) The objector's identity is not provided or cannot be determined from the signature (written or electronically scanned), and a reasonable means of contact is not provided (§ 219.54(c)); or
            (8) The objection is illegible for any reason and a legible copy cannot easily be obtained.
            (b) When an objection includes an issue that is not based on previously submitted substantive formal comments and did not arise after the opportunities for formal comment, that issue will be set aside and not reviewed. Other issues raised in the objection that meet the requirements of this subpart will be reviewed.
            (c) The reviewing officer shall give written notice to the objector and the responsible official when an objection or part of an objection is set aside from review and shall state the reasons for not reviewing the objection in whole or part. If the objection is set aside from review for reasons of illegibility or lack of a means of contact, the reasons must be documented in the planning record.
          
          
            § 219.56
            Objection time periods and process.
            (a) Time to file an objection. For a new plan, plan amendment, or plan revision for which an environmental impact statement (EIS) is prepared, written objections, including any attachments, must be filed within 60 days following the publication date of the public notice for a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision before approval (§§ 219.16 and 219.52). For an amendment for which an EIS is not prepared, the time to file an objection is within 45 days. It is the responsibility of the objector to ensure that the reviewing officer receives the objection in a timely manner.
            (b) Computation of time periods. (1) All time periods are computed using calendar days, including Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays in the time zone of the reviewing officer. However, when the time period expires on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the time is extended to the end of the next Federal working day (11:59 p.m. for objections filed by electronic means such as email or facsimile machine).
            (2) The day after publication of the public notice for a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision before approval (§§ 219.16 and 219.52), is the first day of the objection filing period.
            (3) The publication date of the public notice for a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision before approval (§§ 219.16 and 219.52), is the exclusive means for calculating the time to file an objection. Objectors may not rely on dates or timeframe information provided by any other source.
            (c) Evidence of timely filing. The objector is responsible for filing the objection in a timely manner. Timeliness must be determined by one of the following indicators:
            
            (1) The date of the U.S. Postal Service postmark for an objection received before the close of the fifth business day after the objection filing date;
            (2) The electronically generated posted date and time for email and facsimiles;
            (3) The shipping date for delivery by private carrier for an objection received before the close of the fifth business day after the objection filing date; or
            (4) The official agency date stamp showing receipt of hand delivery.
            (d) Extensions. Time extensions for filing are not permitted except as provided at paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
            (e) Reviewing officer role and responsibilities. The reviewing officer is the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) or Forest Service official having the delegated authority and responsibility to review an objection filed under this subpart. The reviewing officer is a line officer at the next higher administrative level above the responsible official; except that:
            (1) For a plan amendment, that next higher-level line officer may delegate the reviewing officer authority and responsibility to a line officer at the same administrative level as the responsible official. Any plan amendment delegation of reviewing officer responsibilities must be made prior to the public notification of an objection filing period (§ 219.52).
            (2) For an objection or part of an objection specific to the identification of species of conservation concern, the regional forester who identified the species of conservation concern for the plan area may not be the reviewing officer. The Chief may choose to act as the reviewing officer or may delegate the reviewing officer authority to a line officer at the same administrative level as the regional forester. The reviewing officer for the plan will convey any such objections or parts thereof to the appropriate line officer.
            (f) Notice of objections filed. Within 10 days after the close of the objection period, the responsible official shall publish a notice of all objections in the applicable newspaper of record and post the notice online.
            (g) Response to objections. The reviewing officer must issue a written response to the objector(s) concerning their objection(s) within 90 days of the end of the objection-filing period. The reviewing officer has the discretion to extend the time when it is determined to be necessary to provide adequate response to objections or to participate in discussions with the parties. The reviewing officer must notify all parties (lead objectors and interested persons) in writing of any extensions.
          
          
            § 219.57
            Resolution of objections.
            (a) Meetings. Prior to the issuance of the reviewing officer's written response, either the reviewing officer or the objector may request to meet to discuss issues raised in the objection and potential resolution. The reviewing officer must allow other interested persons to participate in such meetings. An interested person must file a request to participate in an objection within 10 days after publication of the notice of objection by the responsible official (§ 219.56(f)). The responsible official shall be a participant in all meetings involving the reviewing officer, objectors, and interested persons. During meetings with objectors and interested persons, the reviewing officer may choose to use alternative dispute resolution methods to resolve objections. All meetings are open to observation by the public.
            (b) Response to objections. (1) The reviewing officer must render a written response to the objection(s) within 90 days of the close of the objection-filing period, unless the allowable time is extended as provided at § 219.56(g). A written response must set forth the reasons for the response but need not be a point-by-point response, and may contain instructions to the responsible official. In cases involving more than one objection to a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision, the reviewing officer may consolidate objections and issue one or more responses. The response must be sent to the objecting party(ies) by certified mail, return receipt requested, and posted online.

            (2) The reviewing officer's review of and response to the objection(s) is limited to only those issues and concerns submitted in the objection(s).
            
            (3) The response of the reviewing officer will be the final decision of the U.S. Department of Agriculture on the objection.
          
          
            § 219.58
            Timing of a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision decision.
            (a) The responsible official may not issue a decision document concerning a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision subject to the provisions of this subpart until the reviewing officer has responded in writing to all objections.
            (b) A decision by the responsible official approving a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision must be consistent with the reviewing officer's response to objections.
            (c) When no objection is filed within the allotted filing period, the reviewing officer must notify the responsible official. The responsible official's approval of the plan, plan amendment, or plan revision in a plan decision document consistent with § 219.14, may occur on, but not before, the fifth business day following the end of the objection-filing period.
          
          
            § 219.59
            Use of other administrative review processes.
            (a) Where the Forest Service is a participant in a multi-federal agency effort that would otherwise be subject to objection under this subpart, the responsible official may waive the objection procedures of this subpart and instead adopt the administrative review procedure of another participating Federal agency. As a condition of such a waiver, the responsible official for the Forest Service must have agreement with the responsible official of the other agency or agencies that a joint agency response will be provided to those who file for administrative review of the multi-agency effort. When such an agreement is reached, the responsible official for the Forest Service shall ensure public notice required in § 219.52 sets forth which administrative review procedure is to be used.
            (b) When a plan amendment is approved in a decision document approving a project or activity and the amendment applies only to the project or activity, the administrative review process of 36 CFR part 215 or part 218, subpart A, applies instead of the objection process established in this subpart. When a plan amendment applies to all future projects or activities, the objection process established in this subpart applies only to the plan amendment decision; the review process of 36 CFR part 215 or part 218 would apply to the project or activity part of the decision.
          
          
            § 219.60
            Secretary's authority.
            Nothing in this subpart restricts the Secretary of Agriculture from exercising any statutory authority regarding the protection, management, or administration of NFS lands.
          
          
            § 219.61
            Information collection requirements.
            This subpart specifies the information that objectors must give in an objection to a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision (§ 219.54(c)). As such, this subpart contains information collection requirements as defined in 5 CFR part 1320 and have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget and assigned control number 0596-0158.

The environmentally preferable alternative is the alternative that will best promote the national environmental policy as expressed in NEPA's section 101 (42 U.S.C. 4321). Ordinarily, the environmentally preferable alternative is that which causes the least harm to the biological and physical environment; it also is the alternative which best protects and preserves historic, cultural, and natural resources. In some situations, there may be more than one environmentally preferable alternative.
          
            Reasonably foreseeable future actions. Those Federal or non-Federal activities not yet undertaken, for which there are existing decisions, funding, or identified proposals. Identified proposals for Forest Service actions are described in § 220.4(a)(1).
          
            Responsible official. The Agency employee who has the authority to make and implement a decision on a proposed action.
          
            Schedule of proposed actions (SOPA). A Forest Service document that informs the public about those proposed and ongoing Forest Service actions for which a record of decision, decision notice or decision memo would be or has been prepared. The SOPA also identifies a contact for additional information on any proposed actions.
        
        
          § 220.4
          General requirements.
          (a) Proposed actions subject to the NEPA requirements. As required by 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq., a Forest Service proposal is subject to the NEPA requirements when all of the following apply:

          (1) The Forest Service has a goal and is actively preparing to make a decision on one or more alternative means of accomplishing that goal and the effects can be meaningfully evaluated (see 40 CFR 1508.23);

          (2) The proposed action is subject to Forest Service control and responsibility (see 40 CFR 1508.18);

          (3) The proposed action would cause effects on the natural and physical environment and the relationship of people with that environment (see 40 CFR 1508.14); and
          (4) The proposed action is not statutorily exempt from the requirements of section 102(2)(C) of the NEPA (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).
          (b) Emergency responses. When the responsible official determines that an emergency exists that makes it necessary to take urgently needed actions before preparing a NEPA analysis and any required documentation in accordance with the provisions in §§ 220.5, 220.6, and 220.7 of this part, then the following provisions apply.
          
          (1) The responsible official may take actions necessary to control the immediate impacts of the emergency and are urgently needed to mitigate harm to life, property, or important natural or cultural resources. When taking such actions, the responsible official shall take into account the probable environmental consequences of the emergency action and mitigate foreseeable adverse environmental effects to the extent practical.
          (2) If the responsible official proposes emergency actions other than those actions described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and such actions are not likely to have significant environmental impacts, the responsible official shall document that determination in an EA and FONSI prepared in accord with these regulations. If the responsible official finds that the nature and scope of proposed emergency actions are such that they must be undertaken prior to preparing any NEPA analysis and documentation associated with a CE or an EA and FONSI, the responsible official shall consult with the Washington Office about alternative arrangements for NEPA compliance. The Chief or Associate Chief of the Forest Service may grant emergency alternative arrangements under NEPA for environmental assessments, findings of no significant impact and categorical exclusions (FSM 1950.41a). Consultation with the Washington Office shall be coordinated through the appropriate regional office.
          (3) If the responsible official proposes emergency actions other than those actions described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and such actions are likely to have significant environmental impacts, then the responsible official shall consult with CEQ, through the appropriate regional office and the Washington Office, about alternative arrangements in accordance with CEQ regulations at 40 CFR 1506.11 as soon as possible.
          (c) Agency decisionmaking. For each Forest Service proposal (§ 220.4(a)), the responsible official shall coordinate and integrate NEPA review and relevant environmental documents with agency decisionmaking by:
          (1) Completing the environmental document review before making a decision on the proposal;
          (2) Considering environmental documents, public and agency comments (if any) on those documents, and agency responses to those comments;
          (3) Including environmental documents, comments, and responses in the administrative record;
          (4) Considering the alternatives analyzed in environmental document(s) before rendering a decision on the proposal; and
          (5) Making a decision encompassed within the range of alternatives analyzed in the environmental documents.
          (d) Schedule of proposed actions (SOPA). The responsible official shall ensure the SOPA is updated and notify the public of the availability of the SOPA.
          (e) Scoping (40 CFR 1501.7). (1) Scoping is required for all Forest Service proposed actions, including those that would appear to be categorically excluded from further analysis and documentation in an EA or an EIS (§ 220.6).
          (2) Scoping shall be carried out in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 1501.7. Because the nature and complexity of a proposed action determine the scope and intensity of analysis, no single scoping technique is required or prescribed.
          (3) The SOPA shall not to be used as the sole scoping mechanism for a proposed action.
          (f) Cumulative effects considerations of past actions. Cumulative effects analysis shall be carried out in accordance with 40 CFR 1508.7 and in accordance with “The Council on Environmental Quality Guidance Memorandum on Consideration of Past Actions in Cumulative Effects Analysis” dated June 24, 2005. The analysis of cumulative effects begins with consideration of the direct and indirect effects on the environment that are expected or likely to result from the alternative proposals for agency action. Agencies then look for present effects of past actions that are, in the judgment of the agency, relevant and useful because they have a significant cause-and-effect relationship with the direct and indirect effects of the proposal for agency action and its alternatives. CEQ regulations do not require the consideration of the individual effects of all past actions to determine the present effects of past actions. Once the agency has identified those present effects of past actions that warrant consideration, the agency assesses the extent that the effects of the proposal for agency action or its alternatives will add to, modify, or mitigate those effects. The final analysis documents an agency assessment of the cumulative effects of the actions considered (including past, present, and reasonable foreseeable future actions) on the affected environment. With respect to past actions, during the scoping process and subsequent preparation of the analysis, the agency must determine what information regarding past actions is useful and relevant to the required analysis of cumulative effects. Cataloging past actions and specific information about the direct and indirect effects of their design and implementation could in some contexts be useful to predict the cumulative effects of the proposal. The CEQ regulations, however, do not require agencies to catalogue or exhaustively list and analyze all individual past actions. Simply because information about past actions may be available or obtained with reasonable effort does not mean that it is relevant and necessary to inform decisionmaking. (40 CFR 1508.7)
          (g) Classified information. To the extent practicable, the responsible official shall segregate any information that has been classified pursuant to Executive order or statute. The responsible official shall maintain the confidentiality of such information in a manner required for the information involved. Such information may not be included in any publicly disclosed documents. If such material cannot be reasonably segregated, or if segregation would leave essentially meaningless material, the responsible official must withhold the entire analysis document from the public; however, the responsible official shall otherwise prepare the analysis documentation in accord with applicable regulations. (40 CFR 1507.3(c))
          (h) Incorporation by reference. Material may be incorporated by reference into any environmental or decision document. This material must be reasonably available to the public and its contents briefly described in the environmental or decision document. (40 CFR 1502.21)
          (i) Applicants. The responsible official shall make policies or staff available to advise potential applicants of studies or other information foreseeably required for acceptance of their applications. Upon acceptance of an application as provided by 36 CFR 251.54(g) the responsible official shall initiate the NEPA process.
        
        
          § 220.5
          Environmental impact statement and record of decision.
          (a) Classes of actions normally requiring environmental impact statements—(1) Class 1: Proposals to carry out or to approve aerial application of chemical pesticides on an operational basis. Examples include but are not limited to:
          (i) Applying chemical insecticides by helicopter on an area infested with spruce budworm to prevent serious resource loss.
          (ii) Authorizing the application of herbicides by helicopter on a major utility corridor to control unwanted vegetation.
          (iii) Applying herbicides by fixed-wing aircraft on an area to release trees from competing vegetation.
          (2) Class 2: Proposals that would substantially alter the undeveloped character of an inventoried roadless area or a potential wilderness area. Examples include but are not limited to:
          (i) Constructing roads and harvesting timber in an inventoried roadless area where the proposed road and harvest units impact a substantial part of the inventoried roadless area.
          (ii) Constructing or reconstructing water reservoir facilities in a potential wilderness area where flow regimens may be substantially altered.
          (iii) Approving a plan of operations for a mine that would cause considerable surface disturbance in a potential wilderness area.
          (b) Notice of intent. Normally, a notice of intent to prepare an EIS shall be published in the Federal Register as soon as practicable after deciding that an EIS will be prepared. Where there is a lengthy period between the agency's decision to prepare an environmental impact statement and the time of actual preparation, the notice of intent may be published at a reasonable time in advance of preparation of the draft statement. A notice must meet the requirements of 40 CFR 1508.22, and in addition, include the following:
          (1) Title of the responsible official(s);
          (2) Any permits or licenses required to implement the proposed action and the issuing authority;
          (3) Lead, joint lead, or cooperating agencies if identified; and
          (4) Address(es) to which comments may be sent.
          (c) Withdrawal notice. A withdrawal notice must be published in the Federal Register if, after publication of the notice of intent or notice of availability, an EIS is no longer necessary. A withdrawal notice must refer to the date and Federal Register page number of the previously published notice(s).
          (d) Environmental impact statement format and content. The responsible official may use any EIS format and design as long as the statement is in accord with 40 CFR 1502.10.
          (e) Alternative(s). The EIS shall document the examination of reasonable alternatives to the proposed action. An alternative should meet the purpose and need and address one or more significant issues related to the proposed action. Since an alternative may be developed to address more than one significant issue, no specific number of alternatives is required or prescribed. The following procedures are available to the responsible official to develop and analyze alternatives:
          (1) The responsible official may modify the proposed action and alternative(s) under consideration prior to issuing a draft EIS. In such cases, the responsible official may consider the incremental changes as alternatives considered. The documentation of these incremental changes to a proposed action or alternatives shall be included or incorporated by reference in accord with 40 CFR 1502.21.
          (2) The proposed action and one or more alternatives to the proposed action may include adaptive management. An adaptive management proposal or alternative must clearly identify the adjustment(s) that may be made when monitoring during project implementation indicates that the action is not having its intended effect, or is causing unintended and undesirable effects. The EIS must disclose not only the effect of the proposed action or alternative but also the effect of the adjustment. Such proposal or alternative must also describe the monitoring that would take place to inform the responsible official during implementation whether the action is having its intended effect.
          (f) Circulating and filing draft and final environmental impact statements. (1) The draft and final EISs shall be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Federal Activities in Washington, DC (see 40 CFR 1506.9).
          (2) Requirements at 40 CFR 1506.9 “Filing requirements,” 40 CFR 1506.10 “Timing of agency action,” and 40 CFR 1502.19 “Circulation of the environmental impact statement” shall only apply to the last draft and final EIS and not apply to material produced prior to the draft EIS or between the draft and final EIS which are filed with EPA.
          (3) When the responsible official determines that an extension of the review period on a draft EIS is appropriate, notice shall be given in the same manner used for inviting comments on the draft.
          (g) Distribution of the record of decision. The responsible official shall notify interested or affected parties of the availability of the record of decision as soon as practical after signing.
        
        
          § 220.6
          Categorical exclusions.
          (a) General. A proposed action may be categorically excluded from further analysis and documentation in an EIS or EA only if there are no extraordinary circumstances related to the proposed action and if:
          (1) The proposed action is within one of the categories established by the Secretary at 7 CFR part 1b.3; or
          (2) The proposed action is within a category listed in § 220.6(d) and (e).
          (b) Resource conditions. (1) Resource conditions that should be considered in determining whether extraordinary circumstances related to a proposed action warrant further analysis and documentation in an EA or an EIS are:
          
          (i) Federally listed threatened or endangered species or designated critical habitat, species proposed for Federal listing or proposed critical habitat, or Forest Service sensitive species;
          (ii) Flood plains, wetlands, or municipal watersheds;
          (iii) Congressionally designated areas, such as wilderness, wilderness study areas, or national recreation areas;
          (iv) Inventoried roadless area or potential wilderness area;
          (v) Research natural areas;
          (vi) American Indians and Alaska Native religious or cultural sites; and
          (vii) Archaeological sites, or historic properties or areas.
          (2) The mere presence of one or more of these resource conditions does not preclude use of a categorical exclusion (CE). It is the existence of a cause-effect relationship between a proposed action and the potential effect on these resource conditions, and if such a relationship exists, the degree of the potential effect of a proposed action on these resource conditions that determines whether extraordinary circumstances exist.
          (c) Scoping. If the responsible official determines, based on scoping, that it is uncertain whether the proposed action may have a significant effect on the environment, prepare an EA. If the responsible official determines, based on scoping, that the proposed action may have a significant environmental effect, prepare an EIS.
          (d) Categories of actions for which a project or case file and decision memo are not required. A supporting record and a decision memo are not required, but at the discretion of the responsible official, may be prepared for the following categories:
          (1) Orders issued pursuant to 36 CFR part 261—Prohibitions to provide short-term resource protection or to protect public health and safety. Examples include but are not limited to:
          (i) Closing a road to protect bighorn sheep during lambing season, and
          (ii) Closing an area during a period of extreme fire danger.

          (iii) Repaving a parking lot; and

          (iv) Applying registered pesticides for rodent or vegetation control.
          
          (6) Acquisition of land or interest in land. Examples include but are not limited to:
          (i) Accepting the donation of lands or interests in land to the NFS, and
          (ii) Purchasing fee, conservation easement, reserved interest deed, or other interests in lands.

          (9) Issuance of a new permit for up to the maximum tenure allowable under the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986 (16 U.S.C. 497b) for an existing ski area when such issuance is a purely ministerial action to account for administrative changes, such as a change in ownership of ski area improvements, expiration of the current permit, or a change in the statutory authority applicable to the current permit. Examples include, but are not limited to:
          (i) Issuing a permit to a new owner of ski area improvements within an existing ski area with no changes to the master development plan, including no changes to the facilities or activities for that ski area;
          (ii) Upon expiration of a ski area permit, issuing a new permit to the holder of the previous permit where the holder is not requesting any changes to the master development plan, including changes to the facilities or activities; and
          (iii) Issuing a new permit under the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986 to the holder of a permit issued under the Term Permit and Organic Acts, where there are no changes in the type or scope of activities authorized and no other changes in the master development plan.
          (10) Amendment to or replacement of an existing special use authorization that involves only administrative changes and does not involve changes in the authorized facilities or increase in the scope or intensity of authorized activities, or extensions to the term of authorization, when the applicant or holder is in full compliance with the terms and conditions of the special use authorization. Examples include, but are not limited to:
          (i) Amending a special use authorization to reflect administrative changes such as adjustment to the land use fees, inclusion of non-discretionary environmental standards or updating a special use authorization to bring it into conformance with current laws or regulations (for example, new monitoring required by water quality standards), and
          (ii) Issuance of a new special use authorization to reflect administrative changes such as, a change of ownership or control of previously authorized facilities or activities, or conversion of the existing special use authorization to a new type of special use authorization (for example, converting a permit to a lease or easement).
          (e) Categories of actions for which a project or case file and decision memo are required. A supporting record is required and the decision to proceed must be documented in a decision memo for the categories of action in paragraphs (e)(1) through (17) of this section. As a minimum, the project or case file should include any records prepared, such as: The names of interested and affected people, groups, and agencies contacted; the determination that no extraordinary circumstances exist; a copy of the decision memo; and a list of the people notified of the decision. If the proposed action is approval of a land management plan, plan amendment, or plan revision, the plan approval document required by 36 CFR part 219 satisfies the decision memo requirements of this section.
          (1) Construction and reconstruction of trails. Examples include, but are not limited to:
          (i) Constructing or reconstructing a trail to a scenic overlook, and
          (ii) Reconstructing an existing trail to allow use by handicapped individuals.
          (2) Additional construction or reconstruction of existing telephone or utility lines in a designated corridor. Examples include, but are not limited to:

          § 220.7
          Environmental assessment and decision notice.
          (a) Environmental assessment. An environmental assessment (EA) shall be prepared for proposals as described in § 220.4(a) that are not categorically excluded from documentation (§ 220.6) and for which the need of an EIS has not been determined (§ 220.5). An EA may be prepared in any format useful to facilitate planning, decisionmaking, and public disclosure as long as the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section are met. The EA may incorporate by reference information that is reasonably available to the public.
          (b) An EA must include the following:
          
          (1) Need for the proposal. The EA must briefly describe the need for the project.
          (2) Proposed action and alternative(s). The EA shall briefly describe the proposed action and alternative(s) that meet the need for action. No specific number of alternatives is required or prescribed.
          (i) When there are no unresolved conflicts concerning alternative uses of available resources (NEPA, section 102(2)(E)), the EA need only analyze the proposed action and proceed without consideration of additional alternatives.
          (ii) The EA may document consideration of a no-action alternative through the effects analysis by contrasting the impacts of the proposed action and any alternative(s) with the current condition and expected future condition if the proposed action were not implemented.
          (iii) The description of the proposal and alternative(s) may include a brief description of modifications and incremental design features developed through the analysis process to develop the alternatives considered. The documentation of these incremental changes to a proposed action or alternatives may be incorporated by reference in accord with 40 CFR 1502.21.
          (iv) The proposed action and one or more alternatives to the proposed action may include adaptive management. An adaptive management proposal or alternative must clearly identify the adjustment(s) that may be made when monitoring during project implementation indicates that the action is not having its intended effect, or is causing unintended and undesirable effects. The EA must disclose not only the effect of the proposed action or alternative but also the effect of the adjustment. Such proposal or alternative must also describe the monitoring that would take place to inform the responsible official whether the action is having its intended effect.
          (3) Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action and Alternative(s). The EA:
          (i) Shall briefly provide sufficient evidence and analysis, including the environmental impacts of the proposed action and alternative(s), to determine whether to prepare either an EIS or a FONSI (40 CFR 1508.9);
          (ii) Shall disclose the environmental effects of any adaptive management adjustments;
          (iii) Shall describe the impacts of the proposed action and any alternatives in terms of context and intensity as described in the definition of “significantly” at 40 CFR 1508.27;
          (iv) May discuss the direct, indirect, and cumulative impact(s) of the proposed action and any alternatives together in a comparative description or describe the impacts of each alternative separately; and
          (v) May incorporate by reference data, inventories, other information and analyses.
          (4) Agencies and Persons Consulted.
          (c) Decision notice. If an EA and FONSI have been prepared, the responsible official must document a decision to proceed with an action in a decision notice unless law or regulation requires another form of decision documentation (40 CFR 1508.13). A decision notice must document the conclusions drawn and the decision(s) made based on the supporting record, including the EA and FONSI. A decision notice must include:
          (1) A heading, which identifies the:
          (i) Title of document;
          (ii) Agency and administrative unit;
          (iii) Title of the project; and
          (iv) Location of the action, including county and State.
          (2) Decision and rationale;
          (3) Brief summary of public involvement;
          (4) A statement incorporating by reference the EA and FONSI if not combined with the decision notice;
          (5) Findings required by other laws and regulations applicable to the decision at the time of decision;
          (6) Expected implementation date;

          (7) Administrative review or appeal opportunities and, when such opportunities exist, a citation to the applicable regulations and directions on when and where to file a request for review or an appeal;
          (8) Contact information, including the name, address, and phone number of a contact person who can supply additional information; and
          (9) Responsible Official's signature, and the date the notice is signed.
          (d) Notification. The responsible official shall notify interested and affected parties of the availability of the EA, FONSI and decision notice, as soon as practicable after the decision notice is signed.

            Issuance of grazing and livestock use permits.
            (a) Unless otherwise specified by the Chief, Forest Service, all grazing and livestock use on National Forest System lands and on other lands under Forest Service control must be authorized by a grazing or livestock use permit.
            (b) Grazing permits and livestock use permits convey no right, title, or interest held by the United States in any lands or resources.
            (c) The Chief, Forest Service, is authorized to issue permits for livestock grazing and other use by livestock of the National Forest System and on other lands under Forest Service control as follows:
            (1) Grazing permits with priority for renewal may be issued as follows: On National Forests in the 16 contiguous western States 10-year term permits will be issued unless the land is pending disposal, or will be devoted to other uses prior to the end of ten years, or it will be in the best interest of sound land management to specify a shorter term. On National Forest System lands other than National Forests in the 16 contiguous western States, the permit term shall be for periods of 10 years or less. Term grazing permits for periods of 10 years or less in the form of grazing agreements may be issued to cooperative grazing associations or similar organizations incorporated or otherwise established pursuant to State law. Such an agreement will make National Forest System lands and improvements available to the association for grazing in accordance with provisions of the grazing agreement and Forest Service policies. Term permits authorized in this paragraph may be in the form of private land or on-and-off grazing permits where the person is qualified to hold such permits under provisions the Chief may require. Permits issued under this paragraph are subject to the following:
            (i) Except as provided for by the Chief, Forest Service, paid term permits will be issued to persons who own livestock to be grazed and such base property as may be required, provided the land is determined to be available for grazing purposes by the Chief, Forest Service, and the capacity exists to graze specified numbers of animals.
            (ii) A term permit holder has first priority for receipt of a new permit at the end of the term period provided he has fully complied with the terms and conditions of the expiring permit.
            (iii) In order to update terms and conditions, term permits may be cancelled at the end of the calendar year of the midyear of the decade (1985, 1995, etc.), provided they are reissued to the existing permit holder for a new term of 10 years.
            (iv) New term permits may be issued to the purchaser of a permittee's permitted livestock and/or base property, provided the permittee waives his term permit to the United States and provided the purchaser is otherwise eligible and qualified.
            (v) If the permittee chooses to dispose of all or part of his base property or permitted livestock (not under approved nonuse) but does not choose to waive his term permit, the Forest Supervisor will give written notice that he no longer is qualified to hold a permit, provided he is given up to one year to reestablish his qualifications before cancellation action is final.
            (vi) The Chief, Forest Service, shall prescribe provisions and requirements under which term permits will be issued, renewed, and administered, including:
            (A) The amount and character of base property and livestock the permit holder shall be required to own.
            (B) Specifying the period of the year the base property shall be capable of supporting permitted livestock.

            (i) Temporary grazing permits for periods not to exceed one year, and on a charge basis, may be issued:
            (A) To allow for use of range while a term grazing permit is held in suspension.
            (B) To use forage created by unusually favorable climatic conditions.
            (C) To use the forage available when the permit of the normal user's livestock is in nonuse status for reasons of personal convenience.
            (D) To allow a person to continue to graze livestock for the remainder of the grazing season where base property has been sold, the permit waived, and a new term permit issued.
            (E) To allow grazing use in the event of drought or other emergency of National or Regional scope where such use would not result in permanent resource damage.
            (ii) Livestock use permits for not to exceed one year may be issued under terms and conditions prescribed by the Chief, Forest Service, as follows:
            (A) Paid permits for transportation livestock to persons engaged in commercial packing, dude ranching, or other commercial enterprises which involve transportation livestock including mining, ranching, and logging, activities.

            § 222.50
            General procedures.
            (a) Fees shall be charged for all livestock grazing or livestock use of National Forest system lands, or other lands under Forest Service control. An exception is livestock authorized free of charge under provisions of § 222.3(c)(2)(ii) (B) through (G).
            (b) Guiding establishment of fees are the law and general governmental policy as established by Bureau of the Budget (now, Office of Management and Budget) Circular A-25 of September 23, 1959, which directs that a fair market value be obtained for all services and resources provided the public through establishment of a system of reasonable fee charges, and that the users be afford equitable treatment. This policy precludes a monetary consideration in the fee structure for any permit value that may be capitalized into the permit holder's private ranching operation.

            (c) A grazing fee shall be charged for each head month of livestock grazing or use. A head month is a month's use and occupancy of range by one animal, except for sheep or goats. A full head month's fee is charged for a month of grazing by adult animals; if the grazing animal is weaned or 6 months of age or older at the time of entering National Forest System lands; or will become 12 months of age during the permitted period of use. For fee purposes 5 sheep or goats, weaned or adult, are equivalent to one cow, bull, steer, heifer, horse, or mule.
            (d) No additional charge will be made for the privilege of lambing upon National Forest System lands, or other lands under Forest Service control.
            (e) Transportation livestock may be charged for at a special rate, and at a minimum established for such use. Fees for horses, mules, or burros associated with management of permitted livestock on an allotment, or for research purposes and administrative studies, and authorized on a charge basis, are determined under provisions of paragraph (b) of this section.
            (f) The fees for trailing livestock across National Forest System lands will conform with the rates established for other livestock. Where practicable, fees for trailing permitted livestock will be covered in the regular grazing fee and the crossing period covered in the regular grazing period.
            (g) All fees for livestock grazing or livestock use of National Forest System lands or other lands under Forest Service control are payable in advance of the opening date of the grazing period, entry, or livestock use unless otherwise authorized by the Chief, Forest Service.
            (h) Unauthorized grazing use rate will be determined by establishing a base value without giving consideration for those contributions normally made by the permittee under terms of the grazing permit. The base will be adjusted annually by the same indexes used to adjust the regular fee. This rate will also apply to excess number of livestock grazing by permittees; to livestock grazed outside the permitted grazing season; or to livestock grazed under an unvalidated permit.
            (i) Refunds or credits may be allowed under justifiable conditions and circumstances as the Chief, Forest Service, may specify.
            (j) The fee year for the purpose of charging grazing fees will be March 1 through the following February.
            (k) The data year for the purpose of collecting beef cattle price data for computing indexes will be November 1 through the following October and apply to the following fee year.

            § 222.51
            National Forests in 16 Western States.
            (a) Grazing fees are established on lands designated National Forests and Land Utilization Projects in the 16 contiguous Western States of Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. (National Grasslands are excluded, see § 222.52.)
            (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of § 222.50, paragraph (b), the calculated grazing fee for 1988 and subsequent grazing fee years represents the economic value of the use of the land to the user and is the product of multiplying the base fair market value of $1.23 by the result of the annual Forage Value Index, added to the sum of the Beef Cattle Price Index minus the Prices Paid Index and divided by 100; provided, that the annual increase or decrease in such fee for any given year shall be limited to not more than plus or minus 25 percent of the previous year's fee, and provided further, that the fee shall not be less than $1.35 per head per month. The indexes used in this formula are as follows:
            (1) Forage Value Index means the weighted average estimate of the annual rental charge per head per month for pasturing cattle on private rangelands in the 11 Western States (Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming) (computed by the National Agricultural Statistics Service) from the June Enumerative Survey) divided by $3.65 per head month and multiplied by 100;

            (2) Beef Cattle Price Index means the weighted average annual selling price for beef cattle (excluding calves) in the 11 Western States (Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming) (computed by the National Agricultural Statistics Service) for November through October (computed by the National Agricultural Statistics Service) divided by $22.04 per hundred weight and multiplied by 100; and

            (3) Prices Paid Index means the following selected components from the National Agricultural Statistics Service “Annual National Index of Prices Paid by Farmers for Goods and Services” adjusted by the weights indicated in parentheses to reflect livestock production costs in the Western States:
            
            
              1. Fuels and Energy (14.5);
              2. Farm and Motor Supplies (12.0);

              4. Tractors and Self-Propelled Machinery (4.5);
              5. Other Machinery (12.0);
              6. Building and Fencing Materials (14.5);
              7. Interest (6.0);
              8. Farm Wage Rates (14.0);

            § 222.53
            Grazing fees in the East—noncompetitive procedures.
            (a) Scope. Except as provided in § 222.54 of this subpart, the fee charged for commercial livestock grazing use and occupancy on National Forest System (NFS) lands in the States of New York, Missouri, Vermont, West Virginia, and in the Southern Region shall be determined through noncompetitive, fair market value procedures. These rules do not apply to grazing fees on National Forest System lands in Oklahoma or National Grasslands in Texas. Grazing permits under the noncompetitive fee method in the East are subject to the rules governing grazing permit administration in Subpart A of this part.
            (b) Applicability. The rules of this section apply to the establishment of grazing fees for existing permittees in the Eastern and Southern Regions on National Forest System lands, including grazing associations in New York and Missouri as of March 1, 1990, to any livestock on-and-off permits defined in Subpart A of this part; and to any allotments advertised for competitive bidding which were not bid on (§ 222.54(h)). Noncompetitive permits vacated or terminated by an existing permittee and any new allotments created after the effective date of this rule shall be offered on a competitive bid basis as specified in § 222.54 of this subpart. As provided in subpart A of this part, holders of term permits have first priority for receipt of a new permit.
            (c) Fee System. The grazing fee charged under this section shall be based on fair market value, as determined by: Using comparable private grazing lease rates, adjusted for the difference in the costs of grazing comparable private leased lands and National Forest System lands, or by reference to prevailing prices in competitive markets for other Federal or State leased grazing lands that are the same or substantially similar to grazing lands offered or administered by the Forest Service in the East with comparability adjustments as appropriate. Comparable grazing lease rates shall be adjusted for the difference between the total costs of operating on leased grazing lands and the total costs (other than grazing fee costs) of operating on National Forest System lands.
            (1) Establishing Base Grazing Value. (i) The Chief of the Forest Service, or an authorized officer to whom such authority has been delegated, shall determine an estimated base market value of grazing use and occupancy on National Forest System lands in the Eastern States for the following designated subregions:
            (A) Corn Belt (Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, and Ohio);
            (B) Lake States (Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin);
            (C) Northeast (Maine, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, and Vermont);
            (D) Appalachia (Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia);
            (E) Southeast/Delta (Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Texas); and
            (F) Florida.
            
            (ii) The Chief or authorized officer shall revise or update estimated market values of grazing use and occupancy, as necessary to respond to significant changes in the agricultural economy in the East, and to ensure that fees represent fair market value.
            (iii) The Chief, or an authorized officer to whom authority has been delegated, where sufficient market data exist, may establish the base grazing value for grazing allotments using comparable, local lease rates for private grazing lands.
            (2) Annual Adjustment of Base Grazing Value. To maintain currency with the private grazing lease market, the respective base grazing value(s) established for grazing permits under this section shall be annually adjusted through a hay price index, by respective subregion. The hay price index means the weighted average selling price of “other baled hay,” computed by the National Agricultural Statistics Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, by designated State and subregion. This index shall be based on 3-year average hay prices and annually reflect the percentage change in the cost of alternative livestock feed.
            (3) Computation of Annual Grazing Fee—(i) Annual Fee Basis. The annual grazing fee shall equal the base grazing value, adjusted by the current period's hay price index, less the value of any agency required range improvements.
            (ii) Grazing Fee Credits for Range Improvements. Any requirements for permittee construction or development of range improvements shall be identified through an agreement and incorporated into the grazing permit, with credits for such improvements to be allowed toward the annual grazing fee. Fee credits shall be allowed only for range improvements which the Forest Service requires an individual permittee to construct or develop on a specific allotment to meet the management direction and prescriptions in the relevant forest land and resource management plan and allotment management plan. These improvements must involve costs which the permittee would not ordinarily incur under the grazing permit, must be of tangible public benefit, and must enhance management of vegetation for resource protection, soil productivity, riparian, watershed, and wetland values, wildlife and fishery habitat, or outdoor recreation values. Maintenance of range improvements specified in allotment management planning documents or the grazing permit, and other costs incurred by the permittee in the ordinary course of permitted livestock grazing, do not qualify for grazing fee credits.
            (4) Implementation. The grazing fee formula provided by this section shall be used to calculate fees for the 1990 grazing fee year. Where implementation would raise fees, the increase shall be phased in over a 5-year period. Full fair market value will be reached in 5 years, beginning in 1990.

            § 222.54
            Grazing fees in the East—competitive bidding.
            (a) General Procedures—(1) Applicability. The rules of this section apply to grazing fees for any allotment established or vacated on National Forest System lands in the Eastern or Southern Regions, as of February 26, 1990 as well as to grazing fees for existing allotments for such lands that have already been established under competitive procedures as of the date of this rule. Permits offered for competitive bidding in the East are subject to the rules governing grazing permit administration in subpart A of this part. The rules of this section do not apply to negotiated livestock use permits or permits with on-and-off grazing provisions as authorized in subpart A of this part. Holders of term permits have first priority for receipt of a new term grazing permit in accordance with subpart A of this part. These rules also do not apply to grazing fees on National Forest System lands in Oklahoma or National Grasslands in Texas.
            (2) Allowable Bidders. Bids for grazing permits shall be accepted from individuals, partnerships, grazing associations (formed after February 26, 1990), joint ventures, corporations, and organizations.
            (b) Establishment of Minimum Bid Price. Authorized officers shall establish a minimum bid price for each available allotment as described in § 222.53 of this subpart.
            
            (c) Prospectus. (1) At such time as allotments are vacated, as new allotments are established, or as existing competitively bid permits expire, the authorized officer shall prepare and advertise a prospectus for those allotments on which grazing will be permitted.
            (2) The prospectus shall include the terms and conditions of occupancy and use under the grazing permit to be issued, as well as document existing improvements and their condition. The prospectus shall also disclose the following:
            (i) Estimated market value of the forage per head month of grazing use;
            (ii) The minimum bid price the agency will accept;
            (iii) Any required range improvements; and
            (iv) The minimum qualifications that applicants must meet to be eligible for a permit.
            (3) Copies of the applicable grazing permit, allotment management planning documents and allotment maintenance requirements, and the latest annual permittee instructions shall be made available to all prospective bidders upon request.
            (d) Submission of bid. Each applicant shall submit an application for the grazing permit, along with a sealed bid for the grazing fee, and a bid deposit of 10 percent of the total amount of the bid.
            (e) Qualifications and Deposit Refunds. Upon opening applicants bids, the authorized officer shall determine whether each bidder meets the qualifications to hold a permit as set forth in Subpart A of this part; and shall refund the deposit to any applicant who is not qualified or who does not offer the high bid.
            (f) Permit Issuance. The authorized officer shall issue the grazing permit to the qualified high bidder, except as provided in paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section. The successful bidder receives the privilege of obtaining or renewing a grazing permit and is billed for the occupancy offered and forage sold.
            (1) Priority for Reissuance. On allotments where a current permit is expiring and competition has been held on a new grazing permit, the current grazing permittee shall have priority for retaining the permit. Accordingly, an applicant who holds the permit on the allotment under bid, who has a satisfactory record of performance under that permit, and who is not the higher bidder for the future grazing privileges in the specified allotment shall be offered the opportunity to match the high bid and thereby retain the permit. Should there be more than one existing permittee in the allotment under bid, each shall be offered the option of meeting the high bid; if only one current permittee opts to meet the high bid, the remaining allowable grazing use, if any, shall be awarded to the initial high bidder.
            (2) Identical Bids. In cases of identical bids, the selection of the successful applicant shall be made through a drawing.
            (g) Computation of Successful Bidder's Annual Fee—(1) Annual Fee Basis. The highest bid received shall establish the base grazing value in the initial year of the grazing permit for each allotment offered. The annual grazing fee shall equal the base grazing value, adjusted by the current period's hay price index for the relevant subregion as described in § 222.53(c)(1), and (c)(3), less the value of any agency required range improvements. This hay price index shall be based on 3-year average hay prices and annually reflect the percent change in the cost of alternative livestock feed.
            (2) Grazing Fee Credits for Range Improvements. Any requirements for permittee construction or development of range improvements shall be identified through an agreement and incorporated into the grazing permit, with credits for such improvements to be allowed toward the annual grazing fee. Fee credits shall be allowed only for range improvements which the Forest Service requires an individual permittee to construct or develop on a specific allotment to meet the management direction and prescriptions in the relevant forest land and resource management plan and allotment management plan. These improvements must involve costs which the permittee would not ordinarily incur under the grazing permit, must be of tangible public benefit, and must enhance management of vegetation for resource protection, soil productivity, riparian, watershed, and wetland values, wildlife and fishery habitat, or outdoor recreation values. Maintenance of range improvements specified in allotment management planning documents or the grazing permit, and other costs incurred by the permittee in the ordinary course of permitted livestock grazing, do not qualify for grazing fee credits.
            (h) No Bids Received. If qualified sealed bids are not received, the authorized officer reserves the right to conduct an oral auction using the minimum bid price established under paragraph (b) of this section or to establish grazing fees through noncompetitive grazing fee procedures specified in § 222.53 of this subpart.

            § 222.62
            Ownership claims.
            (a) Any person claiming ownership under State branding and estray laws of branded or unbranded horses or burros within a wild horse or burro territory or range on the National Forest System where such animals are not authorized must present evidence of ownership to justify a roundup before permission will be granted to gather such animals. Claims of ownership with supporting evidence were required to be filed during a claiming period which expired November 15, 1973. Unauthorized privately owned horses or burros entering the National Forest System after November 15, 1973, which become intermingled with wild horses or burros, may be claimed by filing an application with the District Ranger. All authorizations to gather claimed animals shall be in writing in accordance with instructions as the Chief, Forest Service, may prescribe. After such public notice as an authorized officer deems appropriate to inform interested parties, gathering operations may be authorized. The authorization shall provide that the gathering or roundup be consistent with regulations, and will (1) establish a specific reasonable period of time to allow the gathering of claimed animals and (2) stipulate other conditions, including visual observation by Forest Service personnel deemed necessary to ensure humane treatment of associated wild free-roaming horses and burros and to protect other resources involved.
            (b) Prior to removal of claimed animals which have been captured from the National Forest System, claimants shall substantiate their claim of ownership in accordance with whatever criteria are cooperatively agreed to between the Forest Service and the State agency administering the State estray laws. In the absence of an agreement, ownership claims shall be substantiated in accordance with State law and subject to approval of the Forest Service.
          
          
            § 222.63
            Removal of other horses and burros.
            Horses and burros not within the definition in § 222.20(b)(13) which are introduced onto Wild Horse and Burro Territories or ranges after December 15, 1971, by accident, negligence, or willful disregard of private ownership, and which do not become intermingled with wild free-roaming horses or burros shall be considered as unauthorized livestock and treated in accordance with provisions in 36 CFR 261.7 and 262.10.

            § 222.64
            Use of helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft and motor vehicles.
            The Chief, Forest Service, is authorized to use helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft, and motor vehicles in a manner that will ensure humane treatment of wild free-roaming horses and burros as provided by the following paragraphs:
            (a) Prior to using helicopters in capture operations and/or using motor vehicles for the purpose of transporting captured animals, a public meeting will be held in the proximity of the territory where the capture operation is proposed.
            (b) Helicopters may be used in all phases of the administration of the Act including, but not limited to, inventory, observation, surveillance, and capture operations. In capture operations, helicopters may be used to locate the animals involved to assist ground crews in moving the animals and for related purposes, such as, to transport personnel and equipment. The condition of the animals shall be continuously observed by the authorized officer and, should signs of harmful stress be noted, the source of stress shall be removed so as to allow recovery. Helicopters may be used in round-ups or other capture operations subject to the following procedures.
            (1) Helicopters shall be used in such a manner that bands or herds will tend to remain together.

            (2) Horses or burros will not be moved at a rate which exceeds limitations set by the authorized officer who shall consider terrain, weather, distance to be traveled, and condition of the animals.
            
            (3) Helicopters shall be used to observe the presence of dangerous areas and may be used to move animals away from hazards during capture operations.
            (4) During capture operations, animals shall be moved in such a way as to prevent harmful stress or injury.
            (5) The authorized officer shall supervise all helicopter uses as follows:
            (i) Have means to communicate with the pilot and be able to direct the use of the helicopter; and
            (ii) Be able to observe effects of the use of the helicopters on the well-being of the animals.

            (c) Fixed-wing aircraft may be used for inventory, observation, and surveillance purposes necessary in administering the Act. Such use shall be consistent with the Act of September 8, 1959, as amended (18 U.S.C. 41 et seq.). Fixed-wing aircraft shall not be used in connection with capture operations except as support vehicles.
            (d) Motor vehicles may be used in the administration of the Act except that such vehicles shall not be used for driving or chasing wild horses or burros in capture operations. Motor vehicles may also be used for the purpose of transporting captured animals subject to the following humane procedures.
            (1) Such transportation shall comply with appropriate State and Federal laws and regulations applicable to humane transportation of horses and burros.
            (2) Vehicles shall be inspected by an authorized officer prior to use to ensure vehicles are in good repair and of adequate rate capacity.
            (3) Vehicles shall be carefully operated to ensure that captured animals are transported without undue risk or injury.
            (4) Where necessary and practical, animals shall be sorted as to age, temperament, sex, size, and condition so as to limit, to the extent possible, injury due to fighting and trampling.
            (5) The authorizing officer shall consider the condition of the animals, weather conditions, type of vehicle, and distance to be traveled when planning for transportation of captured animals.
            (6) Unless otherwise approved by the authorized officer, the transportation of wild free-roaming horses and burros shall be limited in sequence, to a maximum of 24 hours in transit followed by a minimum of 5 hours of on-the-ground rest with adequate feed and water.
          
          
            § 222.65
            Protection of wild free-roaming horses and burros when they are upon other than the National Forest System or public lands.
            Individual animals and herds of wild free-roaming horses and burros will be under the protection of the Chief, Forest Service, even though they may thereafter move to lands of other ownership or jurisdiction as a part of their annual territorial habitat pattern or for other reasons. The Chief will exercise surveillance of these animals through the use of cooperative agreements and as otherwise authorized by law and act immediately through appropriate administrative or criminal and civil judicial procedures to provide them the protective measures of the Act at any time he has cause to believe its provisions are being violated.
          
          
            § 222.66
            Removal of wild free-roaming horses and burros from private lands.
            Owners of land upon which wild free-roaming horses and burros have strayed from the National Forest System may request their removal by calling the nearest office of either the Forest Service or Federal Marshall.
          
          
            § 222.67
            Maintenance of wild free-roaming horses and burros on privately-owned lands.
            Owners of land who wish to maintain wild free-roaming horses and burros which have strayed onto their lands from the National Forest System may do so by notifying the nearest office of the Forest Service in a timely fashion and providing such information on a continuing basis as the Chief, Forest Service, may require. Such owners shall protect the wild free-roaming horses and burros on their lands. They may not, in so maintaining these animals, impede their return to National Forest System lands unless authorized by agreement with the Forest Service.
          
          
            § 222.68
            Agreements.

            The Chief, Forest Service, may enter into agreements as he deems necessary to further the protection, management, and control of wild free-roaming horses and burros.
          
          
            § 222.69
            Relocation and disposal of animals.
            (a) The Chief, Forest Service, shall, when he determines over-population of wild horses and burros exists and removal is required, take immediate necessary action to remove excess animals from that particular territory. Such action shall be taken until all excess animals have been removed so as to restore a thriving natural ecological balance to the range, and protect the range from deterioration associated with over-population.
            (b) No person except an authorized Forest Service officer or his agent shall destroy, remove, or relocate any wild free-roaming horse or burro located on the National Forest System.
            (c) Wild horses and burros shall be relocated or removed in the following order of priority:
            (1) In the most humane manner possible, sick, lame, or old animals shall be destroyed;
            (2) Relocate animals to other National Forest System lands which were identified as 1971 wild horse or burro territory, providing suitable habitat exists and relocation of animals will not jeopardize vegetation condition;
            (3) Relocate animals to other federally-owned lands which were identified as 1971 wild horse or burro occupied lands, providing suitable habitat exists and relocation of animals will not jeopardize vegetation condition and animals are requested by the appropriate land manager having jurisdiction;
            (4) Place animals under private maintenance and care agreements where there is an adoption demand by qualified individuals, groups, or Government agency, and for which there is assurance of humane treatment and care, provided not more than four animals are placed under private maintenance and care agreements per year to any individual, organization, or government agency unless there is a determination expressed otherwise in writing, by an authorized Forest Service Officer; and
            (5) Excess animals, for which an adoption demand by qualified applicants does not exist, shall be destroyed in the most humane manner possible, and if several methods are equally humane, select the most cost efficient.
            (d) Where excess animals have been placed under private maintenance and care agreements after December 15, 1971, as provided for in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, and animals have been provided humane conditions, treatment, and care, for a period of one year, the Chief, Forest Service, may grant title to not more than four animals per year to each individual, organization, or government agency.
            (e) The applicants must make written application for title and/or adoption, must be of legal age in the State in which they reside, and must pay fees for adoption and transportation as follows:
            (1) The application must be accompanied by a nonrefundable advance payment of $25 by guaranteed remittance. If custody of a wild, free-roaming horse or burro is granted by the authorized Forest Service officer, the advance payment shall be applied against the adoption fee required to be paid at the time the maintenance and care agreement § 222.29(c)(4) is executed.
            (2) The Forest Service shall charge an adoption fee of $125 for each horse and $75 for each burro, except that there shall be no adoption fee for an unweaned offspring under 6 months of age accompanying its mother.
            (3) Any transportation costs incurred for the transportation of the animal(s) to the point of pickup must be paid before an approved individual, group, or government agency takes custody of the animal(s).
            (f) Humane conditions, treatment, and care must have been provided for no less that one year preceding the filing of the application for title. The conveyance of title shall include a written statement by an authorized officer attesting that the animal is in good condition.

            Authority to sell timber.
            Trees, portions of trees, and other forest products on National Forest System lands may be sold for the purpose of achieving the policies set forth in the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960, as amended (74 Stat. 215; 16 U.S.C. 528-531), and the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974, as amended (88 Stat. 476; as amended, 16 U.S.C. 1600-1614), and the Program thereunder.
          
          
            § 223.2
            Disposal of timber for administrative use.
            Trees, portions of trees, or other forest products in any amount on National Forest System lands may be disposed of for administrative use, by sale or without charge, as may be most advantageous to the United States, subject to the maximum cut fixed in accordance with established policies for management of the National Forests. Such administrative use shall be limited to the following conditions and purposes:
            (a) For construction, maintenance or repair of roads, bridges, trails, telephone lines, fences, recreation areas or other improvements of value for the protection or the administration of Federal lands.
            (b) For fuel in Federal camps, buildings and recreation areas.
            (c) For research and demonstration projects.
            (d) For use in disaster relief work conducted by public agencies.
            (e) For disposal when removal is desirable to protect or enhance multiple-use values in a particular area.
          
          
            § 223.3
            Sale of seized material.
            Seized material (trees, portions of trees or other forest products cut in trespass from National Forest System lands) may be sold to the highest bidder under specific authorization from the Regional Forester. If advertisement is impractical, sales of material with an appraised value of less than $10,000 will be made on informal bids.
          
          
            § 223.4
            Exchange of trees or portions of trees.
            Trees or portions of trees may be exchanged for land under laws authorizing the exchange of National Forest timber. Cutting of exchange timber must comply with the purposes cited in § 223.1.

            § 223.5
            Scope of free use granted to individuals.

            (a) Free use may be granted to individuals for firewood for personal use, except that such use may be limited to bona fide settlers, miners, residents and prospectors living within or immediately adjacent to the National Forest when the available supply is insufficient to meet the total demand. Free use may be granted to such bona fide settlers, miners, residents and prospectors for minerals, for fencing, building, mining, prospecting and domestic purposes.
            
            (Sec. 1, 30 Stat. 35, as amended; 16 U.S.C. 477, 551)
            
            (b) Free use will be granted individuals primarily to aid in the protection and silvicultural improvement of the forests. Except in unusual cases, the material will be restricted to dead, insect-infested, or diseased timber, logging debris, and thinnings. Other material may be granted in unusual cases where its refusal would cause unwarranted hardship. Where limited supply or other conditions justify such action, the free use of green material may be refused.
          
          
            § 223.6
            Cutting and removal of timber in free-use areas.

            Supervisors may designate portions or all of a National Forest as free-use areas where such action is compatible with land management plans and shall give public notice of their action. Within such free-use areas, any dead timber or any green timber previously marked or designated by forest officers may be cut and removed for personal use for domestic purposes. Cutting and removal of timber in free-use areas shall be in accordance with such rules as may be prescribed by the district ranger to prevent fires, minimize damage to uncut trees and other resources, and to avoid confusion among users.
            [42 FR 28252, June 2, 1977, as amended at 44 FR 73029, Dec. 17, 1979. Redesignated at 49 FR 2760, Jan. 23, 1984]
          
          
            § 223.7
            Permission for free use of timber outside free-use areas.
            Similar material may be cut outside of a free-use area without permit in cases of emergency, but the person taking such material shall promptly notify the district ranger. Small quantities of material needed by transients while in the forest may also be taken without permit; subject to such rules as may be prescribed pursuant to § 261.70. In all other cases permits will be required for green material.
          
          
            § 223.8
            Delegations of authority to approve free use by individuals.
            (a) Forest officers whom the supervisor may designate are authorized to grant free use of timber to individuals up to $200 in value in any one fiscal year. Supervisors may grant permits for material not exceeding $5,000 in value. Regional Foresters may approve permits for larger amounts, and in times of emergency may delegate authority to supervisors for not over $10,000 in value. Prior review by the Chief of the Forest Service will be given if the amount involved exceeds $10,000 in value.
            (b) Regional Foresters may authorize supervisors to permit the removal of specific classes of material without scaling or measurement.
            [42 FR 28252, June 2, 1977. Redesignated at 49 FR 2760, Jan. 23, 1984, as amended at 71 FR 525, Jan. 4, 2006]
          
          
            § 223.9
            Free use to owners of certain mining claims.
            Free use will be granted to an owner of a mining claim located subsequent to July 23, 1955, or of a mining claim which is otherwise subject to Section 4 of the Act of July 23, 1955 (69 Stat. 367), if at any time said claim owner requires more timber for his mining operations, in connection with that claim, than is available on that claim because of Forest Service timber disposal therefrom subsequent to location of that claim. He will be granted, free of charge, timber from the nearest National Forest land which is ready for harvesting under the applicable management plan, substantially equivalent in kind and quantity to that estimated by the Forest Service to have been cut under Forest Service authorization from the claim subsequent to its location, Forest officers may be delegated authority to grant amounts of timber not in excess of those which these officers are authorized to sell in commercial sales.

            Free use to Alaskan settlers, miners, residents, and prospectors.
            Bona fide settlers, miners, residents, and prospectors for minerals in Alaska may take free of charge green or dried timber from the National Forests in Alaska for personal use but not for sale. Permits will be required for green saw timber. Other material may be taken without permit. The amount of material granted to any one person in 1 year shall not exceed 10,000 board feet of saw timber and 25 cords of wood, or an equivalent volume in other forms. Persons obtaining materials shall, on demand, forward to the supervisor a statement of the quantity taken and the location from which it was removed.

            § 223.11
            Free use to other Federal agencies.

            (a) National Forest timber will be granted free of charge to other branches of the Federal Government when authorized by law. Permits may be approved by forest officers for amounts not greater than they are otherwise authorized to sell.
            (b) Permits for timber issued hereunder shall be in accordance with the conditions prescribed in § 223.30. The permittee may be required to report to the supervisor the amount of timber, by species, actually cut or may be required to furnish scalers for work under the direction of the forest officers in charge or, if authorized, to provide funds for the employment by the Forest Service of scalers to scale or measure the timber cut. The permittee may be required to dispose of the slash as cutting proceeds, or to employee people to work under the direction of a forest officer in disposing of the slash, or, if authorized, to provide funds for the employment of people for slash disposal under the direction of a forest officer.

            Permission to cut, damage, or destroy trees without advertisement.
            Permission may be granted to cut, damage, or destroy trees, portions of trees, or other forest products on National Forest System lands without advertisement when necessary for the occupancy of a right-of-way or other authorized use of National Forest System land. Payment for timber of merchantable size and quality will be required at its appraised value, but at not less than applicable minimum prices established by Regional Foresters, and payment will be required for young growth timber below merchantable size at its damage appraisal value. Payment will not be required:
            (a) For timber necessarily killed or cut in connection with land uses which are of substantial benefit to the National Forests;
            (b) For timber necessarily killed or cut and used by the permittee which would have been granted free under other applicable regulations; or
            (c) For timber which will be cut by the permittee which the Forest Service retains for sale in log or other product form.

            Compliance.
            Forest officers authorizing free use shall ensure that such use is in compliance with applicable land management plans and is conducted in a manner which protects National Forest System resource values.

            § 223.14
            Where timber may be cut.
            (a) The cutting of trees, portions of trees or other forest products may be authorized on any National Forest System lands, except for:
            (1) Timber reserved by a grantor of land, during the life of such reservation.
            (2) Timber reserved from cutting under other regulations.
            (3) Timber on unpatented mining claims located prior to July 23, 1955, unless the claimant has executed a waiver pursuant to section 6 of the Act of July 23, 1955 (69 Stat. 367), or unless pursuant to a proceeding under Section 5 of that Act, the claimant has failed to file a verified statement or has failed to establish the validity and effectiveness of his asserted rights.
            (4) Timber on lands identified in land management plans as not suited for timber production, except that salvage sales or sales necessitated to protect other multiple-use values may be made.
            (b) The cutting of timber on mining claims shall be conducted in such manner as not to endanger or materially interfere with prospecting, mining or processing operations.
            (c) Timber on an unpatented claim to which the United States does not otherwise have disposal rights may be disposed of with the written consent of the claimant, or, in emergencies without the consent of the claimant.

            (d) Timber on an unpatented claim may be cut by the claimant only for the actual development of the claim or for uses consistent with the purposes for which the claim was entered. Any severance or removal of timber, other than severance or removal to provide clearance, shall be in accordance with plan of operations required by Part 252 of this chapter, and with sound principles of forest management.
            
            (e) With prior approval by the Regional Forester, timber on lands under option by the United States or on offered lands included in an approved land exchange agreement may be sold. Before the sale is made, a cooperative agreement must be made with the owner of the land authorizing the Forest Service to conduct the sale and providing for return of stumpage receipts to the owner if title to the land is not accepted by the United States.
            (f) With prior approval by the Regional Forester, cutting of exchange timber described in § 223.4 may be authorized in advance of the acceptance of title to the non-Federal land offered in exchange.
          
          
            § 223.15
            Provision of trees, portions of trees, or forest products to Indian tribes for traditional and cultural purposes.
            (a) Pursuant to section 8105 of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (Pub. L. 110-246, 122 Stat. 1651) [hereinafter the “2008 Farm Bill”], Regional Foresters or designated Forest Officers may, at their discretion, provide trees, portions of trees, or forest products to Indian tribes free of charge for traditional and cultural purposes provided that:
            (1) The trees, portions of trees, or forest products are provided to tribal officials on behalf of an Indian tribe for traditional and cultural purposes; and
            (2) The trees, portions of trees, or forest products will not be used for commercial purposes.
            (b) The following definitions apply to this section:
            
              Indian tribe. The term “Indian tribe” means any Indian or Alaska Native tribe, band, nation, pueblo, village, or other community the name of which is included on a list published by the Secretary of the Interior pursuant to section 104 of the Federally Recognized Indian Tribe List Act of 1994 (25 U.S.C. 479a-1).
            
              Traditional and cultural purpose. The term “traditional and cultural purpose,” with respect to a definable use, area, or practice, means that the use, area, or practice is identified by an Indian tribe as traditional or cultural because of the long-established significance or ceremonial nature of the use, area, or practice to the Indian tribe.
            
              Tribal officials: The term “tribal officials” means elected or duly appointed officials of Indian tribal governments.
            (c) Requests for trees, portions of trees, or forest products made under this section must be submitted to the local Forest Service District Ranger's Office(s) in writing. Requests may be made:
            (1) Directly by a tribal official(s) who has been authorized by the Indian tribe to make such requests; or
            (2) By providing a copy of a formal resolution approved by the tribal council or other governing body of the Indian tribe.
            (d) Requests for trees, portions of trees, and forest products made under this section must be directed to the appropriate Forest Service District Ranger(s)' Office from which the items are being requested. Tribal officials are encouraged to explain their requests to the Regional Forester or designated Forest Officer and, if necessary, describe how the request fits a traditional and cultural purpose. When an Indian tribe requests forest products located on two or more National Forests, authorized tribal officials should notify each of the affected Forest Service District Ranger's Offices of the requests made on other forests.
            (e) Agency Line Officers and managers (who have been authorized by name through official Forest Service correspondence) are authorized to provide trees, portions of trees, and forest products under this section subject to the following limitations:
            (1) District Rangers and Forest Officers may provide material not exceeding $25,000 in value in any one fiscal year to an Indian tribe;

            (3) Regional Foresters may provide material not exceeding $100,000 in value in any one fiscal year to an Indian tribe; and

            (4) The Chief of the Forest Service may provide material exceeding $100,000 in value to an Indian tribe.
            
            (f) A request for trees, portions of trees, or forest products under this section may be conditioned or denied for reasons including, but not limited to the following:
            (1) Protecting public health and safety;
            (2) Preventing interference with Forest Service and/or commercial operations;
            (3) Complying with Federal and State laws and regulations;
            (4) Ensuring sustainability; or
            (5) Otherwise protecting National Forest System land and resources.
            (g) All decisions made under this section must comply with the National Forest Management Act, relevant land management plans, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act, all other applicable laws and regulations, and are subject to tribal treaty and other reserved rights and the savings provisions of the Cultural and Heritage Cooperation Authority (25 U.S.C. 3057(b)).

              § 223.32
              Timber sale operating plan.
              Sale contracts with a term of 2 years or more shall provide for the filing of an operating plan as soon as practicable after execution of the contract, such plan shall be a part of the contract. The plan of operation shall be general in nature, outlining the expected timing and order of sale development, including such major operations as road construction, felling and removal of timber, distribution of timber, and contractual requirements for erosion prevention and slash disposal.

              Volume determination.
              (a) Timber sale contracts may provide for volume determination by scaling, measuring, weighing, or counting the logs or other products, or by measuring the trees before cutting. If the contract or permit provides for the determination of volume by tree measurement and the timber has been paid for, the marking or otherwise designating of the tree authorizes cutting and removal. Otherwise no timber cut under any contract shall be removed from the place designated until it has been scaled, measured or counted as provided in the timber sale contract, unless such removal is specifically authorized in the contract.
              (b) National Forest timber sold on board foot scale shall be scaled by the Scribner Decimal C Log Rule, or if the advertisement and contract or permit so state, by the International 1/4-inch log rule or by the International 1/4-inch Decimal log rule. National Forest timber may also be sold by the cubic volume rule or by cords, each as used by the Forest Service.
            
            
              § 223.37
              Revegetation of temporary roads.
              Timber sale contracts, permits and other documents authorizing the cutting or removal of timber or forest products shall require the purchaser to treat temporary roads constructed or used thereunder so as to permit the reestablishment by artificial or natural means, or vegetative cover on the roadway and areas where the vegetative cover was disturbed by the construction or use of the road, as necessary to minimize erosion from the disturbed area. Such treatment shall be designed to reestablish vegetative cover as soon as practicable, but at least within 10 years after the termination of the contract.
            
            
              § 223.38
              Standards for road design and construction.
              Road construction authorized under timber sale contracts, permits and other documents authorizing the cutting or removal of timber or forest products shall be designed to standards appropriate for the intended uses, considering safety, cost of transportation, and impacts on land and resources. If the sale contract provides for road design standards in excess of those needed for the harvest and removal of timber from that sale, including measures to protect adjacent resource values, provision shall be made in the contract for compensating the purchaser for the additional costs, unless the purchaser elects Government construction under section 14(i) of the National Forest Management Act of 1976.

              Timber sale contracts, permits, and other such instruments, authorizing the harvesting of trees or other forest products, with terms of longer than 2 years, shall provide for cancellation in order to prevent serious environmental damage or when they are significantly inconsistent with land management plans adopted or revised in accordance with section 6 of the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974, as amended. Such provision shall provide for reasonable compensation to the purchaser for unrecovered costs incurred under the contract and for the difference between the current contract value and the average value of comparable National Forest timber sold during the preceding 6-month period.
            
            
              § 223.41
              Payment when purchaser elects government road construction.

              Each contract having a provision for construction of specified roads with total estimated construction costs of $50,000 or more shall include a provision to ensure that if the purchaser elects government road construction, the purchaser shall pay, in addition to the price paid for the timber or other forest products, an amount equal to the estimated cost of the roads.

For sales made prior to January 1, 1978, the calculation shall be made as of December 31, 1977, except that if the amount actually transferred in as of December 31, 1977, exceeds the calculated limit, the actual transfers as of that date shall be the established limit. Purchaser credit earned on a sale and subsequently transferred out may be replaced without regard to the transfer in limit. Sale area improvement needs shall be based on the original sale area betterment plan or revisions thereto approved prior to July 1, 1976. Salvage sale fund needs shall be based on the original salvage sale fund plan.

              As used in §§ 223.42 and 223.43, the term Purchaser includes any single individual, corporation, company, firm, partnership, joint venture, or other business entity or the successor in interest of any of the foregoing business entities having timber sale contracts on the same National Forest. The term National Forest shall be considered as a unit of the National Forest System, regardless of how it was established, which maintains a separate identity with respect to the distribution of receipts earned thereon to the States and counties. The term Effective Purchaser Credit means unused purchaser credit which does not exceed current contract value minus base rate value. The term base rate value is the sum of the products of base rates and estimated remaining unscaled (unreported on tree measurement contracts) volumes by species of timber included in a timber sale contract.

              § 223.49
              Downpayments.
              (a) For the purposes of this section, the terms listed in this paragraph shall have the following meaning:
              (1) Total bid value is the sum of the products obtained by multiplying the rate the purchaser bid for each species by the estimated volume listed in the contract.
              (2) Bid premium is the amount in excess of the advertised value that a purchaser bids for timber offered.
              
              (3) Lump sum timber sales are premeasured sales where the entire value of the sale is paid in one payment at time of release for cutting.
              (4) Affiliate. Concerns or individuals are affiliates if directly or indirectly, either one controls or has the power to control the other, or a third party controls or has the power to control both. In determining whether or not affiliation exists, the Forest Service shall consider all appropriate factors, including, but not limited to, common ownership, common management, and contractual relationships.
              (b) Timber sale contracts shall include provisions that require purchasers to make a downpayment in cash at the time a timber sale contract is executed, except that a downpayment is not required for stewardship contracts unless the contracting officer determines that a downpayment is needed to ensure the government's financial security.
              (c) The minimum downpayment shall be equivalent to 10 percent of the total advertised value of each sale, plus 20 percent of the bid premium, except in those geographic areas where the Chief of the Forest Service determines that it is necessary to increase the amount of the downpayment in order to deter speculation. The amount of the downpayment shall be redetermined when contract rates for timber are redetermined under the terms of the contract for environmental modification; catastrophic damage; market change; or an emergency rate redetermination. For the purpose of recalculating the minimum downpayment, total advertised value shall be replaced with total redetermined value.
              (d) A purchaser cannot apply the amount deposited as a downpayment to cover other obligations due on that sale until:
              (1) On scaled sales, stumpage value representing 25 percent of the total bid value of the sale has been charged and paid for, or the estimated value of unscaled timber is equal to or less than the amount of the downpayment; or
              (2) On tree measurement sales, stumpage value representing 25 percent of the total bid value of the sale is shown on the timber sale statement of account to have been cut, removed, and paid for, or the estimated value of timber remaining to be cut, removed and paid for as shown on the timber sale statement of account is equal to or less than the amount of the downpayment. On lump sum sales, the downpayment amount may be applied to payment for release of the single payment unit.
              (e) A purchaser or any affiliate of that purchaser awarded a Forest Service timber sale contract must meet the additional downpayment requirements of paragraph (g) of this section under the following circumstances:
              (1) The purchaser or its affiliate after September 29, 1988, has failed to perform in accordance with the terms of a Forest Service or Bureau of Land Management timber sale contract and is notified by a Contracting Officer that a contract has expired uncompleted or is terminated for cause; and
              (2) The estimated value of the unscaled timber on scaled sales, or the estimated value of the timber outstanding on tree measurement sales, included in those terminated or expired contracts exceeds $100,000; and
              (3) Unpaid damages claimed by the Government remain outstanding prior to award of the new sale at issue and corrective action has not been taken to avoid future deficient performance.
              (f) A subsequent final determination by the Contracting Officer or by a court of competent jurisdiction that a contract was improperly classified under the criteria in paragraph (e) of this section will result in the refund or credit of any unobligated portion of the amount of downpayment exceeding that required by paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section and the limitations of paragraph (h) of this section on application of downpayment shall no longer apply.

              (g) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, a purchaser meeting the criteria of paragraph (e) of this section must make a minimum downpayment equal to 20 percent of the total advertised value of that sale, plus 40 percent of the total bid premium. This higher downpayment requirement applies throughout the National Forest System, except in those areas where the Chief of the Forest Service determines, before advertisement of the sale, that another downpayment rate is necessary to achieve the management objectives of the National Forest System. The amount of the downpayment shall be redetermined in accordance with this paragraph when contract rates for timber are redetermined under the terms of the contract for environmental modification; catastrophic damage; market change; or an emergency rate redetermination. For the purpose of redetermining the downpayment, total advertised value shall be replaced with total redetermined value.
              (h) A purchaser subject to the additional downpayment requirements of paragraph (g) of this section cannot apply the amount deposited as a downpayment to other uses until:
              (1) On scaled sales, the estimated value of the unscaled timber is equal to or less than the amount of the downpayment; or
              (2) On tree measurement sales, the estimated value remaining to be cut and removed as shown on the timber sale statement of account is equal to or less than the amount of the downpayment.
              (i) For the purpose of releasing funds deposited as downpayment by a purchaser subject to paragraph (f) of this section, the Forest Service shall compute the estimated value of timber as follows:
              (1) On scaled sales, the estimated value of the unscaled timber is the sum of the products obtained by multiplying the current contract rate for each species by the difference between the advertised volume and the volume that has been scaled of that species.

              (2) On tree measurement sales, the estimated value of the timber outstanding (i.e., not shown on the timber sale statement of account as cut and removed) is the sum of the products obtained by multiplying the current contract rate for each species by the difference between the advertised volume and the volume that has been shown on the timber sale statement to have been cut and removed of the species. The current contract rate for each species is that specified in the Forest Service timber sale contract.
              (j) In order to deter speculation, the Chief of the Forest Service may increase the period for retention of the downpayment and/or preclude temporary reduction of the downpayment under paragraphs (k)(2) and (k)(3) of this section for future contracts subject to such criteria as the Chief may adopt after giving the public notice and opportunity to comment.
              (k) The Forest Service may temporarily reduce the downpayment when a purchaser's scheduled operations are delayed, interrupted, or extended for 30 or more consecutive days for any of the following reasons:
              (1) Forest Service requests or orders purchaser to delay or interrupt operations for reasons other than breach;
              (2) A contract term addition pursuant to purchaser shifting operations to a sale designated by the Forest Service as in urgent need of harvesting; or
              (3) An extension of the contract term authorized upon a determination of substantial overriding public interest, including a market-related contract term addition, or an urgent removal contract term extension under 36 CFR 223.53.
              (l) When purchaser is not cutting or removing timber under contract during a qualifying period of delay, interruption, or extension listed in paragraph (k) of this section, the downpayment may be reduced to $1000 or 2 percent of the downpayment amount stated in the contract, whichever is greater. The purchaser must restore the downpayment to the full amount stated in the contract within 15 days from receipt of the bill for collection and written notice from the contracting officer that the basis for temporarily reducing the downpayment no longer exists. Purchaser shall not cut or remove timber on a contract where the downpayment has been temporarily reduced until the downpayment amount stated in the contract is fully restored.

              § 223.50
              Periodic payments.
              (a) For the purposes of this section, the following terms have the meaning given:
              (1) Total contract value is the product of the estimated volume of the sale multiplied by the rates bid by the purchaser. Total contract value excludes required deposits and is determined at bid date.
              
              (2) Current contract value is the sum of the products of the current contract rates and, in a scaled sale, estimated remaining unscaled volume or, in a tree measurement sale, the estimated remaining quantities by species of included timber meeting utilization standards.
              (3) Normal operating season is the period so specified in a timber sale contract.
              (4) Periodic payment(s) is/are amount(s) specified in a timber sale contract that a purchaser must pay by the periodic payment determination date(s) unless reduced by amounts paid as stumpage for volume removed.
              (5) A periodic payment determination date is a date specified in a timber sale contract upon which the Forest Service will compare the payments made by the timber sale purchaser for timber charges (stumpage), exclusive of required deposits, with the periodic payment amount required as of that date in the contract.
              (b) Except for lump sum sales, each timber sale contract of more than one full normal operating season shall provide for periodic payments. The number of periodic payments required will be dependent upon the number of normal operating seasons within the contract, but shall not exceed two such payments during the course of the contract. Periodic payments must be made by the periodic payment determination date, except that the amount of the periodic payment shall be reduced to the extent that timber has been removed and paid for by the periodic payment determination date. Should the payment fall due on a date other than normal billing dates, the contract shall provide that the payment date will be extended to coincide with the next timber sale statement of account billing date.
              (1) At a minimum, each such contract shall require an initial periodic payment at the midpoint between the specified road completion date and the termination date. If there is no road construction requirement, payment shall be due at the midpoint between award date and the termination date.
              (2) Contracts exceeding 2 full operating seasons shall require an additional periodic payment to be due no later than the midpoint of the last normal operating season or 12 months from the initial periodic payment whichever date is first.
              (3) Notwithstanding this paragraph (b), periodic payments are not required for stewardship contracts unless the contracting officer determines that periodic payments are needed to ensure the Government's financial security.
              (c) Each timber sale contract shall require the initial periodic payment to equal 35 percent of the total contract value or 50 percent of the bid premium, whichever is greater. The amount of this periodic payment will be reduced if the payment would result in the purchaser's credit balance for timber charges exceeding the current contract value.
              (d) Where an additional periodic payment is required by the timber sale contract, this payment will equal 75 percent of the total contract value. The amount of this periodic payment will be reduced if the payment would result in the purchaser's credit balance for timber charges exceeding the current contract value.
              (e) Dates for determining future periodic payments shall be adjusted as follows:
              (1) When contract term adjustments are granted under § 223.46,
              (2) When market-related contract term additions are granted under § 223.52,
              (3) When urgent removal extensions are granted under § 223.53, or
              (4) When extensions in the substantial overriding public interest are granted under § 223.115(b). Periodic payment determination dates shall not be adjusted when a contract term extension is granted under the general authority of § 223.115(a).

              (f) The amount of any periodic payment(s) not yet reached shall be revised when rates are redetermined under the contract. The revised periodic payment amounts shall be based on a recalculated total contract value using the same procedures described in (c) and (d) of this section. The recalculated total contract value is the current contract value following the rate redetermination plus:
              
              (1) The total value of timber scaled prior to establishing redetermined rates in a scaled sale; or
              (2) The total value of timber shown on the timber sale statement of account as having been cut, removed and paid for.

              Bid monitoring.
              Each Regional Forester shall monitor bidding patterns on timber sales to determine if speculative bidding is occurring or if Purchasers are bidding in such a way that they would be unable to perform their obligations under the timber sale contract. A Regional Forester shall propose to the Chief changes in service wide timber sale procedures, as they appear necessary, to discourage speculative bidding.

              § 223.52
              Market-related contract term additions.
              (a) Contract provision. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, each timber sale contract exceeding 1 year in length shall contain a provision for the addition of time to the contract term, under the following conditions:
              (i) The Chief of the Forest Service has determined that adverse wood products market conditions have resulted in a drastic reduction in wood product prices applicable to the sale; and
              (ii) The purchaser makes a written request for additional time to perform the contract.
              (2) The contract term addition provision of the contract must specify the index to be applied to each sale. The Forest Supervisor shall determine and select from paragraph (b) of this section, the index to be used for each sale based on the species and product characteristics, by volume, being harvested on the sale. The index specified shall represent more than one-half of the advertised volume. If none of the indices in paragraph (b) of this section represent more than one-half of the advertised volume, the index specified shall represent the species product combination representing the highest percentage of volume for which there is an index. When the Forest Supervisor determines that the species and potential product characteristics are such that more than one index could be used, the prospectus will state that the Contracting Officer may, upon the purchaser's written request, select an alternative index from paragraph (b) of this section, and may modify the contract by mutual agreement, at time of contract execution, to include an alternative index that the Contracting Officer has determined represents the highest percentage of products the purchaser intends to produce or have produced from the sale. Purchasers seeking a change of index at time of award must substantiate the need for an alternative index by providing the Contracting Officer with a written request that includes a list of products by volume the purchaser intends to produce or expects will be produced from the timber on that sale. In the event a mutual agreement to modify a contract to include an alternative index is not reached at time of contract execution, the index specified in the sample contract shall apply.
              (3) A market-related contract term addition provision shall not be included in contracts where the primary management objective requires prompt removal of the timber, such as, timber is subject to rapid deterioration, timber is in a wildland-urban interface area, or hazard trees adjacent to developed sites.
              (b) Determination of drastic wood product price reductions. (1) The Forest Service shall monitor and use Producer Price Indices, as prepared by the Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), adjusted to a constant dollar base, to determine if market-related contract term additions are warranted.
              (i) The Forest Service shall monitor and use only the following indices:
              
                
                  BLS producer price index
                  Indexseries

              (ii) Preliminary index values will be revised when final index values become available, however, determination of a qualifying quarter will not be revised when final index values become available.
              (2) For PPI index codes 0811 and 0812, the Chief of the Forest Service shall determine that a drastic reduction in wood prices has occurred when, for any 2 or more consecutive qualifying quarters, the applicable adjusted price index is less than 88.5 percent of the average of such index for the 4 highest of the 8 calendar quarters immediately prior to the qualifying quarter. A qualifying quarter is a quarter, following the contract award date, where the applicable adjusted index is more than 11.5 percent below the average of such index for the 4 highest of the previous 8 calendar quarters. For PPI index code 3211135, the Chief of the Forest Service shall determine that a drastic reduction in wood prices has occurred when, for any 2 or more consecutive qualifying quarters, the adjusted price index is less than 85 percent of the average of such index for the 4 highest of the 8 calendar quarters immediately prior to the qualifying quarter. A qualifying quarter is a quarter, following the contract award date, where the adjusted index is more than 15 percent below the average of such index for the 4 highest of the previous eight calendar quarters. Qualifying quarter determinations will be made using the Producer Price Indices for the months of March, June, September, and December.
              (3) A determination, made pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, that a drastic reduction in wood product prices has occurred, shall constitute a finding that the substantial overriding public interest justifies the contract term addition.
              (c) Granting market-related contract term additions. When the Chief of the Forest Service determines, pursuant to this section, that a drastic reduction in wood product prices has occurred, the Forest Service is to notify affected timber sale purchasers. For any contract which has been awarded and has not been terminated, the Forest Service, upon a purchaser's written request, will add 1 year to the contract's terms, except as provided in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section. This 1-year addition includes time outside of the normal operating season.
              (1) Additional contract time may not be granted for those portions of the contract:
              (i) With a required completion date;
              (ii) Where the Forest Service determines that the timber is in need of urgent removal;
              (iii) Where timber deterioration or resource damage may result from delay; or
              (iv) Where included timber is designated by diameter and delay may change the treatment as a result of trees growing into or out of the specified diameter range(s).
              (2) For each additional consecutive quarter in which a contract qualifies for market-related contract term addition, the Forest Service will, upon the purchaser's written request, add an additional 3 months during the normal operating season to the contract, except that no single 3-month addition shall extend the term of a contract by more than 1 year.
              (3) No more than 3 years shall be added to a contract's term by market-related contract term addition unless the following conditions are met:
              (i) The sale was awarded after December 31, 2006;
              (ii) A drastic reduction in wood product prices occurred in at least ten of twelve consecutive quarters during the contract term, but not including the quarter in which the contract was awarded; and
              (4) For each qualifying quarter meeting the criteria in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, the Forest Service will, upon the purchaser's written request, add an additional 3 months during the normal operating season to the contract, except no single 3-month addition shall extend the term of a contract by more than 1 year.
              (5) In no event shall a revised contract term exceed 10 years as a result of market-related contract term addition.
              (d) Recalculation of periodic payments. Where a contract is lengthened as a result of market conditions, any subsequent periodic payment dates shall be delayed 1 month for each month added to the contract's term.

              § 223.53
              Urgent removal contract extensions.
              (a) Finding. There is substantial, overriding public interest in extending National Forest System timber sale contracts for undamaged (green) timber not requiring expeditious removal in order to facilitate the rapid harvest of catastrophically damaged timber requiring expeditious removal on private or other non-National Forest System lands. Such an extension may be granted when a specific catastrophic event beyond the control of the landowner occurs on non-National Forest System lands that poses a threat to general forest health, public safety, and property. Catastrophic events include, but are not limited to, severe wildfire, wind, floods, insects and disease infestation, and drought.
              (b) Regional Forester determination. If the Regional Forester determines that adequate cause for urgent removal extensions exists, Contracting Officers may extend National Forest System timber sale contracts, up to a maximum of 1 year, for the estimated amount of time required to harvest and process the damaged timber on non-National Forest System lands. Contracting Officers may grant urgent removal extensions only when the Regional Forester verifies in writing that:
              (1) A specific catastrophe occurred for which urgent removal extensions should be granted;
              (2) The manufacturing facilities or logging equipment capacity available to purchasers are insufficient to provide for both the rapid harvest of damaged non-National Forest System timber in need of expeditious removal and the continued harvest of undamaged (green) timber under contract with the Forest Service; and
              (3) Failure to harvest the damaged non-National Forest System timber promptly could result in the following:
              (i) Pose a threat to public safety,
              (ii) Create a threat of an insect or disease epidemic to National Forest System or other lands or resources, or
              (iii) Significant private or other public resource loss.
              (c) Purchaser request. To obtain an urgent removal extension on a National Forest System timber sale contract, a purchaser must make a written request to the Contracting Officer, which includes the following:
              (1) An explanation of why the harvest of undamaged (green) National Forest System timber within the term of the existing National Forest System contract(s) will prevent or otherwise impede the removal of damaged non-National Forest System timber in need of expeditious removal; and
              (2) Documentation that the manufacturing facilities or logging equipment capacity available to a purchaser would be insufficient to provide for both the rapid salvage of damaged non-National Forest System timber in need of expeditious removal and continued harvest of undamaged (green) National Forest System timber under contract with the Forest Service.
              (d) Contracting Officer determination. To grant an urgent removal extension, the timber sale Contracting Officer must verify the following:
              (1) That it is likely that the undamaged (green) timber from National Forest System land would be delivered to the same manufacturing facilities as are needed to process the damaged non-National Forest System timber or the National Forest System timber sale contract would require the use of the same logging equipment as is needed to remove the damaged non-National Forest System timber from the area affected by the catastrophe;
              (2) That extension of the National Forest System contract will not be injurious to the United States and will protect, to the extent possible, the health of the National Forest System lands, including:
              (i) That urgent removal extension does not adversely affect other resource management objectives to be implemented by the National Forest System timber sale being extended; and

              (ii) That the National Forest System timber sale contract to be extended is not a sale containing damaged, dead, or dying timber subject to rapid deterioration.
              
              (3) That the purchaser has not been granted a previous urgent removal extension on the same National Forest System timber sale contract based on the current catastrophic event. Subsequent urgent removal extensions may be granted if there are subsequent Regional Forester determinations on other catastrophic events.
              (4) That the revised National Forest System timber sale contract term will not exceed 10 years from the date the National Forest System contract was awarded; and
              (5) That the purchaser is not in breach of the National Forest System contract, and all work items, payments, and deposits are current.
              (e) Execution of contract extension. An urgent removal extension of a National Forest System timber sale contract is executed through a mutual agreement contract modification pursuant to § 223.112, which must include specific contract provisions. An agreement to modify a contract must identify the specific provision(s) of the contract being modified and must include the requirement that purchasers make cash payment to cover the costs of remarking timber on the sale area or reestablishing cutting unit boundaries if the Contracting Officer determines such work is necessary.
              (f) Information collection. The information required of a purchaser to request an extension of an National Forest System timber sale contract, as outlined in paragraph (c) of this section, to facilitate expeditious removal of timber from non-National Forest System lands constitutes an information collection requirement as defined in 5 CFR Part 1320 and has been assigned Office of Management and Budget control number 0596-0167.

              Determining fair market value.
              The objective of Forest Service timber appraisals is to determine fair market value. Fair market value is estimated by such methods as are authorized by the Chief, Forest Service, through issuance of agency directives (36 CFR 200.4). Valid methods to determine fair market value include, but are not limited to, transaction evidence appraisals, analytical appraisals, comparison appraisals, and independent estimates based on average investments. Pertinent factors affecting market value also considered include, but are not limited to, prices paid and valuations established for comparable timber, selling value of products produced, estimated operating costs, operating difficulties, and quality of timber. Considerations and valuations may recognize and adjust for factors which are not normal market influences.

              § 223.61
              Establishing minimum stumpage rates.
              The Chief, Forest Service, shall establish minimum stumpage rates, i.e., “base rates,” for species and products on individual National Forests, or groups of National Forests. Timber shall be sold for appraised value or minimum stumpage rates, whichever is higher. No timber may be sold or cut under timber sale contracts for less than minimum stumpage rates except to provide for the removal of insect-infested, diseased, dead or distressed timber or in accordance with contract provisions specifically providing for catastrophically-affected timber and incidental amounts of material not meeting utilization standards of the timber sale contract. For any timber sale offering where deposits are to be required for reforestation under the Act of June 9, 1930, as amended (46 Stat. 527; 16 U.S.C. 576-576b) which exceed the value of the established minimum stumpage rates, the minimum rates may be increased by the approving officer as necessary to the amount of such required reforestation deposits and a minimum deposit to the Treasury. Minimum rates in timber sale contracts will not be set higher than established minimum rates for purposes other than assuring adequate funds for reforestation.
            
            
              § 223.62
              Timber purchaser road construction credit.

              Appraisal may also establish stumpage value as if unconstructed roads or other developments needed by the purchaser for removal of the timber were in place. When timber is appraised and sold on such basis, purchaser credit for road construction, not to exceed the estimated construction cost of such roads or other developments specified in the timber sale contract, shall, when such construction is accomplished by purchaser, be deducted from stumpage payments made by or due from purchaser under the timber sale contract for other than minimum stumpage rates and required deposits for slash disposal and road maintenance. As used in this section estimated construction costs means the total cost of constructing all permanent roads specified in the timber sale contract, estimated as if construction is to be accomplished by an independent contractor who is not the timber purchaser. In determining the purchaser credit amount applicable against timber payments, the estimated construction cost may be reduced for the effect of differences in applicable wage rates.
            
            
              § 223.63
              Advertised rates.
              Timber shall be advertised for sale at its appraised value. The road construction cost used to develop appraised value means the total estimated cost of constructing all permanent roads specified in the timber sale contract, estimated as if construction is to be accomplished by the timber purchaser. The advertised rates shall be not less than minimum stumpage rates, except that sales of insect-infested, diseased, dead, or distressed timber may be sold at less than minimum rates when harvest of such timber is necessary to protect or improve the forest or prevent waste of usable wood fiber.

              Appraisal on a lump-sum value or rate per unit of measure basis.
              Timber may be appraised and sold at a lump-sum value or at a rate per unit of measure which rate may be adjusted during the period of the contract and as therein specified in accordance with formulas or other equivalent specifications for the following reasons:
              (a) Variations in lumber or other product value indices between the price index base specified in the contract and the price index actually experienced during the cutting of the timber;
              (b) Variance between advertised rates and rates redetermined by appraisal at dates specified in the contract;
              (c) Variance between redetermined rates and rates appropriate for changes in costs or selling values subsequent to the rate redetermination which reduce conversion value to less than such redetermined rates; and
              (d) Substantial loss of value due to physical deterioration of green timber or other physical damage to the sale area or access to the timber.

              When advertisement is required.
              Except as otherwise provided in this part each sale in which the appraised value of the timber or other forest products exceeds $10,000 will be made only after advertisement for a period of 30 days or, if in the opinion of the officer authorizing the sale, the quantity, value or other conditions justify, a longer period; and any sale of smaller appraised value will be advertised or informal bids solicited from potential purchasers if, in the judgment of the officer authorizing the sale, such action is deemed advisable.
            
            
              § 223.81
              Shorter advertising periods in emergencies.

              In emergency situations where prompt removal of timber included in a sale is essential to avoid deterioration or to minimize the likelihood of the spread of insects, the approving officer may authorize shortening the formal advertising period to not less than 7 days. In other emergency situations, or for timber sold under 36 CFR 223.2 the Regional Forester or Chief may authorize shortening the formal advertising period to not less than 7 days.

              § 223.85
              Noncompetitive sale of timber.
              (a) Forest officers may sell, within their authorization, without further advertisement, at not less than appraised value, any timber previously advertised for competitive bids but not sold because of lack of bids and any timber on uncut areas included in a contract which has been terminated by abandonment, cancellation, contract period expiration, or otherwise if such timber would have been cut under the contract. This authority shall not be utilized if there is evidence of competitive interest in the product.
              (b) Extraordinary conditions, as provided for in 16 U.S.C. 472a(d), are defined to include the potential harm to natural resources, including fish and wildlife, and related circumstances arising as a result of the award or release of timber sale contracts pursuant to section 2001(k) of Public Law 104-19 (109 Stat. 246). Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section or any other regulation in this part, for timber sale contracts that have been or will be awarded or released pursuant to section 2001(k) of Public Law 104-19 (109 Stat. 246), the Secretary of Agriculture may allow forest officers to, without advertisement, modify those timber sale contracts by substituting timber from outside the sale area specified in the contract for timber within the timber sale contract area.

              (c) Extraordinary conditions, as provided for in 16 U.S.C. 472a(d), includes those conditions under which contracts for the sale or exchange of timber or other forest products must be suspended, modified, or terminated under the terms of such contracts to prevent environmental degradation or resource damage, or as the result of administrative appeals, litigation, or court orders. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section or any other regulation in this part, when such extraordinary conditions exist on sales not addressed in paragraph (b) of this section, the Secretary of Agriculture may allow forest officers to, without advertisement, modify those contracts by substituting timber or other forest products from outside the contract area specified in the contract for timber or forest products within the area specified in the contract. When such extraordinary conditions exist, the Forest Service and the purchaser shall make good faith efforts to identify replacement timber or forest products of similar volume, quality, value, access, and topography. When replacement timber or forest products agreeable to both parties is identified, the contract will be modified to reflect the changes associated with the substitution, including a rate redetermination. Concurrently, both parties will sign an agreement waiving any future claims for damages associated with the deleted timber or forest products, except those specifically provided for under the contract up to the time of the modification. If the Forest Service and the purchaser cannot reach agreement on satisfactory replacement timber or forest products, or the proper value of such material, either party may opt to end the search. Replacement timber or forest products must come from the same National Forest as the original contract. The term National Forest in this paragraph refers to an administrative unit headed by a single Forest Supervisor. Only timber or forest products for which a decision authorizing its harvest has been made and for which any applicable appeals or objection process has been completed may be considered for replacement pursuant to this paragraph. The value of replacement timber or forest products may not exceed the value of the material it is replacing by more than $10,000, as determined by standard Forest Service appraisal methods.

              (a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, no bid will be considered in the resale of timber remaining from any uncompleted timber sale contract from any person, or from an affiliate of such person, who failed to complete the original contract:
              (1) Because of termination for purchaser's branch or; or
              (2) Through failure to cut designated timber on portions of the sale area by the termination date, unless acceptance of such bid is determined to be in the public interest.
              (b) The no bid restriction in the preceding paragraph:
              (1) Shall only apply when 50 percent or more of the timber included in the resale is timber remaining from the uncompleted contract and the resale is advertised within 3 years of the date the uncompleted contract terminated;
              (2) When imposed because of failure to cut designated timber on portions of the sale area by the termination date, shall not apply to resales of timber for which the original contract was awarded prior to April 30, 1972, unless the contract is extended thereafter; and
              (3) Shall not apply to:
              (i) Resales of timber within a sustained yield unit unless competition may be invited under the policy statement for the unit,
              (ii) Resales of timber on contract which would ordinarily have been awarded prior to April 30, 1972, if award was delayed through no fault of the purchaser, and
              (iii) Resales of timber on contracts not extended because of environmental considerations.
              (c) Where a third-party agreement has been approved in accordance with § 223.114; the original purchaser shall not be affected by this section unless such purchaser is an affiliate of the third party.
              (d) As used in this section, person includes any individual, corporation, company, association, firm, partnership, society, joint stock company, or other business entity or the successor in interest of any of the foregoing business entities. A person is an affiliate when either directly or indirectly:

              Bidding methods.
              (a) Competitive sales of National Forest timber shall be offered through either sealed or oral auction bidding. The method chosen for each sale will:
              (1) Insure open and fair competition,
              (2) Insure that the Federal Government receives not less than fair market value for the public resource,
              (3) Consider the economic stability of communities whose economies are dependent upon National Forest timber, and
              (4) Be consistent with the objectives of the National Forest Management Act of 1976, as amended, and other Federal Statutes.
              (b) As a prerequisite to participation in an oral auction, bidders shall submit a written sealed bid at least equal to the minimum acceptable bid prices specified in the prospectus. No price subsequently bid at oral auction shall be accepted if it is less than the written sealed bid.
              (c) The Chief, Forest Service, shall specify the use of sealed bids or a mix of bidding methods in areas where he has reasonable belief that collusive bidding may be occurring or where he determines that less than normal competitive bidding is occurring.
              (d) Sealed bids shall be used for sales within Federal Sustained Yield Units, except where the policy statement for the Unit restricts purchasers of timber within the Unit from buying National Forest timber outside the Unit and the Chief determines that oral bidding will protect individual communities within the Unit.
              (e) The Chief, Forest Service, may authorize departures from the requirements of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section when he determines that departures are necessary to protect the public interest.
              (f) The Chief, Forest Service, may authorize the testing and evaluation of alternative bidding methods for National Forest timber.

              The sale of advertised timber shall be awarded to the responsible bidder submitting the highest bid that conforms to the conditions of the sale as stated in the prospectus unless:
              (a) Determination is made to reject all bids.

              (b) Two or more bidders, all of whom meet the requirements, submit equal bids which are the highest bids, in which case award may be by the drawing of lots. Equal bids from parties having direct or indirect common control or association in logging, processing or marketing may be consolidated to the extent deemed necessary by the awarding officer in order to give to any others who have bid the same amount an equitable opportunity in the drawing of lots.
              (c) The highest bidder is notoriously or habitually careless with fire.
              (d) Monopoly, injurious to the public welfare, would result from the control of large amounts of public or of public and private timber.

              Determination of purchaser responsibility.
              (a) A Contracting Officer shall not award a timber sale contract unless that officer makes an affirmative determination of purchaser responsibility. In the absence of information clearly indicating that the prospective purchaser is responsible, the Contracting Officer shall conclude that the prospective purchaser does not qualify as a responsible purchaser.
              (b) To determine a purchaser to be responsible, a Contracting Officer must find that:
              (1) The purchaser has adequate financial resources to perform the contract or the ability to obtain them;
              (2) The purchaser is able to perform the contract within the contract term taking into consideration all existing commercial and governmental business commitments;
              (3) The purchaser has a satisfactory performance record on timber sale contracts. A prospective purchaser that is or recently has been seriously deficient in contract performance shall be presumed not to be responsible, unless the Contracting Officer determines that the circumstances were beyond the purchaser's control and were not created through improper actions by the purchaser or affiliate, or that the purchaser has taken appropriate corrective action. Past failure to apply sufficient tenacity and perseverance to perform acceptably under a contract is strong evidence that a purchaser is not a responsible contractor. The Contracting Officer shall consider the number of contracts involved and extent of deficiency of each in making this evaluation;
              (4) The purchaser has a satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics;
              (5) The purchaser has or is able to obtain equipment and supplies suitable for logging the timber and for meeting the resource protection provisions of the contract;
              (6) The purchaser is otherwise qualified and eligible to receive an award under applicable laws and regulations.
              (c) If the prospective purchaser is a small business concern and the Contracting Officer determines that the purchaser does not qualify as a responsible purchaser on an otherwise acceptable bid, the Contracting Officer shall refer the matter to the Small Business Administration which will decide whether or not to issue a Certificate of Competency.
              (d) Affiliated concerns, as defined in § 223.49(a)(5) of this subpart are normally considered separate entities in determining whether the concern that is to perform the contract meets the applicable standards for responsibility. However, the Contracting Officer shall consider an affiliate's past performance and integrity when they may adversely affect the prospective purchaser's responsibility.

              (b) Where the Chief, Forest Service, determines that damages are so great that restoration, reconstruction, or construction is not practical under the cost-sharing arrangement in paragraph (a) of this section, he may allow cancellation of the contract notwithstanding provisions therein or in § 223.116.
              (c) The Chief, Forest Service, is authorized to reduce to 7 days the minimum time to advertise the sale of National Forest timber whenever he determines that—
              (1) The sale of such timber will assist in the construction of any area of a State damaged by a major disaster,
              (2) The sale of such timber will assist in sustaining the economy of such area, or
              (3) The sale of such timber is necessary to salvage the value of timber damaged in such major disaster or to protect undamaged timber.

              Modification of contracts.
              (a) Timber sale contracts may be modified only when the modification will apply to unexecuted portions of the contract and will not be injurious to the United States. Modifications may be made by the officer approving the sale, by his successor, or by his superior, except as provided in § 223.110.

              (b) Timber sale contracts awarded after October 1, 1995, that have been suspended for more than 90 days, during the normal operating season, at no fault of the purchaser, because of administrative appeals or litigation, that did not include contract provisions for rate redeterminations may be modified at the request of the timber sale purchaser to include a rate redetermination for the remaining unharvested volume to reflect significant decreases in market value during the period of delay. Rates in effect at the time of the suspension will be redetermined in accordance with the standard Forest Service methods in effect 45 days prior to the rate redetermination.

              Acquisition by third party.
              No agreement permitting a third party to acquire the rights of a purchaser under a timber sale contract may be recognized and approved by the Forest Service except in writing, signed by the officer approving the sale, his successor, or superior officer. Such approval shall not relieve the purchaser of his responsibilities or liabilities under the timber sale contract and may be given only if—
              (a) The third party is acceptable to the Forest Service as a purchaser of timber under the conditions and requirements then in effect for similar timber sales and assumes in writing all of the obligations to the Forest Service under the terms of the timber sale contract as to the uncompleted portion thereof, or
              (b) The rights are acquired in trust as security and subject to such conditions as may be necessary for the protection of the public interests.

              (b) That the substantial overriding public interest justifies the extension.

              Cancellation.
              (a) Timber sale contracts and permits may be canceled:
              (1) For serious or continued violation of their terms.
              (2) Upon application, or with the consent of the purchaser, when such action is of advantage to the United States or not prejudicial to its interests.
              (3) Upon application of the purchaser if the value of the timber remaining to be cut is diminished materially because of catastrophic damage caused by forces beyond the control of the purchaser resulting in (i) physical change in the sale area or access to it, or (ii) damage to timber remaining to be cut.
              (4) For conviction of violation of criminal statutes or, following final agency or judicial determination, of violation of civil standards, orders, permits, or others regulations for the protection of environmental quality issued by a Federal agency, State agency, or political subdivision thereof, in the conduct of operations thereunder, on National Forest System land, unless compliance with such laws or regulations would preclude performance of other contractual requirements.

              (5) Upon determination by the Chief, Forest Service, that operations thereunder would result in serious environmental degradation or resource damage and with reasonable compensation to the purchaser for unrecovered costs incurred under the contract and the difference between the current contract value and the average value of comparable National Forest timber sold during the preceding 6-month period.
              (b) Cancellation will be by the Chief, Forest Service. Authority to cancel contracts under paragraph (a)(1) through (4) of this section may be delegated to Regional Foresters for sales within their authorization. All contract cancellations under paragraph (a)(5) of this section shall be by the Chief, Forest Service, whose decision shall be the final agency decision.

              § 223.117
              Administration of cooperative or Federal sustained yield units.
              With respect to sustained yield units established pursuant to the provisions of the Act of March 29, 1944 (58 Stat. 132; 16 U.S.C. 583-583l), the Chief, Forest Service, with authority to delegate to other officers and employees of the Forest Service:
              (a) Shall provide that National Forest timber in any sustained yield unit shall be available in sufficient amounts to meet the needs of bona fide farmers, settlers, miners, residents and prospectors for minerals for personal and domestic use as provided by law and by regulation.
              (b) May offer for sale to cooperators, without competition but at not less than appraised value, timber on National Forest lands within an approved cooperative sustained yield unit; or, if the approved sustained yield unit consists entirely of federally owned or administered forest land and if necessary for the maintenance of a stable community or communities, may offer National Forest timber for sale to responsible operators within such community or communities, at not less than appraised value but without competition or with competition restricted to responsible operators who will manufacture the timber to at least a stated degree within the community or communities to be maintained. Each such sale which involves more than $500 in stumpage value may be made only after notice has been given in advance by such means as may be deemed effective in informing the public of the proposed action, including in any event, publication, once weekly for four consecutive weeks and with additional insertions if needed, in one or more newspapers of general circulation in the vicinity of the place where the timber is located, of a notice of the proposed sale stating at least:
              (1) The location, estimated quantity and appraised value of the timber to be cut;
              (2) The name and address of the proposed purchaser or those of the operators among whom bidding is to be restricted;
              (3) The time and place of a public advisory hearing on the proposed sale, to be held not earlier than 30 days after the first publication of said notice, if requested by the State or county where the timber is located or by any other person deemed to have a reasonable interest in the proposed sale or in its terms; and
              (4) The title and address of the officer of the Forest Service to whom any request for such hearing should be made.

              Such requests need be considered only if received at the place designated in the notice not later than 15 days after the first publication of such notice. If a public advisory hearing is to be held, notice of it shall be published in the same newspaper or newspapers as the original notice, stating the place where it will be held and the time, which shall not be earlier than 10 days after the first publication of the said notice of hearing, and shall appear once each week, but not for more than four successive weeks in any event, until the date set for the hearing. Any such hearing shall be conducted by the Chief or by any officer designated by him as his representative, except that if the amount of the proposed sale is not in excess of that which the Regional Forester has been authorized to sell without prior approval of the Chief the hearing may be held by the Regional Forester concerned or by his representative and decision may be by the Regional Forester. At any such hearing, opportunity shall be given to those having a reasonable interest to make oral statements or to file written statements discussing the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed sale; and the officer holding the hearing may, in his discretion, permit the filing of such statements within a reasonable period after the close of the hearing to become part of the record for consideration before a decision is made.
              (c) Shall keep available for public inspection,
              (1) During the life of any sustained yield unit, the minutes or other record of the hearing held on the establishment thereof, and the determination of action taken following the hearing including any modification of the proposals as submitted at the hearing; and
              (2) During the life of any cooperative agreement for coordinated management the similar record of the hearings and actions determined upon; and
              (3) During the life of any sustained yield unit the similar record of any public hearing which may be held on a sale made without competition or with restricted competition and the action determined upon. Such records of any case may be kept in any office of the Forest Service designated by the Chief as being suitable and convenient of access for probably interested persons.
              (d) Shall make provision, in any contract for the purchase of timber without competition or with restricted competition, if that contract is of more than 7 years' duration and in his discretion in any case of shorter duration, for the redetermination of rates for stumpage and for required deposits to be paid by the purchasers, such redetermination to be effective at intervals or dates stated in the contract; but the sum of such redetermined rates for stumpage and sale area betterment shall not be less than the base rates in the published notice of the proposed sale.
              (e) May modify and revise existing cooperative agreements entered into under said act after taking appropriate action.
            
            
              § 223.118
              Appeal process for small business timber sale set-aside program share recomputation decisions.
              (a) Decisions subject to appeal. The rules of this section govern appeal of recomputation decisions related to structural, special, or market changes or the scheduled 5-year recomputations of the small business share of National Forest System timber sales. Certain decisions related to recomputation of shares, such as structural change and carryover volume, may require two decisions, one to determine that a recomputation is needed and the other to recompute the shares. Decisions made both at the earlier stage as well as the later stage are appealable.
              (b) Manner of giving notice—(1) Predecisional notice and comment. The Responsible Official shall provide qualifying timber sale purchasers, as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, 30 days for predecisional review and comment on any draft decision to reallocate shares, including the data used in making the proposed recomputation decision.
              (2) Notice of decision. Upon close of the 30-day predecisional review period, the Responsible Official shall consider any comments received. Within 15 days of the end of the comment period, the Responsible Official shall make a decision on the small business shares and shall give prompt written notice to all parties on the national forest timber sale bidders list for the affected area. The notice of decision must identify the name of the Appeal Deciding Officer, the address, the date by which an appeal must be filed, and a source for obtaining the appeal procedures information.
              (c) Who may appeal or file written comments as an interested party. (1) Only timber sale purchasers, or their representatives, who are affected by recomputations of the small business share of timber sales as described in paragraph (a) of this section and who have submitted predecisional comments pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, may appeal recomputation decisions under this section or may file written comments as an interested party.

              (2) Interested parties are defined as the Small Business Administration and those timber sale purchasers, or their representatives, who are affected by recomputations of the small business share of timber sales as described in paragraph (a) of this section and who have individually, or through an association to which they belong, submitted predecisional comments pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
              (i) A timber sale purchaser may submit comments on an appeal as an interested party if an association to which the purchaser belongs filed predecisional comment but later decides not to appeal or not to file comments as an interested party.
              (ii) A timber sale purchaser, who is a member of an association that appeals a decision, may not file a separate appeal unless that purchaser filed separate predecisional comment under paragraph (b)(1).
              (3) Interested parties who submit written comments on an appeal filed by another party may not continue an appeal if the appellant withdraws the appeal.
              (d) Level of appeal. Only one level of review is available for appeal of decisions pertaining to recomputations under the Small Business Timber Sale Set-aside Program. The Appeal Deciding Officer is the official one level above the level of the Responsible Official who made the recomputation of shares decision. The Responsible Official is normally the Forest Supervisor; thus, the Appeal Deciding Officer is normally the Regional Forester. However, when the Regional Forester makes recomputation decisions, the Appeal Deciding Officer is the Chief or such officer at the National headquarters level as the Chief may designate.
              (e) Filing procedures. In order to file an appeal under this section, an appellant must file a notice of appeal, as specified in the notice of decision, with the Appeal Deciding Officer within 20 days of the date on the notice of the decision. This date must be specified in the notice of decision given pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Written comments filed by an interested party in response to an appeal must be filed within 15 days after the close of the appeal filing period.
              (f) Content of notice of appeal. (1) It is the responsibility of the appellant to provide sufficient narrative evidence and argument to show why a recomputation decision by the Responsible Official should be reversed or changed.
              (2) An appellant must include the following information in a notice of appeal:
              (i) The appellant's name, mailing address, and daytime telephone number;
              (ii) The title or type of recomputation decision involved, the date of the decision, and the name of the Responsible Official;
              (iii) A brief description and date of the decision being appealed:
              (iv) A statement of how the appellant is adversely affected by the decision being appealed;
              (v) A statement of the facts in dispute regarding the issue(s) raised by the appeal;
              (vi) If relevant, any specific references to any law, regulation, or policy that the appellant believes to have been violated and the basis for such an allegation;
              (vii) A statement as to whether and how the appellant has tried to resolve with the Responsible Official the issue(s) being appealed, including evidence of submission of written comments at the predecisional stage as provided by paragraph (a) of this section, the date of any discussion, and the outcome of that meeting or contact; and
              (viii) A statement of the relief the appellant seeks.
              (g) Time periods and timeliness. (1) All time periods applicable to this section will begin on the first day following a decision or action related to the appeal.
              (2) Time periods applicable to this section are computed using calendar days. Saturdays, Sundays, or Federal holidays are included in computing the time allowed for filing an appeal; however, when the filing period would expire on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the filing time is automatically extended to the end of the next Federal working day.

              (3) It is the responsibility of those filing an appeal to file the notice of appeal by the end of the filing period. In the event of questions, legible postmarks on a mailed appeal or the time and date imprint on a facsimile appeal will be considered evidence of timely filing. Where postmarks or facsimile imprints are illegible, the Appeal Deciding Officer shall rule on the timeliness of the notice of appeal.
              (4) The time period for filing a notice of appeal is not extendable.
              (h) Dismissal without decision. The Appeal Deciding Officer shall dismiss an appeal and close the record without a decision in any of the following circumstances:
              (1) The appellant is not on the timber sale bidders list for the area affected by the recomputation decision;
              (2) The appellant's notice of appeal is not filed within the required time period;
              (3) The appellant's notice of appeal does not contain responses required by paragraphs (f)(2)(i) through (f)(2)(viii) of this section; or
              (4) The appellant did not submit written comments on the proposed decision of the new recomputed shares as described in paragraph (c) of this section.
              (i) Appeal record. The appeal record consists of the written decision being appealed, any predecisional comments received, any written comments submitted by interested parties, any other supporting data used to make the decision, the notice of appeal, and, if prepared, a responsive statement by the Responsible Official which addresses the issues raised in the notice of appeal. The Responsible Official must forward the record to the Appeal Deciding Officer within 7 days of the date the notice of appeal is received. A copy of the appeal record must be sent to the appellant at the same time.
              (j) Appeal decision—(1) Responsive statement for appeal decision. The Appeal Deciding Officer may request the Responsible Official to prepare a responsive statement. However, if the information in the files clearly demonstrates the rationale for the Responsible Official's decision, then a responsive statement addressing the points of the appeal is not necessary.
              (2) Appeal issue clarification. For clarification of issues raised in the appeal, the Appeal Deciding Officer may request additional information from either the Responsible Official, the appellant, or an interested party who has submitted comments on the appeal. At the discretion of the Appeal Deciding Officer, an appellant or interested party may be invited to discuss data relevant to the appeal. Information provided to clarify issues or facts in the appeal must be based upon information previously documented in the file or appeal. Any information provided as a result of the Appeal Deciding Officer's request for more information must be made available to all parties, that is, to the Responsible Official, the appellant, and interested parties who have submitted comments on the appeal. All parties will have 5 days after the Appeal Deciding Officer receives the additional information to review and comment on the information, and the appeal decision period will be extended 5 additional days.
              (3) Issuance of final decision. The Appeal Deciding Officer shall review the decision and appeal record and issue a written appeal decision to the parties within 30 days of the close of the appeal period except that this period must be extended to 35 days when additional information is requested by the Appeal Deciding Officer. The Appeal Officer may affirm or reverse the Responsible Official's decision, in whole or in part. There is no extension of the time period for rendering an appeal decision.
              (k) Implementation of decisions during pendency of appeal. Recomputation of shares arising from a scheduled 5-year recomputation are effective on April 1 following the end of the 5-year period being considered. If an appeal that may affect the shares for the next 5-year period is not resolved by the April 1 date, the share decision announced by the Responsible Official must be implemented. If an appeal decision results in a change in the shares, the revised total share of the Small Business Timber Sale Set-aside Program must be accomplished during the remaining portion of the 5-year period.
              (l) Timber sale set-aside policy changes. Timber purchasers shall receive an opportunity, in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations, to review and comment on significant changes in the Small Business Timber Sale Set-aside Program or policy prior to adoption and implementation.
              (m) Information collection requirements. The provisions of paragraph (f) of this section specify the information that appellants must provide when appealing decisions pertaining to recomputation of shares. As such, these rules contain information requirements as defined in 5 CFR Part 1320. These information requirements have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget and assigned control number 0596-0141.

            Applicability.

            These regulations apply to purchasers of National Forest System timber as well as to those persons who violate the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620, et seq.). These regulations do not apply to Forest Service procurement contracts which are governed by regulations at 41 CFR 4-1.6.

            Policy.
            (a) The Forest Service shall solicit and consider timber sale bids from and award contracts only to responsible business concerns and individuals. Debarment and suspension by the Forest Service are discretionary actions that, taken in accordance with these regulations, are appropriate means to effectuate this policy.
            (b) Debarment and suspension shall be imposed only for the causes and in accordance with the procedures set forth in this subpart. The serious nature of debarment and suspension requires that these actions be imposed only in the public interest, for the Government's protection, and not for the purpose of punishment.
            (c) Debarment and suspension actions taken under this subpart shall be based on the administrative record, including any submissions and argument made by the purchaser or named affiliate in accordance with this subpart, and shall be limited in scope and duration to that necessary to protect the Government's interest.

            § 223.136
            Debarment.
            (a) General. In accordance with the procedures in § 223.138, the debarring official may in the public interest, debar a purchaser for any of the causes listed in § 223.137. However, the existence of a cause for debarment does not necessarily require that the purchaser be debarred. In making any debarment decision, the debarring official shall consider the seriousness of the purchaser's acts or omissions and any mitigating factors.
            (b) Effect of proposed debarment. (1) Upon issuance of a notice of proposed debarment by the debarring official and until the final debarment decision is rendered, the Forest Service shall not solicit or consider bids from, award contracts to, approve a third party agreement with, renew or otherwise extend, except pursuant to the terms of a contract term adjustment, any contract with that purchaser. The Chief of the Forest Service or authorized representative may waive this exclusion upon a written determination identifying compelling reasons to continue doing business with that purchaser pending completion of debarment proceedings.
            (2) In addition to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, issuance of a notice of proposed debarment under § 223.137(g) shall preclude such person from entering into any contract to purchase unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands, and from taking delivery of unprocessed Federal timber from any other party who purchased such timber.

            § 223.138
            Procedures for debarment.
            (a) Investigation and referral. Information which may be sufficient cause for debarment of a timber sale purchaser and affiliates shall be reported to the Forest Service Debarring Official. Generally, such information should be referred through the Forest Supervisor and the Regional Forester. The referral shall be accompanied by a complete statement of the facts supported by appropriate exhibits and a recommendation for action. Where the statement of facts indicates a possible criminal offense, except possible antitrust violations, the debarring official shall notify the Office of Inspector General, USDA. Where the statement of facts indicates a possible antitrust violation, the debarring official shall notify the Antitrust Division, Department of Justice.
            (b) Decisionmaking process—(1) Notice of proposal to debar. The debarring official shall initiate debarment by advising the purchaser and any specifically named affiliate, by certified mail, return receipt requested. The notice document shall include the following information:
            (i) That debarment is being considered.
            (ii) The reasons for the proposed debarment in terms sufficient to put the recipient on notice of the conduct or transaction(s) upon which it is based.
            (iii) The cause(s) relied upon under § 223.137 for proposing debarment.
            (iv) The specific procedures governing debarment decisionmaking in § 223.138 (b)(1) through (b)(8).
            (v) The effect of the issuance of the notice of proposed debarment pending a final debarment decision (see § 223.136(b)).
            (vi) The potential effect of a debarment.
            (2) Submission in opposition. Within 30 calendar days after receipt of the notice of proposed debarment, the respondent my submit, in person, in writing, or through a representative, information and argument in opposition to and/or in mitigation of the proposed debarment, including any additional specific information that raises a genuine dispute over the material facts.
            (3) Informal hearing. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a respondent may request an informal hearing with the debarring official. The informal hearing shall be held within 20 calendar days from the date the request is received. The debarring official may postpone the date of the hearing if the respondent requests a postponement in writing. At the hearing, the respondent, appearing personally or through an attorney or other authorized representative, may informally present and explain evidence that causes for debarment do not exist, evidence of any mitigating factors, and arguments concerning the imposition, scope, duration or effects of proposed debarment or debarment. A transcript of the informal hearing shall not be required.
            (4) Additional proceedings as to disputed material facts. In actions not based upon a conviction or civil judgment, if the debarring official finds that and gives notice that the submission in opposition raises a genuine dispute over facts material to the proposed debarment, respondent(s) may request a fact-finding conference on those disputed material facts. Such a conference shall be held within 20 calendar days from the date the request is received unless mutually agreed otherwise. The fact-finding conference shall conform with the following requirements:
            (i) At least 10 days before the fact-finding conference, the debarring official shall send the respondent a copy of all documents in the administrative record as of the date of transmittal and not objected to by the Department of Justice.
            (ii) At the conference, the respondent shall have the opportunity to appear with counsel, submit documentary evidence, present witnesses, and confront any person the Forest Service presents.

            (5) Debarring official's decision—(i) No additional proceedings necessary. In actions based upon a conviction or civil judgement or in which there is no genuine dispute over material facts, the debarring official shall make a decision on the basis of all the information in the administrative record, including any submission made by the purchaser or any specifically named affiliate. The decision shall be made within 30 working days after receipt of any information and argument submitted, unless the debarring official extends this period for good cause.
            (ii) Additional proceedings necessary. (A) In actions in which additional proceedings are necessary to determine disputed material facts, the debarring official shall promptly prepare written findings of fact. The debarring official shall base the decision on the facts as found, together with any information and argument submitted by the purchaser or any specifically named affiliate and any other information in the administrative record.
            (B) The debarring official may refer matters involving disputed material facts to another official for findings of fact. The debarring official may reject any such findings, in whole or in part, only after specifically determining them to be arbitrary and capricious or clearly erroneous.
            (C) The debarring official's decision shall be made after the conclusion of the proceedings with respect to disputed facts.
            (6) Standard of evidence. In any action in which the proposed debarment is not based upon a conviction or civil judgment, the cause for debarment must be established by a preponderance of the evidence. In any action in which the proposed debarment is based upon a conviction or civil judgment, the standard shall be deemed to have been met.
            (7) Notice of debarring official's decision. (i) The purchaser and any affiliates involved shall be given prompt notice of the debarring official's decision by certified mail, return receipt requested. If the debarring official decides to impose debarment, the notice shall:

            Period of debarment.
            (a) Debarment shall be for a period commensurate with the seriousness of the cause(s):
            (1) The debarring official shall consider any suspension period or period since issuance of the notice of proposed debarment in determining the debarment period.

            (b) The debarring official may extend the debarment for those causes listed at § 223.137 (a)-(f) of this subpart for an additional period if that official determines that an extension is necessary to protect the Government's interest. However:
            (1) A debarment may not be extended solely on the basis of the facts and circumstances upon which the initial debarment action was based;
            (2) If debarment for an additional period is necessary, the debarring official shall initiate and follow the procedures in § 223.138 to extend the debarment.
            (c) The debarring official may consider terminating the debarment or reducing the period or extent of debarment, upon the purchaser's request, supported by documentation, for reasons such as:
            (1) Newly discovered material evidence;
            (2) Reversal of the conviction or judgment upon which the debarment was based;
            (3) Bona fide change in ownership or management;
            (4) Elimination of other causes for which the debarment was imposed; or
            (5) Other reasons the debarring official deems appropriate.
            (d) The debarring official shall make final disposition of a reconsideration request under paragraph (c) of this section in writing within 30 working days of receipt of the reconsideration request and supporting documentation, unless the debarring official extends this period for good cause.

            § 223.140
            Scope of debarment.
            (a) Scope in general. (1) Debarment of a purchaser constitutes debarment of all divisions or other organizational elements of the purchaser, unless the debarment decision is limited by its terms to specific divisions, organizational elements, or classes of sales.
            (2) The debarring official may extend a debarment decision to include any affiliates of the purchaser, if they are—
            (i) Specifically named and
            (ii) Given written notice of the proposed debarment and provided an opportunity to respond (see § 223.138(b)).
            (b) Imputing conduct. For purposes of determining the scope of debarment, conduct may be imputed as follows:
            (1) The fraudulent, criminal, or other seriously improper conduct of any officer, director, shareholder, partner, employee, or other individual associated with a purchaser may be imputed to a purchaser when the conduct occurred in connection with the individual's performance of duties for or on behalf of the purchaser, or with the purchaser's knowledge, approval, or acquiescence. The purchaser's acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct shall be evidence of such knowledge, approval, or acquiescence.

            (2) The fraudulent, criminal, or other seriously improper conduct of a purchaser may be imputed to any officer, director, shareholder, partner, employee, or other individual associated with the purchaser who participated in, knew of, or has reason to know of the purchaser's conduct.
            
            (3) The fraudulent, criminal, or other seriously improper conduct of one purchaser participating in a joint venture or similar arrangement may be imputed to other participating purchasers if the conduct occurred for or on behalf of the joint venture or similar arrangement or with the knowledge, approval, or acquiescence of those purchasers. Acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct shall be evidence of such knowledge, approval or acquiescence.
          
          
            § 223.141
            Suspension.
            (a) The suspending official may, in the public interest, suspend a purchaser on the basis of adequate evidence for any of the causes in § 223.142, using the procedures in § 223.143. However, the existence of a cause for suspension does not necessarily require that the purchaser be suspended. In making any suspension decision, the suspending official shall consider the seriousness of the purchaser's acts or omissions and any mitigating factors.
            (b) Suspension is a serious action to be imposed, pending the completion of investigation or legal proceedings, when it has been determined that immediate action is necessary to protect the Government's interest. In assessing the adequacy of the evidence, consideration shall be given to how much information is available, how credible it is given the circumstances, whether or not important allegations are corroborated and what inferences can reasonably be drawn as a result. This assessment shall include an examination of basic documents such as contracts, bids, awards, inspection reports, and correspondence, as appropriate.
          
          
            § 223.142

            (i) Theft, forgery, bribery, embezzlement, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, or receiving stolen property;
            (ii) Fraud, a criminal offense, or violation of Federal or State antitrust laws, any of which occurred in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain; or performing a public contract or subcontract; or
            (iii) Any other offense indicating a lack of business integrity or business honesty that seriously and directly affects the present responsibility of a purchase of Government timber.
            (2) Indictment for any of the causes listed in paragraph (a) of this section constitutes adequate evidence for suspension.
            (3) A purchaser's suspension from the purchaser of timber by another Federal agency which sells timber.
            (b) The suspending official may, upon adequate evidence, also suspend a purchaser for any other cause so serious or compelling that it affects the present responsibility or a purchaser of Government timber.
          
          
            § 223.143
            Procedures for suspension.
            (a) Investigation and referral. Information which may be sufficient cause for suspension under § 223.142 shall be reported to the Forest Service Suspending Official.

            (A) Of a serious nature in business dealings with the Government, or
            
            (B) Seriously reflecting on the propriety of further Government dealings with the recipient;
            (iii) Any such irregularities shall be described in terms sufficient to place the recipient on notice without disclosing the Government's evidence;
            (iv) That the suspension is for a temporary period of time pending the completion of an investigation and such legal proceedings as may ensue;
            (v) The cause(s) relied upon under § 223.142 for imposing suspension;
            (vi) The effect of the suspension (see § 223.135);

At the hearing, the respondent, appearing personally or through an attorney or other authorized representative, may informally present and explain evidence that causes for suspension do not exist, evidence of any mitigating factors, and arguments concerning the imposition, scope, duration or effects of suspension. A transcript of the informal hearing shall not be required.
            (4) Additional proceedings as to disputed material facts. (i) If the suspending official finds that there exists a genuine dispute over facts material to the suspension, respondent(s) shall be afforded an opportunity to appear with counsel, submit documentary evidence, present witnesses, and confront any person the Forest Service presents, unless—
            (A) The action is based on an indictment; or
            (B) A determination is made, on the basis of Department of Justice advice, that the substantial interests of the Government in pending or contemplated legal proceedings based on the same facts as the suspension would be prejudiced.
            (ii) If appropriate, the respondent may request a fact-finding conference on disputed material facts. Such a conference shall be held within 20 calendar days from the date the request is received unless mutually agreed otherwise. The fact-finding conference shall conform with the following requirements:
            (A) At least 10 days before the fact-finding conference, the suspending official shall send the respondent a copy of all documents in the administrative record as of the date of transmittal and not objected to by the Department of Justice.

            (iii) A transcribed record of any additional proceedings shall be prepared and made available at cost to the respondent upon request, unless the respondent and the Forest Service, by mutual agreement, waive the requirement for a transcript.
            (5) Suspending official's decision. The suspending official may modify or terminate the suspension or leave it in force for the same reasons as for terminating or reducing the period or extent of debarment (see § 223.139(c)). The decision shall be made in accordance with the following provisions:
            (i) No additional proceedings necessary. In actions based on an indictment, in which the respondent's submission does not raise a genuine dispute over material facts; or in which additional proceedings to determine disputed material facts have been denied on the basis of Department of Justice advice, the suspending official's decision shall be based on all the information in the administrative record, including any submissions and argument made by the respondent. The decision shall be made within 30 working days after receipt of any information and argument submitted by the respondent, unless the suspending official extends this period for good cause.
            (ii) Additional proceedings necessary. (A) In actions in which additional proceedings are necessary as to disputed material facts, written findings of fact shall be promptly prepared. The suspending official shall base the decision on the facts as found, together with any information and argument submitted by the respondent and any other information in the administrative record.
            (B) The suspending official may refer matters involving disputed material facts to another official for findings of fact. The suspending official may reject any such findings, in whole or in part, only after specifically determining them to be arbitrary and capricious or clearly erroneous.
            (C) The suspending official's decision shall be made only after the conclusion of any proceedings with respect to disputed facts.
            (6) Notice of suspending official's decision. The purchaser and any affiliates involved shall be given prompt written notice of the suspending officer's decision to continue or not continue the suspension by certified mail, return receipt requested.

            § 223.160
            Definitions.
            The following definitions apply to the provisions of this section:
            (a) Export means either direct or indirect export to a foreign country and occurs on the date that a person enters into a contract or other binding transaction for the export of unprocessed timber or, if that date cannot be established, when unprocessed timber is found in an export yard or pond, bundled or otherwise prepared for shipment, or aboard an ocean-going vessel. An export yard or pond is an area where sorting and/or bundling of logs for shipment outside the United States is accomplished. Unprocessed timber, whether from National Forest System or private lands, is exported directly when exported by the National Forest timber purchaser. Timber is exported indirectly when export occurs as a result of a sale to another person or as a consequence of any subsequent transaction.
            (b) Historic level means the average annual volume of unprocessed timber purchased or exported in calendar years 1971, 1972, and 1973.
            (c) Private lands mean lands held or owned by a private person. Nonprivate lands include, but are not limited to, lands held or owned by the United States, a State or political subdivision thereof, or any other public agency, or lands held in trust by the United States for Indians.
            (d) Substitution means the purchase of unprocessed timber from National Forest System lands to be used as replacement for unprocessed timber from private lands which is exported by the purchaser. Substitution occurs when (1) a person increases purchases of National Forest timber in any Calendar year more than 10 percent above their historic level and in the same calendar year exports unprocessed timber from private land in the tributary area; or (2) a person increases exports of unprocessed timber from private land in any tributary area more than 10 percent above their historic level in any calendar year while they have National Forest timber under contract.
            (e) Tributary area means the geographic area from which unprocessed timber is delivered to a specific processing facility or complex. A tributary area is expanded when timber outside an established tributary area is hauled to the processing facility or complex.
            (f) Unprocessed timber, except western red cedar in the contiguous 48 States, means trees or portions of trees having a net scale content not less than 331/3 percent of the gross volume, or the minimum piece specification set forth in the timber sale contract, in material meeting the peeler and sawmill log grade requirements published in the January 1, 1980—Official Log Scaling and Grading Rules used by Log Scaling and Grading Bureaus on the West Coast; cants to be subsequently remanufactured exceeding 83/4 inches in thickness; cants of any thickness reassembled into logs; and split or round bolts, except for aspen, or other roundwood not processed to standards and specifications suitable for end-product use. Unprocessed timber shall not mean pulp (utility) grade logs and Douglas-fir special cull logs or timber processed into the following:
            (1) Lumber and construction timbers, regardless of size, sawn on four sides;
            (2) Chips, pulp, and pulp products;
            (3) Green veneer and plywood;
            (4) Poles, posts, or piling cut or treated for use as such;
            (5) Cants cut for remanufacture, 83/4 inches in thickness or less;
            (6) Aspen bolts, not exceeding 4 feet in length.
            (g) Unprocessed western red cedar timber in the contiguous 48 States means trees or portions of trees of that species which have not been processed into—
            (1) Lumber of American Lumber Standards Grades of Number 3 dimension or better, or Pacific Lumber Inspection Bureau Export R-List Grades of Number 3 Common or better;
            (2) Chips, pulp, and pulp products;
            (3) Veneer and plywood;
            (4) Poles, posts, or piling cut or treated with preservatives for use as such and not intended to be further processed; or
            (5) Shakes and shingles; provided that lumber from private lands manufactured to the standards established in the lumber grading rules of the American Lumber Standards Association or the Pacific Lumber Inspection Bureau and manufactured lumber authorized to be exported under license by the Department of Commerce shall be considered processed.
            (h) Person means an individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity and includes any subsidiary, subcontractor, parent company, or other affiliate. Business entities are considered affiliates for the entire calendar year when one controls or has the power to control the other or when both are controlled directly or indirectly by a third person during any part of the calendar year.
            (i) Purchase occurs when a person is awarded a contract to cut National Forest timber or through the approval of a third party agreement by the Forest Service.
            
            (j) Purchaser means a person that has purchased a National Forest timber sale.

            (4) A person purchases, directly or indirectly, unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands if such person sells or otherwise transfers unprocessed timber that originates from private lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States and that requires domestic processing, to a third party if that third party or successive parties export that unprocessed private timber. A third party or successive parties who acquire such unprocessed timber that originates from private lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States and that requires domestic processing may not export such timber.
            
              Transaction means an arrangement involving the transfer of unprocessed timber.
            
              Transaction statement is a signed copy of one of the transaction reporting forms in 36 CFR 223.193 and 223.194.
            
              Transfer means to pass title, sell, trade, exchange, or otherwise convey unprocessed timber to another person.
            
              Unprocessed timber means trees or portions of trees or other roundwood not processed to standards and specifications suitable for end product use and intended for remanufacture. Unprocessed timber does not include products intended for remanufacture that meet the criteria listed in § 223.187(a) (2) or (3). For the purposes of reporting and identifying under §§ 223.193, 223.194 and 223.195, unprocessed timber also means timber products listed in § 223.187 of these regulations, and other timber products including house logs that are part of a structure kit, that are indistinguishable from other unprocessed timber.
          
          
            § 223.187
            Determinations of unprocessed timber.
            (a) All species except western red cedar. Unprocessed timber, as defined in § 223.186 of this Subpart, does not include timber processed into any one of the following:
            (1) Lumber or construction timbers, except western red cedar, meeting current American Lumber Standards Grades or Pacific Lumber Inspection Bureau Export R or N list grades, sawn on 4 sides, not intended for remanufacture. To determine whether such lumber or construction timbers meet this grade and intended use standard, the shipper of record must have in its possession for each shipment or order, and available for inspection upon the request of the Forest Service:
            (i) A legible copy of a lumber inspection certificate certified by a lumber inspection/grading organization generally recognized by the industry as setting a selling standard; and,
            (ii) A statement by the manufacturer certifying under the penalties provided in section 492 of the Act (16 U.S.C. 620d) and the False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001) that the products in the shipment or order are intended to be used as shipped, are manufactured into products, or processed into pulp, and are not to be manufactured into other products. The certification statements shall be made in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. The certification statements in paragraph (b) of this section are not required if the lumber or construction timbers described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section or the pulpwood bolts described in paragraph (a)(8) of this section otherwise may be exported without regard to an intent to remanufacture or process into pulp. For instance, because the timber originates from private land from which timber may be exported.
            (2) Lumber, construction timbers, or cants for remanufacture, except western red cedar, meeting current American Lumber Standards Grades or Pacific Lumber Inspection Bureau Export R or N list clear grades, sawn on 4 sides, not to exceed 12 inches (30.5 cm) thick. To determine whether such lumber, timbers, or cants meet this grading standard, the shipper of record must have in its possession for each shipment or order and available for inspection, upon the request of the Forest Service, a legible copy of a lumber inspection certificate certified by a lumber inspection/grading organization generally recognized by the industry as setting a selling standard.

I make this authorization with full knowledge and understanding of the export and substitution restrictions of the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620, et seq.) (Act) and its implementing regulations. I fully understand that exporting unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands or unprocessed timber originating from private lands which is required to be processed domestically is a violation of this Act, its implementing regulations, and the False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001), and may subject me to the penalties and remedies provided for such violation.”
            
          
          
            § 223.188
            Prohibitions against exporting unprocessed Federal timber.
            No person who acquires unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States may export such timber from the United States, or sell, trade, exchange, or otherwise convey such timber to any other person for the purpose of exporting such timber from the United States. This prohibition does not apply to specific quantities of grades and species of such unprocessed Federal timber that the Secretary of Agriculture determines to be surplus to domestic manufacturing needs.
          
          
            § 223.189
            Prohibitions against substitution.
            (a) Direct substitution prohibition. Except as otherwise provided by this section:
            (1) No person may purchase directly from any department or agency of the United States unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States if:
            (i) Such person acquires unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States and engages in exporting or selling for export, unprocessed timber originating from private lands within the same geographic and economic area; or

            (2) No person may export or sell for export, unprocessed timber originating from private lands within the same geographic and economic area in the same calendar year that the person has unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands in the person's possession or under contract.
            (3) No person may purchase unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands if such person sells or otherwise transfers unprocessed timber that originates from private lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States and that requires domestic processing, to a third party if that third party or successive parties export that unprocessed private timber. A third party or successive parties who acquire such unprocessed timber that originates from private lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States and that requires domestic processing may not export such timber.
            (4) The prohibitions in paragraphs (a) (1)-(3) of this section shall not apply to specific quantities of grades and species of unprocessed timber which the Secretary of Agriculture has determined to be surplus to domestic manufacturing needs.
            (b) Exemptions. (1) Pursuant to section 490(c) of the Act (16 U.S.C. 620b), all persons who applied for a sourcing area by December 20, 1990, in accordance with § 223.190 of this subpart, were exempt from the prohibitions against substitution, in accordance with § 223.189(a)(1) of this subpart, until such time that the approving official approved or disapproved the application.
            (2) Pursuant to Section 490(a) of the Act (16 U.S.C. 620b), an exemption to the prohibition in § 223.189(a)(1)(B) of this subpart is provided to:
            (i) A person with a historic export quota who submitted a certification in accordance with § 223.189 (c) and (d) of this subpart; and
            (ii) A non-manufacturer who submitted a certification in accordance with § 223.192 of this subpart.
            (3) Pursuant to § 490(c) of the Act (16 U.S.C. 620b), the prohibitions against direct substitution in § 223.189(a) (1) and (2) of this subpart do not apply to a person who acquires unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands within an approved sourcing area, does not export unprocessed timber originating from private lands within the approved sourcing area while the approval is in effect, and, if applicable, received a waiver of the prohibition against exporting unprocessed timber originating from private lands within the sourcing area during the preceding 24 months, in accordance with § 223.189 (f) and (g) of this subpart.
            (c) Historic export quota exemption. The prohibition against the purchase of Federal timber for a person who has exported unprocessed timber originating from private lands, within the preceding 24-month period, shall not apply to a person with a historic export quota approved by the Secretary and who has been exporting unprocessed private timber in accordance with the log export and substitution regulations of the Secretary of Agriculture at 36 CFR part 223, subpart D, in effect before August 20, 1990, if:
            (1) That person certified in writing to the Regional Forester of the Region administering the historic export quota, on or before November 20, 1990, that the person would cease exporting unprocessed timber originating from private lands on or before February 20, 1991, and
            (2) The exporting ceased in accordance with such certification.
            (d) Application for historic export quota exemption. To obtain an exemption from the prohibition against export within the preceding 24-month period for purchasing Federal timber based on an approved historic export quota described in paragraph (c) of this section, a person must have applied in writing to the applicable Regional Forester on or before November 20, 1990. The certificate must have been notarized. The application was required to be on company letterhead and must have included:
            (1) An agreement to retain records of all transactions involving acquisition and disposition of unprocessed timber from both private and Federal lands within the area(s) involved in the certification, for a period of three (3) years beginning November 20, 1990, and to make such records available for inspection upon the request of the Regional Forester, or other official to whom such authority has been delegated.
            (2) A signed certification which reads as follows:
            
            

              “I have purchased, under an historic export quota approved by the Secretary of Agriculture, unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands located west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States during the preceding 24 months in direct substitution for exported unprocessed timber originating from private lands. I desire to purchase directly from a Department or agency of the United States, unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands located in such area of the United States. I make this certification for the exemption from the prohibition against export within the preceding 24-month period for purchasing Federal timber required by the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990, (Pub. L. No. 101-382, August 20, 1990, 16 U.S.C. 620, et seq.) (Act). I hereby certify that I will cease all exporting of such unprocessed private timber from lands west of the 100th meridian in the 48 contiguous States of the United States by February 20, 1991. I make this certification with full knowledge and understanding of the requirements of this Act and do fully understand that failure to cease such exporting as certified will be a violation of this Act (16 U.S.C. 620d) and the False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001), and may subject me to the penalties and remedies provided from such violation.”
            
            
            (3) The certification must have been signed by the person making such certification or, in the case of a corporation, by its Chief Executive Officer.
            (e) Indirect substitution prohibition. No person may purchase from any other person unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States if such person would be prohibited by paragraph (a) of this section from purchasing such timber directly from a Department or agency of the United States, pursuant to § 490(b) of the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620, et seq.). The prohibition in this paragraph does not apply to the following:
            (1) To the acquisition of western red cedar, which is domestically processed into finished products.
            (2) To a person who acquires unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands within an approved sourcing area, does not export unprocessed timber originating from private lands within the approved sourcing area while the approval is in effect, and, if applicable, receives a waiver of the prohibition against exporting unprocessed timber originating from private lands within the sourcing area during the preceding 24 months in accordance with § 223.189 (f) and (g) of this subpart.

            (3) To the limited amount of unprocessed National Forest System timber within Washington State that is exempt from the prohibition against indirect substitution, pursuant to § 223.203.
            
            (f) Waiver within a sourcing area. The prohibitions in § 223.189(a) (1) and (2) against direct and indirect acquisition of unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands do not apply if:
            (1) A person acquires such timber from within an approved sourcing area located west of the 100th meridian in the 48 contiguous States;
            (2) Has not exported unprocessed timber originating from private lands located within the approved sourcing area during the preceding 24 months;
            (3) Does not export such private timber from within the approved sourcing area during the period the sourcing area is in effect; and
            (4) Does not export such private timber during any calendar year in the same geographic and economic area that unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States is under contract or in possession, if the sourcing area is no longer in effect, pursuant to the definition of substitution in 36 CFR 223.186.
            (5) The appropriate Regional Forester could waive, in writing, the prohibition against export within the preceding 24-month period for any person who certified in writing, on or before November 20, 1990, that on or before February 20, 1991, that person would cease exporting unprocessed timber originating from private lands within the approved sourcing area for a period of not less than three (3) years. Signatories of this certificate who received an approved sourcing area, like all holders of sourcing areas, are subject to the prohibition against exporting unprocessed timber originating from private lands within the sourcing area boundaries, pursuant to this paragraph.
            (g) Application for waiver within a sourcing area. To obtain a waiver of the prohibition against export within the preceding 24-month period for purchasing Federal timber described in paragraph (f) of this section, a person must have submitted a request for waiver, in writing, to the Regional Forester of the region in which the manufacturing facility being sourced is located, which must have been received by the Regional Forester on or before November 20, 1990, and which must have been signed by the person making such request or, in the case of a corporation, by its Chief Executive Officer. The request for waiver must be notarized and, in the case of a corporation, with its corporate seal affixed. The request shall be on company letterhead with its corporate seal affixed and must include:
            (1) An agreement to retain records of all transactions involving acquisition and disposition of unprocessed timber from both private and Federal lands within the area(s) involved in the waiver request, for a period of three (3) years beginning November 20, 1990, and to make such records available for inspection upon the request of the Regional Forester, or other official to whom such authority has been delegated.

            (2) A signed certification statement which reads as follows:
            
            

              “I have engaged in exporting of unprocessed timber originating from private land located within the sourcing area for which I am applying. I desire to purchase directly from a department or agency of the United States unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands located within the desired sourcing area. I hereby request waiver of the prohibition against export within the preceding 24-month period for purchasing Federal timber required by the forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (Pub. L. No. 101-382, August 20, 1990, 16 U.S.C. 620, et seq.) (Act). I hereby certify that I will cease all exporting of such unprocessed private timber from within the desired sourcing area by February 20, 1991, and will not resume such exporting for a period of not less than three (3) years. I make this certification with full knowledge and understanding of the requirements of this Act and do fully understand that failure to cease such exporting as certified will be a violation of Section 492 of this Act (16 U.S.C. 620d) and the False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001), and may subject me to the penalties and remedies provided for such violation.”
            
          
          
            § 223.190
            Sourcing area application procedures.

            (a) Subject to the restrictions described in § 223.189 of this subpart and, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a person who owns or operates a manufacturing facility and who exports unprocessed timber originating from private lands may apply for a sourcing area in accordance with the procedures of this section. However, an owner/operator of a manufacturing facility who exports unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands may not possess or acquire unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands unless the acquisition is within an approved sourcing area. A person who intends to acquire or become affiliated with a manufacturing facility that processes Federal timber and who is an exporter may apply for a sourcing area. Written proof of the intent to acquire or affiliate must be included in the sourcing area application, signed by the applicant and the person or, in the case of a corporation, the Chief Executive Officer, whose company the applicant intends to acquire or affiliate with. This certification must be on letterhead and must be notarized. A sourcing area application that the Secretary determines would be approved will be granted tentative approval pending final notification by the applicant of acquisition of or affiliation with the manufacturing facility. The tentative approval of the sourcing area will lapse unless the acquisition or affiliation occurs within 30 days of the tentative approval of the sourcing area. A sourcing area is not valid until final approval of the sourcing area. The direct substitution prohibition did not apply to a person who applied for a sourcing area on or before December 20, 1990. A request for modification of an existing sourcing area shall trigger a review pursuant to the procedures and restrictions in § 223.191(e).
            (b) As provided in the Act, a person who has requested an exemption or waiver of the prohibition against export within the preceding 24-month period, pursuant to § 223.189 of this subpart, must have applied for the desired sourcing area on or before December 20, 1990.
            (c) Applications. Sourcing area applications shall include:
            (1) A map of sufficient scale and detail to clearly show:
            (i) The applicant's desired sourcing area boundary. This boundary will include both the private and Federal lands from which the applicant intends to acquire unprocessed timber for sourcing its manufacturing facilities;
            (ii) The location of the timber manufacturing facilities owned or operated by the applicant within the proposed sourcing area where the person intends to process timber originating from Federal land;
            (iii) The location of private lands within and outside the desired sourcing area where the person has, within the 24 months immediately preceding the date of the application, acquired unprocessed timber originating from private land which was exported, sold, traded, exchanged, or otherwise conveyed to another person for the purpose of exporting such timber;
            (2) A list of other persons with timber manufacturing facilities located within the same general vicinity as the applicant's facilities;
            (3) Any other information the applicant may believe is appropriate to support approval of the requested sourcing area; and

            (4) A statement signed by the person certifying under the penalties provided in Section 492 of this Act (16 U.S.C. 620d) and the False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001) that the information provided in support of the application is true, complete, and accurate to the best of the applicant's knowledge. The statement shall read as follows:
            
            

              “I certify under penalties of 16 U.S.C. 620d and 18 U.S.C. 1001, that the information provided in support of this application, is true, complete, and accurate to the best of my knowledge concerning my timber purchasing and export patterns. I certify that the information provided concerning my timber purchasing and export patterns fully and accurately reflects, to the best of my knowledge, the boundaries of the sourcing area for which I am applying. I make this certification with full knowledge and understanding of the export and substitution restrictions of the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620, et seq.) (Act) and its implementing regulations. I certify that I have not exported unprocessed timber originating from private lands within the boundaries of the sourcing area that is the subject of this application in the previous 24 months. I fully understand that, if this application is approved, exporting unprocessed private timber originating from within the approved sourcing area will be a violation of this Act (16 U.S.C. 620, et seq.) its implementing regulations, and the False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001), and may subject me to the penalties and remedies provided for such violation.”
            
            
            
            (d) Confidential information. Applications are not considered confidential. However, if a person does submit confidential information as part of an application, the information should be marked confidential. Information so marked will be afforded the rights and protection provided under the Freedom of Information Act.
            (e) Where to submit the application. A sourcing area applicant shall send the application to the Office of Administrative Law Judges and shall, simultaneously, send a copy of the sourcing area application to the Forest Service Regional Forester of the region in which the manufacturing facility being sourced is located. Where the sourcing area application will cover purchases from more than one agency, application is to be made to the agency from which the applicant expects to purchase the preponderance of its Federal timber. The sourcing area applicant must also send a complete copy of the application to each agency concerned. The lead agency shall make the decision in consultation with, and upon co-signature of, the other agencies concerned.
            (f) Signatory procedures. Sourcing area applications must be signed by the person making the request, or in the case of a corporation, by its Chief Executive Officer, and must be notarized. The application shall be on company letterhead.

            (g) The sourcing area application and review process will be conducted pursuant to the Rules of Practice Governing the Adjudication of Sourcing Area Applications and Formal Review of Sourcing Areas Pursuant to the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620, et seq.), found at 7 CFR part 1, subpart M.
            (h) A final decision on a sourcing area application or a formal sourcing area review will be issued within four (4) months of the receipt of the application or initiation of the review.
            (i) The following criteria must be met for sourcing area approval:
            (1) The Administrative Law Judge, or, on appeal, the Judicial Officer must find that the proposed sourcing area is geographically and economically separate from any area that the applicant harvests or expects to harvest for export any unprocessed timber originating from private lands. In making such a finding, the Administrative Law Judge, or, on appeal, the Judicial Officer shall consider the timber purchasing patterns of the applicant on private and Federal lands equally with those of other persons in the same local vicinity and the relative similarity of such purchasing patterns.
            (2) The “same local vicinity” will normally be manufacturing facilities located within 30 miles of the community where the applicant's manufacturing facility is located, but may include more distant communities if manufacturing facilities in those communities depend on the same source of timber and have similar purchasing patterns.
            (3) The relative similarity of purchasing patterns of other mills shall be determined by considering the location and similarity of unprocessed timber being acquired by those facilities.
            (4) Lines defining the geographic area shall be based on major natural and cultural features, including, but not limited to, prominent ridge systems, main roads or highways, rivers, political subdivisions, and not characterized by random lines.
            (j) Comments. Persons may submit comments on sourcing area applications pursuant to the Rules of Practice Governing the Adjudication of Sourcing Area Applications and Formal Review of Sourcing Areas Pursuant to the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620, et seq.), found at 7 CFR part 1, subpart M. Persons submitting a comment must certify at the end of the comment, but before the signature, to the following: “I certify that the information provided by me is true and accurate, to the best of my knowledge, and I understand that failure to provide true and accurate information could be violation of the False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001).”

            (k) Transporting or causing to be transported unprocessed private timber from outside of a sourcing area into a sourcing area by the holder of the sourcing area is prohibited as a violation of the sourcing area boundary. Such violation will cause a review of the sourcing area, and could subject the sourcing area holder to the penalties and remedies for violations of the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990, 16 U.S.C. 620, et seq., and its implementing regulations.

            (l) A person with an approved sourcing area may relinquish the sourcing area at any time provided the person certifies to the following:
            
            

              “I am relinquishing the approved sourcing area, described in the Secretary's determination in FSAA ____ on ____, 19__. I understand that I may not export unprocessed timber originating from private lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States during the fiscal year in which I have unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States in my possession or under contract, pursuant to the prohibition against substitution in the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620, et seq.) (“Act”) and its implementing regulations. I also understand that I may not purchase unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States within 24 months of having exported unprocessed timber originating from private lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States, pursuant to the prohibitions against substitution in the Act and its implementing regulations. I make this certification with full knowledge and understanding of the Act and its implementing regulations and do fully understand that exporting unprocessed timber originating from private lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States during a fiscal year in which I have unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States in possession or under contract, or purchasing unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States within 24 months of having exported unprocessed timber originating from private lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States is a violation of the substitution provisions of the Act and the False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001), and may subject me to the penalties and remedies provided for such violation.”
            
            
            The certificate must be signed by the person making such certification or, in the case of a corporation, by its Chief Executive Officer; must be on company letterhead; and must be notarized.
            (m) A sourcing area is in effect until it is relinquished by the sourcing area holder, or is disapproved upon review of the sourcing area.
          
          
            § 223.191
            Sourcing area disapproval and review procedures.
            (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an applicant whose sourcing area application was submitted by December 20, 1990, and was disapproved could either phase out of purchasing Federal timber or phase out of exporting unprocessed timber originating from private lands within the sourcing area that would have been approved, as follows:
            (1) Phase-out of Federal timber purchasing. The applicant could purchase, in the 9-month period after receiving the application disapproval, unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands in the disapproved sourcing area, in an amount not to exceed 75 percent of the annual average of such person's purchases of unprocessed Federal timber in such area during the 5 full fiscal years immediately prior to the date of submission of the application. In the 6-month period immediately following the 9-month period, such person could purchase not more than 25 percent of such annual average, after which time the prohibitions against direct substitution, set forth in § 223.189 of this subpart, shall apply; or
            (2) Phase-out of private timber exporting. The applicant could continue to purchase unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands within the disapproved sourcing area without being subject to the phase-out of Federal timber purchasing procedures described in paragraph (a) of this section, if the following requirements were met:
            (i) The applicant certified to the Regional Forester or the approving official to whom such authority has been delegated, within 90 days after receiving the disapproval decision, as follows:

            (A) An applicant that has exported unprocessed timber originating from private lands from the geographic area that would have been approved provided a signed certification that reads as follows:
            
            

              “I have engaged in the exporting of unprocessed private timber originating from private lands located within the geographic area the approving official would have approved as a sourcing area for my manufacturing facility. I desire to continue purchasing unprocessed Federal timber from within such area. I hereby certify that I will cease all exporting of unprocessed timber from private lands located within the area that would have been approved by [the applicant shall insert date 15 months from date of receipt of the disapproval decision]. I agree to retain records of all transactions involving acquisition and disposition of unprocessed timber from both private and Federal lands within the area involved in the certification, for a period of three (3) years beginning on the date of receipt of the disapproval notification, and to make such records available for inspection upon the request of the Regional Forester, or other official to whom such authority has been delegated. I make this certification with full knowledge and understanding of the requirements of the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620, et seq.) (Act) and do fully understand that failure to cease such exporting as certified will be a violation of the Act and may subject me to the penalties and remedies for such violation. Further, I fully understand that such violation may subject me to the penalty of perjury pursuant to the False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001). I certify that the information in this certificate is true, complete, and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief.”;
            
            
            or,
            

            (B) An applicant who has not exported unprocessed timber originating from private lands from the geographic area that the Secretary would have approved provided a signed certification that reads as follows:
            
            

              “I have not exported timber originating from private lands within both the sourcing area that the Secretary would have approved and the disapproved sourcing area in the past 24 months, pursuant to the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620, et seq.), and I am accepting the area that the Secretary would have approved as my sourcing area. I certify that the information in this certificate is true, complete, and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief.”
            
            
            (ii) Each certification statement set forth in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section must have been signed by the person making such certification or, in the case of a corporation, by its Chief Executive Officer; must have been on company letterhead; must have been notarized; and must have had a corporate seal attached.
            (iii) The person signing such certification set forth in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A) of this section must have provided to the Regional Forester the annual volume of timber exported by that person during the five (5) full fiscal years immediately preceding submission of the application, originating from private lands in the geographic area for which the application would have been approved.
            (iv) When the applicant submitted the certificate, the area the Secretary would have approved, as shown on the sourcing area map provided by the Secretary, became an approved sourcing area. If the certificate was not submitted, the sourcing area that would have been approved did not become an approved sourcing area.
            (3) The phase-out of Federal timber purchasing and the phase-out of private timber exporting procedures provided by paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section do not apply to persons submitting sourcing area applications after December 20, 1990, or to persons requesting review of disapproved sourcing areas.
            (b) Limits on purchases and exports. (1) During the 15-month period following disapproval of a sourcing area, a person who elects to phase-out of private timber exporting as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, may not:
            (i) Purchase more than 125 percent of the person's annual average purchases of unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands within the person's disapproved sourcing area during the five (5) full fiscal years immediately prior to submission of the application; and,
            (ii) Export unprocessed timber originating from private lands in the geographic area determined by the approving official for which the application would have been approved, in amounts that exceed 125 percent of the annual average of that person's exports of unprocessed timber from such private land during the five (5) full years immediately prior to submission of the application.
            (2) At the conclusion of the 15-month export phase-out period, the prohibition against exporting private timber originating from within the area shall be in full force and effect as long as the sourcing area remains approved, pursuant to this subpart F of this part 223.
            (c) Presentation of map to applicant whose sourcing area is disapproved. The area determined by the deciding official that would have been approved shall be drawn on a map and presented to the applicant by the deciding official with the notice of disapproval of the application.
            (d) Effect of prior certification to cease exporting. An applicant's previous certification to cease exporting beginning February 20, 1991, for a period of three (3) years from within the disapproved sourcing area pursuant to paragraphs (f) and (g) in § 223.189 of this subpart shall remain in full force and effect for persons with approved and disapproved sourcing areas.
            (e) Review process and frequency. (1) Approved sourcing areas shall be reviewed not less often than every five (5) years. A tentative date for a review shall be included in the Administrative Law Judge's, or, on appeal, the Judicial Officer's determination or stated in writing by the Regional Forester following the determination. At least 60 days prior to the tentative review date, the Regional Forester or other such reviewing official shall notify the person holding the sourcing area of the pending review, publish notice of such review in newspapers of general circulation within the sourcing area, and invite comments, to be received no later than 30 days from the date of the notice, from all interested persons, including the person holding the sourcing area. For 10 working days following the comment period, any person submitting a written comment and the person with the sourcing area may review the comments. If there is disagreement among the persons who submitted written comments regarding the proper sourcing area, the reviewing official shall convene an informal meeting convenient to the persons that all interested persons may attend. If an agreement cannot be reached among the persons, formal administrative adjudication shall occur. The Administrative Law Judge, or, on appeal, the Judicial Officer shall, on the record and after opportunity for a hearing, approve or disapprove the sourcing area being reviewed, pursuant to the Rules of Practice Governing the Adjudication of Sourcing Area Applications and Formal Review of Sourcing Areas Pursuant to the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620, et seq.), found at 7 CFR part 1, subpart M.
            (2) Disapproved sourcing areas shall be reviewed using the process described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section upon resubmission of an application, provided the applicant has accepted the area the Secretary would have approved as a sourcing area pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
            (3) The Department reserves the right to schedule a review, at the request of the Forest Service or the person holding the sourcing area, at any time prior to the scheduled tentative review date, with 60 days notice.
            (4) Sourcing areas being reviewed shall continue in full force and effect pending the final review determination.
            (f) Reporting and record keeping procedures. The reporting and record keeping procedures in this section constitute information collection requirements as defined in 5 CFR part 1320. These requirements have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget and assigned clearance number 0596-0115.

            (c) Except as otherwise provided by law, a person who transfers unprocessed private timber to another person and meets all notice, certification, acknowledgement, distribution, reporting and record keeping requirements contained in this section shall be relieved from further liability for such timber with regard to the export and substitution restrictions pursuant to the Act.
          
          
            § 223.195
            Procedures for identifying and marking unprocessed timber.
            (a) Highway yellow paint. The use of highway yellow paint on unprocessed logs west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States shall be reserved for identifying logs requiring domestic manufacturing.
            (b) Preserving identification. All identifying marks placed on an unprocessed log to identify the National Forest System origin of that log and/or to identify the log as requiring domestic processing shall be retained on the log until the log is domestically processed. If the identifying marks are lost, removed, or become unreadable, they shall be replaced. If the log is cut into two or more segments, each segment shall be identified in the same manner as the original log.
            (1) A generic log hammer brand, known as a “catch brand”, used to identify ownership, may be used to replace lost, removed, unreadable or otherwise missing brands where such use is authorized by the Regional Forester and approved by the Contracting Officer. Use of such a catch brand on a log or log segment will signify Federal origin.
            (2) The requirement to preserve identification of log pieces shall not apply to logs cut into two or more segments as a part of the mill in-feed process immediately before processing. Log segments that are returned to or placed in storage must be marked on both ends with yellow paint.
            (c) National Forest System logs. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, all unprocessed logs originating from National Forest System timber sales west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States shall, before being removed from the timber sale area, be marked on each end as follows:
            (1) Painted on each end with a spot of highway yellow paint not less than three square inches in size; and,

            (2) Branded on each end with a hammer brand approved for use by the Forest Supervisor of the National Forest from which the logs originate. The brand pattern may not be used to mark logs from any other source for a period of 24 months after all logs have been removed from the sale area and until such brand pattern is released in writing by the Forest Supervisor.
            (d) Private logs. All unprocessed logs originating from private lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States that require domestic manufacturing pursuant to § 223.194 of this subpart, shall be painted on each end with a spot of highway yellow paint not less than three (3) square inches in size before removal from the harvest area. If private logs are acquired by a person who may not export such logs, the logs must be marked by the person acquiring the logs at the time of the acquisition.
            (e) Waiver of painting requirements. The log painting requirements pursuant to paragraphs (c)(1) and (d) of this section may be waived if the Chief of the Forest Service determines that alternate methods for identifying logs required to be domestically processed are equal to or better than the procedures required herein.
            (f) Waiver of branding requirements. Regional Foresters may waive the branding requirements pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section as follows:
            (1) Regions 1, 2, 3, and 4. On an individual timber sale basis, all or a portion of the branding requirements pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section may be waived, if:
            (i) Unprocessed logs from any origin are not known to have been exported by any person from the person's area of operations within the previous 5; years.
            (ii) The person certifies as follows:
            
            

              “I hereby request waiver of the requirements to brand each end of individual logs originating from the ____ timber sale, Forest Service contract number ____ pursuant to 36 CFR 223.195. I certify that I have not exported or sold for export unprocessed timber from private lands within my area of operations in five years. I certify that I understand, that if granted, the waiver applies only to unprocessed logs being processed within my area of operations. I certify that any unprocessed logs to which this waiver applies that are transferred, or sold for transfer, outside my area of operations will be branded on both ends in full compliance with 36 CFR 223.195. I make this certification with full knowledge and understanding of the requirement of the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620, et seq.) (Act) and its implementing regulations at 36 CFR part 223. I fully understand that failure to abide by the terms of the waiver will be a violation of this Act (16 U.S.C. 620, et seq.) and the False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001) and may subject me to the penalties and remedies provided for such violation.”;
            
            
            and,
            
            (iii) The person otherwise complies with the regulations relating to transfers of logs between persons.
            (iv) If the Regional Forester determines that unprocessed logs from my origin are being exported, or are known to have been exported within the previous 5 years, by any person from the person's area of operations, the Regional Forester shall revoke the waiver.
            (2) Regions 5 and 6. On an individual timber sale basis, the branding requirement pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section may be waived for logs ten (10) inches or less in diameter inside bark on the large end may be waived if:
            (i) One end of each log is branded;
            (ii) The person certifies as follows:
            
            

              “I hereby request waiver of the requirement to brand each end of individual logs ten (10) inches or less in diameter inside bark on the large end, originating from the ____ timber sale, U.S. contract number ____ pursuant to 36 CFR 223.195. I certify that I understand, if granted, that the waiver applies only to unprocessed logs being processed at ____, and further certify that any and all unprocessed logs to which waiver would apply that are transferred, or sold for transfer, will be branded on both ends in full compliance 36 CFR 223.195. I make this certification with full knowledge and understanding of the requirements of the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (Pub. L. No. 101-382, August 20, 1990; 16 U.S.C. 620, et seq.) (Act) and its implementing regulations at 36 CFR Part 223.

            and,
            

            (iii) The purchaser otherwise complies with the regulations relating to transfers of logs between persons.
            
            (iv) If the Regional Forester determines that logs ten (10) inches or less in diameter inside bark on the large end are being exported in the Region, the Regional Forester shall revoke the waiver.
            (3) The Chief of the Forest Service may authorize the testing of alternative methods of branding for consideration in future amendment of these regulations. Such alternative methods and logs marked under those methods shall be closely monitored.
          
          
            § 223.196
            Civil penalties for violation.
            (a) Exporting Federal timber. If the Secretary of Agriculture finds, on the record and after providing an opportunity for a hearing, that a person, with willful disregard for the prohibition in the Act exporting unprocessed Federal timber, exported or caused to be exported unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands in violation of the Act, the Secretary may assess against such person a civil penalty of not more than $500,000 for each violation, or 3 times the gross value of the unprocessed timber involved in the violation, whichever amount is greater.
            (b) Other violations. If the Secretary of Agriculture finds, on the record and after providing an opportunity for a hearing, that a person has violated any provision of the Act, or any regulation issued under the Act relating to National Forest System lands, even though that the violation may not have caused the export of unprocessed Federal timber in violation of such Act, the Secretary may:
            (1) Assess against such person a civil penalty of not more than $500,000, if the Secretary determines that the person committed such violation willfully;
            (2) Assess against such person a civil penalty of not more than $75,000 for each violation, if the Secretary determines that the person committed such violation in disregard of such provision or regulation; or
            (3) Assess against such person a civil penalty of not more than $50,000 for each violation, if the Secretary determines that the person should have known that the action constituted a violation.
            (c) Penalties not exclusive and judicial review. A penalty assessed under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section shall not be exclusive of any other penalty provided by law, and shall be subject to review in an appropriate United States district court.
          
          
            § 223.197
            Civil penalty assessment procedures.

            Adjudicatory procedures for hearing alleged violations of this Act and its implementing regulations and assessing penalties shall be conducted under the rules of practice governing formal adjudicatory proceedings instituted by the Secretary. Such procedures are found at 7 CFR 1.130, et seq.
            
          
          
            § 223.198
            Administrative remedies.
            In addition to possible debarment action provided under subpart C of this part, the Chief of the Forest Service, or other official to whom such authority is delegated, may cancel any timber sale contract entered into with a person found to have violated the Act or regulations issued under the Act. Such a finding shall constitute a serious violation of contract terms pursuant to § 223.116(a)(1) of this part.
          
          
            § 223.199

            The Regional Foresters may enter into agreements to cooperate with the Department of the Interior, the Department of Defense, and other Federal, State and local agencies for monitoring, surveillance and enforcing the Act.
          
          
            § 223.200
            Determinations of surplus species.
            (a) Determinations that specific quantities of grades and species are surplus to domestic manufacturing needs and withdrawals of such determinations shall be made in accordance with title 5, United States Code, section 553.

            (b) Review of a determination shall be made at least once in every 3-year period. Notice of such review shall be published in the Federal Register. The public shall have no less than 30 days to submit comments on the review.

            (c) Alaska yellow cedar and Port Orford cedar, which the Secretary of Agriculture found to be surplus to domestic processing needs pursuant to 36 CFR 223.163, the rules in effect before August 20, 1990, shall continue in that status until new determinations are published.
          
          
            § 223.201
            Limitations on unprocessed timber harvested in Alaska.
            Unprocessed timber from National Forest System lands in Alaska may not be exported from the United States or shipped to other States without prior approval of the Regional Forester. This requirement is necessary to ensure the development and continued existence of adequate wood processing capacity in Alaska for the sustained utilization of timber from the National Forests which are geographically isolated from other processing facilities. In determining whether consent will be given for the export of timber, consideration will be given to, among other things, whether such export will:
            (a) Permit more complete utilization on areas being logged primarily for local manufacture,
            (b) Prevent loss or serious deterioration of logs unsalable locally because of an unforeseen loss of market,
            (c) Permit the salvage of timber damaged by wind, insects, fire or other catastrophe,
            (d) Bring into use a minor species of little importance to local industrial development, or
            (e) Provide material required to meet urgent and unusual needs of the Nation. (16 U.S.C. 472a; 16 U.S.C. 551; 16 U.S.C. 616)
          
          
            § 223.202
            Information requirements.
            (a) The procedures in §§ 223.189 and 223.192, and some of the procedures in § 223.190 were approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and assigned Control Number 0596-0114 upon issuance of the interim rule. Control Number 0596-0114 has been reapproved by OMB for use through May 31, 1997. OMB approved the information collection requirements in §§ 223.191 and 223.203 for use through August 31, 1995, and assigned them Control Number 0596-0115. OMB approved the information collection requirements in §§ 223.48 and 223.87 for use through March 31, 1997 and assigned them Control Number 0596-0021; the information collection requirements in §§ 223.48 and 223.87 have been revised. OMB Control Numbers 0596-0114, 0596-0115, and 0596-0021 have been consolidated under OMB Control Number 0596-0114.
            (b) The application and reporting procedures in §§ 223.187, 223.193, 223.194, 223.195, and some of the procedures in § 223.190 of this final rule contain new record keeping and reporting requirements as defined in 5 CFR part 1320 and, therefore, impose additional paperwork burdens on the affected public. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved these requirements, and assigned them Control Number 0596-0114.
          
          
            § 223.203
            Indirect substitution exception for National Forest System timber from within Washington State.
            (a) Exception limits. A limited amount of unprocessed National Forest System timber originating from within Washington State could have been acquired by a person otherwise covered by the prohibition against indirect substitution, pursuant to § 490(b) of the Act and § 223.189(e) of this subpart.
            (1) The amount of such unprocessed timber was limited to whichever is less:
            (i) The higher of the applicant's actual purchase receipts for unprocessed timber originating from National Forest System lands within Washington State or the Department's records, during fiscal years 1988, 1989, and 1990, divided by 3; or
            (ii) 15 million board feet.
            (2) Such limit shall not exceed such person's proportionate share of 50 million board feet.
            (b) Application, review and approval process. To obtain a share of the 50 million board feet exempted from the prohibition against indirect substitution in section 490(b) of the Act, a person must have submitted an application.

            (5) Prospective applicants could review Department records upon request prior to the deadline for submitting applications. An applicant could voluntarily submit information documenting the amount of purchases of unprocessed timber originating from National Forest System lands within Washington State. The Department then determined which amount is higher, verified by either the Department's records or the applicant's records. The Department then determined the applicant's portion of the 50 million board feet by determining the lesser of the amount verified by the records or 15 million board feet. Applicants could submit the information documenting the amount of purchases in the following manner:
            (i) Actual receipts for purchasing unprocessed timber from National Forest System lands within Washington State; or
            (ii) A statement by a certified public accountant of:
            (A) A summary by fiscal year for 1988, 1989 and 1990 of the applicant's acquisitions of timber originating from National Forest System lands in the State of Washington, listing total volume for each of the three fiscal years; and
            (B) The average volume for the three fiscal years. The volumes to be reported were the harvest volumes, except in the case of open sales. Advertised volumes had to be reported for open sales.

            (C) The certified public accountant must have certified to the following:

            (D) The certified public accountant's statement and certification must have been on the accountant's company letterhead, must have been notarized, and must have accompanied the applicant's application.
            (c) Selling and trading rights. The purchase limit right obtained under this rule may be sold, traded, or otherwise exchanged with any other person subject to the following conditions:

            (1) Such rights may not be sold, traded, or otherwise exchanged to persons already in possession of such rights:
            
            (2) Any person selling, trading, or exchanging any or all of the rights obtained under this rule shall advise the Regional Forester of the amount being traded and the name(s) of the person(s) acquiring such rights within 15 days of the transaction; and
            (3) No person may have or acquire more than 15 million board feet in one fiscal year.
            (d) Information collection. The application procedures in this section constitute information collection requirements as defined in 5 CFR part 1320. These requirements have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget and assigned clearance number 0596-0114.

            § 223.217
            Authority to dispose of special forest products.

            The Forest Service has authority to dispose of special forest products located on National Forest System lands pursuant to the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960, as amended (16 U.S.C. 528-531); the National Forest Management Act of 1976, as amended (16 U.S.C. 472a et seq.); and, the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1600-1614).
          
          
            
            § 223.218
            Consistency with plans, environmental standards, and other management requirements.
            The disposal of special forest products from National Forest System lands shall be consistent with applicable land management plans. Each contract, permit, or other authorizing instrument shall include, as appropriate, provisions requiring the person or user to:
            (a) Provide fire protection and suppression;
            (b) Protect natural resources;
            (c) Regenerate harvested species after harvesting operations;
            (d) Minimize soil erosion;
            (e) Maintain favorable conditions of water flow and quality;
            (f) Minimize adverse effects on, protect, or enhance other national forest resources, uses, and improvements; and

            § 223.219
            Sustainable harvest of special forest products.
            (a) Sustainable harvest levels. Prior to offering a special forest product for sale or free use, the responsible forest officer must determine the product's sustainable harvest level. A special forest product's sustainable harvest level is the total quantity of the product that can be harvested annually in perpetuity on a sustained yield basis. Responsible forest officers shall not authorize harvest or free use of special forest products in an amount exceeding known sustainable harvest levels. In determining a sustainable harvest level, the responsible forest officer may consider harvest levels of the product for the previous three years, if such information is available. Responsible forest officers may consider factors such as year-to-year and site-to-site variability, climate, weather change, geographic scale, and scientific data available prior to making their sustainability determination and establishing monitoring time frames consistent with paragraph (c) of this section. Responsible forest officers will consult with Tribes, to the extent appropriate, to determine sustainable harvest levels based on historical information. In addition, responsible forest officers may consult with other appropriate parties to determine sustainable harvest levels based on historical information.
            (b) Harvest of protected species. The sale or free use of special forest products listed or proposed for listing as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act is prohibited, except as authorized by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Moreover, regional guidelines will identify when the sale or free use of any special forest product listed on the Regional Forester's sensitive plant list, species of concern list, species of interest list, or protected under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species may be authorized.
            (c) Monitoring of established harvest levels. At least once every three fiscal years, or as otherwise established by the Regional Forester, the Forest Service shall monitor the effects of harvesting on the sustainability of special forest products. Such monitoring may include, but is not limited to, on-site examination of the product, including both harvested and non-harvested areas, and a review of past and projected harvest levels to the extent such information is available.
            (d) Revision of harvest levels. The sustainable harvest level for a special forest product may be increased or decreased, as appropriate, based on monitoring.
          
          
            § 223.220
            Quantity determination.
            Sale contracts, permits, or other authorizing instruments may provide for determining the quantity of special forest products by scaling, measuring, weighing, counting, or other reliable means.
          
          
            Appraisal and Pricing

              The Chief of the Forest Service shall determine the appraised value of special forest products. Valid methods to determine appraised value include, but are not limited to, transaction evidence appraisals, analytical appraisals, comparison appraisals, and independent estimates based on average investments. Special forest products must be sold at minimum rates or appraised value, whichever is higher.

              Advance payment.
              Contracts, permits, or other authorizing instruments for the sale of special forest products shall require advance payment, unless the contract, permit, or instrument authorizes the person to furnish a payment guarantee satisfactory to the Forest Service.

              § 223.225
              Term.
              The term of any contract, permit, or other authorizing instrument for the sale of special forest products shall not exceed 10 years, unless the Secretary of Agriculture finds that better utilization of the various forest resources consistent with the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960, as amended (16 U.S.C. 528-531) will result. Any such finding by the Secretary of Agriculture shall be made in writing.
            
            
              § 223.226
              Term adjustments for force majeure delay.
              Contracts or other authorizing instruments for the sale of special forest products, excluding permits, may contain a provision allowing the term to be extended if circumstances beyond the person's reasonable control delay performance. In determining whether such an extension is appropriate, responsible forest officers shall consider the value of the products or species, the length and type of authorizing instrument, the need for early/accelerated harvest, and any other appropriate factors. Circumstances beyond a person's reasonable control may include, but are not limited to, acts of God, acts of the public enemy, acts of the Government, labor disputes, fires, insurrections, and floods. The responsible forest officer may grant such an extension upon finding:
              (a) Circumstances beyond the person's reasonable control delayed performance; and
              (b) The person has diligently performed in accordance with the contract or other authorizing instrument.

              Bid restriction on resale of incomplete contracts, permits, or other instruments.
              In any resale of special forest products remaining from a previous sale, the Forest Service shall not consider a bid submitted by a person who failed to complete or defaulted the original contract, permit, or other instrument authorizing the sale, or from any affiliate of such person, except when such consideration serves the public interest.

              § 223.232
              Disclosure of relation to other bidders.
              The Forest Service may require any prospective bidder for special forest products to disclose its relationship with other potential bidders or operators. Such disclosure may include a certified statement listing:
              (a) Stockholders or members of the bidder's firm;
              (c) Officers;
              
              (d) Members of the board of directors; or

            Award of Contracts, Permits, or Other Authorizing Instruments
            
              § 223.233
              Award to highest bidder.
              (a) The Forest Service shall award contracts, permits, or other authorizing instruments for advertised sales as follows:
              (1) The Forest Service will award a special forest products sale to the responsible bidder that submits the highest bid that conforms to the sale conditions in the prospectus.
              (2) If the highest bidder cannot meet the conditions for the sale, as specified in the prospectus, the Forest Service may:
              (i) Reject all bids and reoffer the sale, or
              (ii) Offer the award at the high bid level to the next highest qualified bidder until the award is accepted or refused by all of the conforming bidders.
              (iii) In the event of a tie between two or more responsible high bidders submitting conforming bids, the Forest Service shall award the sale by drawing of lots.
              (iv) If no bids meet the specified conditions in the sale's prospectus, or if there are other irregularities in the bidding process, the Forest Service may reject all bids, and, at its discretion, reoffer the sale.
              (b) [Reserved]
            
            
              § 223.234
              Determination of responsibility.
              (a) A Contracting Officer shall not award a contract, permit, or other instrument authorizing the sale of special forest products to a declared high bidder unless that officer makes an affirmative determination that the person is responsible. In the absence of information clearly establishing that the declared high bidder is responsible, the Contracting Officer shall conclude that the declared high bidder is not responsible.
              (b) In order to make an affirmative determination of responsibility, the Contracting Officer must find that:
              (1) The declared high bidder has adequate financial resources to perform the contract, permit, or other authorizing instrument, or the ability to obtain such resources;
              (2) The declared high bidder is able to complete the contract, permit, or other authorizing instrument within the relevant term, taking into consideration the declared high bidder's other existing commercial and governmental obligations;
              (3) The declared high bidder has a satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics;
              (4) The declared high bidder has or is able to obtain equipment and supplies suitable for harvesting the special forest product(s) and for meeting applicable resource protection requirements;
              (5) The declared high bidder is otherwise qualified and eligible to receive an award of a contract, permit, or other authorizing instrument under all applicable laws and regulations;
              (6) The declared high bidder has a satisfactory performance record on contracts, permits, and other agreements with the U.S. Government. Failure to apply sufficient diligence and perseverance to perform a contract, permit, or other instrument is strong evidence that a declared high bidder is not responsible. A declared high bidder that is, or has been deficient in performance shall be deemed not responsible, unless the declared high bidder demonstrates that the deficiency arose from circumstances beyond their reasonable control.
              (c) Affiliated concerns, as defined in 36 CFR 223.49(a)(5), are normally considered separate entities in determining whether the declared high bidder that is to perform the contract meets the applicable standards for responsibility. However, the responsible Forest Officer shall consider an affiliate's past performance and integrity when they may adversely affect the responsibility of the declared high bidder.
            
            
              § 223.235
              Unilateral delay, suspension, or modification of contracts, permits, or other instruments authorizing the sale of special forest products.
              (a) Reasons for delay, suspension or modification. The Forest Service may unilaterally delay, suspend, or modify any contract, permit, or instrument authorizing the sale or free use of special forest products for any of the following reasons:
              (1) To prevent actual or potential harm to the environment, including without limitation, harm to land, water, air, habitat, plants, animals, cave resources, or cultural resources;
              (2) To ensure consistency with land management plans or other management documents;

              (3) To conduct environmental analyses, including, without limitation, consultation under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, 16 U.S.C. 1531, et seq;
              
              (4) Existing or threatened litigation that might affect or involve a person's harvest of special forest products; or
              (5) For any reasons or other conditions set forth in the contract, permit, or other authorizing instrument governing the sale.
              (b) Compensation. (1) The Forest Service may compensate a person for the unilateral delay, suspension or modification of a contract, permit, or other authorizing instrument in accordance with the applicable provisions set forth in such document or, in the absence of such provisions, in accordance with applicable Forest Service methods and procedures in effect when a claim for compensation is submitted, giving due consideration to the cause, duration, and financial impact of the delay, suspension or modification.
              (2) A person submitting a claim must comply with claim provisions in the governing contract, permit, or other authorizing instrument, or, in the absence of such provisions, must submit a written claim for compensation accompanied by supporting documentation that fully substantiates the claim.
              (c) Authority to unilaterally delay, suspend or modify. The Contracting Officer administering the sale or a responsible superior officer may delay, suspend, or modify the contract, permit, or other authorizing instrument by issuing instructions to a person to delay, suspend, or modify operations.

              § 223.236
              Unilateral termination.
              (a) Reasons for Unilateral Termination. The Forest Service may unilaterally terminate a contract, permit, or other instrument authorizing the sale or free use of special forest products for any of the following reasons:
              (1) Any of the reasons provided in § 223.235(a);
              (2) Material breach or continued violation of the contract, permit or other authorizing instrument;
              (3) Violation of any Federal or State laws or regulations related to:
              (i) Obtaining, attempting to obtain, selling, trading, or processing special forest products;
              (ii) Obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public contract or subcontract;
              (iii) Harming or damaging public lands or protected species; or
              (iv) Business integrity, honesty, or responsibility.
              (b) Compensation. (1) The Forest Service may compensate a person for the unilateral termination of a contract, permit, or other authorizing instrument in accordance with the applicable provisions set forth in such document or, in the absence of such provisions, in accordance with applicable Forest Service methods and procedures in effect when a claim for compensation is submitted, giving due consideration to the cause, duration, and financial impact of the termination.
              (2) A person submitting a claim must comply with claim provisions in the governing contract, permit, or other authorizing instrument, or, in the absence of such provisions, must submit a written claim for compensation accompanied by supporting documentation that fully substantiates the claim.
              (3) No compensation shall be provided if the unilateral termination is due in whole or in part to the reasons set forth at § 223.236(a)(2) or (3).
              (c) Authority to unilaterally terminate. The Chief, or the Chief's designee, has the authority to unilaterally terminate a contract, permit, or other instrument authorizing the sale or free use of special forest products. Any such termination shall be issued in writing, except when exigent circumstances warrant oral communication, in which case a written communication shall follow promptly.
            
            
              § 223.237
              Request for delay, suspension, modification, or termination.
              (a) Request. A person authorized to harvest special forest products may request delay, suspension, modification, or termination of their contract, permit, or other authorizing instrument pursuant to the provisions set forth in the contract, permit, or instrument, if any, or for another reasonable cause, including without limitation, catastrophic damage to the product or substantially changed market conditions. Any such request must be submitted in writing and include a detailed explanation of all relevant circumstances supporting the request.
              (b) Response. The Forest Service shall respond to any request for delay, suspension, modification, or termination in accordance with applicable provisions in the contract, permit, or other authorizing instrument, or, in the absence of such provisions, respond in a manner that is reasonable in light of the request's circumstances. The Forest Service may deny any request, in whole or in part, in accordance with the provisions of the relevant contract, permit, or instrument, or, in the absence of such provisions, at the Agency's discretion.
              (c) Authority. The Contracting Officer administering a sale or a superior officer has the authority to deny or grant any request by a person authorized to harvest special forest products to delay, modify, suspend, or terminate a contract, permit, or other authorizing instrument.

              § 223.238
              Free use authorization to U.S. Army and Navy.
              Subject to delegations of authority by the Chief, Regional Foresters may approve the harvest of special forest products by the U.S. Army and Navy for the purposes identified at 16 U.S.C. 492.
            
            
              § 223.239
              Free use by individuals.
              (a) Free use. A person may harvest a special forest product from National Forest System lands free of charge for personal, non-commercial use up to the amount or quantity authorized by a designated Forest Service officer, a Forest Supervisor, or a Regional Forester, as delegated at 36 CFR 223.8.
              (b) Free use without a permit up to the incidental use harvest level. No permit is required for the free use of a special forest product at or below that product's incidental-use harvest level, which shall be determined at the discretion of the regional forester or a subordinate officer. The incidental use harvest level covers small amounts of special forest products, such as cones, mushrooms, berries, acorns, black walnuts, or medicinal roots. Any free use of a special forest product that does not have an incidental-use harvest level is subject to this section's permit requirements.
              (c) Free-use permit requirement. No person seeking free use of a special forest product, except one identified in § 223.239(e), may harvest a special forest product above the product's incidental-use harvest level without submitting an application to a forest officer and obtaining a free-use permit, unless the permit requirement has been waived for a specific special forest product in a designated free-use area.
              (d) Contents of the permit. The permit shall indicate the type, amount, and/or value of the product to be harvested, the permit's duration, and shall contain other restrictions and requirements as appropriate.
              (e) Free use without a permit for members of Tribes with treaty or other reserved rights related to special forest products. A member of a Tribe with treaty or other reserved rights related to special forest products retains his/her ability to harvest such products in full accordance with existing rights, including free-use harvest without obtaining a free-use permit, as specified in treaty or other reserved rights.
              
              (f) Free use without a permit upon the request of the governing body of a Tribe. At the Agency's discretion, responsible forest officers may, upon the request of an authorized representative of the governing body of a Tribe, issue a permit that would not otherwise be required under paragraph (e) of this section to a Tribe with treaty or other reserved rights related to special forest products for the free use of a specified quantity of special forest products. That Tribe may then allocate specified quantities of the special forest product(s) to individual Tribal members, up to the maximum amount specified in the Tribal free-use permit. Any Tribe issued such a permit must provide the Forest Service with information related to the permitted harvest, upon request.
              (g) Free-use restrictions. A Forest Officer may set conditions on the free-use harvest of a special forest product or deny the free use of a special forest product. Reasons for denying free-use access or setting conditions on free use, except as specified in § 223.240, may include, but are not limited to:
              (1) Ensuring public safety;
              (2) Preventing interference with Forest Service and/or commercial operations;
              (3) Ensuring the sustainability of a special forest product; or
              (4) Otherwise protecting National Forest System land.
              (h) Unilateral termination of a free-use permit. The responsible forest officer, or any superior officer, may terminate a free use permit without compensation at any time for reasons including, but not limited to, resource protection, weather factors, fire season, road access, conflicts with other users, or permit violations.
              (i) Subsistence in Alaska. This section does not affect subsistence uses implemented under Title VIII of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. 3101-3126).
            
            
              § 223.240
              Tribes and treaty and other reserved rights.
              Tribes with treaty or other reserved rights related to special forest products retain their ability to harvest special forest products in full accordance with existing rights. However, consistent with all applicable rights, Regional Foresters may set conditions on Tribes with treaty or other reserved rights related to special forest products to protect the sustainability of special forest products or to otherwise protect National Forest System land. Regional Foresters may only prohibit Tribes with treaty or other reserved rights related to special forest products from harvesting a special forest product to protect public health and safety or to ensure sustainable harvest levels. Regional Foresters will provide a Tribe with treaty or other reserved rights related to special forest products that is prohibited from harvesting a special forest product with written documentation supporting the decision.
            
            
              § 223.241
              Disposal of seized special forest products.
              The Forest Service may dispose of seized special forest products that have been illegally obtained from National Forest System lands by sale or free use. Any sale of such products shall be conducted in accordance with the requirements of this subpart; however, no seized special forest products shall be sold to the person who collected them illegally. The Forest Service shall not dispose of a seized product by sale or free use if that product is:
              (a) Listed or proposed for listing as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act;
              (b) Identified as prohibited for sale or trade under the Convention on Internal Trade in Endangered Species; or
              (c) Listed on the Regional Forester's sensitive plant list, species of concern list, or species of interest list.

              Supplemental guidance, Memorandum of Agreements and Memorandums of Understanding.

              Consistent with subparts G and H of this part, regional foresters may issue supplemental guidance and approve Memorandums of Agreement and Memorandums of Understanding to promote local collaboration, issue resolution, and local implementation of these regulations. Existing Memorandums of Agreement and Memorandums of Understanding related to forest products must be made consistent with subparts G and H within 24 months from December 29, 2008 or those agreements will terminate.

            81 FR 3721, Jan. 22, 2016, unless otherwise noted.
          
          
            § 223.300
            Applicability.
            (a) This part sets forth the regulations applicable to the implementation of section 604 of the Healthy Forest Restoration Act of 2003, “Stewardship End Result Contracting Projects” 16 U.S.C. 6591c. This section provides for the use of contracts and agreements to achieve land management goals for the national forests and the public lands that meet local and rural community needs. In the fulfillment of these activities, the Forest Service may apply the value of timber or other forest products removed from the project site as an offset against the cost of services received under such contracts or agreements.
            (b)(1) Procurement of service contracts. If the Forest Service makes a determination as provided under section 223.301(b)(1) of this subpart that a stewardship contract is a contract for the procurement of services, the Forest Service will utilize the contracting procedures set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulations, Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations including the regulations issued by the Department of Agriculture set forth in Chapter 4 of Title 48 as well as requirements included in § 223.303.
            (2) Sale of property contracts. If the Forest Service makes a determination under § 223.301(b)(2) of this subpart that a stewardship contract is to be a contract for the sale of property, the regulations set forth in subparts A and B of this part are generally applicable, except as provided in § 223.304.
            
            (3) Agreements. Agreements entered into under this subpart are not subject to grant regulations found in 2 CFR part 200 as adopted and supplemented by the USDA in 2 CFR parts 400, 416, and 422.
            (4) Other provisions. Additional terms and conditions for contracts and agreements may be added to a contract or agreement entered into under this subpart, in accordance with applicable law and to the extent determined to be necessary by the Forest Service.
            (c) Parties to contracts and agreements. The Forest Service may enter into contracts and agreements under this part with private persons, private entities and public entities.
          
          
            § 223.301
            Determination of type of contract or agreement.
            (a) Use of a contract or agreement. When the Forest Service initiates a project under this subpart, a determination will be made whether to use a contract or an agreement to implement the project.
            (b) Type of contract. If the Forest Service determines that a contract will be utilized:
            (1) Procurement of service contracts. When the value of timber or other forest products removed through the contract will be less than the total value of the service work items received by the Forest Service, the activity shall be considered a procurement of a service and a contract, for a period not to exceed 10 years, will be utilized as provided in § 223.303 or
            (2) Sale of property contracts. When the value of timber or other forest products removed through the contract is equal to or exceeds the total value of the service work items received by the Forest Service, the activity shall be considered a sale of property and a contract, for a period not to exceed 10 years, will be utilized as provided in § 223.304.
            (c) Best interest of the government determination. The Forest Service official who makes a determination under paragraph (b) of this section shall document in the contract file the basis for the determination that:
            (1) It is in the best interest of the government that a sale of property contract is more suitable for a contract that would otherwise be subject to paragraph (b)(1) of this section; or
            (2) It is in the best interest of the government that a procurement of service contract is more suitable for a contract that would otherwise be subject to paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
          
          
            § 223.302
            Award of contracts and agreements.
            Section 604(d) of HFRA requires that a source for performance of a stewardship agreement or contract be selected on a best-value basis. A stewardship agreement or contract may also be entered into notwithstanding subsections (d) and (g) of section 14 of the National Forest Management Act of 1976 (16 U.S.C. 472a).

          Subpart A—Locatable Minerals
          
            § 228.1
            Purpose.

            It is the purpose of these regulations to set forth rules and procedures through which use of the surface of National Forest System lands in connection with operations authorized by the United States mining laws (30 U.S.C. 21-54), which confer a statutory right to enter upon the public lands to search for minerals, shall be conducted so as to minimize adverse environmental impacts on National Forest System surface resources. It is not the purpose of these regulations to provide for the management of mineral resources; the responsibility for managing such resources is in the Secretary of the Interior.
          
          
            § 228.2
            Scope.

            These regulations apply to operations hereafter conducted under the United States mining laws of May 10, 1872, as amended (30 U.S.C. 22 et seq.), as they affect surface resources on all National Forest System lands under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Agriculture to which such laws are applicable: Provided, however, That any area of National Forest lands covered by a special Act of Congress (16 U.S.C. 482a-482q) is subject to the provisions of this part and the provisions of the special act, and in the case of conflict the provisions of the special act shall apply.
          
          
            § 228.3
            Definitions.
            For the purposes of this part the following terms, respectively, shall mean:
            (a) Operations. All functions, work, and activities in connection with prospecting, exploration, development, mining or processing of mineral resources and all uses reasonably incident thereto, including roads and other means of access on lands subject to the regulations in this part, regardless of whether said operations take place on or off mining claims.
            (b) Operator. A person conducting or proposing to conduct operations.
            (c) Person. Any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity.
            (d) Mining claim. Any unpatented mining claim or unpatented millsite authorized by the United States mining laws of May 10, 1872, as amended (30 U.S.C. 22 et seq.).
            (e) Authorized officer. The Forest Service officer to whom authority to review and approve operating plans has been delegated.
          
          
            § 228.4
            Plan of operations—notice of intent—requirements.
            (a) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a notice of intent to operate is required from any person proposing to conduct operations which might cause significant disturbance of surface resources. Such notice of intent to operate shall be submitted to the District Ranger having jurisdiction over the area in which the operations will be conducted. Each notice of intent to operate shall provide information sufficient to identify the area involved, the nature of the proposed operations, the route of access to the area of operations, and the method of transport.
            (1) A notice of intent to operate is not required for:
            (i) Operations which will be limited to the use of vehicles on existing public roads or roads used and maintained for National Forest System purposes;
            (ii) Prospecting and sampling which will not cause significant surface resource disturbance and will not involve removal of more than a reasonable amount of mineral deposit for analysis and study which generally might include searching for and occasionally removing small mineral samples or specimens, gold panning, metal detecting, non-motorized hand sluicing, using battery operated dry washers, and collecting of mineral specimens using hand tools;
            (iii) Marking and monumenting a mining claim;
            (iv) Underground operations which will not cause significant surface resource disturbance;
            (v) Operations, which in their totality, will not cause surface resource disturbance which is substantially different than that caused by other users of the National Forest System who are not required to obtain a Forest Service special use authorization, contract, or other written authorization;
            (vi) Operations which will not involve the use of mechanized earthmoving equipment, such as bulldozers or backhoes, or the cutting of trees, unless those operations otherwise might cause a significant disturbance of surface resources; or
            (vii) Operations for which a proposed plan of operations is submitted for approval;

            (2) The District Ranger will, within 15 days of receipt of a notice of intent to operate, notify the operator if approval of a plan of operations is required before the operations may begin.
            (3) An operator shall submit a proposed plan of operations to the District Ranger having jurisdiction over the area in which operations will be conducted in lieu of a notice of intent to operate if the proposed operations will likely cause a significant disturbance of surface resources. An operator also shall submit a proposed plan of operations, or a proposed supplemental plan of operations consistent with § 228.4(d), to the District Ranger having jurisdiction over the area in which operations are being conducted if those operations are causing a significant disturbance of surface resources but are not covered by a current approved plan of operations. The requirement to submit a plan of operations shall not apply to the operations listed in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (v). The requirement to submit a plan of operations also shall not apply to operations which will not involve the use of mechanized earthmoving equipment, such as bulldozers or backhoes, or the cutting of trees, unless those operations otherwise will likely cause a significant disturbance of surface resources.
            (4) If the District Ranger determines that any operation is causing or will likely cause significant disturbance of surface resources, the District Ranger shall notify the operator that the operator must submit a proposed plan of operations for approval and that the operations can not be conducted until a plan of operations is approved.

            (b) Any person conducting operations on the effective date of these regulations, who would have been required to submit a plan of operations under § 228.4(a), may continue operations but shall within 120 days thereafter submit a plan of operations to the District Ranger having jurisdiction over the area within which operations are being conducted: Provided, however, That upon a showing of good cause the authorized officer will grant an extension of time for submission of a plan of operations, not to exceed an additional 6 months. Operations may continue according to the submitted plan during its review, unless the authorized officer determines that the operations are unnecessarily or unreasonably causing irreparable damage to surface resources and advises the operator of those measures needed to avoid such damage. Upon approval of a plan of operations, operations shall be conducted in accordance with the approved plan. The requirement to submit a plan of operations shall not apply: (1) To operations excepted in § 228.4(a) or (2) to operations concluded prior to the effective date of the regulations in this part.
            (c) The plan of operations shall include:
            (1) The name and legal mailing address of the operators (and claimants if they are not the operators) and their lessees, assigns, or designees.
            (2) A map or sketch showing information sufficient to locate the proposed area of operations on the ground, existing and/or proposed roads or access routes to be used in connection with the operations as set forth in § 228.12 and the approximate location and size of areas where surface resources will be disturbed.
            (3) Information sufficient to describe or identify the type of operations proposed and how they would be conducted, the type and standard of existing and proposed roads or access routes, the means of transportation used or to be used as set forth in § 228.12, the period during which the proposed activity will take place, and measures to be taken to meet the requirements for environmental protection in § 228.8.

            (d) The plan of operations shall cover the requirements set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, as foreseen for the entire operation for the full estimated period of activity: Provided, however, That if the development of a plan for an entire operation is not possible at the time of preparation of a plan, the operator shall file an initial plan setting forth his proposed operation to the degree reasonably foreseeable at that time, and shall thereafter file a supplemental plan or plans whenever it is proposed to undertake any significant surface disturbance not covered by the initial plan.
            
            (e) At any time during operations under an approved plan of operations, the authorized officer may ask the operator to furnish a proposed modification of the plan detailing the means of minimizing unforeseen significant disturbance of surface resources. If the operator does not furnish a proposed modification within a time deemed reasonable by the authorized officer, the authorized officer may recommend to his immediate superior that the operator be required to submit a proposed modification of the plan. The recommendation of the authorized officer shall be accompanied by a statement setting forth in detail the supporting facts and reasons for his recommendations. In acting upon such recommendation, the immediate superior of the authorized officer shall determine:
            (1) Whether all reasonable measures were taken by the authorized officer to predict the environmental impacts of the proposed operations prior to approving the operating plan,
            (2) Whether the disturbance is or probably will become of such significance as to require modification of the operating plan in order to meet the requirements for environmental protection specified in § 228.8 and
            (3) Whether the disturbance can be minimized using reasonable means. Lacking such determination that unforeseen significant disturbance of surface resources is occurring or probable and that the disturbance can be minimized using reasonable means, no operator shall be required to submit a proposed modification of an approved plan of operations. Operations may continue in accordance with the approved plan until a modified plan is approved, unless the immediate superior of the authorized officer determines that the operations are unnecessarily or unreasonably causing irreparable injury, loss or damage to surface resources and advises the operator of those measures needed to avoid such damage.
            (f) Upon completion of an environmental analysis in connection with each proposed operating plan, the authorized officer will determine whether an environmental statement is required. Not every plan of operations, supplemental plan or modification will involve the preparation of an environmental statement. Environmental impacts will vary substantially depending on whether the nature of operations is prospecting, exploration, development, or processing, and on the scope of operations (such as size of operations, construction required, length of operations and equipment required), resulting in varying degrees of disturbance to vegetative resources, soil, water, air, or wildlife. The Forest Service will prepare any environmental statements that may be required.
            (g) The information required to be included in a notice of intent or a plan of operations, or supplement or modification thereto, has been assigned Office of Management and Budget Control #0596-0022. The public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to vary from a few minutes for an activity involving little or no surface disturbance to several months for activities involving heavy capital investments and significant surface disturbance, with an average of 2 hours per individual response. This includes time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to Chief (2800), Forest Service, USDA, P.O. Box 96090, Washington, DC 20090-6090 and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503.

            § 228.5
            Plan of operations—approval.

            (a) Operations shall be conducted in accordance with an approved plan of operations, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section and in § 228.4 (a), (b), and (e). A proposed plan of operation shall be submitted to the District Ranger, who shall promptly acknowledge receipt thereof to the operator. The authorized officer shall, within thirty (30) days of such receipt, analyze the proposal, considering the economics of the operation along with the other factors in determining the reasonableness of the requirements for surface resource protection, and;
            (1) Notify the operator that he has approved the plan of operations; or
            (2) Notify the operator that the proposed operations are such as not to require an operating plan; or
            (3) Notify the operator of any changes in, or additions to, the plan of operations deemed necessary to meet the purpose of the regulations in this part; or

            (4) Notify the operator that the plan is being reviewed, but that more time, not to exceed an additional sixty (60) days, is necessary to complete such review, setting forth the reasons why additional time is needed: Provided, however, That days during which the area of operations is inaccessible for inspection shall not be included when computing the sixty (60) day period; or
            (5) Notify the operator that the plan cannot be approved until a final environmental statement has been prepared and filed with the Council on Environmental Quality as provided in § 228.4(f).
            (b) Pending final approval of the plan of operations, the authorized officer will approve such operations as may be necessary for timely compliance with the requirements of Federal and State laws, so long as such operations are conducted so as to minimize environmental impacts as prescribed by the authorized officer in accordance with the standards contained in § 228.8.

            (c) A supplemental plan or plans of operations provided for in § 228.4(d) and a modification of an approved operating plan as provided for in § 228.4(e) shall be subject to approval by the authorized officer in the same manner as the initial plan of operations: Provided, however, That a modification of an approved plan of operations under § 228.4(e) shall be subject to approval by the immediate superior of the authorized officer in cases where it has been determined that a modification is required.
            (d) In the provisions for review of operating plans, the Forest Service will arrange for consultation with appropriate agencies of the Department of the Interior with respect to significant technical questions concerning the character of unique geologic conditions and special exploration and development systems, techniques, and equipment, and with respect to mineral values, mineral resources, and mineral reserves. Further, the operator may request the Forest Service to arrange for similar consultations with appropriate agencies of the U.S. Department of the Interior for a review of operating plans.
          
          
            § 228.6
            Availability of information to the public.
            Except as provided herein, all information and data submitted by an operator pursuant to the regulations in this part shall be available for examination by the public at the Office of the District Ranger in accordance with the provisions of 7 CFR 1.1-1.6 and 36 CFR 200.5-200.10. Specifically identified information and data submitted by the operator as confidential concerning trade secrets or privileged commercial or financial information will not be available for public examination. Information and data to be withheld from public examination may include, but is not limited to, known or estimated outline of the mineral deposits and their location, attitude, extent, outcrops, and content, and the known or planned location of exploration pits, drill holes, excavations pertaining to location and entry pursuant to the United States mining laws, and other commercial information which relates to competitive rights of the operator.
          
          
            § 228.7
            Inspection, noncompliance.
            (a) Forest Officers shall periodically inspect operations to determine if the operator is complying with the regulations in this part and an approved plan of operations.

            (b) If an operator fails to comply with the regulations or his approved plan of operations and the noncompliance is unnecessarily or unreasonably causing injury, loss or damage to surface resources the authorized officer shall serve a notice of noncompliance upon the operator or his agent in person or by certified mail. Such notice shall describe the noncompliance and shall specify the action to comply and the time within which such action is to be completed, generally not to exceed thirty (30) days: Provided, however, That days during which the area of operations is inaccessible shall not be included when computing the number of days allowed for compliance.
          
          
            § 228.8
            Requirements for environmental protection.
            All operations shall be conducted so as, where feasible, to minimize adverse environmental impacts on National Forest surface resources, including the following requirements:
            (a) Air Quality. Operator shall comply with applicable Federal and State air quality standards, including the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 1857 et seq.).
            (b) Water Quality. Operator shall comply with applicable Federal and State water quality standards, including regulations issued pursuant to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended (33 U.S.C. 1151 et seq.).

            § 228.10
            Cessation of operations, removal of structures and equipment.
            Unless otherwise agreed to by the authorized officer, operator shall remove within a reasonable time following cessation of operations all structures, equipment and other facilities and clean up the site of operations. Other than seasonally, where operations have ceased temporarily, an operator shall file a statement with the District Ranger which includes:
            (a) Verification of intent to maintain the structures, equipment and other facilities,
            (b) The expected reopening date, and
            (c) An estimate of extended duration of operations. A statement shall be filed every year in the event operations are not reactivated. Operator shall maintain the operating site, structures, equipment and other facilities in a neat and safe condition during nonoperating periods.
          
          
            § 228.11
            Prevention and control of fire.
            Operator shall comply with all applicable Federal and State fire laws and regulations and shall take all reasonable measures to prevent and suppress fires on the area of operations and shall require his employees, contractors and subcontractors to do likewise.
          
          
            § 228.12
            Access.
            An operator is entitled to access in connection with operations, but no road, trail, bridge, landing area for aircraft, or the like, shall be constructed or improved, nor shall any other means of access, including but not limited to off-road vehicles, be used until the operator has received approval of an operating plan in writing from the authorized officer when required by § 228.4(a). Proposals for construction, improvement or use of such access as part of a plan of operations shall include a description of the type and standard of the proposed means of access, a map showing the proposed route of access, and a description of the means of transportation to be used. Approval of the means of such access as part of a plan of operations shall specify the location of the access route, design standards, means of transportation, and other conditions reasonably necessary to protect the environment and forest surface resources, including measures to protect scenic values and to insure against erosion and water or air pollution.
          
          
            § 228.13
            Bonds.
            (a) Any operator required to file a plan of operations shall, when required by the authorized officer, furnish a bond conditioned upon compliance with § 228.8(g), prior to approval of such plan of operations. In lieu of a bond, the operator may deposit into a Federal depository, as directed by the Forest Service, and maintain therein, cash in an amount equal to the required dollar amount of the bond or negotiable securities of the United States having market value at the time of deposit of not less than the required dollar amount of the bond. A blanket bond covering nationwide or statewide operations may be furnished if the terms and conditions thereof are sufficient to comply with the regulations in this part.
            (b) In determining the amount of the bond, consideration will be given to the estimated cost of stabilizing, rehabilitating, and reclaiming the area of operations.
            (c) In the event that an approved plan of operations is modified in accordance with § 228.4 (d) and (e), the authorized officer will review the initial bond for adequacy and, if necessary, will adjust the bond to conform to the operations plan as modified.

            (d) When reclamation has been completed in accordance with § 228.8(g), the authorized officer will notify the operator that performance under the bond has been completed: Provided, however, That when the Forest Service has accepted as completed any portion of the reclamation, the authorized officer shall notify the operator of such acceptance and reduce proportionally the amount of bond thereafter to be required with respect to the remaining reclamation.

            § 228.15
            Operations within National Forest Wilderness.
            (a) The United States mining laws shall extend to each National Forest Wilderness for the period specified in the Wilderness Act and subsequent establishing legislation to the same extent they were applicable prior to the date the Wilderness was designated by Congress as a part of the National Wilderness Preservation System. Subject to valid existing rights, no person shall have any right or interest in or to any mineral deposits which may be discovered through prospecting or other information-gathering activity after the legal date on which the United States mining laws cease to apply to the specific Wilderness.
            (b) Holders of unpatented mining claims validly established on any National Forest Wilderness prior to inclusion of such unit in the National Wilderness Preservation System shall be accorded the rights provided by the United States mining laws as then applicable to the National Forest land involved. Persons locating mining claims in any National Forest Wilderness on or after the date on which said Wilderness was included in the National Wilderness Preservation System shall be accorded the rights provided by the United States mining laws as applicable to the National Forest land involved and subject to provisions specified in the establishing legislation. Persons conducting operations as defined in § 228.3 in National Forest Wilderness shall comply with the regulations in this part. Operations shall be conducted so as to protect National Forest surface resources in accordance with the general purposes of maintaining the National Wilderness Preservation System unimpaired for future use and enjoyment as wilderness and to preserve its wilderness character, consistent with the use of the land for mineral location, exploration, development, drilling, and production and for transmission lines, water lines, telephone lines, and processing operations, including, where essential, the use of mechanized transport, aircraft or motorized equipment.
            (c) Persons with valid mining claims wholly within National Forest Wilderness shall be permitted access to such surrounded claims by means consistent with the preservation of National Forest Wilderness which have been or are being customarily used with respect to other such claims surrounded by National Forest Wilderness. No operator shall construct roads across National Forest Wilderness unless authorized in writing by the Forest Supervisor in accordance with § 228.12.
            (d) On all mining claims validly established on lands within the National Wilderness Preservation System, the operator shall take all reasonable measures to remove any structures, equipment and other facilities no longer needed for mining purposes in accordance with the provisions in § 228.10 and restore the surface in accordance with the requirements in § 228.8(g).
            (e) The title to timber on patented claims validly established after the land was included within the National Wilderness Preservation System remains in the United States, subject to a right to cut and use timber for mining purposes. So much of the mature timber may be cut and used as is needed in the extraction, removal, and beneficiation of the mineral deposits, if needed timber is not otherwise reasonably available. The cutting shall comply with the requirements for sound principles of forest management as defined by the National Forest rules and regulations and set forth in stipulations to be included in the plan of operations, which as a minimum incorporate the following basic principles of forest management:
            (1) Harvesting operations shall be so conducted as to minimize soil movement and damage from water runoff; and
            (2) Slash shall be disposed of and other precautions shall be taken to minimize damage from forest insects, disease, and fire.

            (f) The Chief, Forest Service, shall allow any activity, including prospecting, for the purpose of gathering information about minerals in National Forest Wilderness except that any such activity for gathering information shall be carried on in a manner compatible with the preservation of the wilderness environment as specified in the plan of operations.

            § 228.41
            Scope.
            (a) Lands to which this subpart applies. This subpart applies to all National Forest System lands reserved from the public domain of the United States, including public domain lands being administered under the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act of July 22, 1937 (7 U.S.C. 1010); to all National Forest System lands acquired pursuant to the Weeks Act of March 1, 1911 (36 Stat. 961); to all National Forest System lands with Weeks Act status as provided in the Act of September 2, 1958 (16 U.S.C. 521a); and to public lands within the Copper River addition to the Chugach National Forest (16 U.S.C. 539a). For ease of reference and convenience to the reader, these lands are referred to, throughout this subpart, as National Forest lands.
            
            (b) Restrictions. Disposal of mineral materials from the following National Forest lands is subject to certain restrictions as described below:
            (1) Segregation or withdrawals in aid of other agencies. Disposal of mineral materials from lands segregated or withdrawn in aid of a function of another Federal agency, State, territory, county, municipality, water district, or other governmental subdivision or agency may be made only with the written consent of the governmental entity.
            (2) Segregated or withdrawn National Forest lands. Mineral materials may not be removed from segregated or withdrawn lands where removal is specifically prohibited by statute or by public land order. Where not specifically prohibited, removal of mineral materials may be allowed if the authorized officer determines that the removal is not detrimental to the values for which the segregation or withdrawal was made, except as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Where operations have been established prior to the effective date of this Subpart and where not prohibited by statute, they may be permitted to continue. Nothing in this subparagraph is intended to prohibit the exercise of valid existing rights.
            (3) Unpatented mining claims. Provided that claimants are given prior notice and it has been determined that removal will neither endanger nor materially interfere with prospecting, mining, or processing operations or uses reasonably incident thereto on the claims, disposal of mineral materials may be allowed from:
            (i) Unpatented mining claims located after July 23, 1955; and/or
            (ii) Unpatented mining claims located before July 23, 1955, and on which the United States has established the right to manage the vegetative and other surface resources in accordance with the Multiple Use Mining Act of July 23, 1955 (30 U.S.C. 601, 603, 611-615).
            (4) Acquired Bankhead-Jones lands. Mineral materials on lands which were acquired under the authority of the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act of July 22, 1937 (7 U.S.C. 1010-1012), and which lie outside the exterior boundaries of National Forests, or on acquired lands which are being administered under the Act and which also lie outside the exterior boundaries of National Forests, may be disposed of under these regulations only to public authorities and agencies, and only on condition that the mineral materials are used for public purposes (7 U.S.C. 1011(c)).
            (c) Mineral materials to which this subpart applies. This subpart applies to mineral materials which consist of petrified wood and common varieties of sand, gravel, stone, pumice, pumicite, cinders, clay, and other similar materials. Such mineral materials include deposits which, although they have economic value, are used for agriculture, animal husbandry, building, abrasion, construction, landscaping, and similar uses. This subpart also applies to other materials which may not be minerals but are produced using mining methods, such as peat. The categories of these materials, including representative examples, are:
            (1) Agricultural supply and animal husbandry materials. This category includes, but is not limited to, minerals and vegetative materials used as or for: Soil conditioners or amendments applied to physically alter soil properties such as direct applications to the soil of carbonate rocks, soil containing “trace elements” and peat; animal feed supplements; and other animal care products.
            (2) Building materials. Except for minerals identified as Uncommon Varieties, this category includes, but is not limited to, minerals used as or for: Paint fillers or extenders; flagstone, ashlar, rubble, mortar, brick, tile, pipe, pottery, earthenware, stoneware, terrazzo, and other nonstructural components in floors, walls, roofs, fireplaces, and the like; and similar building uses.
            (3) Abrasive materials. This category includes, but is not limited to, minerals used for: Filing; scouring; polishing; sanding; and sandblasting.
            (4) Construction materials. This category includes, but is not limited to, minerals such as sand, gravel, clay, crushed rock and cinders used as or for fill; borrow; rip-rap; ballast (including all ballast for railroad use); road base; road surfacing; concrete aggregate; clay sealants; and similar construction uses.
            (5) Landscaping materials: This category includes, but is not limited to minerals and peat used as or for: Chips, granules, sand, pebbles, scoria, cinders, cobbles, boulders, slabs, and other components in retaining walls, walkways, patios, yards, gardens, and the like; and similar landscaping uses.
            (d) Minerals not covered by this subpart. Mineral materials do not include any mineral used in manufacturing, industrial processing, or chemical operations for which no other mineral can be substituted due to unique properties giving the particular mineral a distinct and special value; nor do they include block pumice which in nature occurs in pieces having one dimension of two inches or more which is valuable and used for some application that requires such dimensions. Disposal of minerals not covered by this subpart is subject to the terms of the United States Mining Laws, as amended (30 U.S.C. 22 et seq.), on those portions of the National Forest System where those laws apply. Such minerals may include:
            (1) Mineral suitable and used as soil amendment because of a constituent element other than calcium or magnesium carbonate that chemically alters the soil;
            (2) Limestone suitable and used, without substantial admixtures, for cement manufacture, metallurgy, production of quicklime, sugar refining, whiting, fillers, paper manufacture, and desulfurization of stack gases;
            (3) Silica suitable and used for glass manufacture, production of metallic silicon, flux, and rock wool;
            (4) Alumino-silicates or clays having exceptional qualities suitable and used for production of aluminum, ceramics, drilling mud, taconite binder, foundry castings, and other purposes for which common clays cannot be used;
            (5) Gypsum suitable and used for wallboard, plaster, or cement.

            (6) Block pumice which occurs in nature in pieces having one dimension of two inches or more and which is valuable and used for some application that requires such dimensions; and
            (7) Stone recognized through marketing factors for its special and distinct properties of strength and durability making it suitable for structural support and used for that purpose.
            (e) Limitations on applicability. (1) The provisions of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section shall not apply to any mining claims for which a Mineral Entry Final Certificate was issued on or before January 16, 1991. Nor shall these provisions apply to any mining claim located on or before July 23, 1955, which has satisfied the marketability test for locatable minerals from on or before July 23, 1955, until the present date.
            (2) A use which qualifies a mineral as an uncommon variety under paragraph (d) overrides classification of that mineral as a common variety under paragraph (c) of this section.

            § 228.43
            Policy governing disposal.
            (a) General. Forest Service policy is to make mineral materials on National Forest lands available to the public and to local, State, and Federal government agencies where reasonable protection of, or mitigation of effects on, other resources in assured, and where removal is not prohibited.
            (1) A contract or permit limits processing of the mineral material onsite to the first salable product.
            (2) Additional onsite processing may be authorized by a separate permit (36 CFR 251.50).
            (3) The authorized officer must ensure that an environmental analysis is conducted for all planned disposals of mineral materials.
            (4) Decisions to authorize the disposal of mineral materials must conform to approved land and resource management plans (36 CFR 219.22).
            (b) Price. Mineral materials may not be sold for less than the appraised value. The authorized officer may assess a fee to cover costs of issuing and administering a contract or permit.
            (c) Conservation. Adequate measures must be taken to protect, and minimize damage to the environment. Mineral materials may be disposed of only if the authorized officer determines that the disposal is not detrimental to the public interest.
            (d) Ownership. Title to the mineral materials vests in the purchaser or permittee immediately before excavation, subject to the provisions of §§ 228.47 through 228.56 and other provisions of the contract or permit. Title to excavated material not removed within the time provided revests in the United States.
            (e) Decisions. All decisions as to whether or not to grant disposals proposed under this subpart shall be made in writing by the authorized officer. Such decisions must specify their factual and legal basis.
            (f) Option for mining claimants. All mining claimants holding mining claims which are located for a mineral classified in accordance with this subpart as a mineral material have the option of maintaining that the mineral is locatable and filing for patent. All mining claimants holding mining claims located in good faith on or before January 16, 1991, for a mineral classified in accordance with this subpart as a mineral material may accept the classification and, if appropriate, receive a sale by negotiated contract for that mineral material under 36 CFR 228.57(b)(2) of this subpart.
            [49 FR 29784, July 24, 1984, as amended at 55 FR 51706, Dec. 17, 1990]
          
          
            § 228.44
            Disposal on existing Federal leased areas.

            Mineral material contracts or permits may be issued within existing areas leased or under permit under the 1920 Mineral Leasing Act, as amended (30 U.S.C. 181-187); section 402 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1946 (5 U.S.C. Appendix); the 1947 Mineral Leasing Act for Acquired Lands, as amended (30 U.S.C. 351 et seq.); and the 1970 Geothermal Steam Act (30 U.S.C. 1001-1025), provided that it has been determined that removal will neither endanger nor unreasonably interfere with lease operations, and provided further that the lease terms do not prohibit disposal.
          
          
            § 228.45
            Qualifications of applicants.
            The authorized officer may require applicants for prospecting permits, negotiated contracts, or free-use permits or bidders for the sale of mineral materials to furnish information necessary to determine their ability to perform the obligations of the contract or permit.

              General terms and conditions of contracts and permits.
              (a) Disposal of designated mineral materials. Only those specified mineral materials found within the area designated in the contract or permit may be extracted and removed.
              (b) Unauthorized removal (trespass) of mineral materials. The removal of mineral materials from National Forest lands, except when authorized in accordance with applicable law and regulations of the Department of Agriculture, is prohibited (36 CFR 261.9).
              (c) Conservation. Mineral material contracts and permits must contain provisions to ensure the efficient removal and conservation of the mineral material.
              (d) Improvements. Contracts and permits must contain provisions for removal or Government retention of improvements.
              (e) Use of existing National Forest development roads. The authorized officer may require purchasers and permittees to obtain appropriate road-use permits, make deposits for or perform their commensurate share of road maintenance, and comply with road-use rules contained in 36 CFR part 212, depending upon their planned extent of road use.
              (f) Reclamation. Requirements for reclamation of areas disturbed by mineral material operations must be included in contracts and permits, except for disposals from community sites and common-use areas.
            
            
              § 228.48
              Appraisal and measurement.
              (a) Appraisal. All mineral materials for sale must be appraised to determine fair market value. Appraisals must be based on knowledge of the extent of the deposit, quality of material, and economic value. A sale must not be made at less than the appraised value which may be expressed as either price per cubic yard or weight equivalent. In all cases the units of measurement must correspond to the units used in the appraisal. The authorized officer must estimate and record the amount and value of minerals to be disposed of by free-use permit.
              (b) Measurement. The amount of mineral material actually removed may be measured by volume, weight, truck tally, by combination of these methods, or by such other form of measurement as the authorized officer determines to be appropriate and in the public interest.
            
            
              § 228.49
              Reappraisal.
              If an extension of time is granted as provided in § 228.53(b), the authorized officer must reappraise or reestimate the mineral materials covered by the contract or permit and which remain unexcavated at the time of extension. The recalculated unit value becomes the new unit value for the remaining unexcavated material; excavated and stockpiled material is not subject to reappraisal.
            
            
              § 228.50
              Production records.
              At least annually, the purchaser or permittee must furnish a record of the volume extracted, in cubic yards or weight equivalent, to the authorized officer. The units of measurement must correspond to the units used in the appraisal or estimate.
            
            
              § 228.51
              Bonding.
              (a) Bond requirements. Before operations may begin under any contract or permit, a bond must be furnished to the authorized officer to ensure performance of payment (as necessary), reclamation, and other conditions of the contract or permit, except as noted in paragraphs (a) (1) and (3) of this section, where the authorized officer may waive such bonding. If an extension of time is granted as provided in § 228.53(b), the bond requirements must be recalculated and changed accordingly.
              (1) For advance payment contracts for 10,000 cubic yards or more in volume (or weight equivalent), a bond of not less than 10 percent of the total contract price or the value of the estimated annual production (whichever is less), plus the reclamation cost for the area covered by annual mining, is required. When the total volume is less than 10,000 cubic yards, bond requirements, if any, are at the discretion of the authorized officer.
              
              (2) For any deferred payment contract, a bond equaling the value of the estimated annual production plus the reclamation cost for the area covered by annual mining is required.
              (3) For free use, the authorized officer may require a reclamation bond which must be sufficient to cover the cost of reclamation of the anticipated annual work.
              (b) Types of bonding. A bond must be one of the following:
              (1) A bond of a corporate surety shown on the latest approved list issued by the U.S. Treasury Department and executed on an approved standard form;
              (2) A cash bond;
              (3) Negotiable securities of the United States;
              (4) An irrevocable letter of credit acceptable to the Forest Service;
              (5) A performance bond required by other Forest Service contracts or permits, provided the bond covers the performance and reclamation requirements related to the removal of mineral material from a designated pit or area for use in the performance of the contract or permit; or
              (6) Any other types of bond specified in the Forest Service Manual.
            
            
              § 228.52
              Assignments.
              (a) Limitations. A purchaser or permittee may not assign the contract or permit, or any interest therein, without the written approval of the authorized officer.
              (b) Requirements of assignee. The authorized officer will not approve any proposed assignment involving contract or permit performance unless the assignee:
              (1) Submits information necessary to assure the authorized officer of the assignee's ability to meet the same requirements as the original purchaser or permittee (assignor); and
              (2) Furnishes a bond or obtains a commitment from the previous surety to be bound by the assignment when approved.
              (c) Rights and obligations. Once the authorized officer approves an assignment, the assignee is entitled to all the rights and is subject to all of the obligations under the contract or permit, and the original purchaser or permittee may be released from any further responsiblity under the contract or permit.
            
            
              § 228.53
              Term.
              (a) Time allowed. Except as provided in § 228.61(f), § 228.62(b), and elsewhere in this paragraph, a contract or permit may not exceed 1 year from the effective date of the contract or permit unless a written extension is obtained. For those mineral materials sold under a duration of production contract or under a contract for the sale of all mineral material within a specified area, or under a construction contract where removal cannot reasonably take place before completion of other work under the same contract, the authorized officer will establish a reasonable time period for removal.
              (b) Extension of time. If it is shown that a delay in removal was due to causes beyond the control of the purchaser or permittee, the authorized officer may grant an extension, not to exceed 1 year, upon written request. Written requests for extensions of contracts must be received between 30 and 90 days before the expiration date of the contract. Written requests for extensions of permits must be received between 15 and 90 days before the permit expiration date. The authorized officer may grant a total of two extensions for contracts and permits.
            
            
              § 228.54
              Single entry sales or permits.
              The purchaser or permittee is required to reclaim a single entry source in accordance with an approved operating plan which describes operating procedures and reclamation measures, unless the requirement is waived by the authorized officer.
            
            
              § 228.55
              Cancellation or suspension.

              The authorized officer may cancel or suspend a contract, permit, or prospecting permit if the purchaser or permittee fails to comply with its terms and conditions. If the noncompliance is unnecessarily or unreasonably causing injury, loss, or damage to surface resources, the authorized officer may cancel or suspend the contract, permit, or prospecting permit immediately. In cases where noncompliance is of a less serious nature, the authorized officer may cancel or suspend a contract, permit, or prospecting permit if such noncompliance continues for 30 days after service of written notice by the authorized officer. If the noncompliance is not corrected, the authorized officer may attach the bond to ensure compliance with the provisions of the contract, permit, or prospecting permit.
            
            
              § 228.56
              Operating plans.
              Any surface-disturbing operation under a contract, permit, or prospecting permit is subject to prior approval by the authorized officer of an operating plan and to reasonable conditions as may be required to ensure proper protection of the environment and improvements, including timely reclamation of disturbed lands. Significant changes to operations require prior approval of an amended operating plan. The operating plan must include, as a minimum, a map and explanation of the nature of the access, anticipated activity, surface disturbance, and intended reclamation including removal or retention of structures and facilities. Operating plans must be submitted by the purchaser, permittee, or prospecting permittee, except as noted in § 228.64(b).
            
          
          
            Types and Methods of Disposal
            
              § 228.57
              Types of disposal.

              (a) Competitive sale to the highest qualified bidder after formal advertising and other appropriate public notice;
              (b) Sale by negotiated contract. (1) For removal of materials to be used in connection with a public works improvement program on behalf of a Federal, State, or local government agency if the public exigency will not permit delays incident to advertising, or
              (2) For the removal of mineral materials for which it is impracticable to obtain competition;
              (c) Preference right negotiated sale to the holder of a Forest Service-issued prospecting permit under which a suitable mineral material deposit has been demonstrated on acquired National Forest lands;
              (d) Free use when a permit is issued to any nonprofit association, corporation, individual, or others listed in § 228.62(d), for other than commercial purposes, resale, or barter, or to any Federal, State, county, local unit, subdivision, municipality, or county road district for use in public projects; or
              (e) Forest Service force account or by contract where the material is to be used to carry out various Forest Service programs involving construction and maintenance of physical improvements.
            
            
              § 228.58
              Competitive sales.
              (a) Invitation for bid. Sales must be conducted as described below after inviting competitive bids through publication and posting. The authorized officer may not offer a competitive sale unless there is a right-of-way or other access to the sale area which is available to anyone qualified to bid.
              (b) Advertising—(1) Sales over 25,000 cubic yards. Mineral material sales offered by competitive bidding and which exceed 25,000 cubic yards must be advertised on the same day once a week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the area where the material is located, and in a trade or industrial newspaper when considered appropriate. Notice of the sale must be posted in a conspicuous place in the office where bids are to be submitted. In addition, the authorized officer may send the advertisement directly to known interested persons. Bids may be received but not evaluated before the end of the advertising period, which may be extended at the discretion of the authorized officer.
              (2) Content of advertising. The advertisement of sale must specify the location by legal description of the tract or tracts or by any other means identify the location of the mineral material deposit being offered, the kind of material, estimated quantities, the unit of measurement, appraised price (which sets the minimum acceptable bid), time and place for receiving and opening of bids, minimum deposit required, major special constraints due to environmental considerations, available access, maintenance required over haul routes, traffic controls, required use permits, required qualifications of bidders, the method of bidding, bonding requirement, notice of the right to reject any or all bids, the office where a copy of the contract and additional information may be obtained, and additional information the authorized officer deems necessary.
              (3) Advertising smaller sales. Advertisement of mineral materials amounting to 25,000 cubic yards in volume (or weight equivalent) or less must be published and/or posted. The methods of advertisement are at the discretion of the authorized officer.
              (c) Conduct of sales. (1) Bidding at competitive sales may be conducted by the submission of written sealed bids, oral bids, or a combination of both as directed by the authorized officer. In the event of a tie in high sealed bids, the highest bidder will be determined by oral auction among those tied bidders; when no oral bid is higher that the sealed bids, the selected bidder will be determined by lot, the purchase price being the amount of the tied bid. For all oral auctions, including those used to break sealed-bid ties, the high bidder must confirm the bid in writing immediately upon being declared the high bidder. The authorized officer must mail notification of the bidding results to all bidders within 10 days.
              (2) The authorized officer may require bidders to furnish evidence of qualification at the time of award or, if such evidence has already been furnished and is still valid, make appropriate reference to the record containing it.
              (3) When it is in the interest of the United States to do so, the authorized officer may reject any or all bids.
              (d) Bid deposits and award of contract. Sealed bids must be accompanied by a deposit. For mineral materials offered at oral auction, bidders must make the deposit before opening of the bidding.
              (1) Bid deposits must be equal to 10 percent of the appraised value but not less than $100.00.
              (2) Bid deposits must be in the form of cash, money order, bank drafts, cashier's or certified checks made payable to the Forest Service, or bonds acceptable to the Forest Service (§ 228.51(b)).
              (3) Upon conclusion of the bidding, the authorized officer will return the deposits of all unsuccessful bidders. The successful bidder's deposit will be applied toward the purchase price. If the contract is not awarded to the high bidder due to an inability to perform the obligations of the contract, the deposit, less expenses and damages incurred by the United States, may be returned. The return of a deposit does not prejudice any other rights or remedies of the United States. The contract may be offered and awarded to the next successive qualified high bidder, or, at the discretion of the authorized officer, the sale may be either readvertised or negotiated if it is determined that a competitive sale is impracticable.
              (4) Within 30 days after receipt of the contract, the successful bidder must sign and return the contract, together with any required bond, unless the authorized officer has granted an extension for an additional 30 days. The bidder must apply for the extension in writing within the first 30-day period. If the successful bidder fails to return the contract within the first 30-day period or within an approved extension, the bid deposit, less the costs of readvertising and damages, may be returned without prejudice to any other rights or remedies of the United States.
              (5) All sales must be processed on Forest Service-approved contract forms. The authorized officer may add provisions to the contract to cover conditions peculiar to the sale area. Such additional provisions must be made available for inspection by prospective bidders during the advertising period.
            
            
              § 228.59
              Negotiated or noncompetitive sales.
              (a) Volume limitations. When it is determined by the authorized officer to be in the public interest and when it is impracticable to obtain competition, mineral materials not exceeding 100,000 cubic yards in volume (or weight equivalent) may be sold in any one sale at not less than the appraised value, without advertising or calling for bids, except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. The authorized officer may not approve noncompetitive sales that exceed the total of 200,000 cubic yards (or weight equivalent) made in any one State for the benefit of any applicant in any period of 12 consecutive months.
              (b) Government programs. In connection with a public works improvement project on behalf of a Federal, State, or local governmental agency, the authorized officer may sell to an applicant, at not less than the appraised value, without advertising or calling for bids, a volume of mineral materials not to exceed 200,000 cubic yards (or weight equivalent) when the public exigency will not permit delays incident to advertising (30 U.S.C. 602).
              (c) Appropriation for highway purposes. For interstate and/or Federal aid highways, the Secretary of Transportation may appropriate any volume in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 107 and 317.
              (d) Use in development of Federal mineral leases. When it is determined to be impracticable to obtain competition and the mineral materials are to be used in connection with the development of mineral leases issued by the United States (§ 228.44), the authorized officer may sell to a leaseholder a volume of mineral material not to exceed 200,000 cubic yards (or weight equivalent) in one State in any period of 12 consecutive months. No charge will be made for materials which must be moved in the process of extracting the mineral under lease, as long as the materials remain stockpiled within the boundaries of the leased area.
              (e) Exceptions. (1) The Chief of the Forest Service may authorize the noncompetitive sale of mineral materials in excess of the volume limitations in paragraphs (a), (b), and (d) of this section when necessary to:
              (i) Respond to an emergency affecting public health, safety or property;

              (ii) Prevent the curtailment of operations conducted under the United States mining laws of May 10, 1872, as amended (30 U.S.C. 22 et seq.) which generate large volumes of mineral materials as a by-product; or

              (iii) Respond to a critical public need for the prompt development of a mineral lease issued by the United States or a mining claim located under the United States mining laws of May 10, 1872, as amended (30 U.S.C. 22 et seq.).
              (2) Any noncompetitive sale of mineral materials in excess of the volume limitations in paragraphs (a), (b), and (d) shall be subject to such restrictions as the Chief of the Forest Service determines to be in the public interest.
              (3) Nothing in this paragraph shall otherwise alter the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section.
              [49 FR 29784, July 24, 1984, as amended at 52 FR 10565, Apr. 2, 1987; 53 FR 43691, Oct. 28, 1988]
            
            
              § 228.60
              Prospecting permits.
              (a) Right conferred. On acquired National Forest lands, prospecting permits may be issued which grant the permittee the exclusive right to explore for and to demonstrate the existence of a suitable mineral material deposit when existing information is insufficient. After the demonstration of a suitable deposit and confirmation of this by the authorized officer, the permittee will have a preference right to apply for a negotiated sale.
              (b) Limitations. Mineral material may be removed from lands under a prospecting permit only to the extent necessary for testing and analysis or for the demonstration of the existence of a suitable deposit.
              (c) Environmental analysis. Prospecting permits will be issued only after submission by applicant and approval by the authorized officer of a detailed operating plan. The authorized officer may require a bond in accordance with § 228.51. The authorized officer must ensure compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.).
              (d) Acreage and permit limitations. A prospecting permit may not cover more than 640 acres. No individual or group may have an interest at any one time in more than three prospecting permits on Forest Service lands administered by one Forest Supervisor.
              (e) Duration and extension of permits. Prospecting permits may be issued for a period not to exceed 24 months, but they may be extended once for up to an additional 24 months if necessary to complete prospecting. Any application for extension must be submitted no later than 30 days before the expiration of the permit. The application for extension must provide evidence of diligence and state the reasons why additional time is considered necessary to complete prospecting work.
              (f) Refusal to extend permits. The authorized officer may reject applications for extension of prospecting permits for the following reasons:
              (1) Failure to perform. Failure of the permittee to perform prospecting or exploration work without adequate justification may result in the denial of an extension; or
              (2) Failure to apply. If an application for extension is not submitted within the specified period, the permit may expire without notice to the permittee.
              (3) Public interest. If the authorized officer determines that an extension may not be in the public interest, the application may be rejected.
            
            
              § 228.61
              Preference right negotiated sales.
              (a) Qualification for sale. When applying for a preference right negotiated sale, the permittee must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the authorized officer that a suitable deposit of mineral material has been discovered within the area covered by the prospecting permit. Information concerning trade secrets and financial matters submitted by the permittee and identified as confidential will not be available for public examination except as otherwise agreed upon by the permittee.
              (b) Application for sale. The application must be submitted to the District Ranger's office on or before the expiration date of the prospecting permit or its extension. The authorized officer may grant 30 additional days for submitting the application if requested in writing by the permittee before expiration of the prospecting permit or its extension.
              (c) Terms and conditions of contract. The terms and conditions will be evaluated on an individual case basis. Only those mineral materials specified in the contract may be removed by the purchaser. Before a preference right negotiated contract is awarded, the authorized officer must ensure that an environmental analysis is conducted. All contracts are subject to the conditions under §§ 228.47 through 228.56.
              (d) Acreage limitations. The authorized officer will determine the amount of acreage in the preference right negotiated sale based on a presentation of the permittee's needs. The maximum acreage allowable to any individual or group must not exceed 320 acres on National Forest lands administered by one Forest Supervisor. The allowable acreage may be in one or more units which are not necessarily contiguous.
              (e) Volume limitations. Preference right negotiated sales are exempt from volume limitations.
              (f) Contract time allowable. A contract or a renewal must not exceed 5 years; however, the purchaser may have renewal options at the end of each contract or renewal period. The authorized officer may renew a contract if it is determined that the renewal is not detrimental to the public interest and that the purchaser has demonstrated diligence in conducting operations. The authorized officer may cancel the contract, or the purchaser may forfeit the contract, if no substantial commercial production occurs during any continuous 2-year period after the award of the contract or if the contract terms and conditions are breached. However, if a delay is caused by conditions beyond the purchaser's control, the authorized officer may grant an extension equal to the lost time.
              (g) Contract renewal reappraisal. At the time of contract renewal, the authorized officer will reappraise the mineral material deposit in accordance with § 228.49.
            
            
              § 228.62
              Free use.
              (a) Application. An application for a free-use permit must be made with the appropriate District Ranger's office.
              (b) Term. Permits may be issued for periods not to exceed 1 year and will terminate on the expiration date unless extended by the authorized officer as in § 228.53(b). However, the authorized officer may issue permits to any local, State, Federal, or Territorial agency, unit or subdivision, including municipalities and county road districts, for periods up to 10 years.
              (c) Removal by agent. A free-use permittee may extract the mineral materials through a designated agent provided that the conditions of the permit are not violated. No part of the material may be used as payment for the services of an agent in obtaining or processing the material. A permit may be issued in the name of a designated agent for those entities listed in § 228.62(d)(1), at the discretion of the authorized officer, provided there is binding agreement in which the entity retains responsibility for ensuring compliance with the conditions of the permit.
              (d) Conditions. Free-use permits may be issued for mineral materials to settlers, miners, residents, and prospectors for uses other than commercial purposes, resale, or barter (16 U.S.C. 477). Free-use permits may be issued to local, State, Federal, or Territorial agencies, units, or subdivisions, including municipalities, or any association or corporation not organized for profit, for other than commercial or industrial purposes or resale (30 U.S.C. 601). Free-use permits may not be issued when, in the judgment of the authorized officer, the applicant owns or controls an adequate supply of mineral material in the area of demand. The free-use permit, issued on a Forest Service-approved form, must include the basis for the free-use as well as the provisions governing the selection, removal, and use of the mineral materials. No mineral material may be removed until the permit is issued. The permittee must notify the authorized officer upon completion of mineral material removal. The permittee must complete the reclamation prescribed in the operating plan (§ 228.56).
              (1) A free-use permit may be issued to any local, State, Federal, or Territorial agency, unit, or subdivision, including municipalities and county road districts, without limitation on the number of permits or on the value of the mineral materials to be extracted or removed.
              (2) A free-use permit issued to a nonprofit association, corporation, or individual may not provide for the removal of mineral materials having a volume exceeding 5,000 cubic yards (or weight equivalent) during any period of 12 consecutive months.
              (e) Petrified wood. A free-use permit may be issued to amateur collectors and scientists to take limited quantities of petrified wood for personal use. The material taken may not be bartered or sold. Free-use areas may be designated within which a permit may not be required. Removal of material from such areas must be in accord with rules issued by the authorized officer and posted on the area. Such rules must also be posted in the District Ranger's and Forest Supervisor's offices and be available upon request. The rules may vary by area depending on the quantity, quality, and accessibility of the material and the demand for it.
            
            
              § 228.63
              Removal under terms of a timber sale or other Forest Service contract.
              In carrying out programs such as timber sales that involve construction and maintenance of various physical improvements, the Forest Service may specify that mineral materials be mined, manufactured, and/or processed for incorporation into the improvement. Where the mineral material is located on National Forest lands and is designated in the contract calling for its use, no permit is required as long as an operating plan as described in § 228.56 is required by the contract provisions. Title to any excavated material in excess of that needed to fulfill contract requirements revests in the United States without reimbursement to the contract holder or to agents or representatives of the contract holder. Such excess material may be disposed of under §§ 228.58, 228.59, or 228.62.
            
            
              § 228.64
              Community sites and common-use areas.
              (a) Designation. Nonexclusive disposals may be made from the same deposit or areas designated by the authorized officer; the designation of such an area and any reclamation requirements must be based on an environmental analysis.
              (b) Pit plans. The Forest Service must prepare operating plans (§ 228.56) for the efficient removal of the material and for appropriate reclamation of community sites and common-use areas.
              (c) Reclamation. The Forest Service is responsible for reclamation of community sites and common-use areas.
            
            
              
              § 228.65
              Payment for sales.
              (a) Conditions. Mineral materials may not be removed from the sale area until all conditions of payment in the contract have been met.
              (b) Advance payment. (1) For negotiated and competitive sales the full amount may be paid before removal is begun under the contract or by installment at the discretion of the authorized officer. Installment payments must be based on the estimated removal rate specified in the operating plan and must be, as a minimum, the value of 1 month's removal. The first installment must be paid before removal operations are begun; remaining installments must be paid in advance of removal of the remaining materials as billed by the authorized officer. The total amount of the purchase price must be paid at least 60 days before the expiration date of the contract.
              (2) All advance payment contracts must provide for reappraisal of the mineral material at the time of contract renewal or extension.
              (3) Minimum annual production must be sufficient to return a payment to the United States equal to the first installment. In lieu of minimum production, there must be an annual payment in the amount of the first installment which will not be credited to future years' production. Payments for or in lieu of minimum annual production must be received by the authorized officer on or before the anniversary of the effective date of the contract.
              (4) If the purchaser fails to make payments when due, the contract will be considered breached, the authorized officer will cancel the contract, and all previous payments will be forfeited without prejudice to any other rights and remedies of the United States.
              (5) In order to determine payment amount, the purchaser must make a report of operations. The report must include the amount of mineral material removed, which must be verified by the authorized officer.
              (c) Deferred payments. The authorized officer may approve deferred payments for sales.
              (1) The purchaser may make payments monthly or quarterly which must be based on the in-place value (volume or weight equivalent) of material removed during the contract period. The units of measurement must correspond to the units used in the appraisal. The purchaser must make all payments before contract renewal.
              (2) The purchaser must deliver a bond which conforms to the provisions of § 228.51(a)(2) to the authorized officer before operations are begun under the contract.

              § 228.66
              Refunds.
              Upon termination of any contract, payments in excess of $10 may be refunded, less the costs incurred by the United States, under any of the following conditions:
              (a) Payment in excess of value. If the total payment exceeds the value of the mineral material removed, unless it is the minimum annual payment in lieu of production;
              (b) Insufficiency of material. If insufficient mineral material existed in the sale area to provide the quantity of material estimated to have been available;
              (c) Cancellation. (1) If the contract is cancelled by the authorized officer for reasons which are beyond the purchaser's control; or
              (2) If the contract is cancelled by mutual agreement. This refund provision is not a warranty that a specific quantity of material exists in the sale area.

          Subpart D—Miscellaneous Minerals Provisions
          
            § 228.80
            Operations within Misty Fjords and Admiralty Island National Monuments, Alaska.
            (a) Mineral activities on valid mining claims in the Misty Fjords and Admiralty Island National Monuments must be conducted in accordance with regulations in subpart A of this part and with the provisions of this section.
            (b) Prior to approving a plan of operations, the authorized officer must consider:
            (1) The resources of ecological, cultural, geological, historical, prehistorical, and scientific interest likely to be affected by the proposed operations, including access; and
            (2) The potential adverse impacts on the identified resource values resulting from the proposed operations.
            (c) A plan of operations will be approved if, in the judgment of the authorized officer, proposed operations are compatible, to the maximum extent feasible, with the protection of the resource values identified pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
            (1) The authorized officer will deem operations to be compatible if the plan of operations includes all feasible measures which are necessary to prevent or minimize potential adverse impacts on the resource values identified pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section and if the operations are conducted in accordance with the plan.
            (2) In evaluating the feasibility of mitigating measures, the authorized officer shall, at a minimum, consider the following:
            (i) The effectiveness and practicality of measures utilizing the best available technology for preventing or minimizing adverse impacts on the resource values identified pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section; and
            (ii) The long- and short-term costs to the operator of utilizing such measures and the effect of these costs on the long- and short-term economic viability of the operations.
            (3) The authorized officer shall not require implementation of mitigating measures which would prevent the evaluation or development of any valid claim for which operations are proposed.
            (d) In accordance with the procedures described in subpart A and paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section, the authorized officer may approve modifications of an existing plan of operations:
            (1) If, in the judgment of the authorized officer, environmental impacts unforeseen at the time of approval of the existing plan may result in the incompatibility of the operations with the protection of the resource values identified pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section; or
            (2) Upon request by the operator to use alternative technology and equipment capable of achieving a level of environmental protection equivalent to that to be achieved under the existing plan of operations.

            § 228.100
            Scope and applicability.
            (a) Scope. This subpart sets forth the rules and procedures by which the Forest Service of the United States Department of Agriculture will carry out its statutory responsibilities in the issuance of Federal oil and gas leases and management of subsequent oil and gas operations on National Forest System lands, for approval and modification of attendant surface use plans of operations, for monitoring of surface disturbing operations on such leases, and for enforcement of surface use requirements and reclamation standards.
            (b) Applicability. The rules of this subpart apply to leases on National Forest System lands and to operations that are conducted on Federal oil and gas leases on National Forest System lands as of April 20, 1990.
            (c) Applicability of other rules. Surface uses associated with oil and gas prospecting, development, production, and reclamation activities, that are conducted on National Forest System lands outside a leasehold must receive prior authorization from the Forest Service. Such activities are subject to the regulations set forth elsewhere in 36 CFR chapter II, including but not limited to the regulations set forth in 36 CFR parts 251, subpart B, and 261.

              § 228.102
              Leasing analyses and decisions.
              (a) Compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. In analyzing lands for leasing, the authorized Forest officer shall comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, implementing regulations at 43 CFR parts 1500-1508, and Forest Service implementing policies and procedures set forth in Forest Service Manual chapter 1950 and Forest Service Handbook 1909.15.
              (b) Scheduling analysis of available lands. Within 6 months of April 20, 1990, Forest Supervisors shall develop, in cooperation with the Bureau of Land Management and with public input, a schedule for analyzing lands under their jurisdiction that have not been already analyzed for leasing. The Forest Supervisors shall revise or make additions to the schedule at least annually. In scheduling lands for analysis, the authorized Forest officer shall identify and exclude from further review the following lands which are legally unavailable for leasing:
              (1) Lands withdrawn from mineral leasing by an act of Congress or by an order of the Secretary of the Interior;
              (2) Lands recommended for wilderness allocation by the Secretary of Agriculture;
              (3) Lands designated by statute as wilderness study areas, unless oil and gas leasing is specifically allowed by the statute designating the study area; and
              (4) Lands within areas allocated for wilderness or further planning in Executive Communication 1504, Ninety-Sixth Congress (House Document No. 96-119), unless such lands subsequently have been allocated to uses other than wilderness by an approved Forest land and resource management plan or have been released to uses other than wilderness by an act of Congress.
              (c) Leasing analyses. The leasing analysis shall be conducted by the authorized Forest officer in accordance with the requirements of 36 CFR part 219 (Forest land and resource management planning) and/or, as appropriate, through preparation of NEPA documents. As part of the analysis, the authorized Forest officer shall:
              (1) Identify on maps those areas that will be:
              (i) Open to development subject to the terms and conditions of the standard oil and gas lease form (including an explanation of the typical standards and objectives to be enforced under the standard lease terms);
              (ii) Open to development but subject to constraints that will require the use of lease stipulations such as those prohibiting surface use on areas larger than 40 acres or such other standards as may be developed in the plan for stipulation use (with discussion as to why the constraints are necessary and justifiable); and
              (iii) Closed to leasing, distinguishing between those areas that are being closed through exercise of management direction, and those closed by law, regulation, etc.

              (2) Identify alternatives to the areas listed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, including that of not allowing leasing.
              
              (3) Project the type/amount of post-leasing activity that is reasonably foreseeable as a consequence of conducting a leasing program consistent with that described in the proposal and for each alternative.
              (4) Analyze the reasonable foreseeable impacts of post-leasing activity projected under paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
              (d) Area or Forest-wide leasing decisions (lands administratively available for leasing). Upon completion of the leasing analysis, the Regional Forest shall promptly notify the Bureau of Land Management as to the area or Forest-wide leasing decisions that have been made, that is, identify lands which have been found administratively available for leasing.
              (e) Leasing decisions for specific lands. At such time as specific lands are being considered for leasing, the Regional Forester shall review the area or Forest-wide leasing decision and shall authorize the Bureau of Land Management to offer specific lands for lease subject to:
              (1) Verifying that oil and gas leasing of the specific lands has been adequately addressed in a NEPA document, and is consistent with the Forest land and resource management plan. If NEPA has not been adequately addressed, or if there is significant new information or circumstances as defined by 40 CFR 1502.9 requiring further environmental analysis, additional environment analysis shall be done before a leasing decision for specific lands will be made. If there is inconsistency with the Forest land and resource management plan, no authorization for leasing shall be given unless the plan is amended or revised.
              (2) Ensuring that conditions of surface occupancy identified in § 228.102(c)(1) are properly included as stipulations in resulting leases.
              (3) Determining that operations and development could be allowed somewhere on each proposed lease, except where stipulations will prohibit all surface occupancy.

              Notice of appeals of decisions.
              The authorized Forest officer shall promptly notify the Bureau of Land Management if appeals of either an area or Forest-wide leasing decision or a leasing decision for specific lands are filed during the periods provided for under 36 CFR part 217.
            
            
              § 228.104
              Consideration of requests to modify, waive, or grant exceptions to lease stipulations.
              (a) General. An operator submitting a surface use plan of operations may request the authorized Forest officer to authorize the Bureau of Land Management to modify (permanently change), waive (permanently remove), or grant an exception (case-by-case exemption) to a stipulation included in a lease at the direction of the Forest Service. The person making the request is encouraged to submit any information which might assist the authorized Forest officer in making a decision.
              (b) Review. The authorized Forest officer shall review any information submitted in support of the request and any other pertinent information.

              (1) As part of the review, consistent with 30 U.S.C. 226 (f)-(g), the authorized Forest officer shall ensure compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4331 et seq.) and any other applicable laws, and shall ensure preparation of any appropriate environmental documents.
              (2) The authorized Forest officer may authorize the Bureau of Land Management to modify, waive, or grant an exception to a stipulation if:
              (i) The action would be consistent with applicable Federal laws;
              (ii) The action would be consistent with the current forest land and resource management plan;
              (iii) The management objectives which led the Forest Service to require the inclusion of the stipulation in the lease can be met without restricting operations in the manner provided for by the stipulation given the change in the present condition of the surface resources involved, or given the nature, location, timing, or design of the proposed operations; and

              (iv) The action is acceptable to the authorized Forest officer based upon a review of the environmental consequences.
              (c) Other agency stipulations. If a stipulation was included in a lease by the Forest Service at the request of another agency, the authorized Forest officer shall consult with that agency prior to authorizing modification, waiver, or exception.
              (d) Notice of decision. (1) When the review of a stipulation modification, waiver, or exception request has been completed and the authorized Forest officer has reached a decision, the authorized Forest officer shall promptly notify the operator and the appropriate Bureau of Land Management office, in writing, of the decision to grant, or grant with additional conditions, or deny the request.
              (2) Any decision to modify, waive, or grant an exception to a lease stipulation shall be subject to administrative appeal only in conjunction with an appeal of a decision on a surface use plan of operation or supplemental surface use plan of operation.

              § 228.105
              Issuance of onshore orders and notices to lessees.
              (a) Onshore oil and gas orders. The Chief of the Forest Service may issue, or cosign with the Director, Bureau of Land Management, Onshore Oil and Gas Orders necessary to implement and supplement the regulations of this subpart.
              (1) Surface Use Plans of Operations and Master Development Plans. Operators shall submit Surface Use Plans of Operations or Master Development Plans in accordance with Onshore Oil and Gas Order No. 1. Approval of a Master Development Plan constitutes a decision to approve Surface Use Plans of Operations submitted as a part of the Master Development Plan. Subsequently submitted Surface Use Plans of Operations shall be reviewed to verify that they are consistent with the approved Master Development Plan and whether additional NEPA documentation or consultation pursuant to the National Historic Preservation Act or the Endangered Species Act is required. If the review determines that additional documentation is required, the Forest Service will review the additional documentation or consult as appropriate and make an independent decision regarding the subsequently submitted Surface Use Plan of Operations, and notify the BLM and the operator whether the Surface Use Plan of Operations is approved.
              (2) Adoption of additional onshore oil and gas orders. Additional onshore oil and gas orders shall be published in the Federal Register for public comment and codified in the CFR.
              (3) Applicability of onshore oil and gas orders. Onshore Oil and Gas Orders issued pursuant to this section are binding on all operations conducted on National Forest System lands, unless otherwise provided therein.
              (b) Notices to lessees, transferees, and operators. The authorized Forest officer may issue, or cosign with the authorized officer of the Bureau of Land Management, Notices to Lessees, Transferees, and Operators necessary to implement the regulations of this subpart. Notices to Lessees, Transferees, and Operators are binding on all operations conducted on the administrative unit of the National Forest System (36 CFR 200.2) supervised by the authorized Forest officer who issued or cosigned such notice.

              § 228.106
              Operator's submission of surface use plan of operations.
              (a) General. No permit to drill on a Federal oil and gas lease for National Forest System lands may be granted without the analysis and approval of a surface use plan of operations covering proposed surface disturbing activities. An operator must obtain an approved surface use plan of operations before conducting operations that will cause surface disturbance. The operator shall submit a proposed surface use plan of operations as part of an Application for a Permit to Drill to the appropriate Bureau of Land Management office for forwarding to the Forest Service, unless otherwise directed by the Onshore Oil and Gas Order in effect when the proposed plan of operations is submitted.
              
              (b) Preparation of plan. In preparing a surface use plan of operations, the operator is encouraged to contact the local Forest Service office to make use of such information as is available from the Forest Service concerning surface resources and uses, environmental considerations, and local reclamation procedures.
              (c) Content of plan. The type, size, and intensity of the proposed operations and the sensitivity of the surface resources that will be affected by the proposed operations determine the level of detail and the amount of information which the operator includes in a proposed plan of operations. However, any surface use plan of operations submitted by an operator shall contain the information specified by the Onshore Oil and Gas Order in effect when the surface use plan of operations is submitted.
              (d) Supplemental plan. An operator must obtain an approved supplemental surface use plan of operations before conducting any surface disturbing operations that are not authorized by a current approved surface use plan of operations. The operator shall submit a proposed supplemental surface use plan of operations to the appropriate Bureau of Land Management office for forwarding to the Forest Service, unless otherwise directed by the Onshore Oil and Gas Order in effect when the proposed supplemental plan of operations is submitted. The supplemental plan of operations need only address those operations that differ from the operations authorized by the current approved surface use plan of operations. A supplemental plan is otherwise subject to the same requirements under this subpart as an initial surface use plan of operations.
            
            
              § 228.107
              Review of surface use plan of operations.
              (a) Review. The authorized Forest officer shall review a surface use plan of operations as promptly as practicable given the nature and scope of the proposed plan. As part of the review, the authorized Forest officer shall comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, implementing regulations at 40 CFR parts 1500-1508, and the Forest Service implementing policies and procedures set forth in Forest Service Manual Chapter 1950 and Forest Service Handbook 1909.15 and shall ensure that:
              (1) The surface use plan of operations is consistent with the lease, including the lease stipulations, and applicable Federal laws;
              (2) To the extent consistent with the rights conveyed by the lease, the surface use plan of operations is consistent with, or is modified to be consistent with, the applicable current approved forest land and resource management plan;
              (3) The surface use plan of operations meets or exceeds the surface use requirements of § 228.108 of this subpart; and
              (4) The surface use plan of operations is acceptable, or is modified to be acceptable, to the authorized Forest officer based upon a review of the environmental consequences of the operations.
              (b) Decision. The authorized Forest officer shall make a decision on the approval of a surface use plan of operations as follows:
              (1) If the authorized Forest officer will not be able to make a decision on the proposed plan within 3 working days after the conclusion of the 30-day notice period provided for by 30 U.S.C. 226(f), the authorized Forest officer shall advise the appropriate Bureau of Land Management office and the operator as soon as such delay becomes apparent, either in writing or orally with subsequent written confirmation, that additional time will be needed to process the plan. The authorized Forest officer shall explain the reason why additional time is needed and project the date by which a decision on the plan will likely be made.
              (2) When the review of a surface use plan of operations has been completed, the authorized Forest officer shall promptly notify the operator and the appropriate Bureau of Land Management office, in writing, that:
              (i) The plan is approved as submitted:
              (ii) The plan is approved subject to specified conditions; or,
              (iii) The plan is disapproved for the reasons stated.
              (c) Notice of decision. The authorized Forest officer shall give public notice of the decision on a surface use plan of operations and include in the notice that the decision is subject to appeal under 36 CFR part 214 or 215.
              (d) Transmittal of decision. The authorized Forest officer shall immediately forward a decision on a surface use plan of operations to the appropriate Bureau of Land Management office and the operator. This transmittal shall include the estimated cost of reclamation and restoration (§ 228.109(a)) if the authorized Forest officer believes that additional bonding is required.
              (e) Supplemental plans. A supplemental surface use plan of operations (§ 228.106(d)) shall be reviewed in the same manner as an initial surface use plan of operations.
              [55 FR 10444, Mar. 21, 1990, as amended at 72 FR 10328, Mar. 7, 2007; 78 FR 33724, June 5, 2013]

Such measures may include, but are not limited to, posting signs, building fences, or otherwise identifying the hazardous site or condition.
              (i) Wastes. The operator must either remove garbage, refuse, and sewage from National Forest System lands or treat and dispose of that material in such a manner as to minimize or prevent adverse impacts on surface resources. The operator shall treat or dispose of produced water, drilling fluid, and other waste generated by the operations in such a manner as to minimize or prevent adverse impacts on surface resources.
              (j) Watershed protection. (1) Except as otherwise provided in the approved surface use plan of operations, the operator shall not conduct operations in areas subject to mass soil movement, riparian areas and wetlands.
              (2) The operator shall take measures to minimize or prevent erosion and sediment production. Such measures include, but are not limited to, siting structures, facilities, and other improvements to avoid steep slopes and excessive clearing of land.
            
            
              § 228.109
              Bonds.
              (a) General. As part of the review of a proposed surface use plan of operations, the authorized Forest officer shall consider the estimated cost to the Forest Service to reclaim those areas that would be disturbed by operations and to restore any lands or surface waters adversely affected by the lease operations after the abandonment or cessation of operations on the lease. If at any time prior to or during the conduct of operations, the authorized Forest officer determines the financial instrument held by the Bureau of Land Management is not adequate to ensure complete and timely reclamation and restoration, the authorized Forest officer shall give the operator the option of either increasing the financial instrument held by the Bureau of Land Management or filing a separate instrument with the Forest Service in the amount deemed adequate by the authorized Forest officer to ensure reclamation and restoration.
              (b) Standards for estimating reclamation costs. The authorized Forest officer shall consider the costs of the operator's proposed reclamation program and the need for additional measures to be taken when estimating the cost to the Forest Service to reclaim the disturbed area.
              (c) Release of reclamation liability. An operator may request the authorized Forest officer to notify the Bureau of Land Management of reduced reclamation liability at any time after reclamation has commenced. The authorized Forest officer shall, if appropriate, notify the Bureau of Land Management as to the amount to which the liability has been reduced.
            
            
              § 228.110
              Indemnification.
              The operator and, if the operator does not hold all of the interest in the applicable lease, all lessees and transferees are jointly and severally liable in accordance with Federal and State laws for indemnifying the United States for:
              (a) Injury, loss or damage, including fire suppression costs, which the United States incurs as a result of the operations; and

              (e) Inspection. Forest Service officers shall periodically inspect the area of operations to determine and document whether operations are being conducted in compliance with the regulations in this subpart, the stipulations included in the lease at the direction of the Forest Service, the approved surface use plan of operations, the applicable Onshore Oil and Gas Order, and applicable Notices to Lessees, Transferees, and Operators.
            
            
              § 228.113
              Notice of noncompliance.
              (a) Issuance. When an authorized Forest officer finds that the operator is not in compliance with a reclamation or other standard, a stipulation included in a lease at the direction of the Forest Service, an approved surface use plan of operation, the regulations in this subpart, the applicable onshore oil and gas order, or an applicable notice to lessees, transferees, and operators, the authorized Forest officer shall issue a notice of noncompliance.
              (1) Content. The notice of noncompliance shall include the following:
              (i) Identification of the reclamation requirements or other standard(s) with which the operator is not in compliance;

              (ii) Description of the measures which are required to correct the noncompliance;
              
              (iii) Specification of a reasonable period of time within which the noncompliance must be corrected;
              (iv) If the noncompliance appears to be material, identification of the possible consequences of continued noncompliance of the requirement(s) or standard(s) as described in 30 U.S.C. 226(g);
              (v) If the noncompliance appears to be in violation of the prohibitions set forth in 36 CFR part 261, identification of the possible consequences of continued noncompliance of the requirement(s) or standard(s) as described in 36 CFR 261.1b; and
              (vi) Notification that the authorized Forest officer remains willing and desirous of working cooperatively with the operator to resolve or remedy the noncompliance.
              (2) Extension of deadlines. The operator may request an extension of a deadline specified in a notice of noncompliance if the operator is unable to come into compliance with the applicable requirement(s) or standard(s) identified in the notice of noncompliance by the deadline because of conditions beyond the operator's control. The authorized Forest officer shall not extend a deadline specified in a notice of noncompliance unless the operator requested an extension and the authorized Forest officer finds that there was a condition beyond the operator's control, that such condition prevented the operator from complying with the notice of noncompliance by the specified deadline, and that the extension will not adversely affect the interests of the United States. Conditions which may be beyond the operator's control include, but are not limited to, closure of an area in accordance with 36 CFR part 261, subparts B or C, or inaccessibility of an area of operations due to such conditions as fire, flooding, or snowpack.
              (3) Manner of service. The authorized Forest officer shall serve a notice of noncompliance or a decision on a request for extension of a deadline specified in a notice upon the operator in person, by certified mail or by telephone. However, if notice is initially provided in person or by telephone, the authorized Forest officer shall send the operator written confirmation of the notice or decision by certified mail.
              (b) Failure to come into compliance. If the operator fails to come into compliance with the applicable requirement(s) or standard(s) identified in a notice of noncompliance by the deadline specified in the notice, or an approved extension, the authorized Forest officer shall decide whether: The noncompliance appears to be material given the reclamation requirements and other standards applicable to the lease established by 30 U.S.C. 226(g), the regulations in this subpart, the stipulations included in a lease at the direction of the Forest Service, an approved surface use plan of operations, the applicable Onshore Oil and Gas Order, or an applicable Notice to lessees, transferees, and operators; the noncompliance is likely to result in danger to public health or safety or irreparable resource damage; and the noncompliance is resulting in an emergency.
              (1) Referral to compliance officer. When the operations appear to be in material noncompliance, the authorized Forest officer shall promptly refer the matter to the compliance officer. The referral shall be accompanied by a complete statement of the facts supported by appropriate exhibits. Apparent material noncompliance includes, but is not limited to, operating without an approved surface use plan of operations, conducting operations that have been suspended, failure to timely complete reclamation in accordance with an approved surface use plan of operations, failure to maintain an additional bond in the amount required by the authorized Forest officer during the period of operation, failure to timely reimburse the Forest Service for the cost of abating an emergency, and failing to comply with any term included in a lease, stipulation, or approved surface use plan of operations, the applicable onshore oil and gas order, or an applicable Notice to lessees, transferees, and operators, relating to the protection of a threatened or endangered species.
              (2) Suspension of operations. When the noncompliance is likely to result in danger to public health or safety or in irreparable resource damage, the authorized Forest officer shall suspend the operations, in whole or in part.
              (i) A suspension of operations shall remain in effect until the authorized Forest officer determines that the operations are in compliance with the applicable requirement(s) or standard(s) identified in the notice of noncompliance.
              (ii) The authorized Forest officer shall serve decisions suspending operations upon the operator in person, by certified mail, or by telephone. If notice is initially provided in person or by telephone, the authorized Forest officer shall send the operator written confirmation of the decision by certified mail.
              (iii) The authorized Forest officer shall immediately notify the appropriate Bureau of Land Management office when an operator has been given notice to suspend operations.
              (3) Abatement of emergencies. When the noncompliance is resulting in an emergency, the authorized Forest officer may take action as necessary to abate the emergency. The total cost to the Forest Service of taking actions to abate an emergency becomes an obligation of the operator.
              (i) Emergency situations include, but are not limited to, imminent dangers to public health or safety or irreparable resource damage.
              (ii) The authorized Forest officer shall promptly serve a bill for such costs upon the operator by certified mail.
            
            
              § 228.114
              Material noncompliance proceedings.
              (a) Evaluation of referral. The compliance officer shall promptly evaluate a referral made by the authorized Forest officer pursuant to § 228.113(b)(1) of this subpart.
              (b) Dismissal of referral. The compliance officer shall dismiss the referral if the compliance officer determines that there is not adequate evidence to support a reasonable belief that:
              (1) The operator was not in compliance with the applicable requirement(s) or standard(s) identified in a notice of noncompliance by the deadline specified in the notice, or an extension approved by the authorized Forest officer; or
              (2) The noncompliance with the applicable requirement(s) or standard(s) identified in the notice of noncompliance may be material.
              (c) Initiation of proceedings. The compliance officer shall initiate a material noncompliance proceeding if the compliance officer agrees that there is adequate evidence to support a reasonable belief that an operator has failed to come into compliance with the applicable requirement(s) or standard(s) identified in a notice of noncompliance by the deadline specified in the notice, or extension approved by the authorized Forest officer, and that the noncompliance may be material.
              (1) Notice of proceedings. The compliance officer shall inform the lessee and operator of the material noncompliance proceedings by certified mail, return receipt requested.
              (2) Content of notice. The notice of the material noncompliance proceeding shall include the following:
              (i) The specific reclamation requirement(s) or other standard(s) of which the operator may be in material noncompliance;
              (ii) A description of the measures that are required to correct the violation;
              (iii) A statement that if the compliance officer finds that the operator is in material noncompliance with a reclamation requirement or other standard applicable to the lease, the Secretary of the Interior will not be able to issue new leases or approve new transfers of leases to the operator, any subsidiary or affiliate of the operator, or any person controlled by or under common control with the operator until the compliance officer finds that the operator has come into compliance with such requirement or standard; and
              (iv) A recitation of the specific procedures governing the material noncompliance proceeding set forth in paragraphs (d) through (g) of this section.
              (d) Answer. Within 30 calendar days after receiving the notice of the proceeding, the operator may submit, in person, in writing, or through a representative, an answer containing information and argument in opposition to the proposed material noncompliance finding, including information that raises a genuine dispute over the material facts. In that submission, the operator also may:
              (1) Request an informal hearing with the compliance officer; and
              (2) Identify pending administrative or judicial appeal(s) which are relevant to the proposed material noncompliance finding and provide information which shows the relevance of such appeal(s).
              (e) Informal hearing. If the operator requests an informal hearing, it shall be held within 20 calendar days from the date that the compliance officer receives the operator's request.
              (1) The compliance officer may postpone the date of the informal hearing if the operator requests a postponement in writing.
              (2) At the hearing, the operator, appearing personally or through an attorney or another authorized representative, may informally present and explain evidence and argument in opposition to the proposed material noncompliance finding.
              (3) A transcript of the informal hearing shall not be required.
              (f) Additional procedures as to disputed facts. If the compliance officer finds that the answer raises a genuine dispute over facts essential to the proposed material noncompliance finding, the compliance officer shall so inform the operator by certified mail, return receipt requested. Within 10 days of receiving this notice, the operator may request a fact-finding conference on those disputed facts.
              (1) The fact-finding conference shall be scheduled within 20 calendar days from the date the compliance officer receives the operator's request, unless the operator and compliance officer agree otherwise.
              (2) At the fact-finding conference, the operator shall have the opportunity to appear with counsel, submit documentary evidence, present witnesses, and confront the person(s) the Forest Service presents.
              (3) A transcribed record of the fact-finding conference shall be made, unless the operator and the compliance officer by mutual agreement waive the requirement for a transcript. The transcript will be made available to the operator at cost upon request.
              (4) The compliance officer may preside over the fact-finding conference or designate another authorized Forest officer to preside over the fact-finding conference.
              (5) Following the fact-finding conference, the authorized Forest officer who presided over the conference shall promptly prepare written findings of fact based upon the preponderance of the evidence. The compliance officer may reject findings of fact prepared by another authorized Forest officer, in whole or in part, if the compliance officer specifically determines that such findings are arbitrary and capricious or clearly erroneous.
              (g) Dismissal of proceedings. The compliance officer shall dismiss the material noncompliance proceeding if, before the compliance officer renders a decision pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section, the authorized Forest officer who made the referral finds that the operator has come into compliance with the applicable requirements or standards identified in the notice of proceeding.
              (h) Compliance officer's decision. The compliance officer shall base the decision on the entire record, which shall consist of the authorized Forest officer's referral and its accompanying statement of facts and exhibits, information and argument that the operator provided in an answer, any information and argument that the operator provided in an informal hearing if one was held, and the findings of fact if a fact-finding conference was held.
              (1) Content. The compliance officer's decision shall state whether the operator has violated the requirement(s) or standard(s) identified in the notice of proceeding and, if so, whether that noncompliance is material given the requirements of 30 U.S.C. 226(g), the stipulations included in the lease at the direction of the Forest Service, the regulations in this subpart or an approved surface use plan of operations, the applicable onshore oil and gas order, or an applicable notice to lessees, transferees, and operators. If the compliance officer finds that the operator is in material noncompliance, the decision also shall:
              
              (i) Describe the measures that are required to correct the violation;
              (ii) Apprise the operator that the Secretary of the Interior is being notified that the operator has been found to be in material noncompliance with a reclamation requirement or other standard applicable to the lease; and

              (2) Service. The compliance officer shall serve the decision upon the operator by certified mail, return receipt requested. If the operator is found to be in material noncompliance, the compliance officer also shall immediately send a copy of the decision to the appropriate Bureau of Land Management office and to the Secretary of the Interior.
              (i) Petition for withdrawal of finding. If an operator who has been found to be in material noncompliance under the provisions of this section believes that the operations have subsequently come into compliance with the applicable requirement(s) or standard(s) identified in the compliance officer's decision, the operator may submit a written petition requesting that the material noncompliance finding be withdrawn. The petition shall be submitted to the authorized Forest officer who issued the operator the notice of noncompliance under § 228.113(a) of this subpart and shall include information or exhibits which shows that the operator has come into compliance with the requirement(s) or standard(s) identified in the compliance officer's decision.
              (1) Response to petition. Within 30 calendar days after receiving the operator's petition for withdrawal, the authorized Forest officer shall submit a written statement to the compliance officer as to whether the authorized Forest officer agrees that the operator has come into compliance with the requirement(s) or standard(s) identified in the compliance officer's decision. If the authorized Forest officer disagrees with the operator, the written statement shall be accompanied by a complete statement of the facts supported by appropriate exhibits.
              (2) Additional procedures as to disputed material facts. If the compliance officer finds that the authorized Forest officer's response raises a genuine dispute over facts material to the decision as to whether the operator has come into compliance with the requirement(s) or standard(s) identified in the compliance officer's decision, the compliance officer shall so notify the operator and authorized Forest officer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The notice shall also advise the operator that the fact finding procedures specified in paragraph (f) of this section apply to the compliance officer's decision on the petition for withdrawal.
              (3) Compliance officer's decision. The compliance officer shall base the decision on the petition on the entire record, which shall consist of the operator's petition for withdrawal and its accompanying exhibits, the authorized Forest officer's response to the petition and, if applicable, its accompanying statement of facts and exhibits, and if a fact-finding conference was held, the findings of fact. The compliance officer shall serve the decision on the operator by certified mail.
              (i) If the compliance officer finds that the operator remains in violation of requirement(s) or standard(s) identified in the decision finding that the operator was in material noncompliance, the decision on the petition for withdrawal shall identify such requirement(s) or standard(s) and describe the measures that are required to correct the violation(s).
              (ii) If the compliance officer finds that the operator has subsequently come into compliance with the requirement(s) or standard(s) identified in the compliance officer's decision finding that the operator was in material noncompliance, the compliance officer also shall immediately send a copy of the decision on the petition for withdrawal to the appropriate Bureau of Land Management office and notify the Secretary of the Interior that the operator has come into compliance.
              (j) List of operators found to be in material noncompliance. The Deputy Chief, National Forest System, shall compile and maintain a list of operators who have been found to be in material noncompliance with reclamation requirements and other standards as provided in 30 U.S.C. 226(g), the regulations in this subpart, a stipulation included in a lease at the direction of the Forest Service, or an approved surface use plan of operations, the applicable onshore oil and gas order, or an applicable notice to lessees, transferees, and operators, for a lease on National Forest System lands to which such standards apply. This list shall be made available to Regional Foresters, Forest Supervisors, and upon request, members of the public.

            Scope and authority.
            The Urban and Community Forestry Assistance Program is authorized by Section 9 of the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978, as amended (16 U.S.C. 2105). The scope of this authority includes the provision of technical, financial, and related assistance to State and local governments, non-profits, and other members of the public to: maintain, expand, and preserve forest and tree cover; expand research and education efforts related to trees and forest cover; enhance technical skills and understanding of tree maintenance and practices involving cultivation of trees, shrubs and complementary ground covers; and implementing a tree planting program to complement urban tree maintenance and open space programs. The Secretary has delegated the authority for implementing the program to the Chief of the Forest Service under 7 CFR 2.60(a)(16).
          
          
            § 230.21
            Implementation of the program.

            (a) The Urban and Community Forestry Assistance Program is implemented through the Forest Service Grants, Cooperative Agreements, and Other Agreements Program (FSM 1580) and the Grants, Cooperative Agreements, and Other Agreements Handbook (FSH 1509.11). The Forest Service Manual and Handbook are available from the Forest Service internet homepage or at National Forest offices.
            (b) The Forest Service, under the authority of the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978 and through the Urban and Community Forestry Assistance Program, coordinates financial, technical, and related assistance with the Natural Resources Conservation Service for the Urban Resources Partnership initiative. The Natural Resources Conservation Service provides similar assistance through the Urban Resources Partnership initiative under the authority of the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act (16 U.S.C. 590a-590f). The Urban Resources Partnership is an initiative in which Federal agencies, in cooperation with State and local agencies, community groups, and non-governmental organizations endeavor to be more effective, responsive, and efficient in working together to protect, improve, and rehabilitate the environment in urban areas of the Nation. The Forest Service and Natural Resources Conservation Service implement the Urban Resources Partnership initiative under the “Urban Resources Partnership National Guidance for U.S. Department of Agriculture Personnel” and applicable agency and departmental procedures for Federal grants and cooperative agreements. Copies of the Guidance may be obtained from the Cooperative Forestry Staff, Forest Service, USDA, P.O. Box 96090, Washington, DC 20090-6090.

            Until a cooperative agreement has been entered into between the Chief of the Forest Service and appropriate State officials for the regulation of game as provided in § 241.2 and the necessary implementing laws or regulations have been promulgated and taken effect in order to carry out such cooperative agreement the following paragraphs shall be effective:
            (a) Any person desiring to hunt or take game or non-game animals, game or non-game birds, or fish, upon any National Forest lands or waters embraced within the boundaries of a military reservation or a national game or bird refuge, preserve, sanctuary, or reservation established by or under authority of an act of Congress, shall procure in advance a permit from the Forest Supervisor. The permit shall be issued for a specified season, shall fix the bag or creel limits, and shall prescribe such other conditions as the Regional Forester may consider necessary for carrying out the purposes for which such lands have been set aside or reserved.
            (b) Officials of the Forest Service will cooperate with persons, firms, corporations, and State and county officials in the protection, management, and utilization of game and non-game animals, game and non-game birds, and fish, upon national forest lands of the character referred to in paragraph (a) of this section. The Chief of the Forest Service may authorize the acceptance of contributions from cooperators for the payment of expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of this section.
            (c) When necessary for the protection of the forest or the conservation of animal life on refuges under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the Chief of the Forest Service may sell, barter, exchange, or donate game and non-game animals. When the interests of game conservation will be promoted thereby, the Chief of the Forest Service may accept donations of game and non-game animals, game and non-game birds, and fish, or the eggs of birds and fish.

            (d) The National Park Service may regulate further the eligibility of those individuals qualified to engage in subsistence uses on National Park Service lands in accordance with specific authority in ANILCA, and National Park Service regulations at 36 CFR Part 13.
          
          
            § 242.6
            Licenses, permits, harvest tickets, tags, and reports.
            (a) If you wish to take fish and wildlife on public lands for subsistence uses, you must be an eligible rural Alaska resident and:
            (1) Possess the pertinent valid Alaska resident hunting and trapping licenses (no license required to take fish or shellfish, but you must be an Alaska resident) unless Federal licenses are required or unless otherwise provided for in subpart D of this part;
            (2) Possess and comply with the provisions of any pertinent Federal permits (Federal Subsistence Registration Permit or Federal Designated Harvester Permit) required by subpart D of this part; and
            (3) Possess and comply with the provisions of any pertinent permits, harvest tickets, or tags required by the State unless any of these documents or individual provisions in them are superseded by the requirements in subpart D of this part.
            (b) In order to receive a Federal Subsistence Registration Permit or Federal Designated Harvester Permit or designate someone to harvest fish or wildlife for you under a Federal Designated Harvester Permit, you must be old enough to reasonably harvest that species yourself (or under the guidance of an adult).
            (c) If you have been awarded a permit to take fish and wildlife, you must have that permit in your possession during the taking and must comply with all requirements of the permit and the regulations in this section pertaining to validation and reporting and to regulations in subpart D of this part pertaining to methods and means, possession and transportation, and utilization. Upon the request of a State or Federal law enforcement agent, you must also produce any licenses, permits, harvest tickets, tags, or other documents required by this section. If you are engaged in taking fish and wildlife under the regulations in this part, you must allow State or Federal law enforcement agents to inspect any apparatus designed to be used, or capable of being used to take fish or wildlife, or any fish or wildlife in your possession.

            (d) You must validate the harvest tickets, tags, permits, or other required documents before removing your kill from the harvest site. You must also comply with all reporting provisions as set forth in subpart D of this part.
            
            (e) If you take fish and wildlife under a community harvest system, you must report the harvest activity in accordance with regulations specified for that community in subpart D of this part, and as required by any applicable permit conditions. Individuals may be responsible for particular reporting requirements in the conditions permitting a specific community's harvest. Failure to comply with these conditions is a violation of the regulations in this part. Community harvests are reviewed annually under the regulations in subpart D of this part.
            (f) You may not make a fraudulent application for Federal or State licenses, permits, harvest tickets or tags or intentionally file an incorrect harvest report.

            § 242.7
            Restriction on use.
            (a) You may not use fish or wildlife or their parts, taken pursuant to the regulations in this part, unless provided for in this part.
            (b) You may not exchange in customary trade or sell fish or wildlife or their parts, taken pursuant to the regulations in this part, unless provided for in this part.
            (c) You may barter fish or wildlife or their parts, taken pursuant to the regulations in this part, unless restricted in §§ 242.25, 242.26, 242.27, or 242.28.
          
          
            § 242.8
            Penalties.
            If you are convicted of violating any provision of 50 CFR Part 100 or 36 CFR Part 242, you may be punished by a fine or by imprisonment in accordance with the penalty provisions applicable to the public land where the violation occurred.
          
          
            § 242.9
            Information collection requirements.
            (a) The rules in this part contain information collection requirements subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval under 44 U.S.C. 3501-3520. They apply to fish and wildlife harvest activities on public lands in Alaska. Subsistence users will not be required to respond to an information collection request unless a valid OMB number is displayed on the information collection form.
            (1) Section 242.6, Licenses, permits, harvest tickets, tags, and reports. The information collection requirements contained in § 242.6 (Federal Subsistence Registration Permit or Federal Designated Harvester Permit forms) provide for permit-specific subsistence activities not authorized through the general adoption of State regulations. Identity and location of residence are required to determine if you are eligible for a permit and a report of success is required after a harvest attempt. These requirements are not duplicative with the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The regulations in § 242.6 require this information before a rural Alaska resident may engage in subsistence uses on public lands. The Department estimates that the average time necessary to obtain and comply with this permit information collection requirement is 0.25 hours.
            (2) Section 242.20, Request for reconsideration. The information collection requirements contained in § 242.20 provide a standardized process to allow individuals the opportunity to appeal decisions of the Board. Submission of a request for reconsideration is voluntary but required to receive a final review by the Board. We estimate that a request for reconsideration will take 4 hours to prepare and submit.
            (3) The remaining information collection requirements contained in this part imposed upon subsistence users are those adopted from State regulations. These collection requirements would exist in the absence of Federal subsistence regulations and are not subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act. The burden in this situation is negligible, and information gained from these reports is systematically available to Federal managers by routine computer access requiring less than 1 hour.

            (b) You may direct comments on the burden estimate or any other aspect of the burden estimate to: Information Collection Officer, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 1849 C Street, N.W., MS 222 ARLSQ, Washington, D.C. 20240; and the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (Subsistence), Washington, D.C. 20503. Additional information requirements may be imposed if Local Advisory Committees or additional Regional Councils, subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), are established under subpart B of this part. Such requirements will be submitted to OMB for approval prior to their implementation.

            § 242.10
            Federal Subsistence Board.
            (a) The Secretary of the Interior and Secretary of Agriculture hereby establish a Federal Subsistence Board, and assign it responsibility for administering the subsistence taking and uses of fish and wildlife on public lands, and the related promulgation and signature authority for regulations of subparts C and D of this part. The Secretaries, however, retain their existing authority to restrict or eliminate hunting, fishing, or trapping activities which occur on lands or waters in Alaska other than public lands when such activities interfere with subsistence hunting, fishing, or trapping on the public lands to such an extent as to result in a failure to provide the subsistence priority.
            (b) Membership. (1) The voting members of the Board are: A Chair to be appointed by the Secretary of the Interior with the concurrence of the Secretary of Agriculture; two public members who possess personal knowledge of and direct experience with subsistence uses in rural Alaska to be appointed by the Secretary of the Interior with the concurrence of the Secretary of Agriculture; the Alaska Regional Director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; Alaska Regional Director, National Park Service; Alaska Regional Forester, U.S. Forest Service; the Alaska State Director, Bureau of Land Management; and the Alaska Regional Director, Bureau of Indian Affairs. Each Federal agency member of the Board may appoint a designee.
            (2) [Reserved]
            (c) Liaisons to the Board are: a State liaison, and the Chairman of each Regional Council. The State liaison and the Chairman of each Regional Council may attend public sessions of all Board meetings and be actively involved as consultants to the Board.
            (d) Powers and duties. (1) The Board shall meet at least twice per year and at such other times as deemed necessary. Meetings shall occur at the call of the Chair, but any member may request a meeting.
            (2) A quorum consists of five members.
            (3) No action may be taken unless a majority of voting members are in agreement.
            (4) The Board is empowered, to the extent necessary, to implement Title VIII of ANILCA, to:
            (i) Issue regulations for the management of subsistence taking and uses of fish and wildlife on public lands;
            (ii) Determine which communities or areas of the State are rural or non-rural;
            (iii) Determine which rural Alaska areas or communities have customary and traditional subsistence uses of specific fish and wildlife populations;
            (iv) Allocate subsistence uses of fish and wildlife populations on public lands;
            (v) Ensure that the taking on public lands of fish and wildlife for nonwasteful subsistence uses shall be accorded priority over the taking on such lands of fish and wildlife for other purposes;
            (vi) Restrict the taking of fish and wildlife on public lands for nonsubsistence uses or close public lands to the take of fish and wildlife for nonsubsistence uses when necessary for the conservation of healthy populations of fish or wildlife, to continue subsistence uses of fish or wildlife, or for reasons of public safety or administration. The Board may also reopen public lands to nonsubsistence uses if new information or changed conditions indicate that the closure is no longer warranted;

            (vii) Restrict the taking of a particular fish or wildlife population on public lands for subsistence uses, close public lands to the take of fish and wildlife for subsistence uses, or otherwise modify the requirements for take from a particular fish or wildlife population on public lands for subsistence uses when necessary to ensure the continued viability of a fish or wildlife population, or for reasons of public safety or administration. As soon as conditions warrant, the Board may also reopen public lands to the taking of a fish and wildlife population for subsistence users to continue those uses;
            (viii) Establish priorities for the subsistence taking of fish and wildlife on public lands among rural Alaska residents;
            (ix) Restrict or eliminate taking of fish and wildlife on public lands;
            (x) Determine what types and forms of trade of fish and wildlife taken for subsistence uses constitute allowable customary trade;
            (xi) Authorize the Regional Councils to convene;
            (xii) Establish a Regional Council in each subsistence resource region and recommend to the Secretaries, appointees to the Regional Councils, pursuant to the FACA;
            (xiii) Establish Federal Advisory Committees within the subsistence resource regions, if necessary, and recommend to the Secretaries that members of the Federal Advisory Committees be appointed from the group of individuals nominated by rural Alaska residents;
            (xiv) Establish rules and procedures for the operation of the Board, and the Regional Councils;
            (xv) Review and respond to proposals for regulations, management plans, policies, and other matters related to subsistence taking and uses of fish and wildlife;
            (xvi) Enter into cooperative agreements or otherwise cooperate with Federal agencies, the State, Native organizations, local governmental entities, and other persons and organizations, including international entities to effectuate the purposes and policies of the Federal subsistence management program;
            (xvii) Develop alternative permitting processes relating to the subsistence taking of fish and wildlife to ensure continued opportunities for subsistence;
            (xviii) Evaluate whether hunting, fishing, or trapping activities which occur on lands or waters in Alaska other than public lands interfere with subsistence hunting, fishing, or trapping on the public lands to such an extent as to result in a failure to provide the subsistence priority, and after appropriate consultation with the State of Alaska, the Regional Councils, and other Federal agencies, make a recommendation to the Secretaries for their action;
            (xix) Identify, in appropriate specific instances, whether there exists additional Federal reservations, Federal reserved water rights or other Federal interests in lands or waters, including those in which the United States holds less than a fee ownership, to which the Federal subsistence priority attaches, and make appropriate recommendation to the Secretaries for inclusion of those interests within the Federal Subsistence Management Program; and
            (xx) Take other actions authorized by the Secretaries to implement Title VIII of ANILCA.
            (5) The Board may implement one or more of the following harvest and harvest reporting or permit systems:
            (i) The fish and wildlife is taken by an individual who is required to obtain and possess pertinent State harvest permits, tickets, or tags, or Federal permit (Federal Subsistence Registration Permit);
            (ii) A qualified subsistence user may designate another qualified subsistence user (by using the Federal Designated Harvester Permit) to take fish and wildlife on his or her behalf;
            (iii) The fish and wildlife is taken by individuals or community representatives permitted (via a Federal Subsistence Registration Permit) a one-time or annual harvest for special purposes including ceremonies and potlatches; or
            (iv) The fish and wildlife is taken by representatives of a community permitted to do so in a manner consistent with the community's customary and traditional practices.

            (6) The Board may delegate to agency field officials the authority to set harvest and possession limits, define harvest areas, specify methods or means of harvest, specify permit requirements, and open or close specific fish or wildlife harvest seasons within frameworks established by the Board.
            (7) The Board shall establish a Staff Committee for analytical and administrative assistance composed of members from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service, U.S. Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Indian Affairs, and USDA Forest Service. A U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service representative shall serve as Chair of the Staff Committee.
            (8) The Board may establish and dissolve additional committees as necessary for assistance.
            (9) The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service shall provide appropriate administrative support for the Board.
            (10) The Board shall authorize at least two meetings per year for each Regional Council.
            (e) Relationship to Regional Councils. (1) The Board shall consider the reports and recommendations of the Regional Councils concerning the taking of fish and wildlife on public lands within their respective regions for subsistence uses. The Board may choose not to follow any Regional Council recommendation which it determines is not supported by substantial evidence, violates recognized principles of fish and wildlife conservation, would be detrimental to the satisfaction of subsistence needs, or in closure situations, for reasons of public safety or administration or to assure the continued viability of a particular fish or wildlife population. If a recommendation is not adopted, the Board shall set forth the factual basis and the reasons for the decision, in writing, in a timely fashion.
            (2) The Board shall provide available and appropriate technical assistance to the Regional Councils.

            § 242.12
            Local advisory committees.
            (a) The Board shall establish such local Federal Advisory Committees within each region as necessary at such time that it is determined, after notice and hearing and consultation with the State, that the existing State fish and game advisory committees do not adequately provide advice to, and assist, the particular Regional Council in carrying out its function as set forth in § 242.11.
            (b) Local Federal Advisory Committees, if established by the Board, shall operate in conformance with the provisions of the FACA, and comply with rules of operation established by the Board.
          
          
            § 242.13
            Board/agency relationships.
            (a) General. (1) The Board, in making decisions or recommendations, shall consider and ensure compliance with specific statutory requirements regarding the management of resources on public lands, recognizing that the management policies applicable to some public lands may entail methods of resource and habitat management and protection different from methods appropriate for other public lands.

            (2) The Board shall issue regulations for subsistence taking of fish and wildlife on public lands. The Board is the final administrative authority on the promulgation of subparts C and D regulations relating to the subsistence taking of fish and wildlife on public lands.
            
            (3) Nothing in the regulations in this part shall enlarge or diminish the authority of any agency to issue regulations necessary for the proper management of public lands under their jurisdiction in accordance with ANILCA and other existing laws.
            (b) Section 808 of ANILCA establishes National Park and Park Monument Subsistence Resource Commissions. Nothing in the regulations in this part affects the duties or authorities of these commissions.

            (b) The Board may close public lands to hunting, trapping, or fishing, or take actions to restrict the taking of fish and wildlife when necessary to conserve healthy populations of fish and wildlife, continue subsistence uses of such populations, or pursuant to other applicable Federal law. The Board may review and adopt State openings, closures, or restrictions which serve to achieve the objectives of the regulations in this part.
            (c) The Board may enter into agreements with the State in order to coordinate respective management responsibilities.
            (d) Petition for repeal of subsistence rules and regulations. (1) The State of Alaska may petition the Secretaries for repeal of the subsistence rules and regulations in this part when the State has enacted and implemented subsistence management and use laws which:
            (i) Are consistent with sections 803, 804, and 805 of ANILCA; and
            (ii) Provide for the subsistence definition, preference, and participation specified in sections 803, 804, and 805 of ANILCA.
            (2) The State's petition shall:
            (i) Be submitted to the Secretary of the Interior, U.S. Department of the Interior, Washington, D.C. 20240, and the Secretary of Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, D.C. 20240;
            (ii) Include the entire text of applicable State legislation indicating compliance with sections 803, 804, and 805 of ANILCA; and
            (iii) Set forth all data and arguments available to the State in support of legislative compliance with sections 803, 804, and 805 of ANILCA.
            (3) If the Secretaries find that the State's petition contains adequate justification, a rulemaking proceeding for repeal of the regulations in this part will be initiated. If the Secretaries find that the State's petition does not contain adequate justification, the petition will be denied by letter or other notice, with a statement of the ground for denial.

            § 242.16
            Customary and traditional use determination process.
            (a) The Board shall determine which fish stocks and wildlife populations have been customarily and traditionally used for subsistence. These determinations shall identify the specific community's or area's use of specific fish stocks and wildlife populations. For areas managed by the National Park Service, where subsistence uses are allowed, the determinations may be made on an individual basis.
            (b) A community or area shall generally exhibit the following factors, which exemplify customary and traditional use. The Board shall make customary and traditional use determinations based on application of the following factors:
            (1) A long-term consistent pattern of use, excluding interruptions beyond the control of the community or area;
            (2) A pattern of use recurring in specific seasons for many years;

            (3) A pattern of use consisting of methods and means of harvest which are characterized by efficiency and economy of effort and cost, conditioned by local characteristics;
            
            (4) The consistent harvest and use of fish or wildlife as related to past methods and means of taking; near, or reasonably accessible from, the community or area;
            (5) A means of handling, preparing, preserving, and storing fish or wildlife which has been traditionally used by past generations, including consideration of alteration of past practices due to recent technological advances, where appropriate;
            (6) A pattern of use which includes the handing down of knowledge of fishing and hunting skills, values, and lore from generation to generation;
            (7) A pattern of use in which the harvest is shared or distributed within a definable community of persons; and
            (8) A pattern of use which relates to reliance upon a wide diversity of fish and wildlife resources of the area and which provides substantial cultural, economic, social, and nutritional elements to the community or area.
            (c) The Board shall take into consideration the reports and recommendations of any appropriate Regional Council regarding customary and traditional uses of subsistence resources.
            (d) Current determinations are listed in § 242.24.
          
          
            § 242.17
            Determining priorities for subsistence uses among rural Alaska residents.
            (a) Whenever it is necessary to restrict the subsistence taking of fish and wildlife on public lands in order to protect the continued viability of such populations, or to continue subsistence uses, the Board shall establish a priority among the rural Alaska residents after considering any recommendation submitted by an appropriate Regional Council.
            (b) The priority shall be implemented through appropriate limitations based on the application of the following criteria to each area, community, or individual determined to have customary and traditional use, as necessary:
            (1) Customary and direct dependence upon the populations as the mainstay of livelihood;
            (2) Local residency; and
            (3) The availability of alternative resources.
            (c) If allocation on an area or community basis is not achievable, then the Board shall allocate subsistence opportunity on an individual basis through application of the criteria in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section.
            (d) In addressing a situation where prioritized allocation becomes necessary, the Board shall solicit recommendations from the Regional Council in the area affected.
          
          
            § 242.18
            Regulation adoption process.

            (a) The Board will accept proposals for changes to the Federal subsistence regulations in subparts C or D of this part according to a published schedule, except for proposals for emergency and temporary special actions, which the Board will accept according to procedures set forth in § 242.19. The Board may establish a rotating schedule for accepting proposals on various sections of subpart C or subpart D regulations over a period of years. The Board will develop and publish proposed regulations in the Federal Register, publish notice in local newspapers, and distribute comments on the proposed regulations in the form of proposals for public review.
            (1) Proposals shall be made available for at least a thirty (30) day review by the Regional Councils. Regional Councils shall forward their recommendations on proposals to the Board. Such proposals with recommendations may be submitted in the time period as specified by the Board or as a part of the Regional Council's annual report described in § 242.11, whichever is earlier.
            (2) The Board shall publish notice throughout Alaska of the availability of proposals received.
            (3) The public shall have at least thirty (30) days to review and comment on proposals.

            (4) After the comment period the Board shall meet to receive public testimony and consider the proposals. The Board shall consider traditional use patterns when establishing harvest levels and seasons, and methods and means. The Board may choose not to follow any recommendation which the Board determines is not supported by substantial evidence, violates recognized principles of fish and wildlife conservation, or would be detrimental to the satisfaction of subsistence needs. If a recommendation approved by a Regional Council is not adopted by the Board, the Board shall set forth the factual basis and the reasons for its decision in writing to the Regional Council.

            (5) Following consideration of the proposals the Board shall publish final regulations pertaining to subparts C and D of this part in the Federal Register.
            
            (b) Proposals for changes to subparts A and B of this part shall be accepted by the Secretary of the Interior in accordance with 43 CFR part 14.

            § 242.19
            Special actions.
            (a) Emergency special actions. In an emergency situation, if necessary to ensure the continued viability of a fish or wildlife population, to continue subsistence uses of fish or wildlife, or for public safety reasons, the Board may immediately open or close public lands for the taking of fish and wildlife for subsistence uses, or modify the requirements for take for subsistence uses, or close public lands to take for nonsubsistence uses of fish and wildlife, or restrict the requirements for take for nonsubsistence uses.
            (1) If the timing of a regularly scheduled meeting of the affected Regional Council so permits without incurring undue delay, the Board may seek Council recommendations on the proposed emergency special action. Such a Council recommendation, if any, will be subject to the requirements of § 242.18(a)(4).
            (2) The emergency action will be effective when directed by the Board, may not exceed 60 days, and may not be extended unless the procedures for adoption of a temporary special action, as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, have been followed.
            (b) Temporary special actions. After adequate notice and public hearing, the Board may temporarily close or open public lands for the taking of fish and wildlife for subsistence uses, or modify the requirements for subsistence take, or close public lands for the taking of fish and wildlife for nonsubsistence uses, or restrict take for nonsubsistence uses.
            (1) The Board may make such temporary changes only after it determines that the proposed temporary change will not interfere with the conservation of healthy fish and wildlife populations, will not be detrimental to the long-term subsistence use of fish or wildlife resources, and is not an unnecessary restriction on nonsubsistence users. The Board may also reopen public lands to nonsubsistence uses if new information or changed conditions indicate that the closure is no longer warranted.
            (i) Prior to implementing a temporary special action, the Board will consult with the State of Alaska and the Chairs of the Regional Councils of the affected regions.
            (ii) If the timing of a regularly scheduled meeting of the affected Regional Council so permits without incurring undue delay, the Board will seek Council recommendations on the proposed temporary special action. Such Council recommendations, if any, will be subject to the requirements of § 242.18(a)(4).
            (2) The length of any temporary action will be confined to the minimum time period or harvest limit determined by the Board to be necessary under the circumstances. In any event, a temporary opening or closure will not extend longer than the end of the current regulatory cycle.
            (c) The Board may reject a request for either an emergency or a temporary special action if the Board concludes that there are no time-sensitive circumstances necessitating a regulatory change before the next regular proposal cycle. However, a special action request that has been rejected for this reason may be deferred, if appropriate and after consultation with the proponent, for consideration during the next regular proposal cycle. The Board will consider changes to customary and traditional use determinations in subpart C of this part only during the regular proposal cycle.

            (d) The Board will provide notice of all regulatory changes adopted via special action by posting the change on the Office of Subsistence Management Web site (http://alaska.fws.gov/asm/index.cfml). When appropriate, notice may also include distribution of press releases to newspapers, local radio stations, and local contacts, as well as direct notification to the proponent and interested parties. The Board will publish notice and reasons justifying the special action in the Federal Register as soon as practicable.
            (e) The decision of the Board on any proposed special action will constitute its final administrative action.
            (f) Regulations authorizing any individual agency to implement closures or restrictions on public lands managed by the agency remain unaffected by the regulations in this part.
            (g) Fish and wildlife may not be taken in violation of any restriction, closure, or change authorized by the Board.

            Request for reconsideration.

            (a) Regulations in subparts C and D of this part published in the Federal Register are subject to requests for reconsideration.
            (b) Any aggrieved person may file a request for reconsideration with the Board.
            (c) To file a request for reconsideration, you must notify the Board in writing within sixty (60) days of the effective date or date of publication of the notice, whichever is earlier, for which reconsideration is requested.
            (d) It is your responsibility to provide the Board with sufficient narrative evidence and argument to show why the action by the Board should be reconsidered. The Board will accept a request for reconsideration only if it is based upon information not previously considered by the Board, demonstrates that the existing information used by the Board is incorrect, or demonstrates that the Board's interpretation of information, applicable law, or regulation is in error or contrary to existing law. You must include the following information in your request for reconsideration:
            (1) Your name, and mailing address;

            (2) The action which you request be reconsidered and the date of Federal Register publication of that action;
            (3) A detailed statement of how you are adversely affected by the action;
            (4) A detailed statement of the facts of the dispute, the issues raised by the request, and specific references to any law, regulation, or policy that you believe to be violated and your reason for such allegation;
            (5) A statement of how you would like the action changed.
            (e) Upon receipt of a request for reconsideration, the Board shall transmit a copy of such request to any appropriate Regional Council and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADFG) for review and recommendation. The Board shall consider any Regional Council and ADFG recommendations in making a final decision.
            (f) If the request is justified, the Board shall implement a final decision on a request for reconsideration after compliance with 5 U.S.C. 551-559 (APA).
            (g) If the request is denied, the decision of the Board represents the final administrative action.

            § 242.24
            Customary and traditional use determinations.
            (a) The Federal Subsistence Board has determined that rural Alaska residents of the listed communities, areas, and individuals have customary and traditional use of the specified species on Federal public land in the specified areas. Persons granted individual customary and traditional use determinations will be notified in writing by the Board. The Fish & Wildlife Service and the local NPS Superintendent will maintain the list of individuals having customary and traditional use on National Parks and Monuments. A copy of the list is available upon request. When there is a determination for specific communities or areas of residence in a Unit, all other communities not listed for that species in that Unit have no Federal subsistence priority for that species in that Unit. If no determination has been made for a species in a Unit, all rural Alaska residents are eligible to harvest fish or wildlife under this part.
            (1) Wildlife determinations. The rural Alaska residents of the listed communities and areas have a customary and traditional use of the specified species on Federal public lands within the listed areas:

            (f) Harvest limits. (1) The harvest limit specified for a trapping season for a species and the harvest limit set for a hunting season for the same species are separate and distinct. This means that if you have taken a harvest limit for a particular species under a trapping season, you may take additional animals under the harvest limit specified for a hunting season or vice versa.
            (2) A brown/grizzly bear taken in a Unit or portion of a Unit having a harvest limit of “one brown/grizzly bear per year” counts against a “one brown/grizzly bear every four regulatory years” harvest limit in other Units. You may not take more than one brown/grizzly bear in a regulatory year.
            (g) Evidence of sex and identity. (1) If subsistence take of Dall sheep is restricted to a ram, you may not possess or transport a harvested sheep unless both horns accompany the animal.
            (2) If the subsistence taking of an ungulate, except sheep, is restricted to one sex in the local area, you may not possess or transport the carcass of an animal taken in that area unless sufficient portions of the external sex organs remain attached to indicate conclusively the sex of the animal, except that in Units 1-5 antlers are also considered proof of sex for deer if the antlers are naturally attached to an entire carcass, with or without the viscera; and except in Units 11, 13, 19, 21, and 24, where you may possess either sufficient portions of the external sex organs (still attached to a portion of the carcass) or the head (with or without antlers attached; however, the antler stumps must remain attached) to indicate the sex of the harvested moose. However, this paragraph (g)(2) does not apply to the carcass of an ungulate that has been butchered and placed in storage or otherwise prepared for consumption upon arrival at the location where it is to be consumed.
            (3) If a moose harvest limit requires an antlered bull, an antler size, or configuration restriction, you may not possess or transport the moose carcass or its parts unless both antlers accompany the carcass or its parts. If you possess a set of antlers with less than the required number of brow tines on one antler, you must leave the antlers naturally attached to the unbroken, uncut skull plate; however, this paragraph (g)(3) does not apply to a moose carcass or its parts that have been butchered and placed in storage or otherwise prepared for consumption after arrival at the place where it is to be stored or consumed.
            (h) Removing harvest from the field. You must leave all edible meat on the bones of the front quarters and hind quarters of caribou and moose harvested in Units 9, 17, 18, and 19B prior to October 1 until you remove the meat from the field or process it for human consumption. You must leave all edible meat on the bones of the front quarters, hind quarters, and ribs of moose harvested in Unit 21 prior to October 1 until you remove the meat from the field or process it for human consumption. You must leave all edible meat on the bones of the front quarters, hind quarters, and ribs of caribou and moose harvested in Unit 24 prior to October 1 until you remove the meat from the field or process it for human consumption. Meat of the front quarters, hind quarters, or ribs from a harvested moose or caribou may be processed for human consumption and consumed in the field; however, meat may not be removed from the bones for purposes of transport out of the field. You must leave all edible meat on the bones of the front quarters, hind quarters, and ribs of caribou and moose harvested in Unit 25 until you remove the meat from the field or process it for human consumption.
            (i) Returning of tags, marks, or collars. If you take an animal that has been marked or tagged for scientific studies, you must, within a reasonable time, notify the ADF&G or the agency identified on the collar or marker when and where the animal was taken. You also must retain any ear tag, collar, radio, tattoo, or other identification with the hide until it is sealed, if sealing is required; in all cases, you must return any identification equipment to the ADF&G or to an agency identified on such equipment.
            (j) Sealing of bear skins and skulls. (1) Sealing requirements for bear apply to brown bears taken in all Units, except as specified in this paragraph (j), and black bears of all color phases taken in Units 1-7, 11-17, and 20.
            (2) You may not possess or transport from Alaska the untanned skin or skull of a bear unless the skin and skull have been sealed by an authorized representative of ADF&G in accordance with State or Federal regulations, except that the skin and skull of a brown bear taken under a registration permit in Units 5, 9B, 9E, 17, 18, 19A and 19B downstream of and including the Aniak River drainage, Units 21D, 22, 23, 24, and 26A need not be sealed unless removed from the area.
            (3) You must keep a bear skin and skull together until a representative of the ADF&G has removed a rudimentary premolar tooth from the skull and sealed both the skull and the skin; however, this provision does not apply to brown bears taken within Units 5, 9B, 9E, 17, 18, 19A and 19B downstream of and including the Aniak River drainage, Units 21D, 22, 23, 24, and 26A and which are not removed from the Unit.
            (i) In areas where sealing is required by Federal regulations, you may not possess or transport the hide of a bear that does not have the penis sheath or vaginal orifice naturally attached to indicate conclusively the sex of the bear.
            (ii) If the skin or skull of a bear taken in Units 9B, 17, 18, and 19A and 19B downstream of and including the Aniak River drainage is removed from the area, you must first have it sealed by an ADF&G representative in Bethel, Dillingham, or McGrath; at the time of sealing, the ADF&G representative must remove and retain the skin of the skull and front claws of the bear.
            (iii) If you remove the skin or skull of a bear taken in Units 21D, 22, 23, 24, and 26A from the area or present it for commercial tanning within the area, you must first have it sealed by an ADF&G representative in Barrow, Galena, Nome, or Kotzebue; at the time of sealing, the ADF&G representative must remove and retain the skin of the skull and front claws of the bear.
            (iv) If you remove the skin or skull of a bear taken in Unit 5 from the area, you must first have it sealed by an ADF&G representative in Yakutat.
            (v) If you remove the skin or skull of a bear taken in Unit 9E from Unit 9, you must first have it sealed by an authorized sealing representative. At the time of sealing, the representative must remove and retain the skin of the skull and front claws of the bear.
            (4) You may not falsify any information required on the sealing certificate or temporary sealing form provided by the ADF&G in accordance with State regulations.
            (k) Sealing of beaver, lynx, marten, otter, wolf, and wolverine. You may not possess or transport from Alaska the untanned skin of a marten taken in Unit 1-5, 7, 13E, or 14-16 or the untanned skin of a beaver, lynx, otter, wolf, or wolverine, whether taken inside or outside the State, unless the skin has been sealed by an authorized representative in accordance with State or Federal regulations.
            (1) In Unit 18, you must obtain an ADF&G seal for beaver skins only if they are to be sold or commercially tanned.
            (2) In Unit 2, you must seal any wolf taken on or before the 14th day after the date of taking.
            (l) Sealing form. If you take a species listed in paragraph (k) of this section but are unable to present the skin in person, you must complete and sign a temporary sealing form and ensure that the completed temporary sealing form and skin are presented to an authorized representative of ADF&G for sealing consistent with requirements listed in paragraph (k) of this section.
            (m) Traditional religious ceremonies. You may take wildlife, outside of established season or harvest limits, for food in traditional religious ceremonies, which are part of a funerary or mortuary cycle, including memorial potlatches, under the following provisions:
            (1) The harvest does not violate recognized principles of wildlife conservation and uses the methods and means allowable for the particular species published in the applicable Federal regulations. The appropriate Federal land manager will establish the number, species, sex, or location of harvest, if necessary, for conservation purposes. Other regulations relating to ceremonial harvest may be found in the Unit-specific regulations in paragraph (n) of this section.
            (2) No permit or harvest ticket is required for harvesting under this section; however, the harvester must be a federally qualified subsistence user with customary and traditional use in the area where the harvesting will occur.
            (3) In Units 1-26 (except for Koyukon/Gwich'in potlatch ceremonies in Unit 20F, 21, 24, or 25):
            (i) A tribal chief, village or tribal council president, or the chief's or president's designee for the village in which the religious/cultural ceremony will be held, or a federally qualified subsistence user outside of a village or tribal-organized ceremony, must notify the nearest Federal land manager that a wildlife harvest will take place. The notification must include the species, harvest location, and number of animals expected to be taken.
            (ii) Immediately after the wildlife is taken, the tribal chief, village or tribal council president or designee, or other federally qualified subsistence user must create a list of the successful hunters and maintain these records, including the name of the decedent for whom the ceremony will be held. If requested, this information must be available to an authorized representative of the Federal land manager.
            (iii) The tribal chief, village or tribal council president or designee, or other federally qualified subsistence user outside of the village in which the religious/cultural ceremony will be held must report to the Federal land manager the harvest location, species, sex, and number of animals taken as soon as practicable, but not more than 15 days after the wildlife is taken.
            (4) In Units 20F, 21, 24, and 25 (for Koyukon/Gwich'in potlatch ceremonies only):
            (i) Taking wildlife outside of established season and harvest limits is authorized if it is for food for the traditional Koyukon/Gwich'in Potlatch Funerary or Mortuary ceremony and if it is consistent with conservation of healthy populations.
            (ii) Immediately after the wildlife is taken, the tribal chief, village or tribal council president, or the chief's or president's designee for the village in which the religious ceremony will be held must create a list of the successful hunters and maintain these records. The list must be made available, after the harvest is completed, to a Federal land manager upon request.
            (iii) As soon as practical, but not more than 15 days after the harvest, the tribal chief, village council president, or designee must notify the Federal land manager about the harvest location, species, sex, and number of animals taken.
            (n) Unit regulations. You may take for subsistence unclassified wildlife, all squirrel species and marmots in all Units, without harvest limits, for the period of July 1-June 30.

            § 242.27
            Subsistence taking of fish.
            (a) Applicability. (1) Regulations in this section apply to the taking of fish or their parts for subsistence uses.
            (2) You may take fish for subsistence uses at any time by any method unless you are restricted by the subsistence fishing regulations found in this section. The harvest limit specified in this section for a subsistence season for a species and the State harvest limit set for a State season for the same species are not cumulative, except as modified by regulations in paragraph (e) of this section. This means that if you have taken the harvest limit for a particular species under a subsistence season specified in this section, you may not, after that, take any additional fish of that species under any other harvest limit specified for a State season.
            (3) You may not possess, transport, give, receive, or barter subsistence-taken fish or their parts that have been taken contrary to Federal law or regulation or State law or regulation (unless superseded by regulations in this part).
            (b) Methods, means, and general restrictions. (1) Unless otherwise specified in this section or under terms of a required subsistence fishing permit (as may be modified by regulations in this section), you may use the following legal types of gear for subsistence fishing:
            (i) A set gillnet;
            (ii) A drift gillnet;
            (iii) A purse seine;
            (iv) A hand purse seine;
            (v) A beach seine;
            (vi) Troll gear;
            (vii) A fish wheel;
            (viii) A trawl;
            (ix) A pot;
            (x) A longline;
            (xi) A fyke net;
            (xii) A lead;
            (xiii) A herring pound;
            (xiv) A dip net;
            (xv) Jigging gear;
            (xvi) A mechanical jigging machine;
            (xvii) A handline;
            (xviii) A cast net;
            (xix) A rod and reel; and
            (xx) A spear.
            (2) You must include an escape mechanism on all pots used to take fish or shellfish. The escape mechanisms are as follows:
            (i) A sidewall, which may include the tunnel, of all shellfish and bottomfish pots must contain an opening equal to or exceeding 18 inches in length, except that in shrimp pots the opening must be a minimum of 6 inches in length. The opening must be laced, sewn, or secured together by a single length of untreated, 100 percent cotton twine, no larger than 30 thread. The cotton twine may be knotted at each end only. The opening must be within 6 inches of the bottom of the pot and must be parallel with it. The cotton twine may not be tied or looped around the web bars. Dungeness crab pots may have the pot lid tie-down straps secured to the pot at one end by a single loop of untreated, 100 percent cotton twine no larger than 60 thread, or the pot lid must be secured so that, when the twine degrades, the lid will no longer be securely closed.
            (ii) All king crab, Tanner crab, shrimp, miscellaneous shellfish and bottomfish pots may, instead of complying with paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, satisfy the following: a sidewall, which may include the tunnel, must contain an opening at least 18 inches in length, except that shrimp pots must contain an opening at least 6 inches in length. The opening must be laced, sewn, or secured together by a single length of treated or untreated twine, no larger than 36 thread. A galvanic timed-release device, designed to release in no more than 30 days in saltwater, must be integral to the length of twine so that, when the device releases, the twine will no longer secure or obstruct the opening of the pot. The twine may be knotted only at each end and at the attachment points on the galvanic timed-release device. The opening must be within 6 inches of the bottom of the pot and must be parallel with it. The twine may not be tied or looped around the web bars.
            (3) For subsistence fishing for salmon, you may not use a gillnet exceeding 50 fathoms in length, unless otherwise specified in this section. The gillnet web must contain at least 30 filaments of equal diameter or at least 6 filaments, each of which must be at least 0.20 millimeter in diameter.
            (4) Except as otherwise provided for in this section, you may not obstruct more than one-half the width of any stream with any gear used to take fish for subsistence uses.
            (5) You may not use live nonindigenous fish as bait.
            (6) You must have your first initial, last name, and address plainly and legibly inscribed on the side of your fish wheel facing midstream of the river.
            (7) You may use kegs or buoys of any color but red on any permitted gear, except in the following areas where kegs or buoys of any color, including red, may be used:
            (i) Yukon-Northern Area; and
            (ii) Kuskokwim Area.
            (8) You must have your first initial, last name, and address plainly and legibly inscribed on each keg, buoy, stakes attached to gillnets, stakes identifying gear fished under the ice, and any other unattended fishing gear which you use to take fish for subsistence uses.
            (9) You may not use explosives or chemicals to take fish for subsistence uses.

            (10) You may not take fish for subsistence uses within 300 feet of any dam, fish ladder, weir, culvert or other artificial obstruction, unless otherwise indicated.
            
            (11) Transactions between rural residents. Rural residents may exchange in customary trade subsistence-harvested fish, their parts, or their eggs, legally taken under the regulations in this part, for cash from other rural residents. The Board may recognize regional differences and regulates customary trade differently for separate regions of the State.
            (i) Bristol Bay Fishery Management Area—The total cash value per household of salmon taken within Federal jurisdiction in the Bristol Bay Fishery Management Area and exchanged in customary trade to rural residents may not exceed $500.00 annually.
            (ii) Upper Copper River District—The total number of salmon per household taken within the Upper Copper River District and exchanged in customary trade to rural residents may not exceed 50 percent of the annual harvest of salmon by the household. No more than 50 percent of the annual household limit may be sold under paragraphs (b)(11) and (12) of this section when taken together. These customary trade sales must be immediately recorded on a customary trade recordkeeping form. The recording requirement and the responsibility to ensure the household limit is not exceeded rests with the seller.
            (iii) Customary trade of Yukon River Chinook salmon may only occur between Federally qualified rural residents with a current customary and traditional use determination for Yukon River Chinook salmon.
            (12) Transactions between a rural resident and others. In customary trade, a rural resident may exchange fish, their parts, or their eggs, legally taken under the regulations in this part, for cash from individuals other than rural residents if the individual who purchases the fish, their parts, or their eggs uses them for personal or family consumption. If you are not a rural resident, you may not sell fish, their parts, or their eggs taken under the regulations in this part. The Board may recognize regional differences and regulates customary trade differently for separate regions of the State.
            (i) Bristol Bay Fishery Management Area—The total cash value per household of salmon taken within Federal jurisdiction in the Bristol Bay Fishery Management Area and exchanged in customary trade between rural residents and individuals other than rural residents may not exceed $400.00 annually. These customary trade sales must be immediately recorded on a customary trade recordkeeping form. The recording requirement and the responsibility to ensure the household limit is not exceeded rest with the seller.
            (ii) Upper Copper River District—The total cash value of salmon per household taken within the Upper Copper River District and exchanged in customary trade between rural residents and individuals other than rural residents may not exceed $500.00 annually. No more than 50 percent of the annual household limit may be sold under paragraphs (b)(11) and (12) of this section when taken together. These customary trade sales must be immediately recorded on a customary trade recordkeeping form. The recording requirement and the responsibility to ensure the household limit is not exceeded rest with the seller.
            (iii) Customary trade of Yukon River Chinook salmon may only occur between Federally qualified rural residents with a current customary and traditional use determination for Yukon River Chinook salmon.
            (13) No sale to, nor purchase by, fisheries businesses. (i) You may not sell fish, their parts, or their eggs taken under the regulations in this part to any individual, business, or organization required to be licensed as a fisheries business under Alaska Statute AS 43.75.011 (commercial limited-entry permit or crew license holders excluded) or to any other business as defined under Alaska Statute 43.70.110(1) as part of its business transactions.
            (ii) If you are required to be licensed as a fisheries business under Alaska Statute AS 43.75.011 (commercial limited-entry permit or crew license holders excluded) or are a business as defined under Alaska Statute 43.70.110(1), you may not purchase, receive, or sell fish, their parts, or their eggs taken under the regulations in this part as part of your business transactions.

            (14) Except as provided elsewhere in this section, you may not take rainbow/steelhead trout.
            
            (15) You may not use fish taken for subsistence use or under subsistence regulations in this part as bait for commercial or sport fishing purposes.
            (16) Unless specified otherwise in this section, you may use a rod and reel to take fish without a subsistence fishing permit. Harvest limits applicable to the use of a rod and reel to take fish for subsistence uses shall be as follows:
            (i) If you are required to obtain a subsistence fishing permit for an area, that permit is required to take fish for subsistence uses with rod and reel in that area. The harvest and possession limits for taking fish with a rod and reel in those areas are the same as indicated on the permit issued for subsistence fishing with other gear types.
            (ii) Except as otherwise provided for in this section, if you are not required to obtain a subsistence fishing permit for an area, the harvest and possession limits for taking fish for subsistence uses with a rod and reel are the same as for taking fish under State of Alaska subsistence fishing regulations in those same areas. If the State does not have a specific subsistence season and/or harvest limit for that particular species, the limit shall be the same as for taking fish under State of Alaska sport fishing regulations.
            (17) Unless restricted in this section, or unless restricted under the terms of a subsistence fishing permit, you may take fish for subsistence uses at any time.
            (18) Provisions on ADF&G subsistence fishing permits that are more restrictive or in conflict with the provisions contained in this section do not apply to Federal subsistence users.
            (19) You may not intentionally waste or destroy any subsistence-caught fish or shellfish; however, you may use for bait or other purposes, whitefish, herring, and species for which harvest limits, seasons, or other regulatory methods and means are not provided in this section, as well as the head, tail, fins, and viscera of legally taken subsistence fish.
            (20) The taking of fish from waters within Federal jurisdiction is authorized outside of published open seasons or harvest limits if the harvested fish will be used for food in traditional or religious ceremonies that are part of funerary or mortuary cycles, including memorial potlatches, provided that:
            (i) Prior to attempting to take fish, the person (or designee) or Tribal Government organizing the ceremony contacts the appropriate Federal fisheries manager to provide the nature of the ceremony, the parties and/or clans involved, the species and the number of fish to be taken, and the Federal waters from which the harvest will occur;
            (ii) The taking does not violate recognized principles of fisheries conservation, and uses the methods and means allowable for the particular species published in the applicable Federal regulations (the Federal fisheries manager will establish the number, species, or place of taking if necessary for conservation purposes);
            (iii) Each person who takes fish under this section must, as soon as practical, and not more than 15 days after the harvest, submit a written report to the appropriate Federal fisheries manager, specifying the harvester's name and address, the number and species of fish taken, and the date and locations of the taking; and
            (iv) No permit is required for taking under this section; however, the harvester must be eligible to harvest the resource under Federal regulations.
            (c) Fishing permits and reports. (1) You may take salmon only under the authority of a subsistence fishing permit, unless a permit is specifically not required in a particular area by the subsistence regulations in this part, or unless you are retaining salmon from your commercial catch consistent with paragraph (d) of this section.
            (2) If a subsistence fishing permit is required by this section, the following permit conditions apply unless otherwise specified in this section:
            (i) You may not take more fish for subsistence use than the limits set out in the permit;
            (ii) You must obtain the permit prior to fishing;
            (iii) You must have the permit in your possession and readily available for inspection while fishing or transporting subsistence-taken fish;

            (iv) If specified on the permit, you must record, prior to leaving the fishing site, daily records of the catch, showing the number of fish taken by species, location and date of catch, and other such information as may be required for management or conservation purposes; and
            (v) If the return of catch information necessary for management and conservation purposes is required by a fishing permit and you fail to comply with such reporting requirements, you are ineligible to receive a subsistence permit for that activity during the following calendar year, unless you demonstrate that failure to report was due to loss in the mail, accident, sickness, or other unavoidable circumstances. You must also return any tags or transmitters that have been attached to fish for management and conservation purposes.
            (d) Relation to commercial fishing activities. (1) If you are a Federally qualified subsistence user who also commercial fishes, you may retain fish for subsistence purposes from your lawfully-taken commercial catch.
            (2) When participating in a commercial and subsistence fishery at the same time, you may not use an amount of combined fishing gear in excess of that allowed under the appropriate commercial fishing regulations.
            (e) Fishery management area restrictions. (1) Kotzebue Area. The Kotzebue Area includes all waters of Alaska between the latitude of the westernmost tip of Point Hope and the latitude of the westernmost tip of Cape Prince of Wales, including those waters draining into the Chukchi Sea.

              Management of Municipal Watersheds.
              (a) The Forest Service shall manage National Forest watersheds that supply municipal water under multiple use prescriptions in forest plans (36 CFR part 219). When a municipality desires protective actions or restrictions of use not specified in the forest plan, within agreements, and/or special use authorizations, the municipality must apply to the Forest Service for consideration of these needs.
              (b) When deemed appropriate by the Regional Forester, requested restrictions and/or requirements shall be incorporated in the forest plan without written agreements. Written agreements with municipalities to assure protection of water supplies are appropriate when requested by the municipality and deemed necessary by the Regional Forester. A special use authorization may be needed to effect these agreements.
              (c) In preparing any municipal watershed agreement for approval by the Regional Forester or issuing special use authorization to protect municipal water supplies, the authorized forest officer shall specify the types of uses, if any, to be restricted; the nature and extent of any restrictions; any special land management protective measures and/or any necessary standards and guidelines needed to protect water quality or quantity; and any resources that are to be provided by the municipality.
              (d) A special use authorization (36 CFR 251.54) is required if the municipality is to use the subject lands, restrict public access, or control resource uses within the watershed. Special use authorizations issued pursuant to this section are subject to the same fee waivers, conditions, and procedures applicable to all other special uses as set forth in subpart B of this part.
              (e) Any municipal watershed management agreements, special use authorizations, requirements, and/or restrictions shall be consistent with forest plans, or amendments and revisions thereto.

              The location of mining claims in such areas within 660 feet of any Federal, State or county road and within such other areas where the location of mining claims would not be in the public interest, as may be designated by the Chief, Forest Service, or the Regional Forester, of Forest Service Region 2, is hereby prohibited. The Director, Bureau of Land Management, Department of the Interior, shall be advised of the areas so designated and notices of the boundaries of such areas posted at conspicuous places in the Preserve, as well as at the county courthouses in Pennington in the cities of Custer and Rapid City, and Custer Counties and the post offices State of South Dakota.

              § 251.11
              Governing mining locations under the mining laws of the United States within that portion of the Black Hills National Forest, State of South Dakota, designated as the Norbeck Wildlife Preserve.

              (a) Whoever locates a mining claim within the Norbeck Wildlife Preserve must, within 10 days after posting the location notice upon such claim, file a true copy of such location notice with the Forest Supervisor of the Black Hills National Forest at Custer, South Dakota, and further, within 10 days after said location notice is filed for record pursuant to the State laws of South Dakota, a true copy of the recorded location certificate must be filed with said Forest Supervisor.
              
              (b) All mining locators shall in all developments and operations make all reasonable provisions for the disposal of tailings, dumpage, and other deleterious materials or substances in such manner as to prevent obstruction, pollution, or deterioration of the land, streams, ponds, lakes, or springs, as may be directed by the Forest Supervisor.
              (c) All slash resulting from cutting or destruction of forest growth incident and necessary to mining operations must be disposed of as directed by the Forest Supervisor.
              (d) The cutting and removal of timber, except where clearing is necessary in connection with mining operations or to provide space for buildings or structures used in connection with mining operations, shall be conducted in accordance with the marking rules and timber sale practices applicable to the Black Hills National Forest, and such cutting and removal of timber shall be as directed by the Forest Supervisor.
              (e) No use of the surface of a mining claim or the resources therefrom not reasonably required for carrying on mining and prospecting shall be allowed, except under the National Forest rules and regulations, nor shall the locator prevent or obstruct other occupancy of the surface or use of surface resources under authority of National Forest Regulations, or permits issued thereunder, if such occupancy or use is not in conflict with mineral developments.
              (f) When any road is to be built for mining purposes upon a mining claim, the locator must apply to the Forest Supervisor for the applicable rules and regulations governing the construction and maintenance of roads within the Black Hills National Forest, and such road will be built in accordance with such specifications and in such locations as the Forest Supervisor may direct.

              (g) In conducting mining operations the locator, his agents, representatives, or employees, or other persons whose presence in the area or in the vicinity thereof, is occasioned by such mining operations, shall use due diligence in the prevention and suppression of fires, and shall, when requested by the Forest Supervisor, or his authorized representative, be available for service in the extinguishment and suppression of all fires occurring within the Preserve: Provided, That if such fire does not originate through any negligence on the part of the locator, his agents, representatives, or employees, or other persons whose presence in the area or in the vicinity thereof, is occasioned by such mining operations and does not threaten the structures, improvements or property incident to the mining operation, such persons shall be paid for their services at the current rate of pay of fire fighters employed by the United States.
              (h) Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to relieve the locator from complying with any requirements of the laws of the State of South Dakota, nor from compliance with or conformity to any requirements of any Federal law or regulation now existing or which later may be enacted or promulgated, and applicable to the subject involved in this section.

              § 251.14
              Conditions, rules and regulations to govern exercise of timber rights reserved in conveyance to the United States.
              (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, in conveyance of lands to the United States under authorized programs of the Forest Service, where owners reserve the right to enter upon the conveyed lands and to cut and remove timber and timber products, said reservations shall be subject to the following conditions, rules and regulations which shall be expressed in and made a part of the deed of conveyance to the United States and such reservations shall be exercised thereunder and in obedience thereto:

              (1) Whoever undertakes to exercise the reserved rights, hereinafter called operator, shall give prior written notice to Forest Service and shall submit satisfactory evidence of authority to exercise such rights. Operator shall repair, replace, or restore any improvements owned by the United States or its permittees, damaged or destroyed by the timber operations and he shall restore the land to a condition safe and reasonably serviceable for authorized programs of Forest Service.
              (2) In cutting and removing timber and timber products and in locating, constructing and using mills, logging roads, railroads, chutes, landings, camps, or other improvements, no unnecessary damage shall be done to the air, water and soil resources, and to young growth or to trees left standing. All survey monuments and witness trees shall be preserved.
              (3) All trees, timber or timber products of species or sizes not specifically reserved which are unnecessarily cut, damaged, or destroyed by operator shall be paid for at double the usual rates charged in the locality for sales of similar National Forest timber and timber products.
              (4) Slash and debris resulting from the cutting, removal, or processing of timber or timber products, or from construction operations, shall be disposed of or otherwise treated by methods acceptable to the Forest Service. Such treatment or disposal shall comply with known air and water quality criteria and standards and include necessary preparatory work such as fireline constructing and snag falling. The timing of log removal and preparatory work shall not unnecessarily delay slash disposal or treatment.
              (5) Operator is authorized to construct and maintain buildings, facilities, and other improvements, including roads needed to log the reserved timber. Construction and maintenance plans, designs, and location shall be approved in writing by Forest Service before construction is started.
              (6) All buildings, camps, equipment, and other structures or improvements shall be removed from the lands within 6 months from date of completion or abandonment of the operation, unless relieved by Forest Service by issuance of a special-use permit. Otherwise such buildings, camps, equipment, and other structures or improvements shall become the property of the United States, but this does not relieve operator of liability for the cost of removal and restoration of the site.
              (7) Nothing in this section shall be construed to exempt operator from any requirements of the laws of the States in which situated; nor from compliance with or conformity to any requirement of any law which later may be enacted and which otherwise would be applicable.
              (8) While operations are in progress, operator, his employees, any subcontractors, and their employees, shall take all reasonable and practicable action in the prevention and suppression of fire, and shall be available for service in the suppression of all fires within the reserved area. On any fire not caused by negligence on the part of the operator, Forest Service shall pay operator at fire-fighting rates common in the area or at prior agreed rates for equipment or manpower furnished by operator.
              (9) Only one cutting shall be made on any portion of the area on which timber is reserved. Forest Service may permit the cutting of special products, or products the cutting of which is seasonal, on any portion of the area in advance of the cutting of the chief products of the reserved timber. Each reservation of timber shall include a specific period of time within which material may be removed.
              (10) Forest Service shall have the right to use any road constructed under the authority of this timber reservation for any and all purposes in connection with the protection and administration of the National Forest.
              (11) Operator shall take all reasonable precautions to prevent pollution of the air, soil, and water, in operation hereunder.
              (12) All activities by operator in the reserved area shall be conducted in a safe, orderly, and workmanlike manner.

              (13) For the protection of streamcourses, the following measures shall be observed by operator: Culverts or bridges will be required on temporary roads at all points where it is necessary to cross streamcourses. Such facilities shall be of sufficient size and design to provide unobstructed flow of water. Equipment will not be operated in streamcourses except at designated crossings and as essential to construction or removal of culverts and bridges. Any stream that is temporarily diverted must be restored to the natural course as soon as practicable, and in any event prior to a major runoff season.
              (14) Operator shall perform currently as weather and soil conditions permit, the following erosion control work on portions of the reserved area where logging is in progress or has been completed: Construct cross-ditches and water-spreading ditches where staked or otherwise marked on the ground by Forest Service; after a temporary road has served operator's purpose, operator shall remove culverts and bridges, eliminate ditches, out-slope and cross-drain roadbed and remove ruts and berms to the extent necessary to stabilize fills and otherwise minimize erosion; operator shall avoid felling into, yarding in, or crossing natural meadows; and operations will not take place when soil and water conditions are such that excessive damage will result.
              (b) The conditions, rules and regulations set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) through (14) of this section shall not apply to reservations contained in conveyances of land to the United States under the Act of March 3, 1925, as amended (43 Stat. 1133, 64 Stat. 82, 16 U.S.C. 555).
              (c) In cases where a State, or an agency, or a political subdivision thereof, reserves timber rights for the cutting and removal of timber and timber products, in the conveyance of land to the United States under authorized programs of the Forest Service and there are provisions in the laws of such State or in conditions, rules and regulations promulgated by such State, agency or political subdivision thereof, which the Chief, Forest Service, determines are adequate to protect the interest of the United States in the event of the exercise of such reservation, the Chief, Forest Service, is hereby authorized, in his discretion, to subject the exercise of the reservation to such statutory provisions or such conditions, rules, and regulations in lieu of the conditions, rules and regulations set forth in paragraphs (a) (1) through (14) of this section. In that event, such statutory provisions or such conditions, rules and regulations shall be expressed in and made a part of the deed of conveyance to the United States and the reservation shall be exercised thereunder and in obedience thereto.
              All regulations heretofore issued by the Secretary of Agriculture to govern the exercise of timber rights reserved in conveyance of lands to the United States under authorized programs of Forest Service shall continue to be effective in the cases to which they are applicable, but are hereby superseded as to timber rights hereafter reserved in conveyances under such programs.

              § 251.15
              Conditions, rules and regulations to govern exercise of mineral rights reserved in conveyances to the United States.
              (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, in conveyances of lands to the United States under authorized programs of the Forest Service, where owners reserve the right to enter upon the conveyed lands and to prospect for, mine and remove minerals, oil, gas, or other inorganic substances, said reservations shall be subject to the following conditions, rules and regulations which shall be expressed in and made a part of the deed of conveyance to the United States and such reservations shall be exercised thereunder and in obedience thereto:
              (1) Whoever undertakes to exercise the reserved rights shall give prior written notice to the Forest Service and shall submit satisfactory evidence of authority to exercise such rights. Only so much of the surface of the lands shall be occupied, used, or disturbed as is necessary in bona fide prospecting for, drilling, mining (including the milling or concentration of ores), and removal of the reserved minerals, oil, gas, or other inorganic substances.

              (2)(i) None of the lands in which minerals are reserved shall be so used, occupied, or disturbed as to preclude their full use for authorized programs of the Forest Service until the record owner of the reserved rights, or the successors, assigns, or lessees thereof, shall have applied for and received a permit authorizing such use, occupancy, or disturbance of those specifically described parts of the lands as may reasonably be necessary to exercise of the reserved rights.
              
              (ii) Said permit shall be issued upon agreement as to conditions necessary to protect the interest of the United States including such conditions deemed necessary to provide for the safety of the public and other users of the land, and upon initial payment of the annual fee, which shall be at the rate of $2 per acre or fraction of acre included in the permit.
              (iii) The permit shall also provide that the record owner of the reserved right or the successors, assigns, or lessees thereof, will repair or replace any improvements damaged or destroyed by the mining operations and restore the land to a condition safe and reasonably serviceable for authorized programs of the Forest Service, and shall provide for a bond in sufficient amount as determined necessary by the Forest Service to guarantee such repair, replacement or restoration.
              (iv) Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the permit shall be cause for revocation of all rights to use, occupy, or disturb the surface of the lands covered by the permit, but in the event of revocation, a new permit shall be issued upon application when the causes for revocation of the preceding permit have been satisfactorily remedied and the United States has been reimbursed for any damages it has incurred from the noncompliance.
              (3) All structures, other improvements, and materials shall be removed from the lands within one year after the date of revocation of the permit.
              (4) Timber and/or young growth cut or destroyed in connection with exercise of the reserved right shall be paid for at rates determined by the Forest Service to be fair and equitable for comparable timber and/or young growth in the locality. All slash resulting from cutting or destruction of timber or young growth shall be disposed of as required by the Forest Service.

            (b) Nothing in this section prohibits the temporary occupancy of National Forest System lands without a special use authorization when necessary for the protection of life and property in emergencies, if a special use authorization is applied for and obtained at the earliest opportunity, unless waived pursuant to paragraphs (c) through (e)(3) of this section. The authorized officer may, pursuant to § 251.56 of this subpart, impose in that authorization such terms and conditions as are deemed necessary or appropriate and may require changes to the temporary occupancy to conform to those terms and conditions. Those temporarily occupying National Forest System lands without a special use authorization assume liability, and must indemnify the United States, for all injury, loss, or damage arising in connection with the temporary occupancy.
            (c) A special use authorization is not required for noncommercial recreational activities, such as camping, picnicking, hiking, fishing, boating, hunting, and horseback riding, or for noncommercial activities involving the expression of views, such as assemblies, meetings, demonstrations, and parades, unless:
            (1) The proposed use is a noncommercial group use as defined in § 251.51 of this subpart;
            (2) The proposed use is still photography as defined in § 251.51 of this subpart; or
            (3) Authorization of that use is required by an order issued under § 261.50 or by a regulation issued under § 261.70 of this chapter.
            (d) Travel on any National Forest System road shall comply with all Federal and State laws governing the road to be used and does not require a special use authorization, unless:
            (1) The travel is for the purpose of engaging in a noncommercial group use, outfitting or guiding, a recreation event, commercial filming, or still photography, as defined in § 251.51 of this subpart, or for a landowner's ingress or egress across National Forest System lands that requires travel on a National Forest System road that is not authorized for general public use under § 251.110(d) of this part; or
            (2) Authorization of that use is required by an order issued under § 261.50 or by a regulation issued under § 261.70 of this chapter.
            (e) For proposed uses other than a noncommercial group use, a special use authorization is not required if, based upon review of a proposal, the authorized officer determines that the proposed use has one or more of the following characteristics:
            (1) The proposed use will have such nominal effects on National Forest System lands, resources, or programs that it is not necessary to establish terms and conditions in a special use authorization to protect National Forest System lands and resources or to avoid conflict with National Forest System programs or operations;
            (2) The proposed use is regulated by a State agency or another Federal agency in a manner that is adequate to protect National Forest System lands and resources and to avoid conflict with National Forest System programs or operations; or
            (3) The proposed use is not situated in a congressionally designated wilderness area, and is a routine operation or maintenance activity within the scope of a statutory right-of-way for a highway pursuant to R.S. 2477 (43 U.S.C. 932, repealed Oct. 21, 1976) or for a ditch or canal pursuant to R.S. 2339 (43 U.S.C. 661, as amended), or the proposed use is a routine operation or maintenance activity within the express scope of a documented linear right-of-way.

            § 251.54
            Proposal and application requirements and procedures.
            (a) Early notice. When an individual or entity proposes to occupy and use National Forest System lands, the proponent is required to contact the Forest Service office(s) responsible for the management of the affected land as early as possible in advance of the proposed use.
            (b) Filing proposals. Proposals for special uses must be filed in writing with or presented orally to the District Ranger or Forest Supervisor having jurisdiction over the affected land (§ 200.2 of this chapter), except as follows:
            (1) Proposals for projects on lands under the jurisdiction of two or more administrative units of the Forest Service may be filed at the most convenient Forest Service office having jurisdiction over part of the project, and the proponent will be notified where to direct subsequent communications;
            (2) Proposals for cost-share and other road easements to be issued under § 251.53(j) must be filed in accordance with regulations in § 212.10(c) and (d) of this chapter; and
            (3) Proposals for oil and gas pipeline rights-of-way crossing Federal lands under the jurisdiction of two or more Federal agencies must be filed with the State Office, Bureau of Land Management, pursuant to regulations at 43 CFR part 2882.
            (c) Rights of proponents. A proposal to obtain a special use authorization does not grant any right or privilege to use National Forest System lands. Rights or privileges to occupy and use National Forest System lands under this subpart are conveyed only through issuance of a special use authorization.
            (d) Proposal content—(1) Proponent identification. Any proponent for a special use authorization must provide the proponent's name and mailing address, and, if the proponent is not an individual, the name and address of the proponent's agent who is authorized to receive notice of actions pertaining to the proposal.
            (2) Required information—(i) Noncommercial group uses. Paragraphs (d)(3) through (d)(5) of this section do not apply to proposals for noncommercial group uses. A proponent for noncommercial group uses shall provide the following:
            (A) A description of the proposed activity;
            (B) The location and a description of the National Forest System lands and facilities the proponent would like to use;
            (C) The estimated number of participants and spectators;
            (D) The starting and ending time and date of the proposed activity; and
            (E) The name of the person or persons 21 years of age or older who will sign a special use authorization on behalf of the proponent.
            (ii) All other special uses. At a minimum, proposals for special uses other than noncommercial group uses must include the information contained in paragraphs (d)(3) through (d)(5) of this section. In addition, if requested by an authorized officer, a proponent in one of the following categories must furnish the information specified for that category:
            (A) If the proponent is a State or local government agency: a copy of the authorization under which the proposal is made;
            (B) If the proponent is a public corporation: the statute or other authority under which it was organized;
            (C) If the proponent is a Federal Government agency: the title of the agency official delegated the authority to file the proposal;
            (D) If the proponent is a private corporation:
            (1) Evidence of incorporation and its current good standing;
            (2) If reasonably obtainable by the proponent, the name and address of each shareholder owning three percent or more of the shares, together with the number and percentage of any class of voting shares of the entity which such shareholder is authorized to vote;
            (3) The name and address of each affiliate of the entity;
            (4) In the case of an affiliate which is controlled by the entity, the number of shares and the percentage of any class of voting stock of the affiliate that the entity owns either directly or indirectly; or
            (5) In the case of an affiliate which controls that entity, the number of shares and the percentage of any class of voting stock of that entity owned, either directly or indirectly by the affiliate; or
            (E) If the proponent is a partnership, association, or other unincorporated entity: a certified copy of the partnership agreement or other similar document, if any, creating the entity, or a certificate of good standing under the laws of the State.
            (3) Technical and financial capability. The proponent is required to provide sufficient evidence to satisfy the authorized officer that the proponent has, or prior to commencement of construction will have, the technical and financial capability to construct, operate, maintain, and terminate the project for which an authorization is requested, and the proponent is otherwise acceptable.
            (4) Project description. Except for requests for planning permits for a major development, a proponent must provide a project description, including maps and appropriate resource information, in sufficient detail to enable the authorized officer to determine the feasibility of a proposed project or activity, any benefits to be provided to the public, the safety of the proposal, the lands to be occupied or used, the terms and conditions to be included, and the proposal's compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and orders.
            (5) Additional information. The authorized officer may require any other information and data necessary to determine feasibility of a project or activity proposed; compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and orders; compliance with requirements for associated clearances, certificates, permits, or licenses; and suitable terms and conditions to be included in the authorization. The authorized officer shall make requests for any additional information in writing.
            (e) Pre-application actions—(1) Initial screening. Upon receipt of a request for any proposed use other than for noncommercial group use, the authorized officer shall screen the proposal to ensure that the use meets the following minimum requirements applicable to all special uses:
            (i) The proposed use is consistent with the laws, regulations, orders, and policies establishing or governing National Forest System lands, with other applicable Federal law, and with applicable State and local health and sanitation laws.
            (ii) The proposed use is consistent or can be made consistent with standards and guidelines in the applicable forest land and resource management plan prepared under the National Forest Management Act and 36 CFR part 219.
            (iii) The proposed use will not pose a serious or substantial risk to public health or safety.
            (iv) The proposed use will not create an exclusive or perpetual right of use or occupancy.
            (v) The proposed use will not unreasonably conflict or interfere with administrative use by the Forest Service, other scheduled or authorized existing uses of the National Forest System, or use of adjacent non-National Forest System lands.
            (vi) The proponent does not have any delinquent debt owed to the Forest Service under terms and conditions of a prior or existing authorization, unless such debt results from a decision on an administrative appeal or from a fee review and the proponent is current with the payment schedule.
            (vii) The proposed use does not involve gambling or providing of sexually oriented commercial services, even if permitted under State law.
            (viii) The proposed use does not involve military or paramilitary training or exercises by private organizations or individuals, unless such training or exercises are federally funded.
            (ix) The proposed use does not involve disposal of solid waste or disposal of radioactive or other hazardous substances.
            (2) Results of initial screening. Any proposed use other than a noncommercial group use that does not meet all of the minimum requirements of paragraphs (e)(1)(i)-(ix) of this section shall not receive further evaluation and processing. In such event, the authorized officer shall advise the proponent that the use does not meet the minimum requirements. If the proposal was submitted orally, the authorized officer may respond orally. If the proposal was made in writing, the authorized officer shall notify the proponent in writing that the proposed use does not meet the minimum requirements and shall simultaneously return the request.
            (3) Guidance and information to proponents. For proposals for noncommercial group use as well as for those proposals that meet the minimum requirements of paragraphs (e)(1)(i)-(ix), the authorized officer, to the extent practicable, shall provide the proponent guidance and information on the following:
            (i) Possible land use conflicts as identified by review of forest land and resource management plans, landownership records, and other readily available sources;
            (ii) Proposal and application procedures and probable time requirements;
            (iii) Proponent qualifications;
            (iv) Applicable fees, charges, bonding, and/or security requirements;
            (v) Necessary associated clearances, permits, and licenses;
            (vi) Environmental and management considerations;
            (vii) Special conditions; and
            (viii) identification of on-the-ground investigations which will require temporary use permits.
            (4) Confidentiality. If requested by the proponent, the authorized officer, or other Forest Service official, to the extent reasonable and authorized by law, shall hold confidential any project and program information revealed during pre-application contacts.
            
            (5) Second-level screening of proposed uses. A proposal which passes the initial screening set forth in paragraph (e)(1) and for which the proponent has submitted information as required in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, proceeds to second-level screening and consideration. In order to complete this screening and consideration, the authorized officer may request such additional information as necessary to obtain a full description of the proposed use and its effects. An authorized officer shall reject any proposal, including a proposal for commercial group uses, if, upon further consideration, the officer determines that:
            (i) The proposed use would be inconsistent or incompatible with the purposes for which the lands are managed, or with other uses; or
            (ii) The proposed use would not be in the public interest; or
            (iii) The proponent is not qualified; or
            (iv) The proponent does not or cannot demonstrate technical or economic feasibility of the proposed use or the financial or technical capability to undertake the use and to fully comply with the terms and conditions of the authorization; or
            (v) There is no person or entity authorized to sign a special use authorization and/or there is no person or entity willing to accept responsibility for adherence to the terms and conditions of the authorization.
            (6) NEPA compliance for second-level screening process. A request for a special use authorization that does not meet the criteria established in paragraphs (e)(5)(i) through (e)(5)(v) of this section does not constitute an agency proposal as defined in 40 CFR 1508.23 and, therefore, does not require environmental analysis and documentation.
            (f) Special requirements for certain proposals—(1) Oil and gas pipeline rights-of-way. These proposals must include the citizenship of the proponent(s) and disclose the identity of its participants as follows:
            (i) Citizens of another country, the laws, customs, or regulations of which deny similar or like privileges to citizens or corporations of the United States, shall not own an appreciable interest in any oil and gas pipeline right-of-way or associated permit; and
            (ii) The authorized officer shall promptly notify the House Committee on Resources and the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources upon receipt of a proposal for a right-of-way for a pipeline 24 inches or more in diameter, and no right-of-way for that pipeline shall be granted until notice of intention to grant the right-of-way, together with the authorized officer's detailed findings as to the term and conditions the authorized officer proposes to impose, have been submitted to the committees.
            (2) Major development. Proponents of a major development may submit a request for a planning permit of up to 10 years in duration. Requests for a planning permit must include the information contained in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(3) of this section. Upon completion of a master development plan developed under a planning permit, proponents may then submit a request for a long-term authorization to construct and operate the development. At a minimum, a request for a long-term permit for a major development must include the information contained in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2)(ii) through (d)(5) of this section. Issuance of a planning permit does not prejudice approval or denial of a subsequent request for a special use permit for the development.
            (g) Application processing and response—(1) Acceptance of applications. Except for proposals for noncommercial group uses, if a request does not meet the criteria of both screening processes or is subsequently denied, the proponent must be notified with a written explanation of the rejection or denial and any written proposal returned to the proponent. If a request for a proposed use meets the criteria of both the initial and second-level screening processes as described in paragraph (e) of this section, the authorized officer shall notify the proponent that the agency is prepared to accept a written formal application for a special use authorization and shall, as appropriate or necessary, provide the proponent guidance and information of the type described in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) through (e)(3)(viii) of this section.
            
            (2) Processing applications. (i) Upon acceptance of an application for a special use authorization other than a planning permit, the authorized officer shall evaluate the proposed use for the requested site, including effects on the environment. The authorized officer may request such additional information as necessary to obtain a full description of the proposed use and its effects.
            (ii) Federal, State, and local government agencies and the public shall receive adequate notice and an opportunity to comment upon a special use proposal accepted as a formal application in accordance with Forest Service NEPA procedures.
            (iii) The authorized officer shall give due deference to the findings of another agency such as a Public Utility Commission, the Federal Regulatory Energy Commission, or the Interstate Commerce Commission in lieu of another detailed finding. If this information is already on file with the Forest Service, it need not be refiled, if reference is made to the previous filing date, place, and case number.
            (iv) Applications for noncommercial group uses must be received at least 72 hours in advance of the proposed activity. Applications for noncommercial group uses shall be processed in order of receipt, and the use of a particular area shall be allocated in order of receipt of fully executed applications, subject to any relevant limitations set forth in this section.
            (v) For applications for planning permits, including those issued for a major development as described in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, the authorized officer shall assess only the applicant's financial and technical qualifications and determine compliance with other applicable laws, regulations, and orders. Planning permits may be categorically excluded from documentation in an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement pursuant to Forest Service Handbook 1909.15 (36 CFR 200.4).
            (3) Response to applications for noncommercial group uses. (i) All applications for noncommercial group uses shall be deemed granted and an authorization shall be issued for those uses pursuant to the determination as set forth below, unless applications are denied within 48 hours of receipt. Where an application for a noncommercial group use has been granted or is deemed to have been granted and an authorization has been issued under this paragraph, an authorized officer may revoke that authorization only as provided under § 251.60(a)(1)(i).
            (ii) An authorized officer shall grant an application for a special use authorization for a noncommercial group use upon a determination that:
            (A) Authorization of the proposed activity is not prohibited by the rules at 36 CFR part 261, subpart B, or by Federal, State, or local law unrelated to the content of expressive activity;
            (B) Authorization of the proposed activity is consistent or can be made consistent with the standards and guidelines in the applicable forest land and resource management plan required under the National Forest Management Act and 36 CFR part 219;
            (C) The proposed activity does not materially impact the characteristics or functions of the environmentally sensitive resources or lands identified in Forest Service Handbook 1909.15, chapter 30;
            (D) The proposed activity will not delay, halt, or prevent administrative use of an area by the Forest Service or other scheduled or existing uses or activities on National Forest System lands, including but not limited to uses and activities authorized under parts 222, 223, 228, and 251 of this chapter;
            (E) The proposed activity does not violate State and local public health laws and regulations as applied to the proposed site. Issues addressed by State and local public health laws and regulations as applied to the proposed site include but are not limited to:
            (1) The sufficiency of sanitation facilities;
            (2) The sufficiency of waste-disposal facilities;
            (3) The availability of sufficient potable drinking water;
            (4) The risk of disease from the physical characteristics of the proposed site or natural conditions associated with the proposed site; and
            (5) The risk of contamination of the water supply;
            
            (F) The proposed activity will not pose a substantial danger to public safety. Considerations of public safety must not include concerns about possible reaction to the users' identity or beliefs from non-members of the group that is seeking an authorization and shall be limited to the following:
            (1) The potential for physical injury to other forest users from the proposed activity;
            (2) The potential for physical injury to users from the physical characteristics of the proposed site or natural conditions associated with the proposed site;
            (3) The potential for physical injury to users from scheduled or existing uses or activities on National Forest System lands; and
            (4) The adequacy of ingress and egress in case of an emergency;
            (G) The proposed activity does not involve military or paramilitary training or exercises by private organizations or individuals, unless such training or exercises are federally funded; and
            (H) A person or persons 21 years of age or older have been designated to sign and do sign a special use authorization on behalf of the applicant.
            (iii) If an authorized officer denies an application because it does not meet the criteria in paragraphs (g)(3)(ii)(A) through (g)(3)(ii)(H) of this section, the authorized officer shall notify the applicant in writing of the reasons for the denial. If an alternative time, place, or manner will allow the applicant to meet the eight evaluation criteria, an authorized officer shall offer that alternative. If an application is denied solely under paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(C) of this section and all alternatives suggested are unacceptable to the applicant, the authorized officer shall offer to have completed the requisite environmental and other analyses for the requested site. A decision to grant or deny the application for which an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement is prepared is subject to the notice and appeal procedures at 36 CFR part 215 and shall be made within 48 hours after the decision becomes final under that appeal process. A denial of an application in paragraphs (g)(3)(ii)(A) through (g)(3)(ii)(H) of this section constitutes final agency action, is not subject to administrative appeal, and is immediately subject to judicial review.
            (4) Response to all other applications. Based on evaluation of the information provided by the applicant and other relevant information such as environmental findings, the authorized officer shall decide whether to approve the proposed use, approve the proposed use with modifications, or deny the proposed use. A group of applications for similar uses having minor environmental impacts may be evaluated with one analysis and approved in one decision.
            (5) Authorization of a special use. Upon a decision to approve a special use or a group of similar special uses, the authorized officer may issue one or more special use authorizations as defined in § 251.51 of this subpart.

            § 251.55
            Nature of interest.
            (a) A holder is authorized only to occupy such land and structures and conduct such activities as is specified in the special use authorization. The holder may sublet the use and occupancy of the premises and improvements authorized only with the prior written approval of the authorized officer, but the holder shall continue to be responsible for compliance with all conditions of the special use authorization.

            (b) All rights not expressly granted are retained by the United States, including but not limited to (1) continuing rights of access to all National Forest System land (including the subsurface and air space); (2) a continuing right of physical entry to any part of the authorized facilities for inspection, monitoring, or for any other purposes or reason consistent with any right or obligation of the United States under any law or regulation; and (3) the right to require common use of the land or to authorize the use by others in any way not inconsistent with a holder's existing rights and privileges after consultation with all parties and agencies involved. When costs can be feasibly allocated and have not been amortized, a new holder may be required to compensate existing holders for an equitable proportion of the original costs or other expense associated with the common use.
            (c) Special use authorizations are subject to all outstanding valid rights.
            (d) Each special use authorization will specify the lands to be used or occupied which shall be limited to that which the authorized officer determines: (1) Will be occupied by the facilities authorized; (2) to be necessary for the construction, operation, maintenance, and full utilization of the authorized facilities or the conduct of authorized activities; and, (3) to be necessary to protect the public health and safety and the environment.
            (e) The holder will secure permission under applicable law, and pay in advance, the value as determined by the authorized officer for any mineral and vegetative materials (including timber) to be cut, removed, used, or destroyed by the holder from the authorized use area or other National Forest System land. The authorized officer may, in lieu of requiring an advance payment, require the holder to stockpile or stack the material at designated locations for later disposal by the United States.
          
          
            § 251.56
            Terms and conditions.
            (a) General. (1) Each special use authorization must contain:
            (i) Terms and conditions which will:
            (A) Carry out the purposes of applicable statutes and rules and regulations issued thereunder;
            (B) Minimize damage to scenic and esthetic values and fish and wildlife habitat and otherwise protect the environment;
            (C) Require compliance with applicable air and water quality standards established by or pursuant to applicable Federal or State law; and
            (D) Require compliance with State standards for public health and safety, environmental protection, and siting, construction, operation, and maintenance if those standards are more stringent than applicable Federal standards.
            (ii) Such terms and conditions as the authorized officer deems necessary to:
            (A) Protect Federal property and economic interests;
            (B) Manage efficiently the lands subject to the use and adjacent thereto;
            (C) Protect other lawful users of the lands adjacent to or occupied by such use;
            (D) Protect lives and property;
            (E) Protect the interests of individuals living in the general area of the use who rely on the fish, wildlife, and other biotic resources of the area for subsistence purposes;
            (F) Require siting to cause the least damage to the environment, taking into consideration feasibility and other relevant factors; and
            (G) Otherwise protect the public interest.
            
            
              Note to paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(G):
              The Department is making explicit its preexisting understanding of § 251.56(a)(1)(ii)(G) of this subpart in the context of authorizing noncommercial group uses of National Forest System lands. Section 251.56(a)(1)(ii)(G) provides that each special use authorization shall contain such terms and conditions as the authorized officer deems necessary to otherwise protect the public interest. In the context of noncommercial group uses, the Forest Service interprets the term “public interest” found in § 251.56(a)(1)(ii)(G) to refer to the three public interests identified by the Forest Service on August 30, 1995. These public interests include the protection of resources and improvements on National Forest System lands, the allocation of space among potential or existing uses and activities, and public health and safety concerns. Under this construction, § 251.56(a)(1)(ii)(G) allows the Forest Service to impose terms and conditions that are not specifically addressed in § 251.56(a)(1)(ii)(A)-(F) but only those that further these public interests. The Forest Service shall implement and enforce § 251.56(a)(1)(ii)(G) in accordance with this interpretation.
            
            
            (2) Authorizations for use of National Forest System lands may be conditioned to require State, county, or other Federal agency licenses, permits, certificates, or other approval documents, such as a Federal Communication Commission license, a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission license, a State water right, or a county building permit.
            (b) Duration and renewability—(1) Requirements. If appropriate, each special use authorization will specify its duration and renewability. The duration shall be no longer than the authorized officer determines to be necessary to accomplish the purpose of the authorization and to be reasonable in light of all circumstances concerning the use, including
            (i) Resource management direction contained in land management and other plans;
            (ii) Public benefits provided;
            (iii) Cost and life expectancy of the authorized facilities;
            (iv) Financial arrangements for the project; and
            (v) The life expectancy of associated facilities, licenses, etc. Except for special use authorizations issued under the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986, authorizations exceeding 30 years shall provide for revision of terms and conditions at specified intervals to reflect changing times and conditions.
            (2) Ski area permits. (i) For authorizations issued under the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986, the authorized officer normally shall issue a ski area authorization for 40 years, if, upon consideration of information submitted by the applicant, the authorized officer finds that the ski area development meets the following standards:
            (A) In the case of an existing permit holder, existing on-site investment is of sufficient magnitude to justify authorization for 40 years;
            (B) In the case of an existing permit holder, existing investment of capital is in ski-related facilities;
            (C) Planned investment capital is directly related to development of ski area facilities and is not for financing regular, ongoing operation and maintenance costs;
            (D) Ski facilities requiring long-term investment are, or will be, located predominately on land authorized under a permit;
            (E) The number and magnitude of planned facilities, as detailed in a Master Development Plan, clearly require long-term financing and/or operation;
            (F) The United States is not the owner of the principal facilities within the authorized ski area.
            (ii) A term of less than 40 years shall be authorized for a ski area when the applicant requests a shorter term or when, in the authorized officer's discretion:
            (A) Analysis of the information submitted by the applicant indicates that a shorter term is sufficient for financing of the ski area;
            (B) The ski area development, whether existing or proposed, does not meet the standards of paragraph (2)(i)(A) through (F) of this section; or
            (C) A 40-year authorization would be inconsistent with the approved forest land and resource management plan governing the area (36 CFR part 219).
            (c) Preconstruction approvals. Forest Service approval of location, design and plans (or standards, if appropriate) of all developments within the authorized area will be required prior to construction.
            (d) Liability. Holders shall pay the United States for all injury, loss, or damage, including fire suppression costs, in accordance with existing Federal and State laws.
            (1) Holders shall also indemnify the United States for any and all injury, loss, or damage, including fire suppression costs, the United States may suffer as a result of claims, demands, losses, or judgments caused by the holder's use or occupancy.
            (2) Holders of special use authorizations for high risk use and occupancy, such as, but not limited to, powerlines and oil and gas pipelines, shall be held liable for all injury, loss, or damage, including fire suppression costs, caused by the holder's use or occupancy, without regard to the holder's negligence, provided that maximum liability shall be specified in the special use authorization as determined by a risk assessment, prepared in accordance with established agency procedures, but shall not exceed $1,000,000 for any one occurrence. Liability for injury, loss, or damage, including fire suppression costs, in excess of the specified maximum shall be determined by the laws governing ordinary negligence of the jurisdiction in which the damage or injury occurred.
            (e) Bonding. An authorized officer may require the holder of a special use authorization for other than a noncommercial group use to furnish a bond or other security to secure all or any of the obligations imposed by the terms of the authorization or by any applicable law, regulation or order.
            
            (f) Special terms and conditions—(1) Public service enterprises. Special use permits authorizing the operation of public service enterprises shall require that the permittee charge reasonable rates and furnish such services as may be necessary in the public interest, except where such rates and services are regulated by Federal, State or municipal agencies having jurisdiction.
            (2) Common carriers. Oil and gas pipelines and related facilities authorized under section 28 of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, 41 Stat. 449, as amended (30 U.S.C. 185), shall be constructed, operated and maintained as common carriers. The owners or operators of pipelines shall accept, convey, transport, or purchase without discrimination all oil or gas delivered to the pipeline without regard to whether such oil or gas was produced on Federal or nonfederal lands. In the case of oil or gas produced from Federal lands or from the resources on the Federal lands in the vicinity of the pipeline, the Secretary may, after a full hearing with due notice thereof to interested parties and a proper finding of facts, determine the proportionate amounts to be accepted, conveyed, transported, or purchased. The common carrier provisions of this section shall not apply to any natural gas pipeline operated (i) by any person subject to regulation under the Natural Gas Act, 52 Stat. 821, as amended, (15 U.S.C. 717) or (ii) by any public utility subject to regulation by a State or municipal regulatory agency having jurisdiction to regulate the rates and charges for the sale of natural gas to consumers within the State or municipality. Where natural gas not subject to State regulatory or conservation laws governing its purchase by pipeline companies is offered for sale, each pipeline company shall purchase, without discrimination, any such natural gas produced in the vicinity of the pipeline.
            (g) Conversion of Ski Area Authorizations. (1) The Forest Service shall request that all existing permit holders convert existing authorizations for ski areas to a new authorization issued pursuant to the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act.
            (2) Any current holder of a ski area permit who wishes to convert an existing permit to one issued pursuant to the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act must submit a written request for the new authorization to the authorized officer.
            (3) With the consent of the holder, the authorized officer shall convert the authorization if:
            (i) The holder is in compliance with the existing authorization;
            (ii) All fees currently due under the existing authorization are paid in full; and
            (iii) Any proposed modifications of terms and conditions of the existing authorization included in a request for conversion meet the standards of paragraphs (2)(i) (A) through (F) of this section and the relevant requirements of this subpart.
            (4) A holder retains the right to decline a new authorization offered pursuant to this paragraph and to continue to operate under the terms of the existing permit. However, pursuant to the rules at § 251.61 of this subpart, major modifications of existing permits shall require conversion to a permit issued under the authority of the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act, unless the holder provides compelling justification for retaining the existing permit.

            § 251.57
            Rental fees.
            (a) Except as otherwise provided in this part or when specifically authorized by the Secretary of Agriculture, special use authorizations shall require the payment in advance of an annual rental fee as determined by the authorized officer.
            (1) The fee shall be based on the fair market value of the rights and privileges authorized, as determined by appraisal or other sound business management principles.

            (2) Where annual fees of one hundred dollars ($100) or less are assessed, the authorized officer may require either annual payment or a payment covering more than one year at a time. If the annual fee is greater than one hundred dollars ($100), holders who are private individuals (that is, acting in an individual capacity), as opposed to those who are commercial, other corporate, or business or government entities, may, at their option, elect to make either annual payments or payments covering more than one year.
            (3) A base cabin user fee for a recreation residence use shall be 5 percent of the market value of the recreation residence lot, established by an appraisal conducted in accordance with the Act of October 11, 2000 (16 U.S.C. 6201-13).
            (b) All or part of the fee may be waived by the authorized officer, when equitable and in the public interest, for the use and occupancy of National Forest System land in the following circumstances:
            (1) The holder is a State or local government or any agency or instrumentality thereof, excluding municipal utilities and cooperatives whose principal source of revenue from the authorized use is customer charges; or
            (2) The holder is a nonprofit association or nonprofit corporation, which is not controlled or owned by profit-making corporations or business enterprises, and which is engaged in public or semi-public activity to further public health, safety, or welfare, except that free use will not be authorized when funds derived by the holder through the authorization are used to increase the value of the authorized improvements owned by the holder, or are used to support other activities of the holder; or
            (3) The holder provides without charge, or at reduced charge, a valuable benefit to the public or to the programs of the Secretary; or
            (4) When the rental fee is included in the fees for an authorized use or occupancy for which the United States is already receiving compensation; or
            (5) When a right-of-way is authorized in reciprocation for a right-of-way conveyed to the United States; or
            (6) For rights-of-way involving cost-share roads or reciprocal right-of-way agreements.
            (c) No rental fee will be charged when the holder is the Federal government.
            (d) No fee shall be charged when the authorization is for a noncommercial group use as defined in § 251.51 of this subpart.
            (e) Special use authorizations issued under § 251.53(g) of this part may require as all or a part of the consideration the reconditioning and maintenance of the government-owned or controlled structures, improvements, and land to a satisfactory standard. The total consideration will be based upon the fair market value of the rights and privileges authorized.
            (f) Special use authorizations involving government-owned or controlled buildings, structures, or other improvements which require caretakers' services, or the furnishing of special services such as water, electric lights, and clean-up, may require the payment of an additional fee or charge to cover the cost of such services.
            (g) Except where specified otherwise by terms of a special use authorization, rental fees may be initiated or adjusted whenever necessary: (1) As a result of fee review, reappraisal; or (2) upon a change in the holder's qualifications under paragraph (b) of this section; and (3) notice is given prior to initiating or adjusting rental fees.
            (h) Each ski area authorization issued under the authority of the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act shall include a clause that provides that the Forest Service may adjust and calculate future rental fees to reflect Agency revisions to the existing system for determining fees based on fair market value or to comply with any new fee system for determining fees based on fair market value that may be adopted after issuance of the authorization.
            (i) Each permit or term permit for a recreation residence use shall include a clause stating that the Forest Service shall recalculate the base cabin user fee at least every 10 years and shall use an appraisal to recalculate that fee as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
            [45 FR 38327, June 6, 1980, as amended at 51 FR 16683, May 6, 1986; 54 FR 22594, May 25, 1989; 60 FR 45294, Aug. 30, 1995; 63 FR 65967, Nov. 30, 1998; 71 FR 16621, Apr. 3, 2006]
          
          
            § 251.58
            Cost recovery.
            (a) Assessment of fees to recover agency processing and monitoring costs. The Forest Service shall assess fees to recover the agency's processing costs for special use applications and monitoring costs for special use authorizations. Applicants and holders shall submit sufficient information for the authorized officer to estimate the number of hours required to process their applications or monitor their authorizations. Cost recovery fees are separate from any fees charged for the use and occupancy of National Forest System lands.
            (b) Special use applications and authorizations subject to cost recovery requirements. Except as exempted in paragraphs (g)(1) through (g)(4) of this section, the cost recovery requirements of this section apply in the following situations to the processing of special use applications and monitoring of special use authorizations issued pursuant to this subpart:
            (1) Applications for use and occupancy that require a new special use authorization. Fees for processing an application for a new special use authorization shall apply to any application formally accepted by the agency on or after March 23, 2006 and to any application formally accepted by the agency before March 23, 2006, which the agency has not commenced processing. Proposals accepted as applications which the agency has commenced processing prior to March 23, 2006 shall not be subject to processing fees. The cost recovery provisions of this section shall not apply to or supersede written agreements providing for recovery of processing costs executed by the agency and applicants prior to March 23, 2006.
            (2) Changes to existing authorizations. Processing fees apply to proposals that require an application to amend or formally approve specific activities or facilities as identified in an existing authorization, operating plan, or master development plan. Processing fees also apply to agency actions to amend a special use authorization.
            (3) Agency actions to issue a special use authorization and applications for issuance of a new special use authorization due to termination of an existing authorization, including termination caused by expiration, a change in ownership or control of the authorized facilities, or a change in ownership or control of the holder of the authorization. Upon termination of an existing authorization, a holder shall be subject to a processing fee for issuance of a new authorization, even if the holder's existing authorization does not require submission of an application for a new authorization.
            (4) Monitoring of authorizations issued or amended on or after March 23, 2006.
            (c) Processing fee requirements. A processing fee is required for each application for or agency action to issue a special use authorization as identified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section. Processing fees do not include costs incurred by the applicant in providing information, data, and documentation necessary for the authorized officer to make a decision on the proposed use or occupancy pursuant to the provisions at § 251.54.
            (1) Basis for processing fees. The processing fee categories 1 through 6 set out in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (c)(2)(vi) of this section are based upon the costs that the Forest Service incurs in reviewing the application, conducting environmental analyses of the effects of the proposed use, reviewing any applicant-generated environmental documents and studies, conducting site visits, evaluating an applicant's technical and financial qualifications, making a decision on whether to issue the authorization, and preparing documentation of analyses, decisions, and authorizations for each application. The processing fee for an application shall be based only on costs necessary for processing that application. “Necessary for” means that but for the application, the costs would not have been incurred and that the costs cover only those activities without which the application cannot be processed. The processing fee shall not include costs for studies for programmatic planning or analysis or other agency management objectives, unless they are necessary for the application being processed. For example, the processing fee shall not include costs for capacity studies, use allocation decisions, corridor or communications site planning, and biological studies that address species diversity, unless they are necessary for the application. Proportional costs for analyses, such as capacity studies, that are necessary for an application may be included in the processing fee for that application. The costs incurred for processing an application, and thus the processing fee, depend on the complexity of the project; the amount of information that is necessary for the authorized officer's decision in response to the proposed use and occupancy; and the degree to which the applicant can provide this information to the agency. Processing work conducted by the applicant or a third party contracted by the applicant minimizes the costs the Forest Service will incur to process the application, and thus reduces the processing fee. The total processing time is the total time estimated for all Forest Service personnel involved in processing an application and is estimated case by case to determine the fee category.
            (i) Processing fee determinations. The applicable fee rate for processing applications in minor categories 1 through 4 (paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (c)(2)(iv) of this section) shall be assessed from a schedule. The processing fee for applications in category 5, which may be either minor or major, shall be established in the master agreement (paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section). For major category 5 (paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section) and category 6 (paragraph (c)(2)(vi) of this section) cases, the authorized officer shall estimate the agency's full actual processing costs. The estimated processing costs for category 5 and category 6 cases shall be reconciled as provided in paragraphs (c)(5)(ii) and (iii) and (c)(6)(ii) and (iii) of this section.
            (ii) Reduction in processing fees for certain category 6 applications. For category 6 applications submitted under authorities other than the Mineral Leasing Act, the applicant:
            (A) May request a reduction of the processing fee based upon the applicant's written analysis of actual costs, the monetary value of the rights and privileges sought, that portion of the costs incurred for the benefit of the general public interest, the public service provided, the efficiency of the agency processing involved, and other factors relevant to determining the reasonableness of the costs. The agency will determine whether the estimate of full actual costs should be reduced based upon this analysis and will notify the applicant in writing of this determination; or
            (B) May agree in writing to waive payment of reasonable costs and pay the actual costs incurred in processing the application.
            (2) Processing fee categories. No fee is charged for applications taking 1 hour or less for the Forest Service to process. Applications requiring more than 1 hour for the agency to process are covered by the fee categories 1 through 6 set out in the following paragraphs i through vi.
            (i) Category 1: Minimal Impact: More than 1 hour and up to and including 8 hours. The total estimated time in this minor category is more than 1 hour and up to and including 8 hours for Forest Service personnel to process an application.
            (ii) Category 2: More than 8 and up to and including 24 hours. The total estimated time in this minor category is more than 8 and up to and including 24 hours for Forest Service personnel to process an application.
            (iii) Category 3: More than 24 and up to and including 36 hours. The total estimated time in this minor category is more than 24 and up to and including 36 hours for Forest Service personnel to process an application.
            (iv) Category 4: More than 36 and up to and including 50 hours. The total estimated time in this minor category is more than 36 and up to and including 50 hours for Forest Service personnel to process an application.
            (v) Category 5: Master agreements. The Forest Service and the applicant may enter into master agreements for the agency to recover processing costs associated with a particular application, a group of applications, or similar applications for a specified geographic area. This category is minor if 50 hours or less are needed for Forest Service personnel to process an application and major if more than 50 hours are needed. In signing a master agreement for a major category application submitted under authorities other than the Mineral Leasing Act, an applicant waives the right to request a reduction of the processing fee based upon the reasonableness factors enumerated in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. A master agreement shall at a minimum include:
            (A) The fee category or estimated processing costs;
            (B) A description of the method for periodic billing, payment, and auditing;
            (C) A description of the geographic area covered by the agreement;
            (D) A work plan and provisions for updating the work plan;
            (E) Provisions for reconciling differences between estimated and final processing costs; and
            (F) Provisions for terminating the agreement.
            (vi) Category 6: More than 50 hours. In this major category more than 50 hours are needed for Forest Service personnel to process an application. The authorized officer shall determine the issues to be addressed and shall develop preliminary work and financial plans for estimating recoverable costs.
            (3) Multiple applications other than those covered by master agreements (category 5). (i) Unsolicited applications where there is no competitive interest. Processing costs that are incurred in processing more than one of these applications (such as the cost of environmental analysis or printing an environmental impact statement that relates to all of the applications) must be paid in equal shares or on a prorated basis, as deemed appropriate by the authorized officer, by each applicant, including applicants for recreation special uses that are otherwise exempt under paragraph (g)(3) of this section when the Forest Service requires more than 50 hours in the aggregate to process the applications submitted in response to the prospectus.
            (ii) Unsolicited proposals where competitive interest exists. When there is one or more unsolicited proposals and the authorized officer determines that competitive interest exists, the agency shall issue a prospectus. All proposals accepted pursuant to that solicitation shall be processed as applications. The applicants are responsible for the costs of environmental analyses that are necessary for their applications and that are conducted prior to issuance of the prospectus. Processing fees for these cases shall be determined pursuant to the procedures for establishing a category 6 processing fee and shall include costs such as those incurred in printing and mailing the prospectus; having parties other than the Forest Service review and evaluate applications; establishing a case file; recording data; conducting financial reviews; and, for selected applicants, any additional environmental analysis required in connection with their applications. Processing fees shall be paid in equal shares or on a prorated basis, as deemed appropriate by the authorized officer, by all parties who submitted proposals that were processed as applications pursuant to the solicitation, including applicants for recreation special uses that are otherwise exempt under paragraph (g)(3) of this section when the Forest Service requires more than 50 hours in the aggregate to process the applications submitted in response to the prospectus.
            (iii) Solicited applications. When the Forest Service solicits applications through the issuance of a prospectus on its own initiative, rather than in response to an unsolicited proposal or proposals, the agency is responsible for the cost of environmental analyses conducted prior to issuance of the prospectus. All proposals accepted pursuant to that solicitation shall be processed as applications. Processing fees for these cases shall be determined pursuant to the procedures for establishing a category 6 processing fee and shall include costs such as those incurred in printing and mailing the prospectus; having parties other than the Forest Service review and evaluate applications; establishing a case file; recording data; conducting financial reviews; and, for selected applicants, any additional environmental analysis required in connection with their applications. Processing fees shall be paid in equal shares or on a prorated basis, as deemed appropriate by the authorized officer, by all parties who submitted proposals that were processed as applications pursuant to the solicitation, including applicants for recreation special uses that are otherwise exempt under paragraph (g)(3) of this section when the Forest Service requires more than 50 hours in the aggregate to process the applications submitted in response to the prospectus.
            
            (4) Billing and revision of processing fees. (i) Billing. When the Forest Service accepts a special use application, the authorized officer shall provide written notice to the applicant that the application has been formally accepted. The authorized officer shall not bill the applicant a processing fee until the agency is prepared to process the application.
            (ii) Revision of processing fees. Minor category processing fees shall not be reclassified into a higher minor category once the processing fee category has been determined. However, if the authorized officer discovers previously undisclosed information that necessitates changing a minor category processing fee to a major category processing fee, the authorized officer shall notify the applicant or holder of the conditions prompting a change in the processing fee category in writing before continuing with processing the application. The applicant or holder may accept the revised processing fee category and pay the difference between the previous and revised processing categories; withdraw the application; revise the project to lower the processing costs; or request review of the disputed fee as provided in paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(4) of this section.
            (5) Payment of processing fees. (i) Payment of a processing fee shall be due within 30 days of issuance of a bill for the fee, pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section. The processing fee must be paid before the Forest Service can initiate or, in the case of a revised fee, continue with processing an application. Payment of the processing fee by the applicant does not obligate the Forest Service to authorize the applicant's proposed use and occupancy.
            (ii) For category 5 cases, when the estimated processing costs are lower than the final processing costs for applications covered by a master agreement, the applicant shall pay the difference between the estimated and final processing costs.
            (iii) For category 6 cases, when the estimated processing fee is lower than the full actual costs of processing an application submitted under the Mineral Leasing Act, or lower than the full reasonable costs (when the applicant has not waived payment of reasonable costs) of processing an application submitted under other authorities, the applicant shall pay the difference between the estimated and full actual or reasonable processing costs.
            (6) Refunds of processing fees. (i) Processing fees in minor categories 1 through 4 are nonrefundable and shall not be reconciled.
            (ii) For category 5 cases, if payment of the processing fee exceeds the agency's final processing costs for the applications covered by a master agreement, the authorized officer either shall refund the excess payment to the applicant or, at the applicant's request, shall credit it towards monitoring fees due.
            (iii) For category 6 cases, if payment of the processing fee exceeds the full actual costs of processing an application submitted under the Mineral Leasing Act, or the full reasonable costs (when the applicant has not waived payment of reasonable costs) of processing an application submitted under other authorities, the authorized officer either shall refund the excess payment to the applicant or, at the applicant's request, shall credit it towards monitoring fees due.
            (iv) For major category 5 and category 6 applications, an applicant whose application is denied or withdrawn in writing is responsible for costs incurred by the Forest Service in processing the application up to and including the date the agency denies the application or receives written notice of the applicant's withdrawal. When an applicant withdraws a major category 5 or category 6 application, the applicant also is responsible for any costs subsequently incurred by the Forest Service in terminating consideration of the application.
            (7) Customer service standards. The Forest Service shall endeavor to make a decision on an application that falls into minor processing category 1, 2, 3, or 4, and that is subject to a categorical exclusion pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act, within 60 calendar days from the date of receipt of the processing fee. If the application cannot be processed within the 60-day period, then prior to the 30th calendar day of the 60-day period, the authorized officer shall notify the applicant in writing of the reason why the application cannot be processed within the 60-day period and shall provide the applicant with a projected date when the agency plans to complete processing the application. For all other applications, including all applications that require an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement, the authorized officer shall, within 60 calendar days of acceptance of the application, notify the applicant in writing of the anticipated steps that will be needed to process the application. These customer service standards do not apply to applications that are subject to a waiver of or exempt from cost recovery fees under §§ 251.58(f) or (g).
            (d) Monitoring fee requirements. The monitoring fee for an authorization shall be assessed independently of any fee charged for processing the application for that authorization pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section. Payment of the monitoring fee is due upon issuance of the authorization.
            (1) Basis for monitoring fees. Monitoring is defined at § 251.51. For monitoring fees in minor categories 1 through 4, authorization holders are assessed fees based upon the estimated time needed for Forest Service monitoring to ensure compliance with the authorization during the construction or reconstruction of temporary or permanent facilities and rehabilitation of the construction or reconstruction site. Major category 5 and category 6 monitoring fees shall be based upon the agency's estimated costs to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the authorization during all phases of its term, including but not limited to monitoring to ensure compliance with the authorization during the construction or reconstruction of temporary or permanent facilities and rehabilitation of the construction or reconstruction site. Monitoring for all categories does not include billings, maintenance of case files, annual performance evaluations, or scheduled inspections to determine compliance generally with the terms and conditions of an authorization.
            (i) Monitoring fee determinations. The applicable fee rate for monitoring compliance with authorizations in minor categories 1 through 4 (paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (d)(2)(iv) of this section) shall be assessed from a schedule. The monitoring fee for authorizations in category 5, which may be minor or major, shall be established in the master agreement (paragraph (d)(2)(v) of this section). For major category 5 (paragraph (d)(2)(v) of this section) and category 6 (paragraph (d)(2)(vi) of this section) cases, the authorized officer shall estimate the agency's full actual monitoring costs. The estimated monitoring costs for category 5 and category 6 cases shall be reconciled as provided in paragraphs (d)(3)(ii) and (iii) and (d)(4)(ii) and (iii) of this section.
            (ii) Reductions in monitoring fees for certain category 6 authorizations. For category 6 authorizations issued under authorities other than the Mineral Leasing Act, the holder:
            (A) May request a reduction of the monitoring fee based upon the holder's written analysis of actual costs, the monetary value of the rights or privileges granted, that portion of the costs incurred for the benefit of the general public interest, the public service provided, the efficiency of the agency monitoring involved, and other factors relevant to determining the reasonableness of the costs. The agency will determine whether the estimate of full actual costs should be reduced based upon this analysis and will notify the holder in writing of this determination; or
            (B) May agree in writing to waive payment of reasonable costs and pay the actual costs incurred in monitoring the authorization.
            (2) Monitoring fee categories. No monitoring fee is charged for authorizations requiring 1 hour or less for the Forest Service to monitor. Authorizations requiring more than1 hour for the agency to monitor are covered by fee categories 1 through 6 set out in the following paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (vi) of this section.
            (i) Category 1: Minimal Impact: More than 1 hour and up to and including 8 hours. This minor category requires more than1 hour and up to and including 8 hours for Forest Service personnel to monitor compliance with a special use authorization during construction or reconstruction of temporary or permanent facilities and rehabilitation of the construction or reconstruction site.
            (ii) Category 2: More than 8 and up to and including 24 hours. This minor category requires more than 8 and up to and including 24 hours for Forest Service personnel to monitor compliance with a special use authorization during construction or reconstruction of temporary or permanent facilities and rehabilitation of the construction or reconstruction site.
            (iii) Category 3: More than 24 and up to and including 36 hours. This minor category requires more than 24 and up to and including 36 hours for Forest Service personnel to monitor compliance with a special use authorization during construction or reconstruction of temporary or permanent facilities and rehabilitation of the construction or reconstruction site.
            (iv) Category 4: More than 36 and up to and including 50 hours. This minor category requires more than 36 and up to and including 50 hours for Forest Service personnel to monitor compliance with a special use authorization during construction or reconstruction of temporary or permanent facilities and rehabilitation of the construction or reconstruction site.
            (v) Category 5: Master agreements. The Forest Service and the holder of an authorization may enter into a master agreement for the agency to recover monitoring costs associated with a particular authorization or by a group of authorizations for a specified geographic area. This category is minor if 50 hours or less are needed for Forest Service personnel to monitor compliance with an authorization and major if more than 50 hours are needed. In signing a master agreement for a major category authorization issued under authorities other than the Mineral Leasing Act, a holder waives the right to request a reduction of the monitoring fee based upon the reasonableness factors enumerated in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. A master agreement shall at a minimum include:
            (A) The fee category or estimated monitoring costs;
            (B) A description of the method for periodic billing, payment, and auditing of monitoring fees;
            (C) A description of the geographic area covered by the agreement;
            (D) A monitoring work plan and provisions for updating the work plan;
            (E) Provisions for reconciling differences between estimated and final monitoring costs; and
            (F) Provisions for terminating the agreement.
            (vi) Category 6: More than 50 hours. This major category requires more than 50 hours for Forest Service personnel to monitor compliance with the terms and conditions of the authorization during all phases of its term, including, but not limited, to monitoring compliance with the authorization during the construction or reconstruction of temporary or permanent facilities and rehabilitation of the construction or reconstruction site.
            (3) Billing and payment of monitoring fees. (i) The authorized officer shall estimate the monitoring costs and shall notify the holder of the required fee. Monitoring fees in minor categories 1 through 4 must be paid in full before or at the same time the authorization is issued. For authorizations in major category 5 and category 6, the estimated monitoring fees must be paid in full before or at the same time the authorization is issued, unless the authorized officer and the applicant or holder agree in writing to periodic payments.
            (ii) For category 5 cases, when the estimated monitoring costs are lower than the final monitoring costs for authorizations covered by a master agreement, the holder shall pay the difference between the estimated and final monitoring costs.

            (iii) For category 6 cases, when the estimated monitoring fee is lower than the full actual costs of monitoring an authorization issued under the Mineral Leasing Act, or lower than the full reasonable costs (when the holder has not waived payment of reasonable costs) of monitoring an authorization issued under other authorities, the holder shall pay the difference in the next periodic payment or the authorized officer shall bill the holder for the difference between the estimated and full actual or reasonable monitoring costs. Payment shall be due within 30 days of receipt of the bill.
            (4) Refunds of monitoring fees. (i) Monitoring fees in minor categories 1 through 4 are nonrefundable and shall not be reconciled.
            (ii) For category 5 cases, if payment of the monitoring fee exceeds the agency's final monitoring costs for the authorizations covered by a master agreement, the authorized officer shall either adjust the next periodic payment to reflect the overpayment or refund the excess payment to the holder.
            (iii) For category 6 cases, if payment of the monitoring fee exceeds the full actual costs of monitoring an authorization issued under the Mineral Leasing Act, or the full reasonable costs (when the holder has not waived payment of reasonable costs) of monitoring an authorization issued under other authorities, the authorized officer shall either adjust the next periodic payment to reflect the overpayment or refund the excess payment to the holder.
            (e) Applicant and holder disputes concerning processing or monitoring fee assessments; requests for changes in fee categories or estimated costs. (1) If an applicant or holder disagrees with the processing or monitoring fee category assigned by the authorized officer for a minor category or, in the case of a major processing or monitoring category, with the estimated dollar amount of the processing or monitoring costs, the applicant or holder may submit a written request before the disputed fee is due for substitution of an alternative fee category or alternative estimated costs to the immediate supervisor of the authorized officer who determined the fee category or estimated costs. The applicant or holder must provide documentation that supports the alternative fee category or estimated costs.
            (2) In the case of a disputed processing fee:
            (i) If the applicant pays the full disputed processing fee, the authorized officer shall continue to process the application during the supervisory officer's review of the disputed fee, unless the applicant requests that the processing cease.
            (ii) If the applicant fails to pay the full disputed processing fee, the authorized officer shall suspend further processing of the application pending the supervisory officer's determination of an appropriate processing fee and the applicant's payment of that fee.
            (3) In the case of a disputed monitoring fee:
            (i) If the applicant or holder pays the full disputed monitoring fee, the authorized officer shall issue the authorization or allow the use and occupancy to continue during the supervisory officer's review of the disputed fee, unless the applicant or holder elects not to exercise the authorized use and occupancy of National Forest System lands during the review period.
            (ii) If the applicant or holder fails to pay the full disputed monitoring fee, the authorized officer shall not issue the applicant a new authorization or shall suspend the holder's existing authorization in whole or in part pending the supervisory officer's determination of an appropriate monitoring fee and the applicant's or holder's payment of that fee.
            (4) The authorized officer's immediate supervisor shall render a decision on a disputed processing or monitoring fee within 30 calendar days of receipt of the written request from the applicant or holder. The supervisory officer's decision is the final level of administrative review. The dispute shall be decided in favor of the applicant or holder if the supervisory officer does not respond to the written request within 30 days of receipt.
            (f) Waivers of processing and monitoring fees. (1) All or part of a processing or monitoring fee may be waived, at the sole discretion of the authorized officer, when one or more of the following criteria are met:
            (i) The applicant or holder is a local, State, or Federal governmental entity that does not or would not charge processing or monitoring fees for comparable services the applicant or holder provides or would provide to the Forest Service;

            (ii) A major portion of the processing costs results from issues not related to the project being proposed;
            
            (iii) The application is for a project intended to prevent or mitigate damage to real property, or to mitigate hazards or dangers to public health and safety resulting from an act of God, an act of war, or negligence of the United States;
            (iv) The application is for a new authorization to relocate facilities or activities to comply with public health and safety or environmental laws and regulations that were not in effect at the time the authorization was issued;
            (v) The application is for a new authorization to relocate facilities or activities because the land is needed by a Federal agency or for a Federally funded project for an alternative public purpose; or
            (vi) The proposed facility, project, or use will provide, without user or customer charges, a valuable benefit to the general public or to the programs of the Secretary of Agriculture.
            (2) An applicant's or holder's request for a full or partial waiver of a processing or monitoring fee must be in writing and must include an analysis that demonstrates how one or more of the criteria in paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (f)(1)(vi) of this section apply.
            (g) Exemptions from processing or monitoring fees. No processing or monitoring fees shall be charged when the application or authorization is for a:
            (1) Noncommercial group use as defined in § 251.51, or when the application or authorization is to exempt a noncommercial activity from a closure order, except for an application or authorization for access to non-Federal lands within the boundaries of the National Forest System granted pursuant to section 1323(a) of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. 3210(a)).
            (2) Water systems authorized by section 501(c) of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1761(c)).

            (3) A use or activity conducted by a Federal agency that is not authorized under Title V of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1761-1771); the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 (30 U.S.C. 185); the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 470h-2); or the Act of May 26, 2000 (16 U.S.C. 460l-6d).
            (4) Recreation special use as defined in the Forest Service's directive system and requires 50 hours or less for Forest Service personnel to process, except for situations involving multiple recreation special use applications provided for in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. No monitoring fees shall be charged for a recreation special use authorization that requires 50 hours or less for Forest Service personnel to monitor.
            (h) Appeal of decisions. (1) A decision by the authorized officer to assess a processing or monitoring fee or to determine the fee category or estimated costs is not subject to administrative appeal.
            (2) A decision by an authorized officer's immediate supervisor in response to a request for substitution of an alternative fee category or alternative estimated costs likewise is not subject to administrative appeal.
            (i) Processing and monitoring fee schedules. (1) The Forest Service shall maintain schedules for processing and monitoring fees in its directive system (36 CFR 200.4). The rates in the schedules shall be updated annually by using the annual rate of change, second quarter to second quarter, in the Implicit Price Deflator-Gross Domestic Product (IPD-GDP) index. The Forest Service shall round the changes in the rates either up or down to the nearest dollar.
            (2) Within 5 years of the effective date of this rule, March 23, 2006, the Forest Service shall review these rates:
            (i) To determine whether they are commensurate with the actual costs incurred by the agency in conducting the processing and monitoring activities covered by this rule and
            (ii) To assess consistency with processing and monitoring fee schedules established by the United States Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management.

            Transfer of authorized improvements.

            If the holder, through death, voluntary sale, transfer, or through enforcement of a valid legal proceeding or operation of law, ceases to be the owner of the authorized improvements, the authorization terminates upon change of ownership. Except for easements issued under authorities other than § 251.53(e) and leases and easements under § 251.53(l) of this subpart, the new owner of the authorized improvements must apply for and receive a new special use authorization. The new owner must meet requirements under applicable regulations of this subpart and agree to comply with the terms and conditions of the authorization and any new terms and conditions warranted by existing or prospective circumstances.

            § 251.60
            Termination, revocation, and suspension.
            (a) Grounds for termination, revocation, and suspension—(1) Noncommercial group uses—(i) Revocation or suspension. An authorized officer may revoke or suspend a special use authorization for a noncommercial group use only under one of the following circumstances:
            (A) Under the criteria for which an application for a special use authorization may be denied under § 251.54(g)(3)(ii);
            (B) For noncompliance with applicable statutes or regulations or the terms and conditions of the authorization;
            (C) For failure of the holder to exercise the rights or privileges granted; or
            (D) With the consent of the holder.
            (ii) Judicial review. Revocation or suspension of a special use authorization under this paragraph constitutes final agency action, is not subject to administrative appeal, and is immediately subject to judicial review.
            (iii) Termination. A special use authorization for a noncommercial group use terminates when it expires by its own terms. Termination of a special use authorization under this paragraph does not involve agency action and is not subject to administrative or judicial review.
            (2) All other special uses—(i) Revocation or suspension. An authorized officer may revoke or suspend a special use authorization for all other special uses, except a permit or an easement issued pursuant to § 251.53(e) or an easement issued under § 251.53(l) of this subpart:
            (A) For noncompliance with applicable statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the authorization;
            (B) For failure of the holder to exercise the rights or privileges granted;
            (C) With the consent of the holder; or
            (D) At the discretion of the authorized officer for specific and compelling reasons in the public interest.
            (ii) Administrative review. Except for revocation or suspension of an easement issued pursuant to § 251.53(e) or § 251.53(l) of this subpart, revocation or suspension of a special use authorization under this paragraph is subject to appeal pursuant to 36 CFR part 214.
            (iii) Termination. For all special uses except noncommercial group uses, a special use authorization terminates when, by its terms, a fixed or agreed-upon condition, event, or time occurs. Termination of a special use authorization under this paragraph does not involve agency action and is not subject to administrative or judicial review.
            (b) For purposes of this section, the authorized officer is that person who issues the authorization or that officer's successor.
            (c) A right-of-way authorization granted to another Federal agency will be limited, suspended, revoked, or terminated only with that agency's concurrence.
            (d) A right-of-way authorization serving another Federal agency will be limited, suspended, revoked, or terminated only after advance notice to, and consultation with, that agency.
            (e) Except when immediate suspension pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section is indicated, the authorized officer shall give the holder written notice of the grounds for suspension or revocation under paragraph (a) of this section and reasonable time to cure any noncompliance, prior to suspension or revocation pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.

            (f) Immediate suspension of a special use authorization, in whole or in part, may be required when the authorized officer deems it necessary to protect the public health or safety or the environment. In any such case, within 48 hours of a request of the holder, the superior of the authorized officer shall arrange for an on-site review of the adverse conditions with the holder. Following this review, the superior officer shall take prompt action to affirm, modify, or cancel the suspension.
            
            (g) The authorized officer may suspend or revoke permits or easements issued under § 251.53(e) or easements issued under § 251.53(l) of this subpart under the Rules of Practice Governing Formal Adjudicatory Administrative Proceedings instituted by the Secretary under 7 CFR 1.130 through 1.151.
            (h)(1) The Chief may revoke any easement granted under the provisions of the Act of October 13, 1964, 78 Stat. 1089, 16 U.S.C. 534:
            (i) By consent of the owner of the easement;
            (ii) By condemnation; or
            (iii) Upon abandonment after a 5-year period of nonuse by the owner of the easement.
            (2) Before any such easement is revoked upon abandonment, the owner of the easement shall be given notice and, upon the owner's request made within 60 days after receipt of the notice, shall be given an appeal in accordance with the provisions of 36 CFR part 214.
            (i) Upon revocation or termination of a special use authorization, the holder must remove within a reasonable time the structures and improvements and shall restore the site to a condition satisfactory to the authorized officer, unless the requirement to remove structures or improvements is otherwise waived in writing or in the authorization. If the holder fails to remove the structures or improvements within a reasonable period, as determined by the authorized officer, they shall become the property of the United States, but holder shall remain liable for the costs of removal and site restoration.

In approving or denying new, changed, or additional uses or area, the authorized officer shall consider, at a minimum, the findings or recommendations of other affected agencies and whether to revise the terms and conditions of the existing authorization or issue a new authorization. Once approved, any new, changed, or additional uses or area must be reflected in the existing or a new authorization.
            (b) A holder may be required to furnish as-built plans, maps, or surveys upon completion of construction.

The authorization must be signed by the applicant and returned to the authorized officer within 60 days of its receipt by the applicant, unless extended by the authorized officer. Refusal of an applicant to sign and accept a special use authorization within the time allowed, and before its final approval and signature by an authorized officer, shall terminate an application and constitute denial of the requested use and occupancy.

            Reciprocity.
            If it is determined that a right-of-way shall be needed by the United States across nonfederal lands directly or indirectly owned or controlled by an applicant for a right-of-way across Federal lands, the authorized officer may condition a special use authorization to require the holder to grant the United States the needed right-of-way.
          
          
            § 251.64
            Renewals.

            (a) When a special use authorization provides for renewal, the authorized officer shall renew it where such renewal is authorized by law, if the project or facility is still being used for the purpose(s) previously authorized and is being operated and maintained in accordance with all the provisions of the authorization. In making such renewal, the authorized officer may modify the terms, conditions, and special stipulations to reflect any new requirements imposed by current Federal and State land use plans, laws, regulations or other management decisions. Special uses may be reauthorized upon expiration so long as such use remains consistent with the decision that approved the expiring special use or group of uses. If significant new information or circumstances have developed, appropriate environmental analysis must accompany the decision to reauthorize the special use.
            (b) When a special use authorization does not provide for renewal, it is discretionary with the authorized officer, upon request from the holder and prior to its expiration, whether or not the authorization shall be renewed. A renewal pursuant to this section shall comply with the same provisions contained in paragraph (a) of this section.

            § 251.110
            Scope and application.
            (a) The regulations in this subpart set forth the procedures by which landowners may apply for access across National Forest System lands and the terms and conditions that govern any special use or other authorization that is issued by the Forest Service to permit such access.
            (b) These regulations apply to access across all National Forest System lands, including Congressionally designated areas, and supplement the regulations in subpart B of this part, and in parts 212 and 293 of this chapter. The regulations of this subpart do not affect rights-of-way established under authority of R.S. 2477 (43 U.S.C. 932); rights-of-way transferred to States under 23 U.S.C. 317; access rights outstanding in third parties at the time the United States acquired the land; or the rights reserved in conveyances to the United States and in other easements granted by an authorized officer of the Forest Service. Except for the aforementioned rights-of-way, currently valid special-use authorizations will become subject to the rules of this subpart upon expiration, termination, reversion, modification, or reauthorization.
            (c) Subject to the terms and conditions contained in this part and in parts 212 and 293 of this chapter, as appropriate, landowners shall be authorized such access as the authorized officer deems to be adequate to secure them the reasonable use and enjoyment of their land.
            (d) ln those cases where a landowner's ingress or egress across National Forest System lands would require surface disturbance or would require the use of Government-owned roads, trails, or transportation facilities not authorized for general public use, the landowner must apply for and receive a special-use or road-use authorization documenting the occupancy and use authorized on National Forest System lands or facilities and identifying the landowner's rights, privileges, responsibilities, and obligations.
            (e) Where ingress and egress will require the use of existing Government-owned roads, trails, or other transportation facilities which are open and available for general public use, use by the landowner shall be in accordance with the provisions of part 212 of this chapter.

            (f) The rules of this subpart do not apply to access within conservation system units in Alaska which are subject to title XI of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. 3101), except for access to inholdings authorized by section 1110(b) of that Act.
            (g) Where there is existing access or a right of access to a property over non-National Forest land or over public roads that is adequate or that can be made adequate, there is no obligation to grant additional access through National Forest System lands.
          
          
            § 251.111
            Definitions.
            In addition to the definitions in subpart B of this part, the following terms apply to this subpart:
            
              Access means the ability of landowners to have ingress and egress to their lands. It does not include rights-of-way for power lines or other utilities.
            
              Adequate access means a route and method of access to non-Federal land that provides for reasonable use and enjoyment of the non-Federal land consistent with similarly situated non-Federal land and that minimizes damage or disturbance to National Forest System lands and resources.
            
              Congressionally designated area means lands which are within the boundaries of a component of the National Wilderness Preservation System, National Wild and Scenic River System, National Trails System, and also National Monuments, Recreation, and Scenic Areas within the National Forest System, and similar areas designated by Federal statute.
            
              Landowner(s) means the owner(s) of non-Federal land or interests in land within the boundaries of the National Forest System.
          
          
            § 251.112
            Application requirements.
            (a) A landowner shall apply for access across National Forest System lands in accordance with the application requirements of § 251.54 of this part. Such application shall specifically include a statement of the intended mode of access to, and uses of, the non-Federal land for which the special-use authorization is requested.
            (b) The application shall disclose the historic access to the landowner's property and any rights of access which may exist over non-federally owned land and shall provide reasons why these means of access do not provide adequate access to the landowners property.
            (c) The information required to apply for access across National Forest lands under this subpart is approved for use under subpart B of this part and assigned OMB control number 0596-0082.
          
          
            § 251.113
            Instrument of authorization.
            To grant authority to construct and/or use facilities and structures on National Forest System lands for access to non-Federal lands, the authorized officer shall issue a special-use authorization in conformance with the provisions of subpart B of this part or a road-use permit. In cases where Road Rights-of-way Construction And Use Agreements are in effect, the authorized officer may grant an easement in accordance with the provisions of part 212 of this chapter.
          
          
            § 251.114
            Criteria, terms and conditions.
            (a) In issuing a special-use authorization for access to non-Federal lands, the authorized officer shall authorize only those access facilities or modes of access that are needed for the reasonable use and enjoyment of the land and that minimize the impacts on the Federal resources. The authorizing officer shall determine what constitutes reasonable use and enjoyment of the lands based on contemporaneous uses made of similarly situated lands in the area and any other relevant criteria.
            (b) Landowners must pay an appropriate fee for the authorized use of National Forest System lands in accordance with § 251.57 of this part.

            (c) A landowner may be required to provide a reciprocal grant of access to the United States across the landowner's property where such reciprocal right is deemed by the authorized officer to be necessary for the management of adjacent Federal land. In such case, the landowner shall receive the fair market value of the rights-of-way granted to the United States. If the value of the rights-of-way obtained by the Government exceeds the value of the rights-of-way granted, the difference in value will be paid to the landowner. If the value of the rights-of-way across Government land exceeds the value of the rights-of-way across the private land, an appropriate adjustment will be made in the fee charged for the special-use authorization as provided in § 251.57(b)(5) of this part.
            (d) For access across National Forest System lands that will have significant non-Forest user traffic, a landowner may be required to construct new roads or reconstruct existing roads to bring the roads to a safe and adequate standard. A landowner also may be required to provide for the operation and maintenance of the road. This may be done by arranging for such road to be made part of the local public road system, or formation of a local improvement district to assume the responsibilities for the operation and maintenance of the road as either a private road or as a public road, as determined to be appropriate by the authorizing officer.
            (e) When access is tributary to or dependent on forest development roads, and traffic over these roads arising from the use of landowner's lands exceeds their safe capacity or will cause damage to the roadway, the landowner(s) may be required to obtain a road-use permit and to perform such reconstruction as necessary to bring the road to a safe and adequate standard to accommodate such traffic in addition to the Government's traffic. In such case, the landowner(s) also shall enter into a cooperative maintenance arrangement with the Forest Service to ensure that the landowner's commensurate maintenance responsibilities are met or shall make arrangements to have the jurisdiction and maintenance responsibility for the road assumed by the appropriate public road authority.
            (f) In addition to ensuring that applicable terms and conditions of paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section are met, the authorizing officer, prior to issuing any access authorization, must also ensure that:
            (1) The landowner has demonstrated a lack of any existing rights or routes of access available by deed or under State or common law;
            (2) The route is so located and constructed as to minimize adverse impacts on soils, fish and wildlife, scenic, cultural, threatened and endangered species, and other values of the Federal land;
            (3) The location and method of access is as consistent as reasonably possible with the management of any congressionally designated area and is consistent with Forest Land and Resource Management Plans or the plans are amended to accommodate the access grant, and;
            (4) When access routes exist across the adjacent non-Federal lands or the best route as determined by the authorizing officer is across non-Federal lands, the applicant landowner has demonstrated that all legal recourse to obtain reasonable access across adjacent non-Federal lands has been exhausted or has little chance of success.
            (g) In addition to the other requirements of this section, the following factors shall be considered in authorizing access to non-federally owned lands over National Forest System lands which are components of the National Wilderness Preservation System:
            (1) The use of means of ingress and egress which have been or are being customarily used with respect to similarly situated non-Federal land used for similar purposes;
            (2) The combination of routes and modes of travel, including nonmotorized modes, which will cause the least lasting impact on the wilderness but, at the same time, will permit the reasonable use of the non-federally owned land;
            (3) The examination of a voluntary acquisition of land or interests in land by exchange, purchase, or donation to modify or eliminate the need to use wilderness areas for access purposes.

            § 251.120
            Applicability and scope.

            (a) These regulations implement section 1307 of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) (16 U.S.C. 3197) with regard to the continuation of visitor services offered as of January 1, 1979, and the granting of a preference to local residents and certain Native Corporations to obtain special use authorizations for visitor services provided on National Forest System lands within Conservation System Units of the Tongass and Chugach National Forests in Alaska.
            (b) Except as may be specifically provided in this subpart, the regulations at subpart B shall apply to special use authorizations issued under this subpart. However, if subpart B conflicts with subpart E, subpart E controls.
            (c) This subpart does not apply to the guiding of sport hunting and fishing.
          
          
            § 251.121
            Definitions.
            In addition to the definitions in subpart B of this part, the following terms apply to this subpart:
            
              Best application—the application, as determined by the authorized officer, that best meets the evaluation criteria contained in a prospectus to solicit visitor services.
            
              Conservation System Unit (CSU) as it relates to the Tongass and Chugach National Forests in Alaska—a National Forest Monument or any unit of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, National Trails System, or National Wilderness Preservation System, including existing units and any such unit established, designated, or expanded hereafter.
            
              Controlling interest—in the case of a corporation, an interest, beneficial or otherwise, of sufficient outstanding voting securities or capital of the business so as to permit the exercise of managerial authority over the actions and operations of the corporation or election of a majority of the board of directors of the corporation. In the case of a partnership, limited partnership, joint venture, or individual entrepreneurship, a beneficial ownership of or interest in the entity or its capital so as to permit the exercise of managerial authority over the actions and operations of the entity. In other circumstances, any arrangement under which a third party has the ability to exercise management authority over the actions or operations of the business.
            
              Historical operator—a holder of a valid special use authorization to provide visitor services in a CSU under Forest Service jurisdiction who:
            (1) On or before January 1, 1979, was lawfully and adequately providing visitor services in that CSU;
            (2) Has continued lawfully and adequately to provide the same or similar types of visitor services within that CSU; and
            (3) Is otherwise determined by the authorized officer to have a right to continue to provide the same or similar visitor services.
            
              Local area—any site within 100 miles of the location within a CSU where any visitor services covered by a single solicitation by the Forest Service are to be authorized.
            
              Local resident:
            
            (1) For individuals—Alaska residents who have lived within the local area for 12 consecutive months prior to issuance of a solicitation of applications for a visitor services authorization for a CSU; who maintain their primary, permanent residence and business within the local area; and who, whenever absent from this primary, permanent residence, have the intention of returning to it.
            (2) For corporations, partnerships, limited partnerships, joint ventures, individual entrepreneurships, and other circumstances—where the controlling interest is held by an individual or individuals who qualify as local residents within the meaning of this section.
            (3) For nonprofit entities—where a majority of the board members and a majority of the officers qualify as local residents within the meaning of this section.
            
              Native Corporation has the same meaning as under section 102(6) of ANILCA (16 U.S.C. 3197).
            
              Preferred operator—a Native Corporation that is determined, pursuant to § 251.123, to be most directly affected by establishment or expansion of a CSU; or a local resident, as defined in this section, who competes for a visitor service special use authorization under § 251.124 of this subpart.
            
              Responsive application—an application that is received in a timely manner and that meets the requirements stated in the prospectus.
            
            
              Visitor service—any service or activity for which persons who visit a CSU pay a fee, commission, brokerage, or other compensation, including such services as providing food, accommodations, transportation, tours, and outfitting and guiding, except the guiding of sport hunting and fishing.
          
          
            § 251.122
            Historical operator special use authorizations.
            (a) A historical operator has the right to continue to provide visitor services under appropriate terms and conditions contained in a special use authorization, as long as such services are determined by the authorized officer to be consistent with the purposes for which the CSU was established or expanded. A historical operator may not operate without such an authorization.
            (b) Any person who qualifies as a historical operator under this subpart and who wishes to exercise the rights granted to historical operators under section 1307(a) of ANILCA (16 U.S.C. 1397(a)) must notify the authorized officer responsible for the CSU.
            (c) A historical operator may apply for a special use authorization to provide visitor services similar to but in lieu of those provided by that historical operator before January 1, 1979. The authorized officer shall grant the application if those visitor services are determined by the authorized officer to be:
            (1) Consistent with the purposes for which the applicable CSU was established or expanded;
            (2) Similar in kind and scope to the visitor services provided by the historical operator before January 1, 1979; and
            (3) Consistent with the legal rights of any other person.
            (d) Upon the authorized officer's determination that the person qualifies as a historical operator, under either paragraph (a) or paragraph (c) of this section, the authorized officer shall amend the current special use authorization or issue a new special use authorization to identify that portion of the authorized services that is deemed to be historical operations. The special use authorization shall identify the location, type, and frequency or volume of visitor services to be provided.
            (e) When a historical operator's special use authorization expires, the authorized officer shall offer to reissue the special use authorization for the same or similar visitor services, as long as the visitor services remain consistent with the purposes for which the CSU was established or expanded, the historical operator was lawfully and adequately providing visitor services under the previous special use authorization, and the historical operator continues to possess the capability to provide the visitor services adequately.
            (1) If the operator accepts the offer to reissue, the authorized officer shall issue a new special use authorization that clearly identifies the historical operations as required by paragraph (d) of this section.
            (2) If the authorized officer determines that it is necessary to reduce the visitor services to be provided by a historical operator, the authorized officer shall modify the historical operator's special use authorization to reflect the reduced services as follows:
            (i) If more than one historical operator provides services in the area where visitor service capacity is to be reduced, the authorized officer shall apportion the reduction among the historical operators, taking into account historical operating levels and such other factors as are relevant to achieve a proportionate reduction among the operators.
            (ii) If the reductions in visitor service capacity make it necessary to reduce operators in an area, the authorized officer shall select, through a competitive process that is limited to historical operators only, the operator or operators to receive a special use authorization from among the historical operators. Historical operators participating in this competitive process may not claim a preference as a preferred operator under § 251.124.
            (f) Any of the following shall result in the loss of historical operator status:

            (1) Revocation of a special use authorization for historical types and levels of visitor services for failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the special use authorization;
            
            (2) A historical operator's refusal of an offer to reissue a special use authorization made pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section;
            (3) A change in the controlling interest of a historical operator through sale, assignment, devise, transfer, or otherwise, except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section; or
            (4) An operator's failure to provide the authorized services for a period of more than 24 consecutive months.
            (g) A change in the controlling interest of a historical operator that results only in the acquisition of the controlling interest by an individual or individuals, who were personally engaged in the visitor service activities of the historical operator before January 1, 1979, shall not be deemed a change in the historical operator's controlling interest for the purposes of this subpart.
            (h) Nothing in this section shall prohibit the authorized officer from authorizing persons other than historical operators to provide visitor services in the same area, as long as historical operators receive authorization to provide visitor services that are the same as or similar to those they provided on or before January 1, 1979.
            (i) If an authorized officer grants to a historical operator an increase in the scope or level of visitor services from what was provided on or before January 1, 1979, beyond what was authorized under paragraph (d) of this section, for either the same or similar visitor services, the historical operator has no right of preference for the increased amount of authorized services. If additional operations are authorized, the special use authorization shall explicitly state that they are not subject to the historical operator preference.
          
          
            § 251.123
            Most directly affected Native Corporation determination.
            (a) Before issuance of the first special use authorization for a specific CSU pursuant to § 251.124 on or after the effective date of this subpart, the authorized officer shall give notice to Native Corporations interested in providing visitor services within the CSU and give them an opportunity to submit an application to be considered the Native Corporation most directly affected by the establishment or expansion of the CSU under section 1307(b) of ANILCA (16 U.S.C. 1397(b)). In giving notice of the application procedure, the authorized officer shall make clear that this is the only opportunity to apply for most directly affected status for that particular CSU.
            (1) At a minimum, an application from an interested Native Corporation shall include the following:
            (i) Name, address, and telephone number of the Native Corporation; date of its incorporation; its articles of incorporation and structure; and the name of the applicable CSU and the solicitation to which the Native Corporation is responding;
            (ii) Location of the Native Corporation's population centers; and
            (iii) An assessment of the socioeconomic impacts (including changes in historical and traditional use and landownership patterns) on the Native Corporation resulting from establishment or expansion of the applicable CSU.
            (2) In addition to the minimum information required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section, Native Corporations may submit such additional information as they consider relevant.
            (b) Upon receipt of all applications from interested Native Corporations, the authorized officer shall determine the most directly affected Native Corporation considering the following factors:
            (1) Distance and accessibility from the Native Corporation's population centers and/or business address to the applicable CSU;
            (2) Socioeconomic impacts (including changes in historical and traditional use and landownership patterns) on Native Corporations resulting from establishment or expansion of the applicable CSU; and
            (3) Information provided by Native Corporations and other information considered relevant by the authorized officer to assessment of the effects of establishment or expansion of the applicable CSU.

            (c) In the event that two or more Native Corporations are determined to be equally affected for purposes of the most directly affected Native Corporation determination pursuant to this section, each such Native Corporation shall be considered a preferred operator under this subpart.
            (d) A Native Corporation determined to be most directly affected for a CSU shall maintain that status for all future visitor service solicitations for that CSU.
          
          
            § 251.124
            Preferred operator competitive special use authorization procedures.
            (a) In selecting persons to provide visitor services for a CSU, the authorized officer shall, if the number of visitor service authorizations is to be limited, give a preference (subject to any rights of historical operators under this subpart) to preferred operators as defined in this subpart who are determined to be qualified to provide such visitor services.
            (b) In such circumstances, the authorized officer shall solicit applications competitively by issuing a prospectus for persons to apply for a visitor services authorization. Notwithstanding Forest Service outfitting and guiding policy in Forest Service Handbook 2709.11, chapter 40, when authorizations, including priority use permits for activities other than sport hunting and fishing, expire in accordance with their terms, they shall not be reissued if there is a need to limit use and when there is competitive interest by preferred operators.
            (c) To qualify as a preferred operator under this subpart, an applicant responding to a solicitation made under this section must be determined by the authorized officer to be a local resident as defined in § 251.121 of this subpart, or the Native Corporation most directly affected by establishment or expansion of the CSU covered by the solicitation pursuant to § 251.123 of this subpart.
            (d) Applicants seeking preferred operator status based on local residency must provide documentation verifying their claim. Factors demonstrating the location of an individual's primary, permanent residence and business include, but are not limited to, the permanent address indicated on licenses issued by the State of Alaska, tax returns, and voter registration.
            (e) An application from a preferred operator in the form of a corporation, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture, individual entrepreneurship, nonprofit entity, or other form of organization shall be considered valid only when the application documents to the satisfaction of the authorized officer that the preferred operator holds the controlling interest in the corporation, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture, individual entrepreneurship, nonprofit entity, or other form of organization.
            (f) A qualified preferred operator shall be given preference, pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section, over all other applicants, except with respect to use allocated to historical operators pursuant to § 251.122 of this subpart.
            (g) If the best application from a preferred operator is at least substantially equal to the best application from a non-preferred operator, the preferred operator shall be issued the visitor service authorization. If an application from an applicant other than a preferred operator is determined to be the best application (and no preferred operator submits a responsive application that is substantially equal to it), the preferred operator who submitted the best application from among the applications submitted by preferred operators shall be given the opportunity, by amending its application, to meet the terms and conditions of the best application received. If the amended application of that preferred operator is considered by the authorized officer to be at least substantially equal to the best application, the preferred operator shall be issued the visitor service authorization. If a preferred operator does not amend its application to meet the terms and conditions of the best application, the authorized officer shall issue the visitor service authorization to the applicant who submitted the best application in response to the prospectus.
          
          
            § 251.125
            Preferred operator privileges and limitations.
            (a) A preferred operator has no preference within a National Forest in Alaska beyond that authorized by section 1307 of ANILCA (16 U.S.C. 1397) and by § 251.124 of this subpart.

            (b) Local residents and most directly affected Native Corporations have equal priority for consideration in providing visitor services pursuant to § 251.124 of this subpart.
            (c) Nothing in this subpart shall prohibit the authorized officer from issuing special use authorizations to other applicants within the CSU, as long as the requirements of § 251.124 are met.
            (d) If an operator qualifies as a local resident for any part of an area designated in the solicitation for a specific visitor service, in matters related solely to that solicitation, the operator shall be treated as a local resident for the entire area covered by that solicitation.
            (e) The preferences described in this section may not be sold, assigned, transferred, or devised, either directly or indirectly, in whole or in part.
          
          
            § 251.126
            Appeals.
            Decisions related to the issuance of special use authorizations in response to written solicitations by the Forest Service under this subpart or related to the modification of special use authorizations to reflect historical use are subject to administrative appeal under 36 CFR part 214.

            § 254.1
            Scope and applicability.
            (a) These rules set forth the procedures for conducting exchanges of National Forest System lands. The procedures in these rules may be supplemented by instructions issued to Forest Service officers in Chapter 5400 of the Forest Service Manual and Forest Service Handbooks 5409.12 and 5409.13.
            (b) These rules apply to all National Forest System exchanges of land or interests in land, including but not limited to minerals, water rights, and timber, except those exchanges made under the authority of Small Tracts Act of January 12, 1983 (16 U.S.C. 521c-521i) (36 CFR part 254, subpart C), and as otherwise noted. These rules also apply to other methods of acquisition, where indicated.

            (c) The application of these rules to exchanges made under the authority of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, as amended (43 U.S.C. 1621), or the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. 3192), shall be limited to those provisions which do not conflict with the provisions of these Acts.
            (d) Unless the parties to an exchange otherwise agree, land exchanges for which the parties have agreed in writing to initiate prior to April 7, 1994, will proceed in accordance with the rules and regulations in effect at the time of the agreement.
            (e) Except for exchanges requiring cash equalization payments made available through the Land and Water Conservation Act of 1965, as amended (16 U.S.C. 460[1]9), the boundaries of a national forest are automatically extended to encompass lands acquired under the Weeks Act of March 1, 1911, as amended (16 U.S.C. 516), provided the acquired lands are contiguous to existing national forest boundaries and total no more than 3,000 acres in each exchange.
            (f) Exchanges under the Weeks Act of March 1, 1911, or the General Exchange Act of March 20, 1922, may involve land-for-timber (non-Federal land exchanged for the rights to Federal timber), or timber-for-land (the exchange of the rights to non-Federal timber for Federal land), or tripartite land-for-timber (non-Federal land exchanged for the rights to Federal timber cut by a third party in behalf of the exchange parties).
            (g) Land exchanges involving National Forest System lands are authorized by a number of statutes, depending upon the status (conditions of ownership) of such lands and the purpose for which an exchange is to be made. The status of National Forest System land is determined by the method by which the land or interests therein became part of the National Forest System. Unless otherwise provided by law, lands acquired by the United States in exchanges assume the same status as the Federal lands conveyed.
            (h) The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, as amended (43 U.S.C. 1701), is supplemental to all applicable exchange laws, except the cash equalization provisions of the Sisk Act of December 4, 1967, as amended (16 U.S.C. 484a).
          
          
            § 254.2
            Definitions.
            For the purposes of this subpart, the following terms have the meanings set forth in this section.
            
              Acquisition means the attainment of lands or interests in lands by the Secretary, acting on behalf of the United States, by exchange, purchase, donation, or eminent domain.
            
              Adjustment to relative values means compensation for exchange-related costs, or other responsibilities or requirements assumed by one party, which ordinarily would be borne by the other party. These adjustments do not alter the agreed upon value of the lands involved in an exchange.
            
              Agreement to initiate means a written, nonbinding statement of present intent to initiate and pursue an exchange, which is signed by the parties and which may be amended by consent of the parties or terminated at any time upon written notice by any party.
            
              Appraisal or appraisal report means a written statement independently and impartially prepared by a qualified appraiser setting forth an opinion as to the market value of the lands or interests in lands as of a specific date(s), supported by the presentation and analysis of relevant market information.
            
              Approximately equal value means a comparative estimate of value of the lands involved in an exchange which have readily apparent and substantially similar elements of value, such as location, size, use, physical characteristics, and other amenities.
            
              Arbitration is a process to resolve a disagreement among the parties as to appraised value, performed by an arbitrator appointed by the Secretary from a list recommended by the American Arbitration Association.
            
              Assembled land exchange means an exchange of Federal land for a package of multiple ownership parcels of non-Federal land consolidated for purposes of one land exchange transaction.
            
              Authorized officer means a Forest Service line or staff officer who has been delegated the authority and responsibility to make decisions and perform the duties described in this subpart.
            
              Bargaining is a process other than arbitration, by which parties attempt to resolve a dispute concerning the appraised value of the lands involved in an exchange.
            
              Federal lands means any lands or interests in lands, such as mineral and timber interests, that are owned by the United States and administered by the Secretary of Agriculture through the Chief of the Forest Service, without regard to how the United States acquired ownership.
            
              Hazardous substances are those substances designated under Environmental Protection Agency regulations at 40 CFR part 302.

              Lands means any land and/or interests in land.
            
              Market value means the most probable price in cash, or terms equivalent to cash, which lands or interest in lands should bring in a competitive and open market under all conditions requisite to a fair sale, where the buyer and seller each acts prudently and knowledgeably, and the price is not affected by undue influence.
            
              Mineral laws means the mining and mineral leasing laws applicable to Federally owned lands and minerals reserved from the public domain for national forest purposes and the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 (30 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.), but not the Materials Act of 1947 (30 U.S.C. 601 et seq.).
            
              Outstanding interests are rights or interests in property held by an entity other than a party to an exchange.
            
              Party means the United States or any person, State, or local government who enters into an agreement to initiate an exchange.
            
              Person means any individual, corporation, or other legal entity legally capable to hold title to and convey land. An individual must be a citizen of the United States and a corporation must be subject to the laws of the United States or of the State where the land is located or the corporation is incorporated. No Member of Congress may participate in a land exchange with an agency of the United States, as set forth in 18 U.S.C. 431-433.
            
              Public land laws means that body of non-mineral land laws dealing with the disposal of National Forest System lands administered by the Secretary of Agriculture.

              Statement of value means a written report prepared by a qualified appraiser in conformance with the minimum standards of the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice that states the appraiser's conclusion(s) of value.
          
          
            § 254.3
            Requirements.
            (a) Discretionary nature of exchanges. The Secretary is not required to exchange any Federal lands. Land exchanges are discretionary, voluntary real estate transactions between the Federal and non-Federal parties. Unless and until the parties enter into a binding exchange agreement, any party may withdraw from and terminate an exchange proposal at any time during the exchange process.
            (b) Determination of public interest. The authorized officer may complete an exchange only after a determination is made that the public interest will be well served.
            (1) Factors to consider. When considering the public interest, the authorized officer shall give full consideration to the opportunity to achieve better management of Federal lands and resources, to meet the needs of State and local residents and their economies, and to secure important objectives, including but not limited to: protection of fish and wildlife habitats, cultural resources, watersheds, and wilderness and aesthetic values; enhancement of recreation opportunities and public access; consolidation of lands and/or interests in lands, such as mineral and timber interests, for more logical and efficient management and development; consolidation of split estates; expansion of communities; accommodation of existing or planned land use authorizations (§ 254.4(c)(4); promotion of multiple-use values; implementation of applicable Forest Land and Resource Management Plans; and fulfillment of public needs.
            (2) Findings. To determine that an exchange well serves the public interest, the authorized officer must find that—
            (i) The resource values and the public objectives served by the non-Federal lands or interests to be acquired must equal or exceed the resource values and the public objectives served by the Federal lands to be conveyed, and
            (ii) The intended use of the conveyed Federal land will not substantially conflict with established management objectives on adjacent Federal lands, including Indian Trust lands.
            (3) Documentation. The findings and the supporting rationale shall be documented and made part of the administrative record.
            (c) Equal value exchanges. Except as provided in § 254.11 of this subpart, lands or interests to be exchanged must be of equal value or equalized in accordance with the methods set forth in § 254.12 of this subpart. An exchange of lands or interests shall be based on market value as determined by the Secretary through appraisal(s), through bargaining based on appraisal(s), through other acceptable and commonly recognized methods of determining market value, or through arbitration.
            (d) Same-State exchanges. Unless otherwise provided by statute, the Federal and non-Federal lands involved in an exchange must be located within the same State.
            (e) Congressional designations. Upon acceptance of title by the United States, lands acquired by the Secretary of the Interior by exchange under the authority granted by the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, as amended, which are within the boundaries of any unit of the National Forest System, the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, the National Trails System, the National Wilderness Preservation System, or any other system established by Act of Congress; or the boundaries of any national conservation area or national recreation area established by Act of Congress, immediately are reserved for and become a part of the unit or area in which they are located, without further action by the Secretary of the Interior, and, thereafter, shall be managed in accordance with all laws, rules, regulations, and land resource management plans applicable to such unit or area.
            (f) Land and resource management planning. The authorized officer shall consider only those exchange proposals that are consistent with land and resource management plans (36 CFR part 219). Lands acquired by exchange that are located within areas having an administrative designation established through the land management planning process shall automatically become part of the area within which they are located, without further action by the Forest Service, and shall be managed in accordance with the laws, rules, regulations, and land and resource management plan applicable to such area.
            (g) Environmental analysis. After an agreement to initiate an exchange is signed, the authorized officer shall undertake an environmental analysis in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4371), the Council on Environmental Quality regulations (40 CFR parts 1500-1508), and Forest Service environmental policies and procedures (Forest Service Manual Chapter 1950 and Forest Service Handbook 1909.15). In making this analysis, the authorized officer shall consider timely written comments received in response to the exchange notice published pursuant to § 254.8 of this subpart.
            (h) Reservations or restrictions in the public interest. In any exchange, the authorized officer shall reserve such rights or retain such interests as are needed to protect the public interest or shall otherwise restrict the use of Federal lands to be exchanged, as appropriate. The use or development of lands conveyed out of Federal ownership are subject to any restrictions imposed by the conveyance documents and all laws, regulations, and zoning authorities of State and local governing bodies.
            (i) Hazardous substances—(1) Federal lands. The authorized officer shall determine whether hazardous substances are known to be present on the Federal lands involved in the exchange and shall provide notice of known storage, release, or disposal of hazardous substances on the Federal lands in the contract agreement and in the conveyance document, pursuant to 40 CFR part 373 and 42 U.S.C. 9620. For purposes of this section, the notice of hazardous substances on involved Federal lands in an agreement to initiate an exchange or an exchange agreement meets the requirements for notices established in 40 CFR part 373. Unless the non-Federal party is a potentially responsible party under 42 U.S.C. 9607(a) and participated as an owner, or in the operation, arrangement, generation, or transportation of the hazardous substances found on the Federal land, the conveyance document from the United States must contain a covenant warranting that all remedial action necessary to protect human health and the environment with respect to any such substances remaining on the property has been taken before the date of transfer and that any additional remedial action found necessary after the transfer shall be conducted by the United States, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 9620(h)(3). The conveyance document must also reserve to the United States the right of access to the conveyed property if remedial or corrective action is required after the date of transfer. Where the non-Federal party is a potentially responsible party with respect to the property, it may be appropriate to enter into an agreement as referenced in 42 U.S.C. 9607(e) whereby that party would indemnify the United States and hold the United States harmless against any loss or cleanup costs after conveyance.
            (2) Non-Federal lands. The non-Federal party shall notify the authorized officer of any hazardous substances known to have been released, stored, or disposed of on the non-Federal land, pursuant to § 254.4 of this subpart. Notwithstanding such notice, the authorized officer shall determine whether hazardous substances are known to be present on the non-Federal land involved in an exchange. If hazardous substances are known or believed to be present on the non-Federal land, the authorized officer shall reach an agreement with the non-Federal party regarding the responsibility for appropriate response action concerning the hazardous substances before completing the exchange. The terms of this agreement and any appropriate “hold harmless agreement” shall be included in an exchange agreement, pursuant to § 254.14 of this subpart.
            (j) Legal description of properties. All lands subject to an exchange must be properly described on the basis of either a survey executed in accordance with the Public Land Survey System laws and standards of the United States or, if those laws and standards cannot be applied, the lands shall be properly described and clearly locatable by other means as may be prescribed or allowed by law.
            (k) Special review. Except as provided in this paragraph, land acquisitions of $150,000 or more in value made under the authority of the Weeks Act of March 1, 1911, as amended (16 U.S.C. 516), must be submitted to Congress for oversight review, pursuant to the Act of October 22, 1976, as amended (16 U.S.C. 521b). However, minor and insignificant changes in land acquisition proposals need not be resubmitted for congressional oversight, provided the general concept of and basis for the acquisition remain the same.
          
          
            § 254.4
            Agreement to initiate an exchange.
            (a) Exchanges may be proposed by the Forest Service or by any person, State, or local government. Initial exchange proposals should be directed to the authorized officer responsible for the management of Federal lands proposed for exchange.

            (b) To assess the feasibility of an exchange proposal, the prospective parties may agree to obtain a preliminary estimate of the values of the lands involved in the proposal. A qualified appraiser must prepare the preliminary estimate.
            (c) If the authorized officer agrees to proceed with an exchange proposal, all prospective parties shall execute a nonbinding agreement to initiate an exchange. At a minimum, the agreement must include:
            (1) The identity of the parties involved in the proposed exchange and the status of their ownership or ability to provide title to the land;
            (2) A description of the lands or interest in lands being considered for exchange;
            (3) A statement by a party, other than the United States and State and local governments, that such party is a citizen of the United States or a corporation or other legal entity subject to the laws of the United States or a State thereof;
            (4) A description of the appurtenant rights proposed to be exchanged or reserved; any authorized uses, including grants, permits, easements, or leases; and any known unauthorized uses, outstanding interests, exceptions, covenants, restrictions, title defects or encumbrances;
            (5) A time schedule for completing the proposed exchange;
            (6) An assignment of responsibility for performance of required functions and for costs associated with processing the exchange;
            (7) A statement specifying whether compensation for costs assumed will be allowed pursuant to the provisions of § 254.7 of this subpart;
            (8) Notice of any known release, storage, or disposal of hazardous substances on involved Federal or non-Federal lands and any commitments regarding responsibility for removal or other remedial actions concerning such substances on involved non-Federal lands (§ 254.3(i) and § 254.14);
            (9) A grant of permission by each party to physically examine the lands offered by the other party;
            (10) The terms of any assembled land exchange arrangement, pursuant to § 254.5 of this subpart;
            (11) A statement as to the arrangements for relocation of any tenants occupying non-Federal lands pursuant to § 254.15 of this subpart;
            (12) A notice to an owner-occupant of the voluntary basis for the acquisition of the non-Federal lands, pursuant to § 254.15 of this subpart; and
            (13) A statement as to the manner in which documents of conveyance will be exchanged, should the exchange proposal be successfully completed.
            (d) Unless the parties agree to some other schedule, no later than 90 days from the date of the executed agreement to initiate an exchange, the parties shall arrange for appraisals which are to be completed within timeframes and under such terms as are negotiated. In the absence of current market information reliably supporting value, the parties may agree to use other acceptable and commonly recognized methods to estimate value.
            (e) An agreement to initiate may be amended by consent of the parties or terminated at any time upon written notice by any party.
            (f) Entering into an agreement to initiate an exchange does not legally bind any party to proceed with processing or to consummate a proposed exchange, or to reimburse or pay damages to any party to a proposed exchange that is not consummated or to anyone doing business with any such party.
            (g) The withdrawal from an exchange proposal by the authorized officer at any time prior to the notice of decision pursuant to § 254.13 of this subpart is not appealable under 36 CFR part 214 or 215.
            [59 FR 10867, Mar. 8, 1984, as amended at 64 FR 25822, May 13, 1999; 78 FR 33725, June 5, 2013]
          
          
            § 254.5
            Assembled land exchanges.
            (a) Whenever the authorized officer determines it to be practicable, an assembled land exchange arrangement may be used to facilitate exchanges and reduce costs.
            (b) The parties to an exchange may agree to such an arrangement where multiple ownership parcels of non-Federal lands are consolidated into a package for the purpose of completing one exchange transaction.

            (c) An assembled land exchange arrangement must be documented in the agreement to initiate an exchange, pursuant to § 254.4 of this subpart.
            (d) Value of the Federal and non-Federal lands involved in an assembled land exchange arrangement shall be estimated pursuant to § 254.9 of this subpart.
            [59 FR 10867, Mar. 8, 1994; 59 FR 15501, Apr. 1, 1994]
          
          
            § 254.6
            Segregative effect.
            (a) If a proposal is made to exchange Federal lands, the authorized officer may request the appropriate State Office of the Bureau of Management (BLM) to segregate the Federal lands by a notation on the public land records. Subject to valid existing rights, the Federal lands shall be segregated from appropriation under the public land laws and mineral laws for a period not to exceed 5 years from the date of record notation.
            (b) Any interests of the United States in the non-Federal lands that are covered by the exchange proposal may be noted and segregated from appropriation under the mineral laws for a period not to exceed 5 years from the date of notation.
            (c) The segregative effect terminates as follows:
            (1) Automatically, upon issuance of a patent or other document of conveyance to the affected lands;

            (2) On the date and time specified in an opening order, published in the Federal Register by the appropriate BLM State Office, if a decision is made not to proceed with the exchange or upon removal of any lands from the exchange proposal; or
            (3) Automatically, at the end of the segregation period not to exceed 5 years from the date of notation on the public land records, whichever occurs first.
          
          
            § 254.7
            Assumption of costs.
            (a) Generally, each party to an exchange will bear their own costs of the exchange. However, if the authorized officer finds it is in the public interest as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, an agreement to initiate an exchange may provide that:
            (1) One or more of the parties may assume, without compensation, all or part of the costs or other responsibilities or requirements that the authorized officer determines would ordinarily be borne by the other parties; or
            (2) Subject to the limitation in paragraph (c) of this section, the parties may agree to make adjustments to the relative values involved in an exchange transaction, in order to compensate parties for assuming costs or other responsibilities or requirements that the authorized officer determines would ordinarily be borne by the other parties. These costs or services may include but are not limited to: land surveys; appraisals; mineral examinations; timber cruises; title searches; title curative actions; cultural resource surveys and mitigation; hazardous substance surveys and controls; removal of encumbrances; arbitration, including all fees; bargaining; cure of deficiencies preventing highest and best use of the land; conduct of public hearings; assemblage of non-Federal parcels from multiple ownerships; and the expenses of complying with laws, regulations, and policies applicable to exchange transactions, or which are necessary to bring the Federal and non-Federal lands involved in the exchange to their highest and best use for appraisal and exchange purposes.
            (b) As a condition of an agreement to initiate, the authorized officer may agree to assume without compensation costs ordinarily borne by the non-Federal party or to compensate the non-Federal party for assuming Federal costs only on an exceptional basis when it is clearly in the public interest and when the authorized officer determines and documents that each of the following circumstances exist:
            (1) The amount of such cost assumed or compensation is reasonable and accurately reflects the value of the cost or service provided, or any responsibility and requirement assumed;
            (2) The proposed exchange is a high priority of the agency;
            (3) The land exchange must be expedited to protect important Federal resource values, such as congressionally designated areas or endangered species habitat;

            (4) Cash equalization funds are available for compensation of the non-Federal party; and
            
            (5) There are no other practicable means available to the authorized officer for meeting Federal exchange processing costs, responsibilities, or requirements.
            (c) The total amount of an adjustment agreed to as compensation for costs pursuant to this section shall not exceed the limitations set forth in § 254.12(b) of this subpart.

            § 254.8
            Notice of exchange proposal.
            (a) Upon entering into an agreement to initiate an exchange, the authorized officer shall publish a notice once a week for four consecutive weeks in newspapers of general circulation in the counties in which the Federal and non-Federal lands or interests proposed for exchange are located. The authorized officer shall notify authorized users, the jurisdictional State and local governments, and the congressional delegation and shall make other distribution of the notice as appropriate. At a minimum, the notice shall include:
            (1) The identity of the parties involved in the proposed exchange;
            (2) A description of the Federal and non-Federal lands being considered for exchange;
            (3) A statement as to the effect of segregation from appropriation under the public land laws and mineral laws, if applicable;
            (4) An invitation to the public to submit in writing any comments on or concerns about the exchange proposal, including advising the agency as to any liens, encumbrances, or other claims relating to the lands being considered for exchange; and
            (5) The deadline by which comments must be received, and the name, title, and address of the official to whom comments must be sent and from whom additional information may be obtained.
            (b) To be assured of consideration in the environmental analysis of the proposed exchange, all comments must be made in writing to the authorized officer and postmarked or delivered within 45 days after the initial date of publication.
            (c) The authorized officer is not required to republish legal descriptions of any lands that may be excluded from the final exchange transaction, provided such lands were identified in the notice of exchange proposal. In addition, minor corrections of land descriptions and other insignificant changes do not require republication.
          
          
            § 254.9
            Appraisals.
            The Federal and non-Federal parties to an exchange shall comply with the appraisal standards as set forth in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, and, to the extent appropriate, with the Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions: Interagency Land Acquisition Conference 1992 (Washington, DC, 1992), ISBN 0-16-038050-2 when appraising the values of the Federal and non-Federal lands involved in an exchange.
            (a) Appraiser qualifications. (1) A qualified appraiser(s) shall provide to the authorized officer appraisals estimating the market value of Federal and non-Federal properties involved in an exchange. A qualified appraiser may be an employee or a contractor to the Federal or non-Federal exchange parties. At a minimum, a qualified appraiser shall be an individual agreeable to all parties and approved by the authorized officer, who is competent, reputable, impartial, and has training and experience in appraising property similar to the property involved in the appraisal assignment.
            (2) Qualified appraisers shall possess qualifications consistent with State regulatory requirements that meet the intent of Title XI, Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) (12 U.S.C. 3331). In the event a State or Territory does not have approved policies, practices, and procedures regulating the activities of appraisers, the Forest Service may establish appraiser qualification standards commensurate with those generally adopted by other States or Territories meeting the requirements of FIRREA.
            (b) Market value. (1) In estimating market value, the appraiser shall:

            (i) Determine the highest and best use of the property to be appraised;
            
            (ii) Estimate the value of the lands and interests as if in private ownership and available for sale in the open market;
            (iii) Include historic, wildlife, recreation, wilderness, scenic, cultural, or other resource values or amenities as reflected in prices paid for similar properties in the competitive market;
            (iv) Consider the contributory value of any interest in land such as water rights, minerals, or timber, to the extent they are consistent with the highest and best use of the property; and
            (v) If stipulated in the agreement to initiate in accordance with § 254.4 of this subpart, estimate separately the value of each property optioned or acquired from multiple ownerships by the non-Federal party for purposes of exchange, pursuant to § 254.5 of this subpart. In this case, the appraiser also must estimate the value of the Federal and non-Federal properties in a similar manner.
            (2) In estimating market value, the appraiser may not independently add the separate values of the fractional interests to be conveyed, unless market evidence indicates the following:
            (i) The various interests contribute their full value (pro rata) to the value of the whole; and
            (ii) The valuation is compatible with the highest and best use of the property.
            (3) In the absence of current market information reliably supporting value, the authorized officer may use other acceptable and commonly recognized methods to determine market value.
            (c) Appraisal report standards. Appraisals prepared for exchange purposes must contain the following minimum information:
            (1) A summary of facts and conclusions;
            (2) The purpose and/or the function of the appraisal, a definition of the estate being appraised, and a statement of the assumptions and limiting conditions affecting the appraisal assignment, if any;
            (3) An explanation of the extent of the appraiser's research and actions taken to collect and confirm information relied upon in estimating value;
            (4) An adequate description of the physical characteristics of the land being appraised; a statement of all encumbrances; title information; location, zoning, and present use; an analysis of highest and best use; and at least a 5-year sales history of the property;
            (5) A disclosure of any condition that is observed during the inspection of the property or becomes known to the appraiser through the normal research which would lead the appraiser to believe that hazardous substances may be present on the property being appraised;
            (6) A comparative market analysis and, if more than one method of valuation is used, an analysis and reconciliation of the methods used to support the appraiser's estimate of value;
            (7) A description of comparable sales, including a description of all relevant physical, legal, and economic factors such as parties to the transaction, source and method of financing, effect of any favorable financing on sale price, and verification by a party involved in the transaction;
            (8) An estimate of market value;
            (9) The effective date of valuation, date of appraisal, signature, and certification of the appraiser;
            (10) A certification by the appraiser to the following:
            (i) The appraiser has personally contacted the property owner or designated representative and offered the owner an opportunity to be present during inspection of the property;
            (ii) The appraiser has personally examined the subject property and all comparable sale properties relied upon in the report;
            (iii) The appraiser has no present or prospective interest in the appraised property; and
            (iv) The appraiser has not received compensation that was contingent on the analysis, opinions, or conclusions contained in the appraisal report; and

            (11) Copies of relevant written reports, studies, or summary conclusions prepared by others in association with the appraisal assignment which were relied upon by the appraiser to estimate value, which may include, but is not limited to, current title reports, mineral reports, or timber cruises prepared by qualified specialists.
            
            (d) Appraisal review. (1) Appraisal reports shall be reviewed by a qualified review appraiser meeting the qualifications set forth in paragraph (a) of this section. Statements of value prepared by agency appraisers are not subject to this review.
            (2) The review appraiser shall determine whether the appraisal report:
            (i) Is complete, logical, consistent, and supported by market analysis;
            (ii) Complies with the standards prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section; and
            (iii) Reasonably estimates the probable market value of the lands appraised.
            (3) The review appraiser shall prepare a written review report, containing at a minimum:
            (i) A description of the review process used;
            (ii) An explanation of the adequacy, relevance, and reasonableness of the data and methods used by the appraiser to estimate value;
            (iii) The review appraiser's conclusions regarding the appraiser's estimate of market value; and
            (iv) A certification by the review appraiser to the following:
            (A) The review appraiser has no present or prospective interest in the property which is the subject of the review report; and
            (B) The review appraiser has not received compensation that was contingent upon approval of the appraisal report.
          
          
            § 254.10
            Bargaining; arbitration.
            (a) Unless the parties to an exchange agree in writing to suspend or modify the deadlines contained in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section, the parties shall adhere to the following:
            (1)(i) Within 180 days from the date of receipt of the appraisal(s) for review and approval by the authorized officer, the parties to an exchange may agree on the appraised values or may initiate a process of bargaining or some other process to determine values. Bargaining or any other process must be based on an objective analysis of the valuation in the appraisal report(s) and is a means of reconciling differences in such report(s). Bargaining or another process to determine values may involve one or more of the following actions:
            (A) Submission of the disputed appraisal(s) to another qualified appraiser for review:
            (B) Request for additional appraisals;
            (C) Involvement of an impartial third party to facilitate resolution of the value disputes, or
            (D) Use of some other acceptable and commonly recognized practice for resolving value disputes.
            (ii) Any agreement based upon bargaining must be in writing and made part of the administrative record of the exchange. Such agreement must contain a reference to all relevant appraisal information and state how the parties reconciled or compromised appraisal information to arrive at an agreement based on market value.
            (2) If within 180 days from the date of receipt of the appraisal(s) for review and approval by the authorized officer, the parties to an exchange cannot agree on values but wish to continue with the land exchange, the appraisal(s), at the initiative of either party, must be submitted to arbitration, unless, in lieu of arbitration, the parties have employed a process of bargaining or some other process to determine values. If arbitration occurs, it must be conducted in accordance with the real estate valuation arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association. The Secretary or an official to whom such authority has been delegated shall appoint an arbitrator from a list provided by the American Arbitration Association.
            (3) Within 30 days after completion of arbitration, the parties involved in the exchange must determine whether to proceed with the exchange, modify the exchange to reflect the findings of the arbitration or any other factors, or withdraw from the exchange. A decision to withdraw from the exchange may be made upon written notice by either party at this time or at any other time prior to entering into a binding exchange agreement.

            (4) If the parties agree to proceed with an exchange after arbitration, the values established by arbitration are binding upon all parties for a period not to exceed 2 years from the date of the arbitration decision.
            
            (b) Arbitration is limited to the disputed valuation of the lands involved in a proposed exchange and an arbitrator's award decision is limited to the value estimate(s) of the contested appraisal(s). An arbitrator may not include in an award decision recommendations regarding the terms of a proposed exchange, nor may an arbitrator's award decision infringe upon the authority of the Secretary to make all decisions regarding management of Federal lands and to make public interest determinations.
          
          
            § 254.11
            Exchanges at approximately equal value.
            (a) The authorized officer may exchange lands which are of approximately equal value upon a determination that:
            (1) The exchange is in the public interest and the consummation of the proposed exchange will be expedited;
            (2) The value of the lands to be conveyed out of Federal ownership is not more than $150,000 as based upon a statement of value prepared by a qualified appraiser and accepted by an authorized officer;
            (3) The Federal and non-Federal lands are substantially similar in location, acreage, use, and physical attributes; and
            (4) There are no significant elements of value requiring complex analysis.
            (b) The authorized officer, not the non-Federal party, determines whether the Federal and non-Federal lands are approximately equal in value and must document how the determination was made.
          
          
            § 254.12
            Value equalization; cash equalization waiver.
            (a) To equalize the agreed upon values of the Federal and non-Federal lands involved in an exchange, either with or without adjustments of relative values as compensation for various costs, the parties to an exchange may agree to:
            (1) Modify the exchange proposal by adding or excluding lands; and/or
            (2) Use cash equalization, after making all reasonable efforts to equalize values by adding or deleting lands.
            (b) The combined amount of any cash equalization payment and/or the amount of adjustments agreed to as compensation for costs under § 254.7 of this subpart may not exceed 25 percent of the value of the Federal lands to be conveyed.
            (c) The Secretary of Agriculture may not waive cash equalization payment due the United States, but the parties may agree to waive cash equalization payment due the non-Federal party. The amount to be waived may not exceed 3 percent of the value of the lands being exchanged out of Federal ownership or $15,000, whichever is less.
            (d) A cash equalization payment may be waived only after the authorized officer certifies, in writing, that the waiver will expedite the exchange and that the public interest will be best served by the waiver.
          
          
            § 254.13
            Approval of exchanges; notice of decision.
            (a) Upon completion of all environmental analyses and appropriate documentation, appraisals, and all other supporting studies and requirements to determine if a proposed exchange is in the public interest and in compliance with applicable law and regulations, the authorized officer shall decide whether to approve an exchange proposal.
            (1) When a decision to approve or disapprove an exchange is made, the authorized officer shall publish a notice of the availability of the decision in newspapers of general circulation. At a minimum, the notice must include:
            (i) The date of decision;
            (ii) A concise description of the decision;
            (iii) The name and title of the deciding official;
            (iv) Directions for obtaining a copy of the decision; and
            (v) The date of the beginning of the appeal period.

            (2) The authorized officer shall distribute notices to the State and local governmental subdivisions having authority in the geographical area within which the lands covered by the notice are located, the non-Federal exchange parties, authorized users of involved Federal lands, the congressional delegation, and individuals who requested notification or filed written objections, and others as appropriate.
            
            (b) The decision to approve or disapprove an exchange proposal shall be subject to appeal as provided under 36 CFR part 214 or 215 for 45 days after the date of publication of a notice of availability of the decision.

            § 254.14
            Exchange agreement.
            (a) The parties to a proposed exchange may enter into an exchange agreement subsequent to a decision by the authorized officer to approve the exchange, pursuant to § 254.13 of this subpart. Such an agreement is required if hazardous substances are present on the non-Federal lands. An exchange agreement must contain the following:
            (1) Identification of the parties, description of the lands and interests to be exchanged, identification of all reserved and outstanding interests, stipulation of any necessary cash equalization, and all other terms and conditions necessary to complete an exchange;
            (2) Inclusion of the terms regarding responsibility for removal, indemnification (“hold harmless” agreement), or other remedial actions concerning any hazardous substances on the involved non-Federal lands; and
            (3) The agreed upon values of the involved lands, until consummation of the land exchange.
            (b) An exchange agreement, as described in paragraph (a) of this section, is legally binding on all parties, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, provided:
            (1) Acceptable title can be conveyed;
            (2) No substantial loss or damage occurs to either property from any cause;
            (3) No undisclosed hazardous substances are found on the involved Federal or non-Federal lands prior to conveyance;
            (4) The exchange proposal receives any required Secretarial approval;
            (5) No objections are raised during any required congressional oversight;
            (6) In the event of an appeal under 36 CFR part 214 or 215, a decision to approve an exchange proposal pursuant to § 254.13 of this subpart is upheld; and
            (7) The agreement is not terminated by mutual consent or upon such terms as may be provided in the agreement.
            (c) In the event of a failure to perform or to comply with the terms of an exchange agreement, the noncomplying party is liable for all costs borne by the other party as a result of the proposed exchange, including, but not limited to, land surveys, appraisals, mineral examinations, timber cruises, title searches, title curative actions, cultural resource surveys and mitigation, hazardous substance surveys and controls, removal of encumbrances, arbitration, curing deficiencies preventing highest and best use of the land, and any other expenses incurred in processing the proposed land exchange.
            (d) Absent an executed exchange agreement, an action taken by the parties prior to consummation of an exchange does not create any contractual or other binding obligations or rights enforceable against any party.

            § 254.15
            Title standards.
            (a) Title evidence. (1) Unless otherwise specified by the USDA Office of the General Counsel, evidence of title for the non-Federal lands being conveyed to the United States must be in recordable form and in conformance with the Department of Justice regulations and “Standards for the Preparation of Title Evidence in Land Acquisitions by the United States” in effect at the time of conveyance.
            (2) The United States is not required to furnish title evidence for the Federal lands being exchanged.
            (b) Conveyance documents. (1) Unless otherwise specified by the USDA Office of the General Counsel, all conveyances to the United States must be prepared, executed, and acknowledged in accordance with the Department of Justice regulations and “Standards for the Preparation of Title Evidence in Land Acquisitions by the United States” in effect at the time of conveyance.

            (2) Conveyances of lands from the United States are made by patent, quitclaim deed, or deed and without express or implied warranties, except as to hazardous substances pursuant to § 254.3 of this subpart.
            (c) Title encumbrances—(1) Non-Federal lands. (i) Title to the non-Federal lands must be acceptable to the United States. For example, encumbrances such as taxes, judgment liens, mortgages, and other objections or title defects shall be eliminated, released, or waived in accordance with requirements of the preliminary title opinion of the USDA Office of the General Counsel or the Department of Justice, as appropriate.
            (ii) The United States shall not accept lands in which there are reserved or outstanding interests that would interfere with the use and management of the land by the United States or would otherwise be inconsistent with the authority under which, or the purpose for which, the lands are to be acquired. Reserved interests of the non-Federal landowner are subject to the appropriate rules and regulations of the Secretary, except upon special finding by the Chief, Forest Service in the case of States, agencies, or political subdivisions thereof (36 CFR part 251, subpart A).
            (iii) Any personal property owned by the non-Federal party which is not a part of the exchange proposal, should be removed by the non-Federal party prior to acceptance of title by the United States, unless the authorized officer and the non-Federal party to the exchange previously agree upon a specified period to remove the personal property. If the personal property is not removed prior to acceptance of title or within the otherwise prescribed time, it shall be deemed abandoned and shall become vested in the United States.
            (iv) The exchange parties must reach agreement on the arrangements for the relocation of any tenants. Qualified tenants occupying non-Federal lands affected by a land exchange may be entitled to relocation benefits under 49 CFR 24.2. Unless otherwise provided by law or regulation (49 CFR 24.101(a)(1)), relocation benefits are not applicable to owner-occupants involved in exchanges with the United States provided the owner-occupants are notified in writing that the non-Federal lands are being acquired by the United States on a voluntary basis.
            (2) Federal lands. If Federal lands proposed for exchange are occupied under grant, permit, easement, or non-mineral lease by a third party who is not a party to the exchange, the third party holder of such authorization and the non-Federal party to the exchange may reach agreement as to the disposition of the existing use(s) authorized under the terms of the grant, permit, easement, or lease. The non-Federal exchange party shall submit documented proof of such agreement prior to issuance of a decision to approve the land exchange, as instructed by the authorized officer. If an agreement cannot be reached, the authorized officer shall consider other alternatives to accommodate the authorized use or shall determine whether there are specific and compelling reasons in the public interest for revoking the authorization for that use pursuant to 36 CFR 251.60.

            § 254.16
            Case closing.
            (a) Title transfers. Unless otherwise agreed, and notwithstanding the decision in United States v. Schurz, 102 U.S. 378 (1880), or any other law or ruling to the contrary, title to both the non-Federal and Federal lands pass simultaneously and are deemed accepted by the United States and the non-Federal landowner, respectively, when the documents of conveyance are recorded in the county clerk's or other local recorder's office. Before recordation, all instructions, requirements, and conditions set forth by the United States and the non-Federal landowner must be met. The minimum requirements and conditions necessary for recordation include the following, as appropriate:
            (1) The determination by the authorized officer that the United States will receive possession, acceptable to it, of such lands;

            (2) The issuance of title evidence as of the date of recordation which conforms to the instructions and requirements of the USDA Office of the General Counsel's preliminary title opinion; and
            
            (3) Continuation searches disclosing no matters of record that would require any change in the aforementioned title evidence as issued.
            (b) Automatic segregation of lands. Subject to valid existing rights, non-Federal lands acquired through exchange by the United States automatically are segregated from appropriation under the public land laws and mineral laws until midnight of the 90th day after acceptance of title by the United States, and the public land records must be noted accordingly. Thereafter, the lands will be open automatically to operation of the public land laws and mineral laws, except to the extent otherwise provided by law, unless action is taken pursuant to 43 CFR part 2300 to initiate a withdrawal within the 90-day period.

            Purpose and scope.
            (a) A Forest Service official may, upon application, set aside and designate for townsite purposes up to 640 acres of National Forest System lands adjacent to or contiguous to an established community in Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming.
            (b) National Forest System lands, needed by a community, may be sold under the Townsite Act, for fair market value if those lands would serve indigenous community objectives that outweigh the public objectives and values of retaining the lands in Federal ownership. Indigenous community objectives may include space for housing and for service industries, expansion of existing economic enterprises, new industries utilizing local resources and skills, public schools, public health facilities, community parks, and other recreation areas for local citizens, but would exclude such uses as commercial enterprises or new industries and housing projects that would change the character of the local community.

            Pub. L. 97-465; 96 Stat. 2535.

            § 254.30
            Purpose.

            These regulations set forth procedures by which the Secretary of Agriculture may resolve land disputes and management problems pursuant to Pub. L. 97-465, commonly called the Small Tracts Act, by conveying, through sale, exchange, or interchange, three categories of tracts of land: Parcels encroached on, road rights-of-way, and mineral survey fractions. Implementation of these regulations does not constitute authorization of nor consent to adverse possession against lands administered by the Secretary of Agriculture.
          
          
            § 254.31
            Definitions.
            For the purpose of this subpart,
            An applicant is a person who occupies or has improvements on National Forest System land under claim of title or color of title, or who owns land abutting or underlying a road right-of-way, or who owns land interspersed with or adjacent to mineral survey fractions.
            
              Approximately equal value is a comparative estimate of value of lands involved in an interchange where elements of value, such as physical characteristics and other amenities, are readily apparent and substantially similar.
            
              Claim of title is a claim of land as a person's own, based on any reasonable evidence which establishes the person's actual use of the land as though the person had full title thereto from the time the person obtained ownership of abutting land.
            
              Color of title arises from an instrument purporting to convey title to a tract of land.
            
              Encroachments are improvements occupied or used on National Forest System land under claim of title or color of title.
            
              Exchange is a discretionary, voluntary transaction involving mutual transfers of land or interests in land between the Secretary of Agriculture acting by and through the Forest Service and a nonfederal entity.
            
              Good faith is honesty of intention and freedom from knowledge of circumstances which ought to put a prudent person upon inquiry.
            
              Improvements mean an addition to property costing labor or capital which affects its value. The term generally includes fixtures, structures and attendant facilities, or buildings.
            
              Interchange is a land transfer in which the Secretary and another person exchange lands or interests in lands of approximately equal value without a formal appraisal.
            
              Mineral survey fractions are small parcels of National Forest System lands interspersed with or adjacent to lands transferred out of Federal ownership under the mining laws.
            
              Person includes any nonfederal entity such as a State or any political subdivision as well as any individual or business entity.
            
              Secretary refers to the Secretary of the United States Department of Agriculture.
          
          
            § 254.32
            Encroachments.
            (a) Conveyances under this subpart are limited to tracts of 10 acres or less to resolve encroachments by persons:
            (1) To whom no advance notice was given that the improvements encroached or would encroach, and
            (2) Who in good faith relied on an erroneous survey, title search, or other land description which did not reveal such encroachment.
            (b) Forest Service officials shall consider the following factors when determining whether to convey lands upon which encroachments exist:
            (1) The location of the property boundaries based on historical location and continued acceptance and maintenance,
            (2) Factual evidence of claim of title or color of title,
            (3) Notice given to persons encroaching on National Forest System lands,
            (4) Degree of development in the encroached upon area, and
            (5) Creation of an uneconomic remnant.
          
          
            § 254.33
            Road rights-of-way.
            (a) Reserved or acquired road right-of-way parcels subject to conveyance under this subpart are limited to those which are substantially surrounded by lands not owned by the United States.
            (b) Forest Service officials shall consider public road system right-of-way needs based on National Forest transportation planning and State and local law before making any conveyance of rights-of-way.
            (c) Reimbursement will be required for the value of any improvements made by the United States or other highway authorities, unless waived by the Chief of the Forest Service.
          
          
            
            § 254.34
            Mineral survey fractions.
            (a) Mineral survey fractions subject to conveyance under this subpart are limited to those tracts which:
            (1) Cannot be efficiently administered because of size, shape, or location;
            (2) Are occupied or could be occupied or used by adjoining owners; and
            (3) When sold separately or aggregated in one transaction, do not exceed 40 acres.
            (b) Forest Service officials shall consider the following criteria in determining whether to convey mineral survey fractions under this subpart:
            (1) The mineral survey fractions are interspersed among and are more or less an integral part of private land holdings;
            (2) The feasibility and cost of surveying the parcels in order to manage them effectively;
            (3) The size, shape, and location of the parcels as they affect management, utility, access, occupancy or use of the parcels or the lands with which they are interspersed.
          
          
            § 254.35
            Limitations.
            (a) Lands within the National Wilderness Preservation System, the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, the National Trails System, and National Monuments are excluded from any conveyance under these provisions.
            (b) Lands within National Recreation Areas may not be conveyed by sale under this subpart.
            (c) The value of Federal lands conveyed in any transaction, pursuant to this subpart, shall not exceed $150,000.
            (d) Compensation for lands conveyed shall be of at least equal value, or in the case of interchange, of approximately equal value, and may be in the form of land, interest in land (including minerals), or cash, or any combination thereof.
            (e) The sale, exchange, or interchange of lands or interest in lands under these rules are discretionary and shall be made only if found to be in the public interest.
            (f) The abutting landowner(s) shall have the first right of acquisition.
            (g) The area of land conveyed shall be limited to the minimum necessary to resolve encroachment or land management problems.

            § 254.36
            Determining public interest.
            (a) The requirements of § 254.35 and of one of § 254.32, § 254.33, or § 254.34 must be met before a determination of public interest can be made.
            (b) Before a conveyance is made under this subpart, such conveyance must be determined to be in the public interest.
            (c) Forest Service officials shall consider the following criteria in determining when the public interest will be served:
            (1) Sale, exchange, or interchange of the affected lands is not practicable under any other authority of the Secretary;
            (2) Administration and management of National Forest System lands will be more efficient and will result in improved utilization;
            (3) Access to and use and enjoyment of National Forest System lands by the general public will not be unduly impeded or restricted;
            (4) New or extensive inholdings which would create management problems will not be established;
            (5) Scenic, wildlife, environmental, historical, archaeological, or cultural values will not be substantially affected or impaired;

            Valuation of tracts.
            (a) Approximately equal value shall be determined by comparing and evaluating the elements of value on the lands or interest in lands to be interchanged. Elements of value to be considered include size, shape, location, physical attributes, functional utility, proximity of other similar sites, and amenities in the immediate environs of the parcel.

            § 262.10
            Impoundment and disposal of unauthorized livestock.
            Unauthorized livestock or livestock in excess of those authorized by a grazing permit on the National Forest System, which are not removed therefrom within the periods prescribed by this regulation, may be impounded and disposed of by a forest officer as provided herein.
            (a) When a Forest officer determines that such livestock use is occurring, has definite knowledge of the kind of livestock, and knows the name and address of the owners, such livestock may be impounded any time five days after written notice of intent to impound such livestock is mailed by certified or registered mail or personally delivered to such owners.
            (b) When a Forest officer determines that such livestock use is occurring, but does not have complete knowledge of the kind of livestock, or if the name of the owner is unknown, such livestock may be impounded any time 15 days after the date a notice of intent to impound livestock is first published in a local newspaper and posted at the county courthouse and in one or more local post offices. The notice will identify the area in which it will be effective.
            (c) Unauthorized livestock or livestock in excess of those authorized by a grazing permit on National Forest System which are owned by persons given notice under paragraph (a) of this section, and any such livestock in areas for which a notice has been posted and published under paragraph (b) of this section, may be impounded without further notice any time within the 12-month period immediately following the effective date of the notice or notices given under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
            (d) Following the impoundment of livestock, a notice of sale of impounded livestock will be published in a local newspaper and posted at the county courthouse and in one or more local post offices. The notice will describe the livestock and specify the date, time, and place of the sale. The date shall be at least five days after the publication and posting of such notice.
            (e) The owner may redeem the livestock any time before the date and time set for the sale by submitting proof of ownership and paying for all expenses incurred by the United States in gathering, impounding, and feeding or pasturing the livestock. However, when the impoundment costs exceed fair market value a minimum acceptable redemption price at fair market value may be established for each head of livestock.

            (f) If the livestock are not redeemed on or before the date and time fixed for their sale, they shall be sold at public sale to the highest bidder, providing this bid is at or above the minimum amount set by the Forest Service. If a bid at or above the minimum amount is not received, the livestock may be sold at private sale at or above the minimum amount, reoffered at public sale, condemned and destroyed, or otherwise disposed of. When livestock are sold pursuant to this regulation, the forest officer making the sale shall furnish the purchaser a bill or other written instrument evidencing the sale. Agreements may be made with State agencies whereby livestock of unknown ownership and livestock of known ownership, which are not redeemed by the owner, are released to the agency for disposal in accordance with State law, Provided, That remuneration of proceeds from the sale of said animals in excess of costs of impoundment and to arrange for disposal of livestock of known ownership will be refunded to the former owner.

            Any dog found running at large in a part of the National Forest System, which has been closed to dogs running at large, may be captured and impounded by Forest officers. Forest officers will notify the owner of the dog, if known, of such impounding, and the owner will be given five days to redeem the dog. A dog may be redeemed by the owner submitting adequate evidence of ownership and paying all expenses incurred by the Forest Service in capturing and impounding it. If the owner fails to redeem the dog within five days after notice, or if the owner cannot be ascertained within 10 days from the date of impounding, the dog may be destroyed or otherwise disposed of at the discretion of the Forest officer having possession of it.

            (a) Automobiles or other vehicles, trailers, boats, and camping equipment and other inanimate personal property on National Forest System lands without the authorization of a Forest officer which are not removed therefrom within the prescribed period after a warning notice as provided in this regulation may be impounded by a Forest officer. Whenever such Forest officer knows the name and address of the owner, such impoundment may be effected at any time five days after the date that written notice of the trespass is mailed by registered mail or delivered to such owner.
            (b) If the local Forest Officer does not know the name and address of the owner of property in trespass, impoundment may be effected at any time 72 hours after a notice of intention to impound the property in trespass is posted in at least one place in the vicinity of the property.
            (c) Personal property impounded under this regulation may be disposed of at the expiration of 90-days after the date of impoundment. The owner may redeem the personal property within the 90-day period by submitting proof of ownership and paying all expenses incurred by the United States in advertising, gathering, moving, impounding, storing, and otherwise caring for the property, and also for the value of the use of the site occupied during the period of the trespass.
            (d) The owner of impounded property may redeem it by the date set for its disposition, but shall remain liable for all costs associated with its impoundment, removal, transportation, and storage. Impounded property that is not redeemed by the date set for its disposition shall become the property of the United States and may be retained by the Forest Service for official use, sold at public sale to the highest bidder, or otherwise disposed of. When impounded property is sold, the forest officer conducting the sale shall furnish the purchaser with a bill of sale or other written instrument evidencing the sale. The original owner shall remain liable for all costs associated with impoundment, removal, transportation, and storage of the property, minus any amount received from the sale of the property.
            (e) The provisions of this section shall not apply to the impoundment or disposal of beached logs in Alaska if deemed abandoned under State law.

            (a) Public service use. The Chief may authorize the use of the insignia for non-commercial educational purposes, without charge when such use is essentially a public service and will contribute to public knowledge and understanding of the Forest Service, its mission, and objectives.

            (b) Commercial use. Through the issuance of licenses, the Chief may authorize commercial use of the insignia to (1) contribute to the public recognition of the Forest Service, such as a likeness of the insignia on a toy forest ranger's truck or (2) promote employee esprit de corps or pride in the organization, such as a likeness of the insignia on belt buckles.

            (3) The license shall be nonexclusive.
            (4) Licensees are not authorized to grant sublicenses, or transfer or reassign licenses to another person or company, in connection with the manufacture and/or sale of an item, unless and except as approved in writing by the Chief.

The Chief may also revoke any license or authorization when there is a failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the license or authorization.

          § 290.1
          Purpose and scope.

          The rules of this part implement the requirements of the Federal Cave Resources Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 4301-4309), hereafter referred to as the “Act”. The rules apply to cave management on National Forest System lands. These rules, in conjunction with rules in part 261 of this chapter, provide the basis for identifying and managing significant caves on National Forest System lands in accordance with the Act. National Forest System lands will be managed in a manner which, to the extent practical, protects and maintains significant cave resources in accordance with the policies outlined in the Forest Service Directive System and the management direction contained in the individual forest plans.
        
        
          § 290.2
          Definitions.
          For the purposes of this part, the terms listed in this section have the following meaning:
          
            Authorized officer means the Forest Service employee delegated the authority to perform the duties described in this part.
          
            Cave means any naturally occurring void, cavity, recess, or system of interconnected passages beneath the surface of the earth or within a cliff or ledge and which is large enough to permit a person to enter, whether the entrance is excavated or naturally formed. Such term shall include any natural pit, sinkhole, or other opening which is an extension of a cave entrance or which is an integral part of the cave.
          
            Cave resources mean any materials or substances occurring in caves including, but not limited to, biotic, cultural, mineralogic, paleontologic, geologic, and hydrologic resources.
          
            National Forest System lands means all national forest lands reserved or withdrawn from the public domain, acquired through purchase, exchange, or donation, national grasslands and land utilization projects, and other lands, waters, or interests administered by the Forest Service.
          
            Secretary means the Secretary of Agriculture.
          
            Significant cave means a cave located on National Forest System lands that has been determined to meet the criteria in § 290.3 (c) or (d) and has been designated in accordance with § 290.3(e).
        
        
          § 290.3
          Nomination, evaluation, and designation of significant caves.
          (a) Nominations for initial and subsequent listings. The authorized officer will give governmental agencies and the public, including those who utilize caves for scientific, educational, or recreational purposes, the opportunity to nominate caves. The authorized officer shall give public notice, including a notice published in the Federal Register, calling for nominations for the initial listing and setting forth the procedures for preparing and submitting the nominations. Nominations for subsequent listings will be accepted from governmental agencies and the public by the Forest Supervisor where the cave is located as new cave discoveries are made. Caves nominated but not approved for designation may be renominated as additional documentation or new information becomes available.
          (b) Evaluation for initial and subsequent listings. The evaluation of the nominations for significant caves will be carried out in consultation with individuals and organizations interested in the management and use of caves and cave resources, within the limits imposed by the confidentiality provisions of § 290.4. Nominations shall be evaluated using the criteria in § 290.3 (c) and (d).
          (c) Criteria for significant caves. A significant cave on National Forest System lands shall possess one or more of the following features, characteristics, or values.
          (1) Biota. The cave provides seasonal or yearlong habitat for organisms or animals, or contains species or subspecies of flora or fauna native to caves, or are sensitive to disturbance, or are found on State or Federal sensitive, threatened, or endangered species lists.
          (2) Cultural. The cave contains historic properties or archeological resources (as defined in Parts 800.2 and 296.3 of this chapter respectively, or in 16 U.S.C. 470, et seq.), or other features included in or eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places because of their research importance for history or prehistory, historical associations, or other historical or traditional significance.
          (3) Geologic/Mineralogic/Paleontologic. The cave possesses one or more of the following features:

          (i) Geologic or mineralogic features that are fragile, represent formation processes that are of scientific interest, or that are otherwise useful for study.
          (ii) Deposits of sediments or features useful for evaluating past events.
          (iii) Paleontologic resources with potential to contribute useful educational or scientific information.
          (4) Hydrologic. The cave is a part of a hydrologic system or contains water which is important to humans, biota, or development of cave resources.
          (5) Recreational. The cave provides or could provide recreational opportunities or scenic values.
          (6) Educational or scientific. The cave offers opportunities for educational or scientific use; or, the cave is virtually in a pristine state, lacking evidence of contemporary human disturbance or impact; or, the length, volume, total depth, pit depth, height, or similar measurements are notable.
          (d) Specially designated areas. All caves located within special management areas, such as Special Geologic Areas, Research Natural Areas, or National Monuments, that are designated wholly or in part due to the cave resources found therein are determined to be significant.
          (e) Designation and documentation. If the authorized officer determines that a cave nominated and evaluated under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section meets one or more of the criteria in paragraph (c) of this section, the authorized officer shall designate the cave as significant. The authorized officer will notify the nominating party of the results of the evaluation and designation. Each forest will retain appropriate documentation for all significant caves located within its administrative boundaries. At a minimum, this documentation shall include a statement of finding signed and dated by the authorized officer and the information used to make the determination. This documentation will be retained as a permanent record in accordance with the confidentiality provision in § 290.4.
          (f) Undiscovered passages. If a cave is determined to be significant, its entire extent on federal land, including passages not mapped or discovered at the time of the determination, is deemed significant. This includes caves that extend from lands managed by any other Federal agency into National Forest System lands, as well as caves initially believed to be separate for which interconnecting passages are discovered after significance is determined.
          (g) Decision final. The decision to designate or not designate a cave as significant is made at the sole discretion of the authorized officer based upon the criteria in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section and is not subject to further administrative review of appeal under Parts 217 or 251.82 of this chapter.
        
        
          § 290.4
          Confidentiality of cave location information.
          (a) Information disclosure. No Forest Service employee shall disclose any information that could be used to determine the location of a significant cave or a cave nominated for designation, unless the authorized officer determines that disclosure will further the purposes of the Act and will not create a substantial risk of harm, theft, or destruction to cave resources.
          (b) Requesting confidential information. Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, the authorized officer may make confidential cave information available to Federal or State governmental agencies, bona fide educational or research institutes, or individuals or organizations assisting the land management agencies with cave management activities. To request confidential cave information, such entities shall make a written request to the authorized officer which includes the following:
          (1) Name, address, and telephone number of the individual responsible for the security of the information received;
          (2) A legal description of the area for which the information is sought;
          (3) A statement of the purpose for which the information is sought; and,
          (4) Written assurances that the requesting party will maintain the confidentiality of the information and protect the cave and its resources.
          (c) Decision final. The decision to permit or deny access to confidential cave information is made at the sole discretion of the authorized officer and is not subject to further administrative review or appeal under 5 U.S.C. 552 or parts 217 or 251.82 of this chapter.
        
        
          
          § 290.5
          Collection of information.
          The collection of information contained in this rule represents new information requirements as defined in 5 CFR part 1320, Controlling Paperwork Burdens on the Public. In accordance with those rules and the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 as amended (44 U.S.C. 3507), the Forest Service has received approval by the Office of Management and Budget to collect cave nomination information under clearance number 0596-0123 and confidential information under 0596-0122. The information provided for the cave nominations will be used to determine which caves will be listed as “significant” and the information in the requests to obtain confidential cave information will be used to decide whether to grant access to this information. Response to the call for cave nominations is voluntary. No action may be taken against a person for refusing to supply the information requested. Response to the information requirements for obtaining confidential cave information is required to obtain a benefit in accordance with section 5 of the Federal Cave Resources Protection Act of 1988 (16 U.S.C. 4304).

          Casual collecting on National Forest System lands.
          (a) Casual collecting is allowed without a permit on National Forest System lands where such collection is consistent with the laws governing the management of those lands, the land management plans, and where the lands in question are not closed to casual collection.
          (b) National Forest System lands are open to casual collection unless otherwise closed, as described in § 291.12.
          (c) Research activities do not constitute casual collection, and therefore, research involving the collecting of common invertebrate and plant paleontological resources requires a permit.
          (d) Using scientific principles and expertise, the Authorized Officer may determine that certain invertebrate and plant paleontological resources do or do not meet the definition of “common invertebrate and plant paleontological resources” as set forth in these regulations, and thus, whether such resources can be casually collected or must be collected under permit.
          (e) Determinations as described above in paragraph (d) of this section are subject to the conditions as stated in § 291.9(c)(1) through (4).
          (f) It is the responsibility of the collecting public to ensure that they are casually collecting in an area that is open to casual collection, and that the materials they collect are subject to casual collection.
          (g) Paleontological resources collected on National Forest System lands, including common invertebrate and plant paleontological resources subject to casual collecting, cannot be sold. Sale of these paleontological resources is a violation of 16 U.S.C. 470aaa-5(a)(3) and § 291.27(a)(3) and may subject the violator to civil and criminal penalties.

The amount of any penalty assessed for any one violation shall not exceed an amount equal to double the cost of response to, and restoration and repair of resources and paleontological site damage plus double the scientific or fair market value of resources destroyed or not recovered.
          (d) Determination of scientific and fair market values and cost of response to, and restoration and repair. Scientific and fair market values and the cost of response to, and restoration and repair are determined as described in §§ 291.37 through 291.39.
        
        
          § 291.30
          Civil penalty process.
          (a) Notice of violation. The Authorized Officer shall serve a notice of violation by certified mail (return receipt requested) or other type of verifiable delivery upon any person believed to be subject to a civil penalty. The Authorized Officer shall include in the notice:
          (1) A concise statement of the facts believed to show a violation;
          (2) A specific reference to the section(s) of this part or to a permit issued pursuant to this part allegedly violated;
          (3) The penalty proposed;
          (4) Notification of the right to request a hearing in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section. The notice shall also inform the person of the right to seek judicial review of any final administrative decision assessing a civil penalty.
          (b) Response to notice of violation. The person served with a notice of violation shall have 45 calendar days from the date of mailing in which to respond. During this time the person may:
          (1) Accept the proposed penalty, either in writing or by payment. Acceptance of the proposed penalty will be deemed a waiver of the right to request a hearing as described in paragraph (f) in this section.
          (2) Seek informal discussions with the Authorized Officer;
          (3) File a written response. This written response must be filed with the Authorized Officer within 45 calendar days of the date of mailing of the notice of violation, and must be signed by the person served with the notice of violation. If the person is a corporation, the written response must be signed by an officer authorized to sign such documents. The written response will set forth in full the legal or factual basis for the requested relief.
          (4) Request a hearing in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.
          (c) Assessment of penalty. (1) The Authorized Officer shall assess a civil penalty upon completion of the 45 calendar day response period, informal discussions, or review of the written response, whichever is later.
          (2) The Authorized Officer shall take into consideration all available information, including information provided under paragraph (b) of this section or furnished upon further request by the Authorized Officer.

          (3) If the facts warrant a conclusion that no violation has occurred, the Authorized Officer shall notify the person served with the notice of violation that no violation has occurred and no penalty will be assessed.
          
          (4) Where the facts warrant a conclusion that a violation has occurred, the Authorized Officer shall determine a penalty amount in accordance with § 291.29.
          (d) Penalty modification and remittance. The Authorized Officer may offer to modify or remit the penalty. Modification or remittance may be based upon any or all of the following factors:
          (1) Agreement by the person being assessed a civil penalty to return to the Authorized Officer paleontological resources removed from National Forest System lands;
          (2) Agreement by the person being assessed a civil penalty to assist the Authorized Officer in activity to preserve, restore, or otherwise contribute to the protection and study of paleontological resources on National Forest System lands;
          (3) Agreement by the person being assessed a civil penalty to provide information which will assist in the detection, prevention, or prosecution of violations of the Act or this part;
          (4) Determination that the person being assessed a civil penalty did not willfully commit the violation;
          (5) Determination of other mitigating circumstances appropriate to consideration in reaching a fair and expeditious assessment.
          (e) Notice of assessment. The Authorized Officer shall serve a written notice of assessment upon the person served with a notice of violation. The notice of assessment establishes the penalty amount assessed by the Authorized Officer and is served by certified mail (return receipt requested), or other type of verifiable delivery. The Authorized Officer shall include in the notice of assessment:
          (1) The facts and conclusions from which it was determined that a violation did occur;
          (2) The basis for determining the penalty amount assessed and/or any offer to mitigate or remit the penalty; and
          (3) Notification of the right to request a hearing, including the procedures to be followed, and to seek judicial review of any final administrative decision assessing a civil penalty.
          (f) Hearings. (1) Except where the right to request a hearing is deemed to have been waived as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the person served with a notice of assessment may file a written request for a hearing with the hearing office specified in the notice. The person shall enclose with the request for hearing a copy of the notice of assessment, and shall deliver the request for hearing by certified mail (return receipt requested), as specified in the notice of assessment.
          (2) Failure to deliver a written request for a hearing within 45 calendar days of the date of mailing of the notice of assessment shall be deemed a waiver of the right to a hearing.
          (3) Any hearing conducted pursuant to this section shall be held in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 554. In any such hearing, the amount of civil penalty assessed shall be determined in accordance with §§ 291.28 through 291.33, and shall not be limited by the amount assessed by the Authorized Officer under § 291.29(a) or any offer of mitigation or remission made by the Authorized Officer.
          (g) Final administrative decision. (1) Where the person served with a notice of violation has accepted the penalty pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the notice of violation shall constitute the final administrative decision;
          (2) Where the person served with a notice of assessment has not requested a hearing within 45 calendar days of the date of mailing of the notice of assessment, the notice of assessment shall constitute the final administrative decision;
          (3) Where the person served with a notice of assessment has filed a timely request for a hearing, the decision resulting from the hearing shall constitute the final administrative decision.
          (h) Payment of penalty. The person assessed a civil penalty shall have 45 calendar days from the date of issuance of the final administrative decision in which to make full payment of the penalty assessed, unless a timely request for appeal has been filed with a U.S. District Court as provided in § 291.32.
          (i) Other remedies not waived. Assessment of a penalty under this section shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to pursue other available legal or administrative remedies.
        
        
          § 291.31
          Civil penalties hearing procedures.
          (a) Requests for hearings. Any person wishing to request a hearing on a notice of assessment of civil penalty may file a written dated request for a hearing with the hearing office specified in the notice. The person shall enclose a copy of the notice of violation and the notice of assessment. The request shall state the relief sought, the basis for challenging the facts used for assessing the penalty, and the person's preference as to the place and date for a hearing. A copy of the request shall be served upon the USDA Office of the General Counsel by certified mail, at the addresses specified in the notice of assessment. Hearings shall be conducted in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 554.
          (b) Commencement of hearing procedures. Upon receipt of a request for a hearing, the hearing office shall assign an administrative law judge to the case. Notice of assignment shall be given promptly to the parties, and thereafter, all pleadings, papers, and other documents in the proceeding shall be filed directly with the administrative law judge, with copies served on the opposing party.
          (c) Appearance and practice. (1) The respondent may appear in person, by representative, or by counsel, and may participate fully in the proceedings. If respondent fails to appear and the administrative law judge determines such failure is without good cause, the administrative law judge may, in his/her discretion, determine that such failure shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing and consent to the making of a decision on the record made at the hearing.
          (2) Departmental counsel shall represent the Agency in the proceedings. Upon notice to the Authorized Officer of the assignment of an administrative law judge to the case, said counsel shall enter his/her appearance on behalf of the Agency and shall file all petitions and correspondence exchanges by the Agency and the respondent which shall become part of the hearing record. Thereafter, service upon the Agency shall be made to Departmental counsel.
          (d) Hearing administration. (1) The administrative law judge shall have all powers accorded by law and necessary to preside over the parties and the proceedings and to make decisions in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 554 through 557.
          (2) The transcript of testimony; the exhibits; and all papers, documents and requests filed in the proceedings shall constitute the record for decision. The administrative law judge shall render a written decision upon the record, which shall set forth his/her findings of fact and conclusions of law, and the reasons and basis therefore, and an assessment of a penalty, if any.
          (3) The administrative law judge's decision shall become effective 30 calendar days from the date of this decision.
        
        
          § 291.32
          Petition for judicial review; collection of unpaid assessments.
          (a) Judicial review. Any person against whom a final administrative decision is issued assessing a penalty may file a petition for judicial review of the decision in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or in the district in which the violation is alleged to have occurred within the 30 calendar day period beginning on the date the decision was issued. Upon notice of such filing, the Secretary shall promptly file such a certified copy of the record on which the decision was issued. The court shall hear the action on the record made before the Secretary and shall sustain the action if it is supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. Judicial review is limited by the requirement to exhaust administrative remedies under 7 U.S.C. 6912(e).
          (b) Failure to pay. Failure to pay a penalty assessed is a debt to the U.S. Government. If any person fails to pay a penalty within 30 calendar days after the final administrative decision and the person has not filed a petition for judicial review of the decision in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section; or after a court in an action brought in paragraph (a) of this section has entered a final judgment upholding the assessment of the penalty, the Secretary may request the Attorney General to institute a civil action in a district court of the United States for any district in which the person if found, resides, or transacts business, to collect the penalty (plus interest at currently prevailing rates from the date of the final decision or the date of the final judgment, as the case may be). The district court shall have jurisdiction to hear and decide any such action. In such action, the validity, amount, and appropriateness of such penalty shall not be subject to review. Any person who fails to pay on a timely basis the amount of an assessment of a civil penalty shall be required to pay, in addition to such amount and interest, attorney's fees and costs for collection proceedings. This section does not preclude the use of other collection methods such as Treasury offset, where appropriate.
        
        
          § 291.33
          Use of recovered amounts.
          Penalties and/or restitution collected shall be available to the Authorized Officer and without further appropriation may be used only as follows:
          (a) To protect, restore, or repair the paleontological resources and sites which were the subject of the action, and to protect, monitor, and study the resources and sites; and/or
          (b) To provide educational materials to the public about paleontological resources, sites, and their protection; and/or
          (c) To provide for the payment of rewards as provided in § 291.40.
        
        
          § 291.34
          Criminal penalties.
          (a) A person who knowingly violates or counsels, procures, solicits, or employs another person to violate § 291.27 shall, upon conviction, be fined in accordance with Title 18, United States Code, or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both; but if the sum of the commercial and paleontological value of the paleontological resources involved and the cost of restoration and repair of such resources does not exceed $500, such person shall be fined in accordance with Title 18, United States Code, or imprisoned not more than 2 years, or both.
          (b) Paleontological and commercial values and the cost of restoration and repair are determined under §§ 291.37 through 291.39.
        
        
          § 291.35
          Multiple offenses.
          In the case of subsequent or repeat violations by the same person, the amount of the monetary penalty assessed may be doubled.
        
        
          § 291.36
          General exception.
          The provisions in §§ 291.28 through 291.35 do not apply to any person with respect to any paleontological resource which was in the lawful possession of such person prior to the date of enactment of the Act.
        
        
          § 291.37
          Scientific or paleontological value.
          The scientific value of any paleontological resource involved in a violation of the prohibitions contained in this part or conditions of a permit issued pursuant to this Part shall be the value of the information associated with the paleontological resource. The term “scientific value” can be used interchangeably with the term “paleontological value.” This value shall be determined in terms of the costs of the retrieval of the scientific and educational information which would have been obtainable prior to the violation. These costs may include, but need not be limited to, the cost of preparing a research design, conducting field work, carrying out laboratory analysis, and preparing reports or educational materials or displays as would be necessary to realize the information potential.
        
        
          § 291.38
          Fair market or commercial value.

          The fair market value of any paleontological resource involved in a violation of the prohibitions contained in this part or conditions of a permit issued pursuant to this part shall be the commercial value of the resources, determined using the condition of the paleontological resource prior to the violation, to the extent that its prior condition can be ascertained. The term “fair market value” can be used interchangeably with the term “commercial value.” Fair market value of paleontological resources can be established through the use of comparable sales or pricing information, advertisements for comparable resources, appraisals, and/or other information on legal or illegal markets.
        
        
          § 291.39
          Cost of response, restoration, and repair.
          The cost of response, restoration, and repair of paleontological resources involved in a violation of prohibitions contained in this part or conditions of a permit issued pursuant to this part, shall be the sum of the costs incurred for response, investigation, assessment, emergency restoration, or repair work, plus those costs projected to be necessary to complete restoration and repair, which may include but need not be limited to the costs of:
          (a) Reconstruction of the paleontological resource;
          (b) Stabilization and/or salvage of the paleontological resource;
          (c) Ground contour reconstruction and surface stabilization;
          (d) Research necessary to carry out reconstruction or stabilization;
          (e) Physical barriers or other protective devices or signs, necessitated by the disturbance of the paleontological resource, to protect it from further disturbance;
          (f) Examination and analysis of the paleontological resource including recording remaining paleontological information, where necessitated by disturbance, in order to salvage remaining values which cannot be otherwise conserved;
          (g) Storage, preparation, and curation;
          (h) Site monitoring; and
          (i) Preparation of reports relating to any of the above activities.
        
        
          § 291.40
          Rewards.
          (a) The Authorized Officer may, at his or her discretion, pay from penalties collected under §§ 291.28 through 291.36, or from appropriated funds, an amount up to half of the penalties collected to any person who furnishes information which leads to a finding of the civil violation(s) or to the criminal conviction(s).
          (b) If several persons provided the information, the amount may be divided at the discretion of the Authorized Officer among the persons.
          (c) No officer or employee of the United States or of any State or local government who furnishes information or renders service in the performance of their official duties shall be eligible for payment.
        
        
          § 291.41
          Forfeiture.
          (a) Forfeiture. All paleontological resources with respect to which a violation under §§ 291.28 through 291.36 occurred and which are in the possession of any person, are subject to forfeiture proceedings. All forfeitures will be initiated pursuant to cooperative agreements with agencies having law enforcement authority and forfeiture regulations in place.
          (b) Transfer of administration of forfeited resources. The administration of forfeited resources may be transferred to Federal or non-Federal institutions to be used for scientific or educational purposes, in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.

            § 292.11
            Introduction.
            (a) Administration of the Shasta and Clair Engle-Lewiston Units will be coordinated with the other purposes of the Central Valley Project of the Bureau of Reclamation and of the recreation area as a whole so as to provide for: (1) Public outdoor recreation benefits; (2) conservation of scenic, scientific, historic, and other values contributing to public enjoyment; and (3) the management, utilization, and disposal of renewable natural resources which in the judgment of the Secretary of Agriculture will promote or is compatible with, and does not significantly impair, public recreation and conservation of scenic, scientific, historic, or other values contributing to public enjoyment.
            (b) The Secretary may not acquire without consent of the owner any privately owned “improved property” or interests therein within the boundaries of these units, so long as the appropriate local zoning agency shall have in force and applicable to such property a duly adopted, valid, zoning ordinance that is approved by the Secretary. This suspension of the Secretary's authority to acquire “improved property” without the owner's consent would automatically cease: (1) If the property is made the subject of a variance or exception to any applicable zoning ordinance that does not conform to the applicable standards contained in §§ 292.11 to 292.13; or (2) if such property is put to any use which does not conform to any applicable zoning ordinance approved by the Secretary.
            (c) Improved property as used in §§ 292.11 to 292.13, means any building or group of related buildings, the actual construction of which was begun before February 7, 1963, together with not more than three acres of land in the same ownership on which the building or group of buildings is situated, but the Secretary may exclude from such “improved property” any shore or waters, together with so much of the land adjoining such shore or waters, as he deems necessary for public access thereto.

            (d) Sections 292.11 to 292.13 specify the standards with which local zoning ordinances for the Shasta and Clair Engle-Lewiston Units must conform if the “improved property” or unimproved property proposed for development as authorized by the Act within the boundaries of the units is to be exempt from acquisition by condemnation. The objectives of §§ 292.11 to 292.13 are to:
            (1) Prohibit new commercial or industrial uses other than those which the Secretary considers to be consistent with the purposes of the act establishing the national recreation area; (2) promote the protection and development of properties in keeping with the purposes of that Act by means of use, acreage, setback, density, height or other requirements; and (3) provide that the Secretary receive notice of any variance granted under, or any exception made to, the application of the zoning ordinance approved by him.
            (e) Following promulgation of §§ 292.11 to 292.13 of final form, the Secretary is required to approve any zoning ordinance or any amendment to an approved zoning ordinance submitted to him which conforms to the standards contained in the regulations in effect at the time of adoption of the ordinance or amendment.
            (f) Any owner of unimproved property who proposes to develop his property for service to the public may submit to the Secretary a development plan setting forth the manner in which and the time by which the property is to be developed and the use to which it is proposed to be put. If the Secretary determines that the development and the use of the property conforms to approved zoning ordinances, and serves the purposes of the National Recreation Area and that the property is not needed for easements and rights-of-way for access, utilities, or facilities, or for administration sites, campgrounds, or other areas needed for use by the United States for visitors, he may in his discretion issue to such owner a certification that so long as the property is developed, maintained, and used in conformity with approved zoning ordinances the Secretary's authority to acquire the property without the owner's consent is suspended.
          
          
            § 292.12
            General provisions; procedures.
            (a) Approval of zoning ordinance and development plans. (1) All validly adopted zoning ordinances and amendments thereto pertaining to the Shasta and Clair Engle-Lewiston Units may be submitted by the county of origin to the Secretary for written approval relative to their conformance with the applicable standards of §§ 292.11 to 292.13. Within 60 days following submission, the county will be notified of the Secretary's approval or disapproval of the zoning ordinances or amendments thereto. If more than 60 days are required, the county will be notified of the expected delay and of the additional time deemed necessary to reach a decision. The Secretary's approval shall remain effective so long as the zoning ordinances or amendments thereto remain in effect as approved.
            (2) Development plans pertaining to unimproved property within the Shasta and Clair Engle-Lewiston Units may be submitted by the owner to the Secretary for determination as to whether they conform with approved zoning ordinances and whether the planned use and development would serve the Act. Within 30 days following submission of such plans the Secretary will approve or disapprove the plans or, if more than 30 days are required, will notify the applicant of the expected delay and of the additional time deemed necessary.
            (b) Amendment of ordinances. Amendments of approved ordinances may be furnished in advance of their adoption to the Secretary for written decision as to their conformance with applicable standards of §§ 292.11 to 292.13.
            (c) Variances or exceptions to application of ordinances. (1) The Secretary shall be given written notice of any variance granted under, or any exception made to, the application of a zoning ordinance or amendment thereto approved by him.

            (2) The County, or private owners of improved property, may submit to the Secretary proposed variances or exceptions to the application of an approved zoning ordinance or amendment thereto for written advice as to whether the intended use will make the property subject to acquisition without the owner's consent. Within 30 days following his receipt of such a request, the Secretary will advise the interested party or parties as to his determination. If more than 30 days are required by the Secretary for such determination, he shall so notify the interested party or parties stating the additional time required and the reasons therefore.
            (d) Certification of property. Where improvements and land use of improved property conform with approved ordinances, or with approved variances from such ordinances, certification that the Secretary's authority to acquire the property without the owner's consent is suspended may be obtained by any party in interest upon request to the Secretary. Where the development and use of unimproved property for service to the public is approved by the Secretary, certification that the authority to acquire the property without the owner's consent is suspended may be issued to the owner.
            (e) Effect of noncompliance. Suspension of the Secretary's authority to acquire any improved property without the owner's consent will automatically cease if: (1) Such property is made the subject of variance or exception to any applicable zoning ordinance that does not conform to the applicable standard in the Secretary's regulation, (2) such property is put to a use which does not conform to any applicable zoning ordinance, or, as to property approved by the Secretary for development, a use which does not conform to the approved development plan or (3) the local zoning agency does not have in force a duly adopted, valid zoning ordinance that is approved by the Secretary in accordance with the standards of §§ 292.11 to 292.13.
            (f) Nonconforming commercial or industrial uses. Any existing commercial or industrial uses not in conformance with approved zoning ordinances shall be discontinued within 10 years from the date such ordinances are approved: Provided, however, That with the approval of the Secretary such 10-year period may be extended by the county for a prescribed period sufficient to allow the owner reasonable additional time to amortize investments made in the property before November 8, 1965.
          
          
            § 292.13
            Standards.
            (a) The standards set forth in §§ 292.11-292.13 shall apply to the Shasta and Clair Engle-Lewiston Units, which are defined by the boundary descriptions in the notice of the Secretary of Agriculture of July 12, 1966 (31 FR 9469), and to a strip of land outside the National Recreation Area on either side of Federal Aid Secondary Highway Numbered 1089, as more fully described in 2(a) of the act establishing the recreation area (79 Stat. 1296).
            (b) New industrial or commercial uses. New industrial or commercial uses will be prohibited in any location except under the following conditions:
            (1) The industrial use is such that its operation, physical structures, or waste byproducts would not have significant adverse impacts on surrounding or nearby outdoor recreation, scenic and esthetic values. Industrial uses having an adverse impact include, but are not limited to, cement production, gravel extraction operations involving more than one-fourth acre of surface, smelters, sand, gravel and aggregate processing plants, fabricating plants, pulpmills, and commercial livestock feeder yards.
            (2)(i) The commercial use is for purposes of providing food, lodging, automotive or marine maintenance facilities and services to accommodate recreationists and the intended land occupancy and physical structures are such that they can be harmonized with adjacent land development and surrounding appearances in accordance with approved plans and schedules.
            (ii) This standard provides for privately owned and operated businesses whose purposes and physical structures are in keeping with objectives for use and maintenance of the area's outdoor recreation resources. It precludes establishment of drive-in theaters, zoos, and similar nonconforming types of commercial entertainment.
            (c) Protection of roadsides. Provisions to protect natural scenic qualities and maintain screening along public travel routes will include:

            (1) Prohibition of new structural improvements or visible utility lines within a strip of land extending back not less than 150 feet from both sides of the centerline of any public road or roadway except roads within subdivisions or commercial areas. In addition to buildings, this prohibition pertains to above-ground power and telephone lines, borrow pits, gravel, or earth extraction areas, and quarries.
            (2) Retention of trees and shrubs in the above-prescribed roadside strips to the full extent that is compatible with needs for public safety and road maintenance. Wholesale clearing by chemical or other means for fire control and other purposes will not be practiced under this standard.
            (d) Protection of shorelines. Provisions to protect scenic qualities and reduce potentials for pollution of public reservoirs will include: Prohibition of structures within 300 feet horizontal distance from highwater lines of reservoirs other than structures the purpose of which is to service and accommodate boating or to facilitate picnicking and swimming: Provided, That exceptions to this standard may be made upon showing satisfactory to the Secretary that proposed structures will not conflict with scenic and antipollution considerations.
            (e) Property development. Location and development of structures will conform with the following minimum standards:
            (1) Commercial development. (i) Stores, restaurants, garages, service stations, and comparable business enterprises will be situated in centers zoned for this purpose unless they are operated as part of a resort or hotel. Commercial centers will be of sufficient size that expansion of facilities or service areas is not dependent upon use of public land.
            (ii) Sites outside designated commercial centers will be used for resort development contingent upon case by case concurrence of the responsible county officials and the Secretary that such use is, in all aspects, compatible with the purposes for establishing the recreation area.
            (iii) Structures for commercial purposes, inclusive of isolated resorts or motels, will not exceed two stories height at front elevation, and will be conventional architecture and will utilize colors, nonglare roofing materials, and spacing or layout that harmonizes with forested settings. Except for signs, structures designed primarily for purposes of calling attention to products or service will not be permitted.
            (2) Residential development. (i) Locations approved for residential development will be buffered by distance, topography, or forest cover from existing or planned public use areas such as trailer parks, campgrounds, or organization sites. Separation will be sufficient to avoid conflicts resulting from intervisibility, noise, and proximity that is conducive to private property trespass.

            (ii) Requirements for approval of residential areas will include: (a) Construction of access when main access would otherwise be limited to a road constructed by the United States primarily to service publicly owned recreation developments; (b) limitation of residences to single-family units situated at a density not exceeding two per acre, but any lot of less than a half-acre may be used for residential purposes if, on or before promulgation of §§ 292.11-292.13, such lot was in separate ownership or was delineated in a county-approved plat that constitutes part of a duly recorded subdivision; (c) use of set-backs, limitations to natural terrain, neutral exterior colors, nonglare roofing materials, and limitations of building heights fully adequate to harmonize housing development with the objective of the National Recreation Area as set forth in the act.
            (3) Signs and signing. Only those signs may be permitted which: (i) Do not exceed 1 square foot in area for any residential use; (ii) do not exceed 40 square feet in area, 8 feet in length, and 15 feet maximum height from ground for any other use, including advertisement of the sale or rental of property; and (iii) which are not illuminated by any neon or flashing device. Commercial signs may be placed only on the property on which the advertised use occurs, or on the property which is advertised for sale or rental. Signs shall be subdued in appearance, harmonizing in design and color with the surroundings and shall not be attached to any tree or shrub. Nonconforming signs may continue for a period not to exceed 2 years from the date a zoning ordinance containing these limitations is adopted.

            § 292.15
            General provisions—procedures.
            (a) Classification of private property. For the purpose of establishing specific standards applicable to the several parcels of private land within the boundaries, such properties are classified and assigned to land use categories as shown on the Land Use Category Map, dated December 15, 1973, as amended July 16, 1976, on file and available for public inspection in the office of the Area Ranger, Sawtooth National Recreation Area, Ketchum, Idaho. The classification of private properties is based on evaluation of scenic, natural, historic, pastoral, wildlife, and other values.
            (b) Land use categories. Land use categories shown on the map referred to in paragraph (a) of this section are:
            (1) Designated community. All properties inside a designated community.
            (2) Residential. Areas for residential development outside designated communities.
            (3) Commercial. Areas for commercial development outside designated communities.
            (4) Agriculture. All properties outside designated communities not placed in a residential or commercial land use category.
            (5) Mineral. Any areas in the land use in paragraphs (b) (1) through (4) of this section, used for mineral operations.
            (c) Changes in classification. The Secretary may make changes in the classification of private lands set forth in paragraph (a) of this section by incorporating such changes in an amendment of these regulations.
            (d) Certification of compliance with standards—(1) Present use. Any owner of property may request in writing the Area Ranger to examine the present use of the property and issue a certification that such present use conforms to the applicable standards established in § 292.16 for the land use category in which the property is placed. If after examination the Area Ranger determines that the present use of the property does so conform, he will issue a certification to this effect.
            (2) Planned development or change in use. Any owner of property who proposes to change the use or develop his property for other than agricultural use may submit to the Area Ranger a use or development plan setting forth the manner in which and the time by which the property is to be developed and the use to which the property is to be put. If the Area Ranger determines that the development and use plan conforms to the applicable standards established in § 292.16 for the land use category in which the property is placed, he will issue a certification to this effect.
            (3) Notification of action. Within 45 days after receipt of request for certification, the Area Ranger shall:
            (i) Issue the certification.
            (ii) Notify applicant that additional information is needed before action can be taken on the application.
            (iii) Notify applicant that certification is denied, and reasons for denial.
            (iv) Notify applicant that action on the request is deferred for a specified period of time for stated reasons.
            (e) Qualified certifications. (1) Any owner of a property classified residential or commercial under paragraph (a) of this section which had been improved and was being used for residential or commercial purposes on the effective date of these regulations, but which does not conform to the standards established for properties in the land use category in which the property is placed may nevertheless be issued a certification for period not to exceed 10 years so that the improvements may be made to conform to the standards. Such certification shall specify that it is only effective so long as the property is not subdivided, and is not further improved and the improvements existing on the effective date of these regulations, are not reconstructed, altered or relocated, except to meet standards. The certification shall specify the date on which it shall terminate.
            (2) If the Area Ranger determines, prior to certification, that a part or all of a property, for which a request for certification is made, is needed for access to and utilization of public property or for recreation and other facilities, he may except from the certification that part of the property needed for these purposes.
            (f) Revocation of certification. The Area Ranger will revoke a certification when he finds that the property is being used or developed not in conformance with the terms of the certification or the applicable standards established in § 292.16 or is in imminent danger of being so used or developed. Notice of such revocation will be in writing and delivered to the owner in person or by certified mail. A partial revocation may be made when a portion of a property covered by a certification is determined to be needed for access to and utilization of public property or for recreation and other facilities.
            
            (g) Effect of certification. Property for which a certification is held by the owner shall not be acquired by the Secretary by condemnation.
            (h) Effect of noncompliance with standards. Property for which a determination has been made that it is being used or developed not in conformance with the applicable standards established in § 292.16 for the land use category in which the property is placed may be acquired by the Secretary by condemnation.
            (i) Acquisition by negotiated purchase. (1) Any privately owned land or interest in land determined by the Secretary to be needed in furtherance of the objectives and purposes for which the Sawtooth National Recreation Area was established may be acquired by negotiated purchase subject only to the limitation in paragraph (j) of this section.
            (2) Property which has been developed for use prior to the effective date of these regulations, but which is not in conformance with applicable standards may be acquired by the Secretary through negotiated purchase and the Secretary may permit the owners, their successors or assigns to retain a right of use and occupancy of the improved property for a definite term not beyond December 31, 1988.
            (j) Limitation on acquisitions. Acquisitions of lands or interests therein for access to and utilization of public property and for recreation and other facilities shall not exceed 5 percent of the total acreage of all private property within the Sawtooth National Recreation Area on August 22, 1972. A land acquisition plan shall be prepared by the Area Ranger and approved by the Regional Forester showing those properties needed for access to and utilization of public property or for recreation and other facilities. Said plan may be revised from time to time upon approval by the Regional Forester. Said plan shall be available for inspection by the public in the office of the Area Ranger.
            (k) Land exchanges. Some parcels of Federal lands within the Sawtooth National Recreation Area are classified or may be subsequently classified in the overall general plan for the Recreation Area as suitable for selection through land exchange. Using existing land exchange authorities, these Federal lands may be made available for selection by parties owning land within the boundaries of the National Recreation Area to resolve some existing or potential land use conflicts. The values of the properties so exchanged shall be approximately equal, or, if they are not approximately equal, they shall be equalized by the payment of cash. Federal lands which may be located within the boundaries of designated communities will be considered for exchange only after acceptable community development plans and ordinances have been implemented.
            (l) Appeals. Denial or revocation of a certification of compliance under this subpart is subject to appeal under 36 CFR part 214.
            (m) Judicial review. The United States District Court for the District of Idaho shall have jurisdiction to review these regulations upon a compliant filed within 6 months after the effective date of these regulations, by any affected landowner in an action for a declaratory judgment as provided in the Act of August 22, 1972 (86 Stat. 612), section 4(a).

            § 292.18
            Mineral resources.
            (a) Occupancy. No unpatented mining claim may be used or occupied, except as otherwise permitted for any purpose other than exploration, mining, or processing operations and uses reasonably incident thereto.
            (b) Letter of authorization. A letter of authorization with the posting of an appropriate bond is required prior to conducting operations in the SNRA.
            (c) Operating plan. A proposed operating plan must be filed with the Area Ranger prior to conducting any operations and prior to construction, reconstruction, improvement or maintenance of roads and trails, bridges, or other facilities for access within the SNRA; provided, that an operating plan is not required for—
            (1) Operations which only involve vehicular travel on existing roads open to public use;
            (2) Marking and/or reestablishing claims corners;
            (3) Sampling and exploration work which will not cause significant damage to surface resources and will not involve the removal of more than 100 pounds of material for analysis and study, provided the Area Ranger has prior notice of such activities; or

            (d) Operating plan—requirements. Each operating plan shall include:
            (1) The names and mailing addresses of operators and their agents, along with a statement of ownership and/or authorization under which the operation is to be conducted, and including a copy of the location notice(s), proof of assessment labor, and quit claim deeds if ownership has changed within the assessment year.
            (2) A map or sketch showing information sufficient to locate the proposed area of operations on the ground, existing and/or proposed roads or access routes to be used in connection with the operations and the approximate location and size of areas where surface resources will be disturbed.
            (3) Information describing the nature of operations proposed and how they will be conducted, the type and standard of existing and proposed roads or access routes, the means of transportation to be used, the period during which the proposed operations will take place, and measures to be taken for protecting the values of the SNRA and reclaiming the lands.
            (e) Operating plan—approval. (1) The Area Ranger shall promptly acknowledge receipt of any operating plan to the operator. The Area Ranger shall review the environmental effects and conduct a technical examination of each proposed operating plan.

            The technical examination shall identify the resources and the land uses in the area of operations. The Area Ranger shall use the current General Management Plan of the SNRA and the Final Environmental Statement as guides in determining whether the proposed operations may result in substantial impairment of the values of the SNRA. In his review, the Area Ranger may solicit comments from the general public and/or other government agencies in analysis of environmental effects. In his review, the Area Ranger will consider the compatibility of the proposed operating plan with the Act and the General Management Plan. The Area Ranger may not approve an operating plan for an identical claimed area to more than one operator.
            (2) Within 30 working days of receipt of a proposed operating plan, the Area Ranger shall take one of the following actions:
            (i) Notify the operator that the operating plan has been approved as submitted; or,
            (ii) Notify the operator that the operating plan has been approved as subject to the operator accepting the changes or conditions deemed necessary by the Area Ranger; or,
            (iii) Notify the operator that more time is necessary to review the plan because of the need to prepare an environmental impact statement, or conduct a cultural resource survey, or other stated reasons; in such cases, the operator will be notified of the approximate time needed to complete the review; or,
            (iv) Notify the operator of an apparent conflict of ownership and that additional proof of ownership is required; or,
            (v) Notify the operator that the operating plan as submitted is inadequate to support any conclusion as to substantial impairment, and that additional information will be required; or,
            (vi) Notify the operator that the operating plan is not approved since such operations as specified in the plan would create substantial impairment.
            (f) Operating plans—suspension, revocation, or modification. The authorized officer may suspend or revoke authorization to operate in whole or in part where such operations are causing substantial impairment which cannot be mitigated. At any time during operations under an approved operating plan, the operator may be required to modify the operating plan to minimize or avoid substantial impairment of the values of the SNRA.
            (g) Bond requirements. (1) An operator shall furnish a bond, in the amount determined by the Area Ranger to be appropriate for reclamation of the disturbed surface area, prior to the commencement of operations. In lieu of a bond, the operator may deposit into a Federal depository, as directed by the Forest Service, cash in an amount equal to the required dollar amount of the bond or negotiable securities of the United States having market value at the time of deposit or not less than the required dollar amount of the bond.
            (2) When the reclamation of the project, or portions thereof, has been completed, the operator will notify the Area Ranger who will examine the area to determine whether the reclamation is acceptable. When the Area Ranger has accepted as completed any portion of the reclamation, he shall reduce proportionately the amount of bond thereafter to be required with respect to the remaining reclamation. However, the operator will not be released from liability under the bond for the amount which may be necessary to revegetate each planting area for a minimum period of at least 5 years after the first efforts at revegetation if those initial efforts are unsuccessful.
            (3) If the Area Ranger determines that revegetation is likely to occur before the expiration of such minimum period, he may release the operator from the extended liability under the bond for revegetation of planting area.
            (h) Access. The operator shall permit free and unrestricted public access to and through lands included within an unpatented mining claim for all lawful and proper purposes. In areas where such access would unduly interfere with authorized operations or would constitute a hazard to public health and safety, public use may be restricted with prior approval of the Area Ranger.

          Subpart E—Hells Canyon National Recreation Area—Private Lands
          
            Authority:
            89 Stat. 1117; 16 U.S.C. 460gg-460gg-13.
          
          
            Source:
            59 FR 30497, June 13, 1994, unless otherwise noted.
          
          
            § 292.20
            Purpose and scope.
            (a) Purpose. The Act establishing the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area (hereafter referred to as HCNRA) (16 U.S.C. 460gg-460gg-13) encourages the retention of traditional and valid uses of private land within the HCNRA, such as ranching, grazing, farming, timber harvesting, and the occupation of homes and lands associated therewith, as they existed at the time the HCNRA was established on December 31, 1975. To this end, the Act directs the Secretary of Agriculture to promulgate regulations establishing standards for the use and development of private land within the HCNRA and grants the Secretary limited condemnation authority to address situations where the standards are not met. The purpose of this subpart is to establish standards that would guide the Secretary's consideration of the use of the limited condemnation authority granted by the Act.
            (b) Scope. The regulations in this subpart establish standards applicable to all private property within the boundaries of the HCNRA, including that within the boundaries of the Rapid, Snake, and Imnaha Wild and Scenic Rivers and the Hells Canyon Wilderness. The regulations in this subpart do not operate to restrict the use and development of private property; rather, they serve to inform the landowner of those uses that are compatible with purposes for which the HCNRA was established. Uses not compatible with these standards could result in the Secretary acquiring land or interests therein without a landowner's consent.
            The regulations in this subpart, in and of themselves, do not effect a taking of private property, including valid, existing water rights, nor do the standards established in this subpart limit or restrict a private landowner's property use that is compatible with the purposes of the Act. The Responsible Official may use the regulations in this subpart solely to determine whether private land uses or developments are compatible with the purposes and direction of the Act and, if not, to determine whether the Secretary should consider initiating condemnation proceedings to acquire land or scenic easements.
          
          
            § 292.21
            Definitions.

The Ranger shall give notice of the availability of this map or maps in the local newspapers of record.
            (b) Changes in land category assignment. Lands assigned to the Commercial, Residential, or Mining category may be reclassified as farm/forest/grazing land so long as the intended use or development is consistent with the standards in § 292.23 and the Ranger has given public notice of the proposed change in the local newspaper of record and has notified adjacent landowners and the affected county government at least 30 days prior to any decision on the proposed change.
          
          
            § 292.23
            Standards of compatible land use and development.
            Private land use that conforms to the standards of this section is deemed to be compatible with the purpose for which the HCNRA was established.
            (a) Standards applicable to all private lands. As of June 13, 1994, the use and development of private lands in all land categories within the HCNRA is deemed compatible with the purposes for which the HCNRA was established, if the use and development of such lands meets the following standards:
            (1) Use and development conforms to applicable local, state, and federal environmental, natural resource, cultural resource, and land use development law.
            (2) All new or replacement structures are screened and/or constructed of materials that blend with the natural environment, except where structures typify the architectural style and materials of a significant historic era such as pre-World War II. Screening is not required, however, for new or replacement structures that are associated with an existing unscreened structure or structures that were not screened at the time this rule became effective.
            (3) No public or commercial solid waste disposal sites or hazardous substance disposal sites are located on private lands within the HCNRA.
            (4) All new or replacement utility lines are placed underground where ground conditions and topography permit. This standard does not prevent or impair routine maintenance of utility lines or related structures in existence prior to June 13, 1994.

              (b) Information to support valid existing rights. A proposed plan of operations within the SRNRA must include at least the following information on the existence of valid existing rights:
              (1) The mining claim recordation serial number assigned by the Bureau of Land Management;
              (2) A copy of the original location notice and conveyance deeds, if ownership has changed since the date of location;
              (3) A copy of affidavits of assessment work or notices of intention to hold the mining claim since the date of recordation with the Bureau of Land Management;
              (4) Verification by the Bureau of Land Management that the holding or maintenance fees have been paid or have been exempted;
              (5) Sketches or maps showing the location of past and present mineral workings on the claims and information sufficient to locate and define the mining claim corners and boundaries on the ground;
              (6) An identification of the valuable mineral that has been discovered;
              (7) An identification of the site within the claims where the deposit has been discovered and exposed;
              (8) Information on the quantity and quality of the deposit including copies of assays or test reports, the width, locations of veins, the size and extent of any deposit; and
              (9) Existing evidence of past and present sales of the valuable mineral.
              (c) Minimum information on proposed operations. In addition to the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, a plan of operations must include the information required at §§ 228.4 (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this chapter which includes information about the proponent and a detailed description of the proposed operation. In addition, if the operator and claim owner are different, the operator must submit a copy of the authorization or agreement under which the proposed operations are to be conducted. A plan of operations must also address the environmental requirements of § 228.8 of this chapter which includes reclamation. In addition, a plan of operations also must include the following:
              (1) An identification of the hazardous materials and any other toxic materials, petroleum products, insecticides, pesticides, and herbicides that will be used during the mineral operation, and the proposed means for disposing of such substances;
              (2) An identification of the character and composition of the mineral wastes that will be used or generated and a proposed method or strategy for their placement, control, isolation, or removal; and
              (3) An identification of how public health and safety are to be maintained.
            
            
              § 292.64
              Plan of operations—approval.
              (a) Timeframe for review. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of § 292.62 of this subpart, upon receipt of a plan of operations, the authorized officer shall review the information related to valid existing rights and notify the operator in writing within 60 days of one of the following situations:
              (1) That sufficient information on valid existing rights has been provided and the anticipated date by which the valid existing rights determination will be completed, which shall not be more than 2 years after the date of notification; unless the authorized officer, upon finding of good cause with written notice and explanation to the operator, extends the time period for completion of the valid existing rights determination.

              (2) That the operator has failed to provide sufficient information to review a claim of valid existing rights and, therefore, the authorized officer has no obligation to evaluate whether the operator has valid existing rights or to process the operator's proposed plan of operations.
              
              (b)(1) If the authorized officer concludes that there is not sufficient evidence of valid existing rights, the officer shall so notify the operator in writing of the reasons for the determination, inform the operator that the proposed mineral operation cannot be conducted, advise the operator that the Forest Service will promptly notify the Bureau of Land Management of the determination and request the initiation of a mineral contest action against the pertinent mining claim, and advise the operator that further consideration of the proposed plan of operations is suspended pending final action by the Department of the Interior on the operator's claim of valid existing rights and any final judicial review thereof.
              (2) If the authorized officer concludes that there is not sufficient evidence of valid existing rights, the authorized officer also shall notify promptly the Bureau of Land Management of the determination and request the initiation of a mineral contest action against the pertinent mining claims.
              (c) An authorized officer's decision pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section that there is not sufficient evidence of valid existing rights is not subject to further agency or Department of Agriculture review or administrative appeal.
              (d) The authorized officer shall notify the operator in writing that the review of the remainder of the proposed plan will proceed if:
              (1) The authorized officer concludes that there is sufficient evidence of valid existing rights;
              (2) Final agency action by the Department of the Interior determines that the applicable mining claim constitutes a valid existing right; or
              (3) Final judicial review of final agency action by the Department of the Interior finds that the applicable mining claim constitutes a valid existing right.
              (e) Upon completion of the review of the plan of operations, the authorized officer shall ensure that the minimum information required by § 292.63(c) of this subpart has been addressed and, pursuant to § 228.5(a) of this chapter, notify the operator in writing whether or not the plan of operations is approved.
              (f) If the plan of operations is not approved, the authorized officer shall explain in writing why the plan of operations cannot be approved.
              (g) If the plan of operations is approved, the authorized officer shall establish a time period for the proposed operations which shall be for the minimum amount of time reasonably necessary for a prudent operator to complete the mineral development activities covered by the approved plan of operations.
              (h) An approved plan of operations is subject to review and modification as follows:
              (1) To bring the plan into conformance with changes in applicable federal law or regulation; or
              (2) To respond to new information not available at the time the authorized officer approved the plan, for example, new listings of threatened or endangered species; or
              (3) To correct errors or omissions made at the time the plan was approved, for example, to ensure compliance with applicable federal law or regulation; or
              (4) To permit operations requested by the operator that differ in type, scope, or duration from those in an approved plan of operations but that are not subject to paragraph (i) of this section.
              (i) If an operator desires to conduct operations that differ in type, scope, or duration from those in an approved plan of operations, and if those changes will result in resource impacts not anticipated when the original plan was approved, the operator must submit a supplemental plan or a modification of the plan for review and approval.
            
            
              § 292.65
              Plan of operations—suspension.
              (a) The authorized officer may suspend mineral operations due to an operator's noncompliance with applicable statutes, regulations, or terms and conditions of the approved plan of operations.

              (1) In those cases that present a threat of imminent harm to public health, safety, or the environment, or where such harm is already occurring, the authorized officer may take immediate action to stop the threat or damage without prior notice. In such case, written notice and explanation of the action taken shall be given the operator as soon as reasonably practicable following the suspension.
              (2) In those cases that do not present a threat of imminent harm to public health, safety, or the environment, the authorized officer must first notify the operator in writing of the basis for the suspension and provide the operator with reasonably sufficient time to respond to the notice of the authorized officer or to bring the mineral operations into conformance with applicable laws, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the approved plan of operations.
              (b) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the authorized officer shall notify the operator not less than 30 days prior to the date of the proposed suspension.

            Suitable areas of national forest land, other than wilderness or wild areas, which should be managed principally for recreation use may be given special classification as follows:

            (a) Areas which should be managed principally for recreation use substantially in their natural condition and on which, in the discretion of the officer making the classification, certain other uses may or may not be permitted may be approved and classified by the Chief of the Forest Service or by such officers as he may designate if the particular area is less than 100,000 acres. Areas of 100,000 acres or more will be approved and classified by the Secretary of Agriculture.
            
            (b) Areas which should be managed for public recreation requiring development and substantial improvements may be given special classification as public recreation areas. Areas in single tracts of not more than 160 acres may be approved and classified by the Chief of the Forest Service or by such officers as he may designate. Areas in excess of 160 acres will be classified by the Secretary of Agriculture. Classification hereunder may include areas used or selected to be used for the development and maintenance as camp grounds, picnic grounds, organization camps, resorts, public service sites (such as for restaurants, filling stations, stores, horse and boat liveries, garages, and similar types of public service accommodations), bathing beaches, winter sports areas, lodges, and similar facilities and appurtenant structures needed by the public to enjoy the recreation resources of the national forests. The boundaries of all areas so classified shall be clearly marked on the ground and notices of such classification shall be posted at conspicuous places thereon. Areas classified under this section shall thereby be set apart and reserved for public recreation use and such classification shall constitute a formal closing of the area to any use or occupancy inconsistent with the classification.

            Road construction and reconstruction in Idaho Roadless Areas.
            (a) Wild Land Recreation, Special Areas of Historic or Tribal Significance, or Primitive. Road construction and reconstruction are prohibited in Idaho Roadless Areas designated as Wild Land Recreation, Special Areas of Historic or Tribal Significance, or Primitive. However, the Regional Forester may authorize a road to be constructed or reconstructed in an area designated as Wild Land Recreation, Special Area of Historic or Tribal Significance, or Primitive if pursuant to statute, treaty, reserved or outstanding rights, or other legal duty of the United States.
            (b) Backcountry/Restoration. (1) Road construction and reconstruction are only permissible in Idaho Roadless Areas designated as Backcountry/Restoration where the Regional Forester determines:
            (i) A road is needed to protect public health and safety in cases of an imminent threat of flood, wildland fire, or other catastrophic event that, without intervention, would cause the loss of life or property;
            (ii) A road is needed to conduct a response action under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) or to conduct a natural resource restoration action under CERCLA, section 311 of the Clean Water Act, or the Oil Pollution Act;
            (iii) A road is needed pursuant to statute, treaty, reserved or outstanding rights, or other legal duty of the United States;
            (iv) A road realignment is needed to prevent irreparable resource damage that arises from the design, location, use, or deterioration of a road and cannot be mitigated by road maintenance. Road realignment may occur under this subsection only if the road is deemed essential for public or private access, natural resource management, or public health and safety;
            (v) Road reconstruction is needed to implement a road safety improvement project on a road determined to be hazardous based on accident experience or accident potential on that road; or
            (vi) The Secretary of Agriculture determines that a Federal Aid Highway project, authorized pursuant to Title 23 of the United States Code, is in the public interest or is consistent with the purpose for which the land was reserved or acquired and no other reasonable and prudent alternative exists.
            (2) A responsible official may authorize temporary road construction or road reconstruction for community protection zone activities pursuant to § 294.24(c)(1)(i) if in the official's judgment the community protection objectives cannot be reasonably accomplished without a temporary road.
            (3) The Regional Forester may approve temporary road construction or road reconstruction to reduce hazardous fuel conditions outside a community protection zone where in the Regional Forester's judgment the circumstances set out below exist. Temporary road construction or road reconstruction to reduce hazardous fuel conditions under this provision will be dependent on forest type and is expected to be infrequent.

            (i) There is a significant risk that a wildland fire disturbance event could adversely affect an at-risk community or municipal water supply system pursuant to § 294.24(c)(1)(ii). A significant risk exists where the history of fire occurrence, and fire hazard and risk, indicate a serious likelihood that a wildland fire disturbance event would present a high risk of threat to an at-risk community or municipal water supply system.
            (ii) The activity cannot be reasonably accomplished without a temporary road.
            (iii) The activity will maintain or improve one or more roadless characteristics over the long-term.

            § 294.42
            Prohibition on tree cutting, sale, or removal.
            (a) General. Trees may not be cut, sold, or removed in Colorado Roadless Areas, except as provided in paragraph (b) and (c) of this section.
            (b) Upper Tier Acres. Notwithstanding the prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section, trees may be cut, sold, or removed in Colorado Roadless Areas upper tier acres if the responsible official determines the activity is consistent with the applicable land management plan, and:
            (1) Tree cutting, sale, or removal is incidental to the implementation of a management activity not otherwise prohibited by this subpart; or
            (2) Tree cutting, sale, or removal is needed and appropriate for personal or administrative use, as provided for in 36 CFR part 223, subpart A.
            (c) Non-Upper Tier Acres. Notwithstanding the prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section, trees may be cut, sold, or removed in Colorado Roadless Areas outside upper tier acres if the responsible official, unless otherwise noted, determines the activity is consistent with the applicable land management plan, one or more of the roadless area characteristics will be maintained or improved over the long-term with the exception of paragraph (5) and (6) of this section, and one of the following circumstances exists:
            (1) The Regional Forester determines tree cutting, sale, or removal is needed to reduce hazardous fuels to an at-risk community or municipal water supply system that is:
            (i) Within the first one-half mile of the community protection zone, or
            (ii) Within the next one-mile of the community protection zone, and is within an area identified in a Community Wildfire Protection Plan.
            (iii) Projects undertaken pursuant to paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section will focus on cutting and removing generally small diameter trees to create fuel conditions that modify fire behavior while retaining large trees to the maximum extent practical as appropriate to the forest type.
            (2) The Regional Forester determines tree cutting, sale, or removal is needed outside the community protection zone where there is a significant risk that a wildland fire disturbance event could adversely affect a municipal water supply system or the maintenance of that system. A significant risk exists where the history of fire occurrence, and fire hazard and risk indicate a serious likelihood that a wildland fire disturbance event would present a high risk of threat to a municipal water supply system.
            (i) Projects will focus on cutting and removing generally small diameter trees to create fuel conditions that modify fire behavior while retaining large trees to the maximum extent practical as appropriate to the forest type.
            (ii) Projects are expected to be infrequent.
            (3) Tree cutting, sale, or removal is needed to maintain or restore the characteristics of ecosystem composition, structure and processes. These projects are expected to be infrequent.
            (4) Tree cutting, sale, or removal is needed to improve habitat for federally threatened, endangered, proposed, or Agency designated sensitive species; in coordination with the Colorado Department of Natural Resources, including the Colorado Division of Parks and Wildlife.
            (5) Tree cutting, sale, or removal is incidental to the implementation of a management activity not otherwise prohibited by this subpart.
            (6) Tree cutting, sale, or removal is needed and appropriate for personal or administrative use, as provided for in 36 CFR part 223, subpart A.
          
          
            § 294.43
            Prohibition on road construction and reconstruction.
            (a) General. A road may not be constructed or reconstructed in a Colorado Roadless Area except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
            (b) Upper Tier Acres. Notwithstanding the prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section, a road may only be constructed or reconstructed in Colorado Roadless Area upper tier acres if the responsible official determines that the conditions in subsection 1 or 2 are met.
            (1) A road is needed pursuant to reserved or outstanding rights, or as provided for by statute or treaty, or
            (2) A road is needed to protect public health and safety in cases of an imminent threat of flood, fire or other catastrophic event that, without intervention, would cause the loss of life or property.

            (3) For any road construction/reconstruction authorized pursuant to this provision, subject to the legal rights identified in 36 CFR 294.43(b)(1), the responsible official must determine:
            (i) Motorized access, without road construction is not feasible;
            (ii) When proposing to construct a forest road, that a temporary road would not provide reasonable access;
            (iii) Road construction is consistent with the applicable land management plan direction;
            (iv) Within a native cutthroat trout catchment or identified recovery watershed, road construction will not diminish, over the long-term, conditions in the water influence zone and the extent of the occupied native cutthroat trout habitat; and
            (v) That watershed conservation practices will be applied to all projects occurring in native cutthroat trout habitat.
            (c) Non-Upper Tier Acres. Notwithstanding the prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section, a road or temporary road may only be constructed or reconstructed in Colorado Roadless Areas outside upper tier acres if the responsible official determines:
            (1) That one of the following exceptions exists:
            (i) A road is needed pursuant to reserved or outstanding rights, or as provided for by statute or treaty;
            (ii) Road realignment is needed to prevent irreparable resource damage that arises from the design, location, use, or deterioration of a forest road and that cannot be mitigated by road maintenance. Road realignment may occur under this paragraph only if the road is deemed essential for administrative or public access, public health and safety, or uses authorized under permit, easement or other legal instrument;
            (iii) Road reconstruction is needed to implement a road safety improvement project on a forest road determined to be hazardous on the basis of accident experience or accident potential on that road;
            (iv) The Regional Forester determines a road or temporary road is needed to allow for the construction, reconstruction, or maintenance of an authorized water conveyance structure which is operated pursuant to a pre-existing water court decree with the use of the road limited to the water right identified in the pre-existing water court decree (see also § 294.44(b)(2));
            (v) A temporary road is needed to protect public health and safety in cases of imminent threat of flood, fire, or other catastrophic event that, without intervention, would cause the loss of life or property;
            (vi) The Regional Forester determines a temporary road is needed to facilitate tree cutting, sale, or removal (§ 294.42(c)(1)) within the first one-half mile of the community protection zone to reduce the wildfire hazard to an at-risk community or municipal water supply system;
            (vii) The Regional Forester determines a temporary road is needed to facilitate tree cutting, sale, or removal (§ 294.42(c)(3)) within the first one-half mile of the community protection zone to maintain or restore characteristics of ecosystem composition, structure and processes;
            (viii) A temporary road is needed within a Colorado Roadless Area pursuant to the exploration or development of an existing oil and gas lease that does not prohibit road construction or reconstruction, including the construction of infrastructure necessary to transport the product, on National Forest System lands that are under lease issued by the Secretary of the Interior as of July 3, 2012. The Forest Service shall not authorize the Bureau of Land Management to grant any request for a waiver, exception, or modification to any oil or gas lease if doing so would result in any road construction within a Colorado Roadless Area beyond that which was authorized by the terms and conditions of the lease at the time of issuance; or

            (ix) A temporary road is needed for coal exploration and/or coal-related surface activities for certain lands with Colorado Roadless Areas within the North Fork Coal Mining Area of the Grand Mesa, Uncompahgre, and Gunnison National Forests as defined by the North Fork Coal Mining Area displayed on the final Colorado Roadless Areas map. Such roads may also be used for collecting and transporting coal mine methane. Any buried infrastructure, including pipelines, needed for the capture, collection, and use of coal mine methane, will be located within the rights-of-way of temporary roads that are otherwise necessary for coal-related surface activities including the installation and operation of methane venting wells.
            (2) If proposed road construction/reconstruction meets one of the exceptions, subject to the legal rights identified in § 294.43(c)(1), the responsible official must determine:
            (i) Motorized access, without road construction is not feasible;
            (ii) When proposing to construct a forest road, that a temporary road would not provide reasonable access;
            (iii) Road construction is consistent with the applicable land management plan direction;
            (iv) Within a native cutthroat trout catchment or identified recovery watershed, road construction will not diminish, over the long-term, conditions in the water influence zone and the extent of the occupied native cutthroat trout habitat; and
            (v) That watershed conservation practices will be applied to all projects occurring in native cutthroat trout habitat.
            (d) Road construction/reconstruction/decommissioning project implementation and management. The following elements will be incorporated into any road construction/reconstruction projects implemented within Colorado Roadless Areas.
            (1) Road construction/reconstruction. If it is determined that a road is authorized in a Colorado Roadless Area, conduct construction in a manner that reduces effects on surface resources, and prevents unnecessary or unreasonable surface disturbance.
            (2) Road decommissioning. Decommission any road and restore the affected landscape when it is determined that the road is no longer needed for the established purpose prior to, or upon termination or expiration of a contract, authorization, or permit, if possible; or upon termination or expiration of a contract, authorization, or permit, whichever is sooner. Require the inclusion of a road decommissioning provision in all contracts or permits. Design decommissioning to stabilize, restore, and revegetate unneeded roads to a more natural state to protect resources and enhance roadless area characteristics. Examples include obliteration, denial of use, elimination of travelway functionality, and removal of the road prism (restoration of the road corridor to the original contour and hydrologic function).
            (3) Road designations. The designation of a temporary road constructed or reconstructed pursuant to this subpart may not be changed to forest road except where a forest road is allowed under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
            (4) Road use. Use of motor vehicles for administrative purposes by the Forest Service and by fire, emergency, or law enforcement personnel is allowed. All roads constructed pursuant to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section shall prohibit public motorized vehicles (including off-highway vehicles) except:
            (i) Where specifically used for the purpose for which the road was established; or
            (ii) Motor vehicle use that is specifically authorized under a Federal law or regulation.
            (5) Road maintenance. Maintenance of roads is permissible in Colorado Roadless Areas.

            § 294.44
            Prohibition on linear construction zones.
            (a) General. A linear construction zone may not be authorized in Colorado Roadless Areas except as provided in paragraph (b) and (c) of this section and § 294.48 (a).
            (b) Upper Tier Acres. Notwithstanding the prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section, a linear construction zone may only be authorized within Colorado Roadless Area upper tier acres if the Regional Forester determines the LCZ is needed:
            (1) Pursuant to reserved or outstanding rights, or as provided for by statute or treaty.
            (2) For the construction, reconstruction, or maintenance of an authorized water conveyance structure which is operated pursuant to a pre-existing water court decree (see § 294.43(c)(1)(iv));
            (c) Non-Upper Tier Acres. Notwithstanding the prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section, a linear construction zone may only be authorized within Colorado Roadless Area non-upper tier acres if the Regional Forester determines the LCZ is needed:
            (1) Pursuant to reserved or outstanding rights, or as provided for by statute or treaty.
            (2) For the construction, reconstruction, or maintenance of an authorized water conveyance structure which is operated pursuant to a pre-existing water court decree (see § 294.43(c)(1)(iv));
            (3) For the construction, reconstruction, or maintenance of existing or future authorized electrical power lines or telecommunication lines. Electrical power lines or telecommunication lines within Colorado Roadless Areas will only be authorized if there is no opportunity for the project to be implemented outside of a Colorado Roadless Area without causing substantially greater environmental damage; or
            (4) For the construction, reconstruction or maintenance of a pipeline associated with operation of an oil and gas lease that allows surface use within a Colorado Roadless Area or the construction, reconstruction or maintenance of a pipeline needed to connect to infrastructure within a Colorado Roadless Area from outside a Colorado Roadless Area where such a connection would cause substantially less environmental damage than alternative routes. The construction of pipelines for the purposes of transporting oil or natural gas through a Colorado Roadless Area, where the source(s) and destination(s) of the pipeline are located exclusively outside of a Colorado Roadless Area, shall not be authorized.
            (d) Proposed Linear Construction Zones. If a proposed linear construction zone meets one of the above exceptions, then the following must be determined:
            (1) Motorized access, without a linear construction zone, is not feasible;
            (2) A linear construction zone is consistent with the applicable land management plan direction;
            (3) A linear construction zone is no wider than its intended use;
            (4) Within a native cutthroat trout catchment or identified recovery watershed, a linear construction zone will not diminish, over the long-term, conditions in the water influence zone and the extent of the occupied native cutthroat trout habitat;
            (5) Reclamation of a linear construction zone will not diminish, over the long-term, roadless area characteristics; and
            (6) That watershed conservation practices will be applied to all projects occurring in catchments with occupied native cutthroat trout habitat.
            (e) Linear construction zone decommissioning. Where a linear construction zone is authorized in a Colorado Roadless Area, installation of the linear facility will be done in a manner that minimizes ground disturbance, including placement within existing right-of-ways where feasible. All authorizations approving the installation of linear facilities through the use of a linear construction zone shall include a responsible official approved reclamation plan for reclaiming the affected landscape while conserving roadless area characteristics over the long-term. Upon completion of the installation of a linear facility via the use of a linear construction zone, all areas of surface disturbance shall be reclaimed as prescribed in the authorization and the approved reclamation plan and may not be waived.
          
          
            § 294.45
            Environmental documentation.
            (a) Environmental documentation will be prepared pursuant to Section 102 of the National Environmental Policy Act, 40 CFR part 1500, and 36 CFR part 220 for any proposed action within a Colorado Roadless Area. Proposed actions that would significantly alter the undeveloped character of a Colorado Roadless Area require an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).
            (b) The Forest Service will offer cooperating agency status to the State of Colorado, for all proposed projects and planning activities subject to this rule that would be implemented on lands within Colorado Roadless Areas. Where the Forest Service does not have the authority to offer formal cooperating agency status, the Forest Service shall offer to coordinate with the State.
          
          
            
            § 294.46
            Other activities.
            (a) Water Rights. This subpart in no manner restricts any party from seeking modification of a pre-existing water court decree, but after July 3, 2012 any Forest Service authorization required for road construction, road reconstruction, tree cutting, or linear construction zones associated with a modified water court decree must conform to the requirements in this subpart; provided that road construction or reconstruction may be authorized where necessary to change the location of a headgate and associated ditch, pursuant to Colorado Revised Statute 2011 § 37-86-111.
            (b) Oil and Gas Leases. Oil and gas leases issued within a Colorado Roadless Area after July 3, 2012 will prohibit road construction/reconstruction. The Forest Service shall not authorize the Bureau of Land Management to grant any request for a waiver, exception, or modification to any oil or gas lease if doing so would result in any road construction within a Colorado Roadless Area. For oil and gas leases issued in a Colorado Roadless Area prior to July 3, 2012, the rule preserves any existing leases and surface development rights. The rule also preserves any existing limitations on surface development rights arising from lease terms, lease stipulations, conditions of approval, 36 CFR 228.100, and Onshore Oil and Gas Orders.
            (c) Oil and Gas Leases on Upper Tier Acres. Oil and gas leases issued within upper tier acres after July 3, 2012 will require a no surface occupancy stipulation. The Forest Service shall not authorize the Bureau of Land Management to grant any request for a waiver, exception, or modification to any oil or gas lease if doing so would result in surface occupancy within an upper tier area.
            (d) Oil and Gas Surface Use Plans of Operation. Where applicable and consistent with lease rights, during the review of any application for a surface use plan of operations affecting lands within a Colorado Roadless Area, the responsible official will:
            (1) Locate, without compromising health and safety standards, roads, well sites, and facilities on pre-existing areas of surface disturbance. Project design shall minimize the amount of necessary temporary road construction or reconstruction.
            (2) Consider an alternative for proposed operations that addresses locating directional drilling of multi-well sites on pre-existing areas of surface disturbance. Such an alternative can be dismissed from detailed analysis with clear justification.
            (3) Restrict road construction for leases partially within Colorado Roadless Areas to portions of the lease outside of Colorado Roadless Areas except when doing so will be substantially more environmentally damaging, compromise safety standards, or is unfeasible due to surface and/or operational conditions.
            (4) Perform reclamation of surface disturbances incrementally, to minimize the total area of disturbance at any given point in time during the exploration or development of a lease.
            (5) Design temporary roads and facilities to blend with the terrain to minimize visual impacts and to facilitate restoration when the road is no longer needed.
            (6) Co-locate, consistent with health and safety standards, power lines, flow lines and pipelines within the right-of-way of roads or other LCZs to minimize the area of surface disturbance.
            (7) Consider new and developing low impact techniques and technologies and either apply or dismiss with justification.
            (8) Consider the best available technology to minimize noise and air emissions.
            (e) Trails. Nothing in this subpart shall affect the current or future management of motorized and non-motorized trails in Colorado Roadless Areas. Decisions concerning the management or status of motorized and non-motorized trails within Colorado Roadless Areas under this subpart shall be made during the applicable forest travel management processes.
            (f) Motorized access. Nothing in this subpart shall be construed as limiting the authority of the responsible official to approve existing and future motorized access not requiring road construction or reconstruction in Colorado Roadless Areas associated with grazing permits, special use authorizations, and other authorizations.
            (g) Livestock grazing. The authority to issue livestock grazing permits on national forest system lands within a Colorado Roadless Area is not affected by this subpart; however, no new temporary or forest roads shall be authorized through grazing permits issued after July 3, 2012.
          
          
            § 294.47
            Modifications and administrative corrections.
            Modifications and administrative corrections pursuant to this subpart, after coordination with the State, may be made under the following circumstances:
            (a) Modifications to boundaries. The Chief of the Forest Service may modify the boundaries of any designated Colorado Roadless Area identified in § 294.49 or add new Colorado Roadless Areas based on changed circumstances. Modifications and additions will be reflected in the set of maps maintained at the national headquarters office of the Forest Service. The construction or reconstruction of a temporary road or tree cutting, sale, or removal will not result in any boundary modification of a Colorado Roadless Area. Public notice with a minimum 90-day comment period will be provided for any proposed Colorado Roadless Area boundary modifications or additions.
            (b) Administrative corrections to boundaries. The Chief of the Forest Service may issue administrative corrections after public notice and a 30-day comment period. Administrative corrections to the maps of any designated Colorado Roadless Areas identified in § 294.49, including upper tier acres are adjustments to remedy errors such as clerical or improvements in mapping technology. Other than clerical errors, an administrative correction is based on improved field data due to updated imagery, global positioning system data, or other collected field data.
            (c) Amendments to rule language. Any amendment of this subpart will include coordination with the State and the appropriate level of NEPA analysis. A minimum 90-day comment period will be provided.
          
          
            § 294.48
            Scope and applicability.
            (a) This subpart does not revoke, suspend, or modify any permit, contract, lease, or other legal instrument authorizing or granting rights to the occupancy and use of National Forest system land issued prior to July 3, 2012 nor does it affect the authority or the discretion of the responsible official to reissue any such permit, contract, or other legal instrument upon its expiration or termination.
            (b) This subpart does not revoke, suspend, or modify any project or activity decision made prior to July 3, 2012.
            (c) The provisions set forth in this subpart provide the maximum level of tree cutting, sale and removal, and road construction and reconstruction activity allowed within Colorado Roadless Areas. Land management plan components can be more restrictive than this subpart and will continue to provide direction and guidance for projects and activities within Colorado Roadless Areas. Nothing in this subpart shall prohibit a responsible official from further restricting activities allowed within Colorado Roadless Areas. This subpart does not compel the amendment or revision of any land management plan.
            (d) The prohibitions and restrictions established in this subpart are not subject to reconsideration, revision, or rescission in subsequent project decisions or land management plan amendments or revisions undertaken pursuant to 36 CFR part 219.
            (e) Nothing in this subpart waives any applicable requirements regarding site specific environmental analysis, public involvement, consultation with Tribes and other agencies, or compliance with applicable laws.
            (f) If any provision in this subpart or its application to any person or to certain circumstances is held to be invalid, the remainder of the regulations in this subpart and their application remain in force.
            (g) After July 3, 2012 36 CFR 294.10 through 294.14 shall have no effect within the State of Colorado.

          § 296.1
          Purpose.
          (a) The regulations in this part implement provisions of the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979, as amended (16 U.S.C. 470aa-mm) by establishing the uniform definitions, standards, and procedures to be followed by all Federal land managers in providing protection for archaeological resources, located on public lands and Indian lands of the United States. These regulations enable Federal land managers to protect archaeological resources, taking into consideration provisions of the American Indian Religious Freedom Act (92 Stat. 469; 42 U.S.C. 1996), through permits authorizing excavation and/or removal of archaeological resources, through civil penalties for unauthorized excavation and/or removal, through provisions for the preservation of archaeological resource collections and data, and through provisions for ensuring confidentiality of information about archaeological resources when disclosure would threaten the archaeological resources.
          (b) The regulations in this part do not impose any new restrictions on activities permitted under other laws, authorities, and regulations relating to mining, mineral leasing, reclamation, and other multiple uses of the public lands.

          (a) The regulations in this part are promulgated pursuant to section 10(a) of the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 (16 U.S.C. 470ii), which requires that the Secretaries of the Interior, Agriculture and Defense and the Chairman of the Board of the Tennessee Valley Authority jointly develop uniform rules and regulations for carrying out the purposes of the Act.
          (b) In addition to the regulations in this part, section 10(b) of the Act (16 U.S.C. 470ii) provides that each Federal land manager shall promulgate such rules and regulations, consistent with the uniform rules and regulations in this part, as may be necessary for carrying out the purposes of the Act.
        
        
          § 296.3

          (ii) Coins, bullets, and unworked minerals and rocks.
          (5) The Federal land manager may determine that certain material remains, in specified areas under the Federal land manager's jurisdiction, and under specified circumstances, are not or are no longer of archaeological interest and are not to be considered archaeological resources under this part. Any determination made pursuant to this subparagraph shall be documented. Such determination shall in no way affect the Federal land manager's obligations under other applicable laws or regulations.

          § 296.4
          Prohibited acts and criminal penalties.
          (a) Under section 6(a) of the Act, no person may excavate, remove, damage, or otherwise alter or deface, or attempt to excavate, remove, damage, or otherwise alter or deface any archaeological resource located on public lands or Indian lands unless such activity is pursuant to a permit issued under § 296.8 or exempted by § 296.5(b) of this part.
          (b) No person may sell, purchase, exchange, transport, or receive any archaeological resource, if such resource was excavated or removed in violation of:
          (1) The prohibitions contained in paragraph (a) of this section; or
          (2) Any provision, rule, regulation, ordinance, or permit in effect under any other provision of Federal law.
          (c) Under section (d) of the Act, any person who knowingly violates or counsels, procures, solicits, or employs any other person to violate any prohibition contained in section 6 (a), (b), or (c) of the Act will, upon conviction, be fined not more than $10,000.00 or imprisoned not more than one year, or both: provided, however, that if the commercial or archaeological value of the archaeological resources involved and the cost of restoration and repair of such resources exceeds the sum of $500.00, such person will be fined not more than $20,000.00 or imprisoned not more than two years, or both. In the case of a second or subsequent such violation upon conviction such person will be fined not more than $100,000.00, or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.

          § 296.5
          Permit requirements and exceptions.
          (a) Any person proposing to excavate and/or remove archaeological resources from public lands or Indian lands, and to carry out activities associated with such excavation and/or removal, shall apply to the Federal land manager for a permit for the proposed work, and shall not begin the proposed work until a permit has been issued. The Federal land manager may issue a permit to any qualified person, subject to appropriate terms and conditions, provided that the person applying for a permit meets conditions in § 296.8(a) of this part.
          (b) Exceptions: (1) No permit shall be required under this part for any person conducting activities on the public lands under other permits, leases, licenses, or entitlements for use, when those activities are exclusively for purposes other than the excavation and/or removal of archaeological resources, even though those activities might incidentally result in the disturbance of archaeological resources. General earth-moving excavation conducted under a permit or other authorization shall not be construed to mean excavation and/or removal as used in this part. This exception does not, however, affect the Federal land manager's responsibility to comply with other authorities which protect archaeological resources prior to approving permits, leases, licenses, or entitlements for use; any excavation and/or removal of archaeological resources required for compliance with those authorities shall be conducted in accordance with the permit requirements of this part.
          (2) No permit shall be required under this part for any person collecting for private purposes any rock, coin, bullet, or mineral which is not an archaeological resource as defined in this part, provided that such collecting does not result in disturbance of any archaeological resource.
          (3) No permit shall be required under this part or under section 3 of the Act of June 8, 1906 (16 U.S.C. 432), for the excavation or removal by any Indian tribe or member thereof of any archaeological resource located on Indian lands of such Indian tribe, except that in the absence of tribal law regulating the excavation or removal or archaeological resources on Indian lands, an individual tribal member shall be required to obtain a permit under this part;
          (4) No permit shall be required under this part for any person to carry out any archaeological activity authorized by a permit issued under section 3 of the Act of June 8, 1906 (16 U.S.C. 432), before the enactment of the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979. Such permit shall remain in effect according to its terms and conditions until expiration.
          (5) No permit shall be required under section 3 of the Act of June 8, 1906 (16 U.S.C. 432) for any archaeological work for which a permit is issued under this part.
          (c) Persons carrying out official agency duties under the Federal land manager's direction, associated with the management of archaeological resources, need not follow the permit application procedures of § 296.6. However, the Federal land manager shall insure that provisions of §§ 296.8 and 296.9 have been met by other documented means, and that any official duties which might result in harm to or destruction of any Indian tribal religious or cultural site, as determined by the Federal land manager, have been the subject of consideration under § 296.7.
          (d) Upon the written request of the Governor of any State, on behalf of the State or its educational institutions, the Federal land manager shall issue a permit, subject to the provisions of §§ 296.5(b)(5), 296.7, 296.8(a) (3), (4), (5), (6), and (7), 296.9, 296.10, 296.12, and 296.13(a) to such Governor or to such designee as the Governor deems qualified to carry out the intent of the Act, for purposes of conducting archaeological research, excavating and/or removing archaeological resources, and safeguarding and preserving any materials and data collected in a university, museum, or other scientific or educational institution approved by the Federal land manager.
          (e) Under other statutory, regulatory, or administrative authorities governing the use of public lands and Indian lands, authorizations may be required for activities which do not require a permit under this part. Any person wishing to conduct on public lands or Indian lands any activities related to but believed to fall outside the scope of this part should consult with the Federal land manager, for the purpose of determining whether any authorization is required, prior to beginning such activities.
        
        
          § 296.6
          Application for permits and information collection.
          (a) Any person may apply to the appropriate Federal land manager for a permit to excavate and/or remove archaeological resources from public lands or Indian lands and to carry out activities associated with such excavation and/or removal.
          (b) Each application for a permit shall include:

          (1) The nature and extent of the work proposed, including how and why it is proposed to be conducted, proposed time of performance, locational maps, and proposed outlet for public written dissemination of the results.
          (2) The name and address of the individual(s) proposed to be responsible for conducting the work, institutional affiliation, if any, and evidence of education, training, and experience in accord with the minimal qualifications listed in § 296.8(a).
          (3) The name and address of the individual(s), if different from the individual(s) named in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, proposed to be responsible for carrying out the terms and conditions of the permit.
          (4) Evidence of the applicant's ability to initiate, conduct, and complete the proposed work, including evidence of logistical support and laboratory facilities.
          (5) Where the application is for the excavation and/or removal of archaeological resources on public lands, the names of the university, museum, or other scientific or educational institution in which the applicant proposes to store all collections, and copies of records, data, photographs, and other documents derived from the proposed work. Applicants shall submit written certification, signed by an authorized official of the institution, of willingness to assume curatorial responsibility for the collections, records, data, photographs and other documents and to safeguard and preserve these materials as property of the United States.
          (6) Where the application is for the excavation and/or removal of archaeological resources on Indian lands, the name of the university, museum, or other scientific or educational institution in which the applicant proposes to store copies of records, data, photographs, and other documents derived from the proposed work, and all collections in the event the Indian owners do not wish to take custody or otherwise dispose of the archaeological resources. Applicants shall submit written certification, signed by an authorized official of the institution, or willingness to assume curatorial responsibility for the collections, if applicable, and/or the records, data, photographs, and other documents derived from the proposed work.
          (c) The Federal land manager may require additional information, pertinent to land management responsibilities, to be included in the application for permit and shall so inform the applicant.
          (d) Paperwork Reduction Act. The information collection requirement contained in § 296.6 of these regulations has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. and assigned clearance number 1024-0037. The purpose of the information collection is to meet statutory and administrative requirements in the public interest. The information will be used to assist Federal land managers in determining that applicants for permits are qualified, that the work proposed would further archaeological knowledge, that archaeological resources and associated records and data will be properly preserved, and that the permitted activity would not conflict with the management of the public lands involved. Response to the information requirement is necessary in order for an applicant to obtain a benefit.
        
        
          § 296.7
          Notification to Indian tribes of possible harm to, or destruction of, sites on public lands having religious or cultural importance.
          (a) If the issuance of a permit under this part may result in harm to, or destruction of, any Indian tribal religious or cultural site on public lands, as determined by the Federal land manager, at least 30 days before issuing such a permit the Federal land manager shall notify any Indian tribe which may consider the site as having religious or cultural importance. Such notice shall not be deemed a disclosure to the public for purposes of section 9 of the Act.
          (1) Notice by the Federal land manager to any Indian tribe shall be sent to the chief executive officer or other designated official of the tribe. Indian tribes are encouraged to designate a tribal official to be the focal point for any notification and discussion between the tribe and the Federal land manager.

          (2) The Federal land manager may provide notice to any other Native American group that is known by the Federal land manager to consider sites potentially affected as being of religious or cultural importance.
          (3) Upon request during the 30-day period, the Federal land manager may meet with official representatives of any Indian tribe or group to discuss their interests, including ways to avoid or mitigate potential harm or destruction such as excluding sites from the permit area. Any mitigation measures which are adopted shall be incorporated into the terms and conditions of the permit under § 296.9.
          (4) When the Federal land manager determines that a permit applied for under this part must be issued immediately because of an imminent threat of loss or destruction of an archaeological resource, the Federal land manager shall so notify the appropriate tribe.
          (b)(1) In order to identify sites of religious or cultural importance, the Federal land manager shall seek to identify all Indian tribes having aboriginal or historic ties to the lands under the Federal land manager's jurisdiction and seek to determine, from the chief executive officer or other designated official of any such tribe, the location and nature of specific sites of religious or cultural importance so that such information may be on file for land management purposes. Information on sites eligible for or included in the National Register of Historic Places may be withheld from public disclosure pursuant to section 304 of the Act of October 15, 1966, as amended (16 U.S.C. 470w-3).
          (2) If the Federal land manager becomes aware of a Native American group that is not an Indian tribe as defined in this part but has aboriginal or historic ties to public lands under the Federal land manager's jurisdiction, the Federal land manager may seek to communicate with official representatives of that group to obtain information on sites they may consider to be of religious or cultural importance.
          (3) The Federal land manager may enter into agreement with any Indian tribe or other Native American group for determining locations for which such tribe or group wishes to receive notice under this section.
          (4) The Federal land manager should also seek to determine, in consultation with official representatives of Indian tribes or other Native American groups, what circumstances should be the subject of special notification to the tribe or group after a permit has been issued. Circumstances calling for notification might include the discovery of human remains. When circumstances for special notification have been determined by the Federal land manager, the Federal land manager will include a requirement in the terms and conditions of permits, under § 296.9(c), for permittees to notify the Federal land manger immediately upon the occurrence of such circumstances. Following the permittee's notification, the Federal land manager will notify and consult with the tribe or group as appropriate. In cases involving Native American human remains and other “cultural items”, as defined by NAGPRA, the Federal land manager is referred to NAGPRA and its implementing regulations.

          § 296.9
          Terms and conditions of permits.
          (a) In all permits issued, the Federal land manager shall specify:
          (1) The nature and extent of work allowed and required under the permit, including the time, duration, scope, location, and purpose of the work;

          (4) Reporting requirements.

          (b) The Federal land manager may specify such terms and conditions as deemed necessary, consistent with this part, to protect public safety and other values and/or resources, to secure work areas, to safeguard other legitimate land uses, and to limit activities incidental to work authorized under a permit.
          
          (c) The Federal land manager shall include in permits issued for archaeological work on Indian lands such terms and conditions as may be requested by the Indian landowner and the Indian tribe having jurisdiction over the lands, and for archaeological work on public lands shall include such terms and conditions as may have been developed pursuant to § 296.7.
          (d) Initiation of work or other activities under the authority of a permit signifies the permittee's acceptance of the terms and conditions of the permit.
          (e) The permittee shall not be released from requirements of a permit until all outstanding obligations have been satisfied, whether or not the term of the permit has expired.
          (f) The permittee may request that the Federal land manager extend or modify a permit.
          (g) The permittee's performance under any permit issued for a period greater than 1 year shall be subject to review by the Federal land manager, at least annually.

          Suspension and revocation of permits.
          (a) Suspension or revocation for cause. (1) The Federal land manager may suspend a permit issued pursuant to this part upon determining that the permittee has failed to meet any of the terms and conditions of the permit or has violated any prohibition of the Act or § 296.4. The Federal land manager shall provide written notice to the permittee of the suspension, the cause thereof, and the requirements which must be met before the suspension will be removed.
          (2) The Federal land manager may revoke a permit upon assessment of a civil penalty under § 296.15 upon the permittee's conviction under section 6 of the Act, or upon determining that the permittee has failed after notice under this section to correct the situation which led to suspension of the permit.
          (b) Suspension or revocation for management purposes. The Federal land manager may suspend or revoke a permit, without liability to the United States, its agents, or employees, when continuation of work under the permit would be in conflict with management requirements not in effect when the permit was issued.

          § 296.11
          Appeals relating to permits.
          Any affected person may appeal permit issuance, denial of permit issuance, suspension, revocation, and terms and conditions of a permit through existing administrative appeal procedures, or through procedures which may be established by the Federal land manager pursuant to section 10(b) of the Act and this part.
        
        
          § 296.12
          Relationship to Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act.
          Issuance of a permit in accordance with the Act and this part does not constitute an undertaking requiring compliance with section 106 of the Act of October 15, 1966 (16 U.S.C. 470f). However, the mere issuance of such a permit does not excuse the Federal land manager from compliance with section 106 where otherwise required.
        
        
          § 296.13
          Custody of archaeological resources.
          (a) Archaeological resources excavated or removed from the public lands remain the property of the United States.
          (b) Archaeological resources excavated or removed from Indian lands remain the property of the Indian or Indian tribe having rights of ownership over such resources.
          (c) The Secretary of the Interior may promulgate regulations providing for the exchange of archaeological resources among suitable universities, museums, or other scientific or educational institutions, for the ultimate disposition of archaeological resources, and for standards by which archaeological resources shall be preserved and maintained, when such resources have been excavated or removed from public lands and Indian lands.

          (d) In the absence of regulations referenced in paragraph (c) of this section, the Federal land manager may provide for the exchange of archaeological resources among suitable universities, museums, or other scientific or educational institutions, when such resources have been excavated or removed from public lands under the authority of a permit issued by the Federal land manager.
          (e) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, the Federal land manager will follow the procedures required by NAGPRA and its implementing regulations for determining the disposition of Native American human remains and other “cultural items”, as defined by NAGPRA, that have been excavated, removed, or discovered on public lands.

          § 296.14
          Determination of archaeological or commercial value and cost of restoration and repair.
          (a) Archaeological value. For purposes of this part, the archaeological value of any archaeological resource involved in a violation of the prohibitions in § 296.4 of this part or conditions of a permit issued pursuant to this part shall be the value of the information associated with the archaeological resource. This value shall be appraised in terms of the costs of the retrieval of the scientific information which would have been obtainable prior to the violation. These costs may include, but need not be limited to, the cost of preparing a research design, conducting field work, carrying out laboratory analysis, and preparing reports as would be necessary to realize the information potential.
          (b) Commercial value. For purposes of this part, the commercial value of any archaeological resource involved in a violation of the prohibitions in § 296.4 of this part or conditions of a permit issued pursuant to this part shall be its fair market value. Where the violation has resulted in damage to the archaeological resource, the fair market value should be determined using the condition of the archaeological resource prior to the violation, to the extent that its prior condition can be ascertained.
          (c) Cost of restoration and repair. For purposes of this part, the cost of restoration and repair of archaeological resources damaged as a result of a violation of prohibitions or conditions pursuant to this part, shall be the sum of the costs already incurred for emergency restoration or repair work, plus those costs projected to be necessary to complete restoration and repair, which may include, but need not be limited to, the costs of the following:
          (1) Reconstruction of the archaeological resource;
          (2) Stabilization of the archaeological resource;
          (3) Ground contour reconstruction and surface stabilization;
          (4) Research necessary to carry out reconstruction or stabilization;
          (5) Physical barriers or other protective devices, necessitated by the disturbance of the archaeological resource, to protect it from further disturbance;
          (6) Examination and analysis of the archaeological resource including recording remaining archaeological information, where necessitated by disturbance, in order to salvage remaining values which cannot be otherwise conserved;
          (7) Reinterment of human remains in accordance with religious custom and State, local, or tribal law, where appropriate, as determined by the Federal land manager.
          (8) Preparation of reports relating to any of the above activities.
        
        
          § 296.15
          Assessment of civil penalties.
          (a) The Federal land manager may assess a civil penalty against any person who has violated any prohibition contained in § 296.4 or who has violated any term or condition included in a permit issued in accordance with the Act and this part.
          (b) Notice of violation. The Federal land manager shall serve a notice of violation upon any person believed to be subject to a civil penalty, either in person or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested). The Federal land manager shall include in the notice:
          (1) A concise statement of the facts believed to show a violation;

          (2) A specific reference to the provision(s) of this part or to a permit issued pursuant to this part allegedly violated;
          (3) The amount of penalty proposed to be assessed, including any initial proposal to mitigate or remit where appropriate, or a statement that notice of a proposed penalty amount will be served after the damages associated with the alleged violation have been ascertained;
          (4) Notification of the right to file a petition for relief pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, or to await the Federal land manager's notice of assessment, and to request a hearing in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section. The notice shall also inform the person of the right to seek judicial review of any final administrative decision assessing a civil penalty.
          (c) The person served with a notice of violation shall have 45 calendar days from the date of its service (or the date of service of a proposed penalty amount, if later) in which to respond. During this time the person may:
          (1) Seek informal discussions with the Federal land manager;
          (2) File a petition for relief in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section;
          (3) Take no action and await the Federal land manager's notice of assessment;
          (4) Accept in writing or by payment the proposed penalty, or any mitigation or remission offered in the notice. Acceptance of the proposed penalty or mitigation or remission shall be deemed a waiver of the notice of assessment and of the right to request a hearing under paragraph (g) of this section.
          (d) Petition for relief. The person served with a notice of violation may request that no penalty be assessed or that the amount be reduced, by filing a petition for relief with the Federal land manager within 45 calendar days of the date of service of the notice of violation (or of a proposed penalty amount, if later).

          (2) The Federal land manager shall take into consideration all available information, including information provided pursuant to paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section or furnished upon further request by the Federal land manager.
          (3) If the facts warrant a conclusion that no violation has occurred, the Federal land manager shall so notify the person served with a notice of violation, and no penalty shall be assessed.
          (4) Where the facts warrant a conclusion that a violation has occurred, the Federal land manager shall determine a penalty amount in accordance with § 296.16.
          (f) Notice of assessment. The Federal land manager shall notify the person served with a notice of violation of the penalty amount assessed by serving a written notice of assessment, either in person or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested). The Federal land manager shall include in the notice of assessment:
          (1) The facts and conclusions from which it was determined that a violation did occur;
          (2) The basis in § 296.16 for determining the penalty amount assessed and/or any offer to mitigate or remit the penalty; and
          (3) Notification of the right to request a hearing, including the procedures to be followed, and to seek judicial review of any final administrative decision assessing a civil penalty.
          (g) Hearings.

The person shall enclose with the request for hearing a copy of the notice of assessment, and shall deliver the request as specified in the notice of assessment, personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested).
          (2) Failure to deliver a written request for a hearing within 45 days of the date of service of the notice of assessment shall be deemed a waiver of the right to a hearing.
          (3) Any hearing conducted pursuant to this section shall be held in accordance with 5 U.S.C. section 554. In any such hearing, the amount of civil penalty assessed shall be determined in accordance with this part, and shall not be limited by the amount assessed by the Federal land manager under paragraph (f) of this section or any offer of mitigation or remission made by the Federal land manager.
          (h) Final administrative decision. (1) Where the person served with a notice of violation has accepted the penalty pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the notice of violation shall constitute the final administrative decision;
          (2) Where the person served with a notice of assessment has not filed a timely request for a hearing pursuant to paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the notice of assessment shall constitute the final administrative decision;
          (3) Where the person served with a notice of assessment has filed a timely request for a hearing pursuant to paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the decision resulting from the hearing or any applicable administrative appeal therefrom shall constitute the final administrative decision.
          (i) Payment of penalty. (1) The person assessed a civil penalty shall have 45 calendar days from the date of issuance of the final administrative decision in which to make full payment of the penalty assessed, unless a timely request for appeal has been filed with a United States District Court as provided in section 7(b)(1) of the Act.
          (2) Upon failure to pay the penalty, the Federal land manager may request the Attorney General to institute a civil action to collect the penalty in a United States District Court for any district in which the person assessed a civil penalty is found, resides, or transacts business. Where the Federal land manager is not represented by the Attorney General, a civil action may be initiated directly by the Federal land manager.
          (j) Other remedies not waived. Assessment of a penalty under this section shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to pursue other available legal or administrative remedies.
        
        
          § 296.16
          Civil penalty amounts.
          (a) Maximum amount of penalty. (1) Where the person being assessed a civil penalty has not committed any previous violation of any prohibition in § 296.4 or of any term or condition included in a permit issued pursuant to this part, the maximum amount of the penalty shall be the full cost of restoration and repair of archaeological resources damaged plus the archaeological or commercial value of archaeological resources destroyed or not recovered.
          (2) Where the person being assessed a civil penalty has committed any previous violation of any prohibition in § 296.4 or of any term or condition included in a permit issued pursuant to this part, the maximum amount of the penalty shall be double the cost of restoration and repair plus double the archaeological or commercial value of archaeological resources destroyed or not recovered.
          (3) Violations limited to the removal of arrowheads located on the surface of the ground shall not be subject to the penalties prescribed in this section.
          (b) Determination of penalty amount, mitigation, and remission. The Federal land manager may assess a penalty amount less than the maximum amount of penalty and may offer to mitigate or remit the penalty.
          (1) Determination of the penalty amount and/or a proposal to mitigate or remit the penalty may be based upon any of the following factors:
          (i) Agreement by the person being assessed a civil penalty to return to the Federal land manager archaeological resources removed from public lands or Indian lands;

          (ii) Agreement by the person being assessed a civil penalty to assist the Federal land manager in activity to preserve, restore, or otherwise contribute to the protection and study of archaeological resources on public lands or Indian lands;
          
          (iii) Agreement by the person being assessed a civil penalty to provide information which will assist in the detection, prevention, or prosecution of violations of the Act or this part;
          (iv) Demonstration of hardship or inability to pay, provided that this factor shall only be considered when the person being assessed a civil penalty has not been found to have previously violated the regulations in this part;
          (v) Determination that the person being assessed a civil penalty did not willfully commit the violation;
          (vi) Determination that the proposed penalty would constitute excessive punishment under the circumstances;
          (vii) Determination of other mitigating circumstances appropriate to consideration in reaching a fair and expeditious assessment.
          (2) When the penalty is for a violation on Indian lands, the Federal land manager shall consult with and consider the interests of the Indian landowner and the Indian tribe having jurisdiction over the Indian lands prior to proposing to mitigate or remit the penalty.
          (3) When the penalty is for a violation which may have had an effect on a known Indian tribal religious or cultural site on public lands, the Federal land manager should consult with and consider the interests of the affected tribe(s) prior to proposing to mitigate or remit the penalty.

          § 296.21
          Surveys and Schedules.

          (a) The Secretaries of the Interior, Agriculture, and Defense and the Chairman of the Board of the Tennessee Valley Authority will develop plans for surveying lands under each agency's control to determine the nature and extent of archaeological resources pursuant to section 14(a) of the Act. Such activities should be consistent with Federal agency planning policies and other historic preservation program responsibilities required by 16 U.S.C. 470 et seq. Survey plans prepared under this section will be designed to comply with the purpose of the Act regarding the protection of archaeological resources.
          (b) The Secretaries of the Interior, Agriculture, and Defense and the Chairman of the Tennessee Valley Authority will prepare schedules for surveying lands under each agency's control that are likely to contain the most scientifically valuable archaeological resources pursuant to section 14(b) of the Act. Such schedules will be developed based on objectives and information identified in survey plans described in paragraph (a) of this section and implemented systematically to cover areas where the most scientifically valuable archaeological resources are likely to exist.
          (c) Guidance for the activities undertaken as part of paragraphs (a) through (b) of this section is provided by the Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for Archeology and Historic Preservation.
          (d) Other Federal land managing agencies are encouraged to develop plans for surveying lands under their jurisdictions and prepare schedules for surveying to improve protection and management of archaeological resources.

          (e) The Secretaries of the Interior, Agriculture, and Defense and the Chairman of the Tennessee Valley Authority will develop a system for documenting and reporting suspected violations of the various provisions of the Act. This system will reference a set of procedures for use by officers, employees, or agents of Federal agencies to assist them in recognizing violations, documenting relevant evidence, and reporting assembled information to the appropriate authorities. Methods employed to document and report such violations should be compatible with existing agency reporting systems for documenting violations of other appropriate Federal statutes and regulations. Summary information to be included in the Secretary's comprehensive report will be based upon the system developed by each Federal land manager for documenting suspected violations.

          Subpart A—Water Resources Projects
          
            § 297.1
            General.
            Section 7 of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (16 U.S.C. 1278), as amended, provides for the protection of the free-flowing, scenic, and natural values of rivers designated as components or potential components of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System from the effects of construction of any water resources project.
          
          
            § 297.2
            Scope and application.
            These rules apply to Federal assistance in the construction of water resources projects affecting Wild and Scenic Rivers or Study Rivers administered in whole or part by the Secretary of Agriculture.
          
          
            § 297.3
            Definitions.
            
              Act means the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (82 Stat. 906, as amended; 16 U.S.C. 1271-1288).
            
              Construction means any action carried on with Federal assistance affecting the free-flowing characteristics or the scenic or natural values of a Wild and Scenic River or Study River.
            
              Federal assistance means any assistance by an authorizing agency including, but not limited to, the following:
            (a) A license, permit, preliminary permit, or other authorization granted by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pursuant to sections 4(e) and 4(f) of the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. 797;

            (b) A license, permit, or other authorization granted by the Corps of Engineers, Department of the Army, pursuant to the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (33 U.S.C. 401 et seq.), and section 404 of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1344); and,
            (c) Any other license, permit, or authorization which may be required by an agency or Department of the Federal Government before, during, or after construction of a water resources project.
            
              Free-flowing is defined by section 16(b) of the Act as “existing or flowing in natural condition without impoundment, diversion, straightening, riprapping, or other modification of the waterway” (16 U.S.C. 1287(b)).
            
              Study period means the time during which a river is being studied as a potential component of the Wild and Scenic Rivers System and such additional time as provided in section 7(b)(ii) of the Act not to exceed 3 additional years during which a report recommending designation is before the Congress, or such additional time as may be provided by statute.
            
              Study river means a river and the adjacent area within one quarter mile of the banks of the river which is designated for study as a potential addition to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System pursuant to section 5(a) of the Act.
            
              Water resources project means any dam, water conduit, reservoir, powerhouse, transmission line, or other project works under the Federal Power Act (41 Stat. 1063) as amended, or other construction of developments which would affect the free-flowing characteristics of a Wild and Scenic River or Study River.
            
              Wild and scenic river means a river and the adjacent area within the boundaries of a component of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System pursuant to section 3(a) or 2(a)(ii) of the Act.
          
          
            
            § 297.4
            Requirements for Federal agencies.
            (a) No license, permit, or other authorization can be issued for a Federally assisted water resources project on any portion of a Wild and Scenic River or Study River nor can appropriations be requested to begin construction of such projects, without prior notice to the Secretary of Agriculture, and a determination in accordance with section 7 of the Act.
            (b) As soon as practicable, but no less than 60 days prior to the date of proposed action, the Federal agency shall provide a notice of intent to issue such license, permit, or other authorization to the Chief, Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, P.O. Box 2417, Washington, DC 20013. The Secretary will, to the extent possible, give expedited consideration to a notice of intent for a project needed to address an emergency situation.
            (c) The notice shall include the following information:
            (1) Name and location of affected river;
            (2) Location of the project;
            (3) Nature of the permit or other authorization proposed for issuance;
            (4) A description of the proposed activity; and
            (5) Any relevant information, such as plans, maps, and environmental studies, assessments, or environmental impact statements.
          
          
            § 297.5
            Determination.
            (a) The Secretary of Agriculture will consent to the issuance of any Federal license, permit, or other authorization if, as a finding of fact, it is determined that:
            (1) The water resources project will not have a direct and adverse effect on the values for which a Wild and Scenic River or Study River was designated, when any portion of the project is within the boundaries of said river, or;
            (2) The effects of the water resources project will neither invade nor unreasonably diminish the scenic, recreational, and fish wildlife values of a Wild and Scenic River, when any portion of the project is located above, below, or outside the Wild and Scenic River, or;
            (3) The effects of the water resources project will neither invade nor diminish the scenic, recreational, and fish and wildlife values of a Study River when the project is located above, below, or outside the Study River during the study period.
            (b) If consent is denied, the Secretary may recommend measures to eliminate adverse effects, and the authorizing agencies may submit revised plans for consideration.
          
          
            § 297.6
            Environmental analysis requirements.
            (a) The determination of the effects of a proposed water resources project shall be made in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). To the extent possible, authorizing agencies should ensure that any environmental studies, assessments, or environmental impact statements prepared for a water resources project adequately address the environmental effects on resources protected by the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, and that the Department of Agriculture is apprised of ongoing analyses so as to facilitate coordination and identification of Wild and Scenic River related issues.
            (b) To the extent practicable, impacts on Wild and Scenic River values will be considered in the context of other review procedures provided by law. Authorizing agencies are encouraged to consult with the Forest Service in order to identify measures which could eliminate any direct and adverse effects, thereby increasing the likelihood of securing consent.
