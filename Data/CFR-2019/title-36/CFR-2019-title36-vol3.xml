      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vii"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

          <P>(d) <E T="03">Policy.</E> (1) It is the policy of the Chief of Engineers to protect and manage shorelines of all Civil Works water resource development projects under Corps jurisdiction in a manner which will promote the safe and healthful use of these shorelines by the public while maintaining environmental safeguards to ensure a quality resource for use by the public. The objectives of all management actions will be to achieve a balance between permitted private uses and resource protection for general public use. Public pedestrian access to and exit from these shorelines shall be preserved. For projects or portions of projects where Federal real estate interest is limited to easement title only, management actions will be appropriate within the limits of the estate acquired.</P>
          <P>(2) Private shoreline uses may be authorized in designated areas consistent with approved use allocations specified in Shoreline Management Plans. Except to honor written commitments made prior to publication of this regulation, private shoreline uses are not allowed on water resource projects where construction was initiated after December 13, 1974, or on water resource projects where no private shoreline uses existed as of that date. Any existing permitted facilities on these projects will be grandfathered until the facilities fail to meet the criteria set forth in § 327.30(h).</P>
          <P>(3) A Shoreline Management Plan, as described in § 327.30(e), will be prepared for each Corps project where private shoreline use is allowed. This plan will honor past written commitments. The plan will be reviewed at least once every five years and revised as necessary. Shoreline uses that do not interfere with authorized project purposes, public safety concerns, violate local norms or result in significant environmental effects should be allowed unless the public participation process identifies problems in these areas. If sufficient demand exists, consideration should be given to revising the shoreline allocations (e.g. increases/decreases). Maximum public participation will be encouraged as set forth in § 327.30(e)(6). Except to honor written commitments made prior to the publication of this regulation, shoreline management plans are not required for those projects where construction was initiated after December 13, 1974, or on projects not having private shoreline use as of that date. In that case, a statement of policy will be developed by the district commander to present the shoreline management policy. This policy statement will be subject to the approval of the division commander. For projects where two or more agencies have jurisdiction, the plan will be cooperatively prepared with the Corps as coordinator.</P>

          <P>(4) Where commercial or other public launching and/or moorage facilities are not available within a reasonable distance, group owned mooring facilities may be allowed in Limited Development Areas to limit the proliferation of individual facilities. Generally only one permit will be necessary for a group owned mooring facility with that entity, if incorporated, or with one person from the organization designated as the permittee and responsible for all moorage spaces within the facility. No charge may be made for use of any permitted facility by others nor shall any <PRTPAGE P="17"/>commercial activity be engaged in thereon.</P>
          <P>(5) The issuance of a private shoreline use permit does not convey any real estate or personal property rights or exclusive use rights to the permit holder. The public's right of access and use of the permit area must be maintained and preserved. Owners of permitted facilities may take necessary precautions to protect their property from theft, vandalism or trespass, but may in no way preclude the public right of pedestrian or vessel access to the water surface or public land adjacent to the facility.</P>
          <P>(6) Shoreline Use Permits will only be issued to individuals or groups with legal right of access to public lands.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Shoreline Management Plan</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The policies outlined in § 327.30(d) will be implemented through preparation of Shoreline Management Plans, where private shoreline use is allowed.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Preparation.</E> A Shoreline Management Plan is prepared as part of the Operational Management Plan. A moratorium on accepting applications for new permits may be placed in effect from the time an announcement of creation of a plan or formal revision of a plan is made until the action is completed.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Approval.</E> Approval of Shoreline Management Plans rests with division commanders. After approval, one copy of each project Shoreline Management Plan will be forwarded to HQUSACE (CECW-ON) WASH DC 20314-1000. Copies of the approved plan will also be made available to the public.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Scope and Format.</E> The Shoreline Management Plan will consist of a map showing the shoreline allocated to the uses listed in § 327.30(e)(6), related rules and regulations, a discussion of what areas are open or closed to specific activities and facilities, how to apply for permits and other information pertinent to the Corps management of the shoreline. The plan will be prepared in sufficient detail to ensure that it is clear to the public what uses are and are not allowed on the shoreline of the project and why. A process will be developed and presented in the Shoreline Management Plan that prescribes a procedure for review of activities requested but not specifically addressed by the Shoreline Management Plan.</P>
          <P>(5) <E T="03">Shoreline Allocation.</E> The entire shoreline will be allocated within the classifications below and delineated on a map. Any action, within the context of this rule, which gives a special privilege to an individual or group of individuals on land or water at a Corps project, that precludes use of those lands and waters by the general public, is considered to be private shoreline use. Shoreline allocations cover that land and/or water extending from the edge of the water and waterward with the exception of allocations for the purpose of vegetation modification which extends landward to the project boundary. These allocations should complement, but certainly not contradict, the land classifications in the project master plan. A map of sufficient size and scale to clearly display the shoreline allocations will be conspicuously displayed or readily available for viewing in the project administration office and will serve as the authoritative reference. Reduced or smaller scale maps may be developed for public dissemination but the information contained on these must be identical to that contained on the display map in the project administration office. No changes will be made to these maps except through the formal update process. District commanders may add specific constraints and identify areas having unique characteristics during the plan preparation, review, or updating process in addition to the allocation classifications described below.</P>
          <P>(i) <E T="03">Limited Development Areas.</E> Limited Development Areas are those areas in which private facilities and/or activities may be allowed consistent with § 327.30(h) and appendix A. Modification of vegetation by individuals may be allowed only following the issuance of a permit in accordance with appendix A. Potential low and high water conditions and underwater topography should be carefully evaluated before shoreline is allocated as Limited Development Area.</P>
          <P>(ii) <E T="03">Public Recreation Areas.</E> Public Recreation Areas are those areas designated for commercial concessionaire <PRTPAGE P="18"/>facilities, Federal, state or other similar public use. No private shoreline use facilities and/or activities will be permitted within or near designated or developed public recreation areas. The term “near” depends on the terrain, road system, and other local conditions, so actual distances must be established on a case by case basis in each project Shoreline Management Plan. No modification of land forms or vegetation by private individuals or groups of individuals is permitted in public recreation areas.</P>
          <P>(iii) <E T="03">Protected Shoreline Areas.</E> Protected Shoreline Areas are those areas designated to maintain or restore aesthetic, fish and wildlife, cultural, or other environmental values. Shoreline may also be so designated to prevent development in areas that are subject to excessive siltation, erosion, rapid dewatering, or exposure to high wind, wave, or current action and/or in areas in which development would interfere with navigation. No Shoreline Use Permits for floating or fixed recreation facilities will be allowed in protected areas. Some modification of vegetation by private individuals, such as clearing a narrow meandering path to the water, or limited mowing, may be allowed only following the issuance of a permit if the resource manager determines that the activity will not adversely impact the environment or physical characteristics for which the area was designated as protected. In making this determination the effect on water quality will also be considered.</P>
          <P>(iv) <E T="03">Prohibited Access Areas.</E> Prohibited Access Areas are those in which public access is not allowed or is restricted for health, safety or security reasons. These could include hazardous areas near dams, spillways, hydro-electric power stations, work areas, water intake structures, etc. No shoreline use permits will be issued in Prohibited Access Areas.</P>
          <P>(6) <E T="03">Public Participation.</E> District commanders will ensure public participation to the maximum practicable extent in Shoreline Management Plan formulation, preparation and subsequent revisions. This may be accomplished by public meetings, group workshops, open houses or other public involvement techniques. When master plan updates and preparation of the Shoreline Management Plans are concurrent, public participation may be combined and should consider all aspects of both plans, including shoreline allocation classifications. Public participation will begin during the initial formulation stage and must be broad-based to cover all aspects of public interest. The key to successful implementation is an early and continual public relations program. Projects with significant numbers of permits should consider developing computerized programs to facilitate exchange of information with permittees and to improve program efficiency. Special care will be taken to advise citizen and conservation organizations; Federal, state and local natural resource management agencies; Indian Tribes; the media; commercial concessionaires; congressional liaisons; adjacent landowners and other concerned entities during the formulation of Shoreline Management Plans and subsequent revisions. Notices shall be published prior to public meetings to assure maximum public awareness. Public notices shall be issued by the district commander allowing for a minimum of 30 days for receipt of written public comment in regard to the proposed Shoreline Management Plan or any major revision thereto.</P>
          <P>(7) <E T="03">Periodic Review.</E> Shoreline Management Plans will be reviewed periodically, but no less often than every five years, by the district commander to determine the need for update. If sufficient controversy or demand exists, consideration should be given, consistent with other factors, to a process of reevaluation of the shoreline allocations and the plan. When changes to the Shoreline Management Plan are needed, the plan will be formally updated through the public participation process. Cumulative environmental impacts of permit actions and the possibility of preparing or revising project NEPA documentation will be considered. District commanders may make minor revisions to the Shoreline Management Plan when the revisions are consistent with policy and funds for a complete plan update are not available. <PRTPAGE P="19"/>The amount and type of public involvement needed for such revision is at the discretion of the district commander.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Instruments for Shoreline Use.</E> Instruments used to authorize private shoreline use facilities, activities or development are as follows:</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Shoreline Use Permits.</E> (i) Shoreline Use Permits are issued and enforced in accordance with provisions of 36 CFR 327.19.</P>
          <P>(ii) Shoreline Use Permits are required for private structures/activities of any kind (except boats) in waters of Civil Works projects whether or not such waters are deemed navigable and where such waters are under the primary jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Army and under the management of the Corps of Engineers.</P>
          <P>(iii) Shoreline Use Permits are required for non-floating structures on waters deemed commercially non-navigable, when such waters are under management of the Corps of Engineers.</P>
          <P>(iv) Shoreline Use Permits are also required for land vegetation modification activities which do not involve disruption to land form.</P>
          <P>(v) Permits should be issued for a term of five years. To reduce administration costs, one year permits should be issued only when the location or nature of the activity requires annual reissuance.</P>
          <P>(vi) Shoreline Use Permits for erosion control may be issued for the life or period of continual ownership of the structure by the permittee and his/her legal spouse.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Department of the Army Permits.</E> Dredging, construction of fixed structures, including fills and combination fixed-floating structures and the discharge of dredged or fill material in waters of the United States will be evaluated under authority of section 10, River and Harbor Act of 1899 (33 U.S.C. 403) and section 404 of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1344). Permits will be issued where appropriate.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Real Estate Instruments.</E> Commercial development activities and activities which involve grading, cuts, fills, or other changes in land form, or establishment of appropriate land-based support facilities required for private floating facilities, will continue to be covered by a lease, license or other legal grant issued through the appropriate real estate element. Shoreline Management Plans should identify the types of activities that require real estate instruments and indicate the general process for obtaining same. Shoreline Use Permits are not required for facilities or activities covered by a real estate instrument.</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Transfer of Permits.</E> Shoreline Use Permits are non-transferable. They become null and void upon sale or transfer of the permitted facility or the death of the permittee and his/her legal spouse.</P>
          <P>(h) <E T="03">Existing Facilities Now Under Permit.</E> Implementation of a Shoreline Management Plan shall consider existing permitted facilities and prior written Corps commitments implicit in their issuance. Facilities or activities permitted under special provisions should be identified in a way that will set them apart from other facilities or activities.</P>
          <P>(1) Section 6 of Pub. L. 97-140 provides that no lawfully installed dock or appurtenant structures shall be required to be removed prior to December 31, 1989, from any Federal water resources reservoir or lake project administered by the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, on which it was located on December 29, 1981, if such property is maintained in usable condition, and does not occasion a threat to life or property.</P>
          <P>(2) In accordance with section 1134(d) of Pub. L. 99-662, any houseboat, boathouse, floating cabin or lawfully installed dock or appurtenant structures in place under a valid shoreline use permit as of November 17, 1986, cannot be forced to be removed from any Federal water resources project or lake administered by the Secretary of the Army on or after December 31, 1989, if it meets the three conditions below except where necessary for immediate use for public purposes or higher public use or for a navigation or flood control project.</P>
          <P>(i) Such property is maintained in a usable and safe condition,</P>

          <P>(ii) Such property does not occasion a threat to life or property, and<PRTPAGE P="20"/>
          </P>
          <P>(iii) The holder of the permit is in substantial compliance with the existing permit.</P>
          <P>(3) All such floating facilities and appurtenances will be formally recognized in an appropriate Shoreline Management Plan. New permits for these permitted facilities will be issued to new owners. If the holder of the permit fails to comply with the terms of the permit, it may be revoked and the holder required to remove the structure, in accordance with the terms of the permit as to notice, time, and appeal.</P>
          <P>(i) <E T="03">Facility Maintenance.</E> Permitted facilities must be operated, used and maintained by the permittee in a safe, healthful condition at all times. If determined to be unsafe, the resource manager will establish together with the permittee a schedule, based on the seriousness of the safety deficiency, for correcting the deficiency or having it removed, at the permittee's expense. The applicable safety and health prescriptions in EM 385-1-1 should be used as a guide.</P>
          <P>(j) <E T="03">Density of Development.</E> The density of private floating and fixed recreation facilities will be established in the Shoreline Management Plan for all portions of Limited Development areas consistent with ecological and aesthetic characteristics and prior written commitments. The facility density in Limited Development Areas should, if feasible, be determined prior to the development of adjacent private property. The density of facilities will not be more than 50 per cent of the Limited Development Area in which they are located. Density will be measured by determining the linear feet of shoreline as compared to the width of the facilities in the water plus associated moorage arrangements which restrict the full unobstructed use of that portion of the shoreline. When a Limited Development Area or a portion of a Limited Development area reaches maximum density, notice should be given to the public and facility owners in that area that no additional facilities will be allowed. In all cases, sufficient open area will be maintained for safe maneuvering of watercraft. Docks should not extend out from the shore more than one-third of the width of a cove at normal recreation or multipurpose pool. In those cases where current density of development exceeds the density level established in the Shoreline Management Plan, the density will be reduced to the prescribed level through attrition.</P>
          <P>(k) <E T="03">Permit Fees.</E> Fees associated with the Shoreline Use Permits shall be paid prior to issuing the permit in accordance with the provisions of § 327.30(c)(1). The fee schedule will be published separately.</P>
          <EXTRACT>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Appendix A to § 327.30—Guidelines for Granting Shoreline Use Permits</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">1. General</HD>
            <P>a. Decisions regarding permits for private floating recreation facilities will consider the operating objectives and physical characteristics of each project. In developing Shoreline Management Plans, district commanders will give consideration to the effects of added private boat storage facilities on commercial concessions for that purpose. Consistent with established policies, new commercial concessions may be alternatives to additional limited development shoreline.</P>
            <P>b. Permits for individually or group owned shoreline use facilities may be granted only in Limited Development Areas when the sites are not near commercial marine services and such use will not despoil the shoreline nor inhibit public use or enjoyment thereof. The installation and use of such facilities will not be in conflict with the preservation of the natural characteristics of the shoreline nor will they result in significant environmental damage. Charges will be made for Shoreline Use Permits in accordance with the separately published fee schedule.</P>
            <P>c. Permits may be granted within Limited Development Areas for ski jumps, floats, boat moorage facilities, duck blinds, and other private floating recreation facilities when they will not create a safety hazard and inhibit public use or enjoyment of project waters or shoreline. A Corps permit is not required for temporary ice fishing shelters or duck blinds when they are regulated by a state program. When the facility or activity is authorized by a shoreline use permit, a separate real estate instrument is generally not required.</P>

            <P>d. Group owned boat mooring facilities may be permitted in Limited Development Areas where practicable (e.g. where physically feasible in terms of access, water depths, wind protection, etc.).<PRTPAGE P="21"/>
            </P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2. Applications for Shoreline Use Permits</HD>
            <P>a. Applications for private Shoreline Use Permits will be reviewed with full consideration of the policies set forth in this and referenced regulations, and the Shoreline Management Plan. Fees associated with the Shoreline Use Permit shall be paid prior to issuing the permit. Plans and specifications of the proposed facility shall be submitted and approved prior to the start of construction. Submissions should include engineering details, structural design, anchorage method, and construction materials; the type, size, location and ownership of the facility; expected duration of use; and an indication of willingness to abide by the applicable regulations and terms and conditions of the permit. Permit applications shall also identify and locate any land-based support facilities and any specific safety considerations.</P>
            <P>b. Permits will be issued by the district commander or his/her authorized representative on ENG Form 4264-R (Application for Shoreline Use Permit) (appendix B). Computer generated forms may be substituted for ENG Form 4264-R provided all information is included. The computer generated form will be designated, “ENG Form 4264-R-E, Oct 87 (Electronic generation approved by USACE, Oct 87)”.</P>
            <P>c. The following are guides to issuance of Shoreline Use Permits:</P>
            <P>(1) Use of boat mooring facilities, including piers and boat (shelters) houses, will be limited to vessel or watercraft mooring and storage of gear essential to vessel or watercraft operation.</P>
            <P>(2) Private floating recreation facilities, including boat mooring facilities shall not be constructed or used for human habitation or in a manner which gives the appearance of converting Federal public property on which the facility is located to private, exclusive use. New docks with enclosed sides (i.e. boathouses) are prohibited.</P>
            <P>(3) No private floating facility will exceed the minimum size required to moor the owner's boat or boats plus the minimum size required for an enclosed storage locker of oars, life preservers and other items essential to watercraft operation. Specific size limitations may be established in the project Shoreline Management Plan.</P>
            <P>(4) All private floating recreation facilities including boat mooring facilities will be constructed in accordance with plans and specifications, approved by the resource manager, or a written certification from a licensed engineer, stating the facility is structurally safe will accompany the initial submission of the plans and specifications.</P>
            <P>(5) Procedures regarding permits for individual facilities shall also apply to permits for non-commercial group mooring facilities.</P>
            <P>(6) Facilities attached to the shore shall be securely anchored by means of moorings which do not obstruct the free use of the shoreline, nor damage vegetation or other natural features. Anchoring to vegetation is prohibited.</P>
            <P>(7) Electrical service and equipment leading to or on private mooring facilities must not pose a safety hazard nor conflict with other recreational use. Electrical installations must be weatherproof and meet all current applicable electrical codes and regulations. The facility must be equipped with quick disconnect fittings mounted above the flood pool elevation. All electrical installations must conform to the National Electric Code and all state, and local codes and regulations. In those states where electricians are licensed, registered, or otherwise certified, a copy of the electrical certification must be provided to the resource manager before a Shoreline Use Permit can be issued or renewed. The resource manager will require immediate removal or disconnection of any electrical service or equipment that is not certified (if appropriate), does not meet code, or is not safely maintained. All new electrical lines will be installed underground. This will require a separate real estate instrument for the service right-of-way. Existing overhead lines will be allowed, as long as they meet all applicable electrical codes, regulations and above guidelines, to include compatibility and safety related to fluctuating water levels.</P>
            <P>(8) Private floating recreation facilities will not be placed so as to interfere with any authorized project purposes, including navigation, or create a safety or health hazard.</P>
            <P>(9) The district commander or his/her authorized representative may place special conditions on the permit when deemed necessary. Requests for waivers of shoreline management plan permit conditions based on health conditions will be reviewed on a case by case basis by the Operations Manager. Efforts will be made to reduce onerous requirements when a limiting health condition is obvious or when an applicant provides a doctor's certification of need for conditions which are not obvious.</P>
            <P>(10) Vegetation modification, including but not limited to, cutting, pruning, chemical manipulation, removal or seeding by private individuals is allowed only in those areas designated as Limited Development Areas or Protected Shoreline Areas. An existing (as of July 1, 1987) vegetation modification permit, within a shoreline allocation which normally would not allow vegetation modification, should be grandfathered. Permittees will not create the appearance of private ownership of public lands.</P>

            <P>(11) The term of a permit for vegetation modification will be for five years. Where possible, such permits will be consolidated with other shoreline management permits into a single permit. The district commander <PRTPAGE P="22"/>is authorized to issue vegetation modification permits of less than five years for one-time requests or to aid in the consolidation of shoreline management permits.</P>
            <P>(12) When issued a permit for vegetative modification, the permittee will delineate the government property line, as surveyed and marked by the government, in a clear but unobtrusive manner approved by the district commander and in accordance with the project Shoreline Management Plan and the conditions of the permit. Other adjoining owners may also delineate the common boundary subject to these same conditions. This delineation may include, but is not limited to, boundary plantings and fencing. The delineation will be accomplished at no cost to the government.</P>
            <P>(13) No permit will be issued for vegetation modification in Protected Shoreline Areas until the environmental impacts of the proposed modification are assesed by the resource manager and it has been determined that no significant adverse impacts will result. The effects of the proposed modification on water quality will also be considered in making this determination.</P>
            <P>(14) The original of the completed permit application is to be retained by the permittee. A duplicate will be retained in the resource manager's office.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">3. Permit Revocation</HD>
            <P>Permits may be revoked by the district commander when it is determined that the public interest requires such revocation or when the permittee fails to comply with terms and conditions of the permit, the Shoreline Management Plan, or of this regulation. Permits for duck blinds and ice fishing shelters will be issued to cover a period not to exceed 30 days prior to and 30 days after the season.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">4. Removal of Facilities</HD>
            <P>Facilities not removed when specified in the permit or when requested after termination or revocation of the permit will be treated as unauthorized structures pursuant to 36 CFR 327.20.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">5. Posting of Permit Number</HD>
            <P>Each district will procure 5″ × 8″ or larger printed permit tags of light metal or plastic for posting. The permit display tag shall be posted on the facility and/or on the land area covered by the permit, so that it can be visually checked, with ease in accordance with instructions provided by the resource manager. Facilities or activities permitted under special provisions should be identified in a way that will set apart from other facilities or activities.</P>

            <P>1. This permit is granted solely to the applicant for the purpose described on the attached permit.</P>
            <P>2. The permittee agrees to and does hereby release and agree to save and hold the Government harmless from any and all causes of action, suits at law or equity, or claims or demands or from any liability of any nature whatsoever for or on account of any damages to persons or property, including a permitted facility, growing out of the ownership, construction, operation or maintenance by the permittee of the permitted facilities and/or activities.</P>
            <P>3. Ownership, construction, operation, use and maintenance of a permitted facility are subject to the Government's navigation servitude.</P>
            <P>4. No attempt shall be made by the permittee to forbid the full and free use by the public of all public waters and/or lands at or adjacent to the permitted facility or to unreasonably interfere with any authorized project purposes, including navigation in connection with the ownership, construction, operation or maintenance of a permitted facility and/or activity.</P>
            <P>5. The permittee agrees that if subsequent operations by the Government require an alteration in the location of a permitted facility and/or activity or if in the opinion of the district commander a permitted facility and/or activity shall cause unreasonable obstruction to navigation or that the public interest so requires, the permittee shall be required, upon written notice from the district commander to remove, alter, or relocate the permitted facility, without expense to the Government.</P>
            <P>6. The Government shall in no case be liable for any damage or injury to a permitted facility which may be caused by or result from subsequent operations undertaken by the Government for the improvement of navigation or for other lawful purposes, and no claims or right to compensation shall accrue from any such damage. This includes any damage that may occur to private property if a facility is removed for noncompliance with the conditions of the permit.</P>
            <P>7. Ownership, construction, operation, use and maintenance of a permitted facility and/or activity are subject to all applicable Federal, state and local laws and regulations. Failure to abide by these applicable laws and regulations may be cause for revocation of the permit.</P>

            <P>8. This permit does not convey any property rights either in real estate or material; and does not authorize any injury to private property or invasion of private rights or any infringement of Federal, state or local laws <PRTPAGE P="23"/>or regulations, nor does it obviate the necessity of obtaining state or local assent required by law for the construction, operation, use or maintenance of a permitted facility and/or activity.</P>
            <P>9. The permittee agrees to construct the facility within the time limit agreed to on the permit issuance date. The permit shall become null and void if construction is not completed within that period. Further, the permittee agrees to operate and maintain any permitted facility and/or activity in a manner so as to provide safety, minimize any adverse impact on fish and wildlife habitat, natural, environmental, or cultural resources values and in a manner so as to minimize the degradation of water quality.</P>
            <P>10. The permittee shall remove a permitted facility within 30 days, at his/her expense, and restore the waterway and lands to a condition accepted by the resource manager upon termination or revocation of this permit or if the permittee ceases to use, operate or maintain a permitted facility and/or activity. If the permittee fails to comply to the satisfaction of the resource manager, the district commander may remove the facility by contract or otherwise and the permittee agrees to pay all costs incurred thereof.</P>
            <P>11. The use of a permitted boat dock facility shall be limited to the mooring of the permittee's vessel or watercraft and the storage, in enclosed locker facilities, of his/her gear essential to the operation of such vessel or watercraft.</P>
            <P>12. Neither a permitted facility nor any houseboat, cabin cruiser, or other vessel moored thereto shall be used as a place of habitation or as a full or part-time residence or in any manner which gives the appearance of converting the public property, on which the facility is located, to private use.</P>
            <P>13. Facilities granted under this permit will not be leased, rented, sub-let or provided to others by any means of engaging in commercial activity(s) by the permittee or his/her agent for monetary gain. This does not preclude the permittee from selling total ownership to the facility.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Policy.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) The objective of Corps of Engineers resources management is to maximize public enjoyment and use of the lands, waters, forests, and associated recreational resources, consistent with their aesthetic and biological values. Such management includes efforts to preserve and enhance the environmental amenities that are the source of the recreational value associated with the project and to allow such other new and innovative uses of the projects that are not detrimental thereto.</P>
                  <P>(b) Seaplane operations at water resource development projects administered by the Chief of Engineers may involve hazards including, but not limited to, conflicting recreational activities, floating debris, and underwater hazards, which may be accentuated by the normal fluctutations of water levels.</P>
                  <P>(c) Seaplane operations may be prohibited or restricted at such water resource development projects, or portions thereof, for a variety of management reasons. Prohibiting or restricting seaplane operations in certain portions within a project in no way implies that safety hazards to seaplane operations or to other recreation users may not exist in other portions of such project.</P>
                  <P>(d) The operation of a seaplane at Corps projects is at the risk of the plane's owner, operator, and passenger(s). The responsibility to ascertain whether seaplane operations are permitted, prohibited or restricted at such projects, and portions thereof, is incumbent upon the person(s) contemplating the use of, or using, such waters.</P>

                  <P>(a) All operations of the aircraft while upon the water shall be in accordance with the marine rules of the road for power boats or vessels.</P>
                  <P>(b) Seaplanes on project waters and lands in excess of 24 hours shall be securely moored at mooring facilities and at locations permitted by the District Engineer. Seaplanes may be temporarily moored on project waters and lands, except in areas prohibited by the District Engineer, for periods less than 24 hours providing that—</P>
                  <P>(1) The mooring is safe, secure, and accomplished so as not to damage the rights of the government or members of the public and</P>
                  <P>(2) The operator remains in the vicinity of the seaplane and reasonably available to relocate the seaplane if necessary.</P>
                  <P>(c) No commercial operation of seaplanes from project waters will be allowed without written approval of the District Engineer following consultation with and the necessary clearance from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and other appropriate public authorities and affected interests.</P>
                  <P>(d) Seaplanes may not be operated at Corps projects between sunset and sunrise unless adequate lighting and supervision are available.</P>
                  <P>(e) Requests for public commercial facilities in support of seaplanes will be handled under normal concession policies.</P>
                  <P>(f) Permits for floating and nonfloating structures of any kind, in, on, or affecting project waters, under the management of the Resource Manager, including waters under lease, license or other outgrant agreement, shall be handled in accordance with the lakeshore management plan or policy statement for the project involved, § 327.19 of title 36, Code of Federal Regulations and, where required by statute or regulation, section 10 of the River and Harbor Act (approved March 3, 1899) and section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (Pub. L. 92-500).</P>
                  <P>(g) Appropriate signs should be employed to inform users of projects, or portions thereof, where seaplane operations are permitted.</P>

                  <SUBJECT>Procedures.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) In order to protect the integrity and all authorized uses of Corps projects and the safety of all users of the lake projects, the District Engineer shall:</P>
                  <P>(1) Examine and investigate each Corps project within his district which a seaplane operator could conceivably attempt to use for seaplane operations, and determine those projects, or portions thereof, in which seaplane operations should be prohibited.</P>
                  <P>(2) Establish such restrictions on seaplane operations as he deems necessary or desirable in accordance with these regulations for other areas. Seaplane takeoff and landing maneuvers within specified distances of the shoreline, bridges, causeways, water utility crossings, dams, and similar structures should be prohibited.</P>
                  <P>(3) Prior to concluding any such examination and investigation, consult with the FAA, appropriate State aeronautical agency, lessee or licensee of outgranted lands, the Coast Guard, and state boating law administrators, and use his best efforts to consult with other interested or affected public authorities and private interests for their guidance, particularly for those projects which are regularly used by the public for recreational purposes or are located in the vicinity of actively used airports, air fields, or densely populated areas. News releases, public notice, and congressional liaison should be used. Public hearings are encouraged.</P>
                  <P>(4) In making his investigation, examination, and determination, consider environmental factors in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), Pub. L. 91-190—particularly should he consider the impact that seaplane operations may have on the safety at the project, aquatic, fish and wildlife, noise levels, recreation, and air and water quality. Prior to concluding such investigation and examination, he shall prepare an environmental impact assessment (EIA) and, if necessary, an environmental impact statement (EIS) assessing the environmental impacts of permitting seaplanes to operate at the projects, or portions thereof, in his district.</P>
                  <P>(5) Place on Corps maps, brochures and otherwise adequately apprise the public and interested agencies of projects, or portions thereof, where seaplane operations are prohibited or restricted. Each map, brochure, or other notice should clearly indicate that operation of a seaplane at Corps projects is at the risk of the plane's owner, operator, and/or passenger(s).</P>
                  <P>(6) Notify the FAA by letter of projects, or portions thereof, where seaplane operations are prohibited or restricted. The letter should use the words “seaplane operations prohibited,” or “seaplane operations restricted,” describe the geographical location of such areas as precisely as possible, describe any restrictions, include a telephone number for FAA to contact the District, and be sent to: Federal Aviation Administration, Area Traffic Service, Flight Services Division (AAT-432), 800 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20591.</P>
                  <P>(b) The removal of the present prohibition on seaplane operations will be effective one year from the date of publication of these regulations. The District Engineer should complete the examination, investigation, determination and notification to the FAA of projects, or portions thereof, where seaplane operations are prohibited or restricted, within one year from the date of this regulation. The District Engineer may extend the present prohibition for up to one additional year if he cannot complete his examination, investigation, determination, and notification within one year. In such event, he should notify the FAA by letter and publish other appropriate notices. Any further extension of time will require the approval of the Chief of Engineers.</P>

                  <P>(c) After he has completed his examination, investigation, determination and notification of the FAA of projects, or portions thereof where seaplane operations will be prohibited or restricted, The District Engineer should periodically reevaluate his determination as additional operational data becomes available. He may modify, delete, or add projects, or portions thereof, where seaplane operations are prohibited or restricted. Except where immediate action is required, he should <PRTPAGE P="27"/>consult with appropriate public authorities and private interests for their guidance with regard to such actions. Notification of these actions shall be forwarded to the FAA as indicated in paragraph (a)(6) of this section.</P>

                  <SECTNO>§ 330.5</SECTNO>
                  <SUBJECT>Policy.</SUBJECT>

                  <P>(a) It is the policy of the Corps of Engineers to provide, to the extent of its authorities, a safe and healthful environment for public use of lands and waters at Civil Works water resource development projects. To insure this safe and healthful environment, and to augment the citation authorities granted to the Corps of Engineers by reference § 330.3(b), District Engineers, subject to the authority of the Division Engineers, as set out below, are hereby delegated the authority to contract with States or their political subdivisions to obtain increased law enforcement services at Civil Works water resource development projects. Division Engineers are hereby delegated the authority to approve any minor deviations from this regulation except that any substantial deviations from the policies expressed within this regulation will require the prior approval of the Chief of Engineers or his authorized representative. Any required approval for deviation shall be made prior to the execution of the contract. When fiscal year 1978 and fiscal year 1979 work allowances are issued, instructions will be furnished on reporting requirements and the control of expenditures.<PRTPAGE P="28"/>
                  </P>
                  <P>(b) Contracts for law enforcement services, as authorized in § 330.5(a), shall be subject to the terms and conditions as provided for within this regulation and in accordance with standard contracting and accounting procedures applicable to the Corps of Engineers.</P>
                  <P>(c) This regulation is not intended to diminish or otherwise limit the existing law enforcement responsibilities of the State or local law enforcement agencies.</P>
                  <P>(d) Contract law enforcement personnel shall not be given Federal citation authority for enforcement of regulations contained in title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter III nor shall they be empowered to enforce such regulations. These regulations shall remain the responsibility of the Corps of Engineers.</P>
                  <P>(e) Contracts for increased law enforcement shall be for those projects or portions of projects that are operated and maintained by the Corps of Engineers. Law enforcement services will not be provided under this program to those outgrant areas operated and maintained by a non-Federal sponsor.</P>

                  <SECTNO>§ 330.6</SECTNO>
                  <SUBJECT>Criteria.</SUBJECT>
                  <P>(a) In order to provide reimbursement for law enforcement services supplied by a State or local law enforcement agency, a contract must be executed and approved in accordance with this regulation prior to the provisions of such services.</P>
                  <P>(b) The authorized contract law enforcement program extends only to 30 September 1979. Law enforcement services acquired by contract under this program shall be limited to those increased law enforcement services required to meet the needs of the public during peak visitation periods. Accordingly, the contract period shall not extend beyond the dates of 1 April through 30 September inclusive, and in no event shall the contract be written for more than 120 days within that time period. The contract may provide for an option to renew for a similar, additional period not to exceed 120-day period in Fiscal Year 1979. Any exceptions to this criteria must be approved by the Chief of Engineers or his authorized representative.</P>
                  <P>(c) Contracts shall be consummated only with those public law enforcement agencies legally empowered to enforce State and local criminal and civil laws within their respective political jurisdictions. In light of this requirement and the authority cited in § 330.3(c), it is recognized that sole source negotiations may necessarily be utilized in the procurement of these services. In negotiating law enforcement contracts with these agencies the District Engineer must determine the reasonableness of the price for the law enforcement services offered under the contract. Such a determination shall be made prior to execution of the contract, in accordance with the applicable Contract Cost Principles and Procedures as set out in ASPR, section 15, part 7, and as subject to the policies contained in this regulation. Such a determination shall be contained in the official contract file and must accompany any requests for deviations from the Division Engineer or Chief of Engineers as provided for in § 330.5(a) of this regulation. Contract law enforcement personnel must meet all the qualifications, including minimal law enforcement training, required by State and local laws and regulations.</P>
                  <P>(d) The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment and supplies which are required to provide the increased law enforcement services contracted for by the District Engineer. The Corps of Engineers shall not reimburse the contractor for the purchase of any equipment or supplies desired by the contractor for use under this program. However, the Corps of Engineers shall reimburse the contractor for the reasonable costs incurred by him in the rental or use of such equipment which is allocated to the work performed by him under the contract. Such use shall include:</P>

                  <P>(1) A depreciation or use allowance for such equipment as determined by the service life evaluation system used by the contractor, and (2) the costs of necessary maintenance, repair, and upkeep of the property which neither adds to the permanent value of the property nor appreciably prolongs its intended life, but keeps it at an efficient operating condition.<PRTPAGE P="29"/>
                  </P>
                  <P>(e) Reimbursement for law enforcement services shall be considered only for increased law enforcement services to meet needs during peak visitation periods. Each District Engineer shall evaluate and establish a normal law enforcement service standard for each contract situation and include such standard in the plan of operation to be developed in accordance with § 330.6(h). Each District Engineer shall evaluate the existing law enforcement services now being provided by State or local law enforcement agencies at those water resources projects or recreation areas where it is anticipated that law enforcement service contracts may be executed, and determine the scope including the type and amount, of law enforcement service which exceeds the normal law enforcement standard, and which will become eligible for reimbursement under the contract. Normally, requests by the District Engineer or his authorized representative for emergency or unanticipated law enforcement assistance will be considered nonreimbursable. Increased law enforcement services, eligible for reimbursement under the terms of the contract, shall be those regularly scheduled patrols or surveillance in excess of the normal law enforcement standard presently being provided by the contractor.</P>
                  <P>(f) An appropriate orientation program will be given by Corps personnel to all contract law enforcement personnel assigned to Corps projects. The purpose of this orientation will be to familiarize the contract law enforcement personnel with the policies and procedures of the Corps of Engineers, and to familiarize Corps personnel with the functions and duties of the State or local law enforcement agency. The Corps of Engineers shall reimburse the contractor for the cost per man hour as set out in § 330.6(h)(4) for attending the orientation program.</P>
                  <P>(g) The contractor shall be required to keep a record of the services provided to the District under the terms and conditions of the contract in accordance with the criteria established in the plan of operation required in § 330.6(h).</P>
                  <P>(h) The District Engineer, in cooperation with the Contractor, shall prepare a Plan of Operation for the Provision of law enforcement services as an attachment to the contract. The Plan of Operation shall contain, but not necessarily be limited to, the following information:</P>
                  <P>(1) Identify, by name and location, the project or projects and specific areas (recreation and others) that require law enforcement services.</P>
                  <P>(2) Describe the normal law enforcement services to be provided by the Contractor without reimbursement by the Government (see § 330.6(e)). Identify time of day, number of hours-per-day number of days-per-week, and the number of patrols.</P>
                  <P>(3) Describe the increased law enforcement services to be provided by the Contractor under the contract. Identify the time-of-day, number of hours-per-day, number of days-per-week, number of patrols, manpower per patrol, and effective starting and ending dates.</P>
                  <P>(4) Identify the cost-per-man-hour for the provision of reimbursable law enforcement services, and identify the costs for utilization and operation, maintenance and repair of such equipment as allocated for use under the contract. (See § 330.6(d).)</P>
                  <P>(5) The District Engineer and the Contractor should designate specific individuals to issue or receive requests for reimbursable law enforcement services under the contract.</P>
                  <P>(6) Describe the billing procedures to be utilized for the increased law enforcement services. The Contractor shall provide, at a minimum, the total charges, the number of hours involved, and starting and ending dates of the billing period.</P>

                  <P>(7) The Contractor shall prepare a Daily Law Enforcement Log (see § 330.6(g) for the law enforcement services rendered as specified in § 330.6(h)(3)). These logs shall be compiled by the Contractor and submitted to the District Engineer or his designated representative on a regular basis throughout the life of the contract. It is intended by this reporting requirement to minimize the paperwork burden on behalf of the Contractor while, at the same time, providing assurance to the Government with an adequate information base on <PRTPAGE P="30"/>which to administer the law enforcement services being provided under the contract. Any requirement for additional information to be contained in these reports due to unique or special circumstances encountered in negotiating a Plan of Operation with a particular law enforcement jurisdiction must receive the prior approval of the Division Engineer.</P>

                  <P>(a) The regulations contained in this part apply to those lands and waters within the established boundary of the Falls of the Ohio National Wildlife Conservation Area (WCA). Included in this boundary, which was published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> of August 12, 1982, are publicly and privately owned lands, waters and improvements. The Federal Government, acting through the Corps of Engineers, will acquire such rights to privately-owned properties in the WCA as are necessary to carry out the purposes of title II, Pub. L. 97-137. The regulations prescribed herein are for the use, management and protection of the resources of the WCA and all persons entering, using or visiting within the boundaries of the WCA are subject to these regulations. All other applicable Federal, State and local laws and regulations remain in <PRTPAGE P="31"/>full force and effect. The District Engineer, US Army Corps of Engineers, exercises non-exclusive jurisdiction over the lands and waters of the WCA and enforces these regulations.</P>
                  <P>(b) The WCA boundary encompasses an existing hydroelectric generating station and the McAlpine Locks and Dam, operating navigation structures which are part of the authorized Ohio River Navigation System. The continued operation and maintenance of this system take precedence over the purposes of the WCA, except that such operation and maintenance will be consistent with the basic purpose of the WCA as regards prohibition of hunting, vandalism, and dumping of refuse. Management of the WCA to achieve its intended purposes will, to the extent practicable, be accomplished in a manner consistent and compatible with continued generation of electricity and navigation on the Ohio River, including operation and maintenance of the McAlpine Locks and Dam and the Louisville Repair Station and material storage areas located on Shippingport Island.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
          <P>This part provides guidance on the execution of the responsibilities given by Congress to the American Battle Monuments Commission (Commission) regarding memorials and monuments commemorating the service of American Armed Forces at locations outside the United States.</P>
        </SECTION>
        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 401.2</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Applicability and scope.</SUBJECT>
          <P>This part applies to all agencies of the United States Government, State and local governments of the United States and all American citizens, and private and public American organizations that have established or plan to establish any permanent memorial commemorating the service of American Armed Forces at a location outside the United States. This chapter does not address temporary monuments, plaques and other elements that deployed American Armed Forces wish to erect at a facility occupied by them outside the United States. Approval of any such temporary monument, plaque or other element is a matter to be determined by the concerned component of the Department of Defense consistent with host nation law and any other constraints applicable to the presence of American Armed Forces at the overseas location.</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 401.3</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Background.</SUBJECT>
          <P>Following World War I many American individuals, organizations and governmental entities sought to create memorials in Europe commemorating the service of American Armed Forces that participated in that war. Frequently such well-intended efforts were undertaken without adequate regard for many issues including host nation approvals, design adequacy, and funding for perpetual maintenance. As a result, in 1923 Congress created the American Battle Monuments Commission to generally oversee all memorials created by Americans or American entities to commemorate the service of American Armed Forces at locations outside the United States.</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 401.4</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Responsibility.</SUBJECT>
          <P>The Commission is responsible for building and maintaining appropriate memorials commemorating the service of American Armed Forces at any place outside the United States where Armed Forces have served since April 6, 1917.</P>
        </SECTION>
        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 401.5</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Control and supervision of materials, design, and building.</SUBJECT>
          <P>The Commission controls the design and prescribes regulations for the building of all memorial monuments and buildings commemorating the service of American Armed Forces that are built in a foreign country or political division of the foreign country that authorizes the Commission to carry out those duties and powers.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Approval by National Commission of Fine Arts.</SUBJECT>
          <P>A design for a memorial to be constructed at the expense of the United States Government must be approved by the National Commission of Fine Arts before the Commission can accept it.</P>
        </SECTION>
        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 401.7</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Cooperation with other than Government entities.</SUBJECT>
          <P>The Commission has the discretion to cooperate with citizens of the United States, States, municipalities, or associations desiring to build war memorials outside the United States.</P>
        </SECTION>
        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 401.8</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Requirement for Commission approval.</SUBJECT>
          <P>No administrative agency of the United States Government may give assistance to build a memorial unless the plan for the memorial has been approved by the Commission. In deciding whether to approve a memorial request the Commission will apply the criteria set forth in § 401.9.</P>

              <ENT>Requests made during or immediately after an event are not generally subject to approval. The Commission will not approve a memorial until at least 10 years after the officially designated end of the event. It should be noted that this is the same period of time made applicable to the establishment of memorials in the District of Columbia and its environs by the Commemorative Works Act.</ENT>

              <ENT>As a general rule, memorials should be erected to organizations rather than to troops from a particular locality of the United States.</ENT>

            <ROW>
              <ENT I="01" O="xl">(h) Does the contribution of the element to be honored warrant a separate memorial?</ENT>
              <ENT>The commemoration should normally be through a memorial that would have the affect of honoring all of the American Armed Forces personnel who participated rather than a select segment of the organizational participants.</ENT>

          <P>Pursuant to the provisions of 36 U.S.C. 2106(d), the Commission operates a Monument Trust Fund Program (MTFP) in countries where there is a Commission presence. Under the MTFP, the Commission may assume both the sponsor's legal interests in the monument and responsibility for its maintenance. To be accepted in the Monument Trust Fund Program, an organization must develop an acceptable maintenance plan and transfer sufficient monies to the Commission to fully fund the maintenance plan for at least 30 years. to The Commission will put this money into a trust fund of United States Treasury instruments that earn interest. Prior to acceptance into the MTFP, the sponsor must perform any deferred maintenance necessary to bring the monument up to a mutually agreeable standard. At that time, the Commission may assume the sponsoring organization's interest in the property and responsibility for all maintenance and other decisions concerning the monument. Once accepted into the program, the Commission will provide for all necessary maintenance of the monument and charge the cost to the trust fund. to The sponsoring organization or others interested in the monument may add to the trust fund at any time to insure that adequate funds remain available. to The Commission will maintain the monument <PRTPAGE P="39"/>for as long a period as the trust fund account permits.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Demolition criteria.</SUBJECT>
          <P>As authorized by the provisions of 36 U.S.C. 2106(e), the Commission may take necessary action to demolish any war memorial built outside the United States by a citizen of the United States, a State, a political subdivision of a State, a governmental authority (except a department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States Government), a foreign agency, or a private association and to dispose of the site of the memorial in a way the Commission decides is proper, if—</P>
          <P>(a) The appropriate foreign authorities agree to the demolition; and</P>
          <P>(b)(1) The sponsor of the memorial consents to the demolition; or</P>
          <P>(2) The memorial has fallen into disrepair and a reasonable effort by the Commission has failed—</P>
          <P>(i) To persuade the sponsor to maintain the memorial at a standard acceptable to the Commission; or</P>
          <P>(ii) To locate the sponsor.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Organization.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The brief description of the central organization of the American Battle Monuments Commission follows:</P>
          <P>(1) The Commission is composed of not more than 11 members appointed by the President.</P>
          <P>(2) The day to day operation of the Commission is under the direction of a Secretary appointed by the President.</P>
          <P>(3) Principal Officials include the Executive Director, Director of Finance, Director of Procurement and Contracting, Director of Engineering, Maintenance, and Operations and Director of Personnel and Administration.</P>
          <P>(4) The Commission also creates temporary offices when tasked with major additional responsibilities not of a permanent nature.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Locations.</E> (1) The principal offices of the American Battle Monuments Commission are located at Courthouse Plaza II, Suite 500, 2300 Clarendon Boulevard, Arlington, VA 22201. Persons desiring to visit offices or employees of the American Battle Monuments Commission should write or telephone ahead (703-696-6897 or 703-696-6895) to make an appointment.</P>
          <P>(2) Field offices are located in Paris, France; Rome, Italy; Manila, Republic of the Philippines; the Republic of Panama; and Mexico City, Mexico.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 404.4</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Access to information.</SUBJECT>

          <P>(a) The American Battle Monuments Commission makes available information pertaining to Commission matters within the scope of 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2) by publishing them electronically at the ABMC home page at <E T="03">http://www.abmc.gov.</E>
          </P>

          <P>(b) The ABMC FOIA Officer is responsible for acting on all initial requests. Individuals wishing to file a request under the Freedom of Information Act <PRTPAGE P="40"/>(FOIA) should address their request in writing to the FOIA Officer, American Battle Monuments Commission, Courthouse Plaza II, Suite 500, 2300 Clarendon Boulevard, Arlington, VA 22201 (telephone 703-696-6897 or 703-696-6895). Requests for information shall be as specific as possible.</P>
          <P>(c) Upon receipt of any request for information or records, the FOIA Officer will determine within 20 days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays and legal public holidays) after the receipt of such request whether it is appropriate to grant the request and will immediately provide written notification to the person making the request. If the request is denied, the written notification to the person making the request shall include the names of the individuals who participated in the determination, the reasons for the denial, and a notice that an appeal may be lodged within the American Battle Monuments Commission. (Receipt of a request as used herein means the date the request is received in the office of the FOIA Officer.)</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Expedited processing.</E> (1) Requests and appeals will be taken out of order and given expedited treatment whenever it is determined that they involve:</P>
          <P>(i) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual;</P>
          <P>(ii) An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information;</P>
          <P>(iii) The loss of substantial due process rights; or</P>
          <P>(iv) A matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity which effect public confidence.</P>
          <P>(2) A request for expedited processing may be made at the time of the initial request for records or at any later time.</P>
          <P>(3) A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct to the best of that person's knowledge and belief, explaining in detail the basis for requesting expedited processing. For example, a requester within the category described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, if not a full-time member of the news media, must establish that he or she is a person whose main professional activity or occupation is information dissemination, though it need not be his or her sole occupation. A requester within the category (d)(1)(ii) of this section also must establish a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request, beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally. The formality of certification may be waived as a matter of administrative discretion.</P>
          <P>(4) Within 10 days of its receipt of a request for expedited processing, ABMC will decide whether to grant it and will notify the requester of the decision. If a request for expedited treatment is granted, the request will be given priority and will be processed as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited processing is denied, any appeal of that decision will be acted on expeditiously.</P>
          <P>(e) Appeals shall be set forth in writing within 30 days of receipt of a denial and addressed to the FOIA Officer at the address specified in paragraph (b) of this section. The appeal shall include a statement explaining the basis for the appeal. Determinations of appeals will be set forth in writing and signed by the Executive Director, or his designee, within 20 days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays). If, on appeal, the denial is in whole or in part upheld, the written determination will also contain a notification of the provisions for judicial review and the names of the persons who participated in the determination.</P>

          <P>(f) In unusual circumstances, the time limits prescribed in paragraphs (c) and (e) of this section may be extended for not more than 10 days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, or legal public holidays). Extensions may be granted by the FOIA Officer. The extension period may be split between the initial request and the appeal but in no instance may the total period exceed 10 working days. Extensions will be by written notice to the persons making the request and will set forth the reasons for the extension and the date the determination is expected.<PRTPAGE P="41"/>
          </P>
          <P>(g) With respect to a request for which a written notice under paragraph (f) of this section extends the time limits prescribed under paragraph (c) of this section, the agency shall notify the person making the request if the request cannot be processed within the time limit specified in paragraph (f) of this section and shall provide the person an opportunity to limit the scope of the request so that it may be processed within that time limit or an opportunity to arrange with the agency an alternative time frame for processing the request or a modified request. Refusal by the person to reasonably modify the request or arrange such an alternative time frame shall be considered as a factor in determining whether exceptional circumstances exist for purposes of 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(C). When ABMC reasonably believes that a requester, or a group of requestors acting in concert, has submitted requests that constitute a single request, involving clearly related matters, ABMC may aggregate those requests for purposes of this paragraph. One element to be considered in determining whether a belief would be reasonable is the time period over which the requests have occurred.</P>
          <P>(h) As used herein, but only to the extent reasonably necessary to the proper processing of the particular request, the term unusual circumstances means:</P>
          <P>(1) The need to search for and collect the requested records from establishments that are separated from the office processing the request;</P>
          <P>(2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in a single request; or</P>
          <P>(3) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or more components of the agency which have a substantial subject matter interest therein.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Inspection and copying.</SUBJECT>
          <P>When a request for information has been approved pursuant to § 404.4, the person making the request may make an appointment to inspect or copy the materials requested during regular business hours by writing or telephoning the FOIA Officer at the address or telephone number listed in § 404.4(b). Such materials may be copied and reasonable facilities will be made available for that purpose. Copies of individual pages of such materials will be made available at the price per page specified in § 404.7(d); however, the right is reserved to limit to a reasonable quantity the copies of such materials which may be made available in this manner when copies also are offered for sale by the Superintendent of Documents.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
          <P>For the purpose of these regulations:</P>
          <P>(a) All the terms defined in the Freedom of Information Act apply.</P>
          <P>(b) A <E T="03">statute specifically providing for setting the level of fees for particular types of records</E> (5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A)(vi)) means any statute that specifically requires a government agency, such as the Government Printing Office (GPO) or the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), to set the level of fees for particular types of records, in order to:</P>
          <P>(1) Serve both the general public and private sector organizations by conveniently making available government information;</P>
          <P>(2) Ensure that groups and individuals pay the cost of publications and other services that are for their special use so that these costs are not borne by the general taxpaying public;</P>
          <P>(3) Operate an information dissemination activity on a self-sustaining basis to the maximum extent possible; or</P>

          <P>(4) Return revenue to the Treasury for defraying, wholly or in part, appropriated funds used to pay the cost of disseminating government information. Statutes, such as the User Fee Statute, which only provide a general discussion of fees without explicitly requiring that an agency set and collect fees for particular documents do not supersede the Freedom of Information Act under section (a)(4)(A)(vi) of that statute.<PRTPAGE P="42"/>
          </P>
          <P>(c) The term <E T="03">direct costs</E> means those expenditures that ABMC actually incurs in searching for and duplicating (and in the case of commercial requesters, reviewing) documents to respond to a FOIA request. Direct costs include, for example, the salary of the employee performing work (the basic rate of pay for the employee plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating duplicating machinery. Not included in direct costs are overhead expenses such as costs of space, and heating or lighting the facility in which the records are stored.</P>
          <P>(d) The term <E T="03">search</E> means the process of looking for and retrieving records or information responsive to a request. It includes page-by-page or line-by-line identification of information within records and also includes reasonable efforts to locate and retrieve information from records maintained in electronic form or format. ABMC employees should ensure that searching for material is done in the most efficient and least expensive manner so as to minimize costs for both the agency and the requester. For example, employees should not engage in line-by-line search when merely duplicating an entire document would prove the less expensive and quicker method of complying with a request. Search should be distinguished, moreover, from review of material in order to determine whether the material is exempt from disclosure (see paragraph (f) of this section).</P>
          <P>(e) The term <E T="03">duplication</E> means the making of a copy of a document, or of the information contained in it, necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Such copies can take the form of paper, microform, audio-visual materials, or electronic records (e.g., magnetic tape or disk), among others. The requester's specified preference of form or format of disclosure will be honored if the record is readily reproducible in that format.</P>
          <P>(f) The term <E T="03">review</E> refers to the process of examining documents located in response to a request that is for a commercial use (<E T="03">see</E> paragraph (g) of this section) to determine whether any portion of any document located is permitted to be withheld. It also includes processing any documents for disclosure, e.g., doing all that is necessary to excise them and otherwise prepare them for release. Review does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.</P>
          <P>(g) The term <E T="03">commercial use request</E> refers to a request from or on behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made. In determining whether a requester properly belongs in this category, ABMC must determine the use to which a requester will put the documents requested. Moreover, where an ABMC employee has reasonable cause to doubt the use to which a requester will put the records sought, or where that use is not clear from the request itself, the employee should seek additional clarification before assigning the request to a specific category.</P>
          <P>(h) The term <E T="03">educational institution</E> refers to a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate higher education, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an institution of professional education, or an institution of vocational education, that operates a program or programs of scholarly research.</P>
          <P>(i) The term <E T="03">non-commercial scientific institution</E> refers to an institution that is not operated on a commercial basis (as that term is referenced in paragraph (g) of this section), and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.</P>
          <P>(j) The term <E T="03">representative of the news media</E> refers to any person actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public. The term news means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of periodicals (but only in those instances when they can qualify as disseminators of news) who make their products available for purchase or subscription <PRTPAGE P="43"/>by the general public. These examples are not intended to be all-inclusive. Moreover, as traditional methods of news delivery evolve (e.g., electronic dissemination of newspapers through telecommunications services), such alternative media would be included in this category. In the case of freelance journalists, they may be regarded as working for a news organization if they can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that organization, even though not actually employed by it. A publication contract would be the clearest proof, but ABMC may also look to the past publication record of a requester in making this determination.</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 404.7</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Fees to be charged—general.</SUBJECT>
          <P>ABMC shall charge fees that recoup the full allowable direct costs it incurs. Moreover, it shall use the most efficient and least costly methods to comply with requests for documents made under the FOIA. When documents that would be responsive to a request are maintained for distribution by agencies operating statutory-based fee schedule programs (see definition in § 404.6(b)), such as the NTIS, ABMC should inform requesters of the steps necessary to obtain records from those sources.</P>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Manual searches for records.</E> ABMC will charge at the salary rate(s) (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> basic pay plus 16 percent) of the employee(s) making the search.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Computer searches for records.</E> ABMC will charge at the actual direct cost of providing the service. This will include the cost of operating the central processing unit (CPU) for that portion of operating time that is directly attributable to searching for records responsive to a FOIA request and operator/programmer salary apportionable to the search.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Review of records.</E> Only requesters who are seeking documents for commercial use may be charged for time spent reviewing records to determine whether they are exempt from mandatory disclosure. Charges may be assessed only for the initial review; <E T="03">i.e.,</E> the review undertaken the first time ABMC analyzes the applicability of a specific exemption to a particular record or portion of a record. Records or portions of records withheld in full under an exemption that is subsequently determined not to apply may be reviewed again to determine the applicability of other exemptions not previously considered. The costs for such a subsequent review is assessable.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Duplication of records.</E> Records will be duplicated at a rate of $.15 per page. For copies prepared by computer, such as tapes or printouts, ABMC shall charge the actual cost, including operator time, of production of the tape or printout. For other methods of reproduction or duplication, ABMC will charge the actual direct costs of producing the document(s). If ABMC estimates that duplication charges are likely to exceed $25, it shall notify the requester of the estimated amount of fees, unless the requester has indicated in advance his willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. Such a notice shall offer a requester the opportunity to confer with agency personnel with the object of reformulating the request to meet his or her needs at a lower cost.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Other charges.</E> When it elects to charge them, ABMC will recover the full costs of providing services such as:</P>
          <P>(1) Certifying that records are true copies;</P>
          <P>(2) Sending records by special methods such as express mail.</P>
          <P>(3) Eight by ten inch black and white photographs—$3.75</P>
          <P>(4) Eight by ten inch color photographs—$5.00</P>
          <P>(5) $1.50 per publication</P>
          <P>(6) Video Purchase: The Price of Freedom—$13.00</P>
          <P>(f) Remittances shall be in the form either of a personal check or bank draft drawn on a bank in the United States, or a postal money order. Remittances shall be made payable to the order of the Treasury of the United States and mailed to the FOIA Officer, American Battle Monuments Commission, Courthouse Plaza II, Suite 500, 2300 Clarendon Blvd., Arlington, Virginia 22201</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">A receipt for fees paid will be given upon request.</E> Refund of fees paid for services actually rendered will not be made.</P>
          <P>(h) <E T="03">Restrictions on assessing fees.</E> With the exception of requesters seeking documents for a commercial use, <PRTPAGE P="44"/>ABMC will provide the first 100 pages of duplication and the first 2 hours of search time without charge. Moreover, ABMC will not charge fees to any requester, including commercial use requesters, if the cost of collecting a fee would be equal to or greater than the fee itself.</P>
          <P>(1) The elements to be considered in determining the cost of collecting a fee are the administrative costs of receiving and recording a requester's remittance, and processing the fee for deposit in the Treasury Department's special account.</P>

          <P>(2) For purposes of these restrictions on assessment of fees, the word <E T="03">pages</E> refers to paper copies of 8<FR>1/2</FR> × 11 or 11 × 14. Thus, requesters are not entitled to 100 microfiche or 100 computer disks, for example. A microfiche containing the equivalent of 100 pages or 100 pages of computer printout, does meet the terms of the restriction.</P>
          <P>(3) Similarly, the term <E T="03">search time</E> in this context has as its basis, manual search. To apply this term to searches made by computer, ABMC will determine the hourly cost of operating the central processing unit and the operator's hourly salary plus 16 percent. When the cost of search (including the operator time and the cost of operating the computer to process a request) equals the equivalent dollar amount of two hours of the salary of the person performing the search, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> the operator, ABMC will begin assessing charges for computer search.</P>
        </SECTION>
        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 404.8</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Fees to be charged—categories of requesters.</SUBJECT>
          <P>There are four categories of FOIA requesters: commercial use requesters; educational and noncommercial scientific institutions; representatives of the news media; and all other requesters. The specific levels of fees for each of these categories:</P>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Commercial use requesters.</E> When ABMC receives a request for documents for commercial use, it will assess charges that recover the full direct costs of searching for, reviewing for release, and duplicating the record sought. Requesters must reasonably describe the records sought. Commercial use requesters are not entitled to 2 hours of free search time nor 100 free pages of reproduction of documents. ABMC may recover the cost of searching for and reviewing records even if there is ultimately no disclosure of records (<E T="03">see</E> paragraph (b) of this section).</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Educational and noncommercial scientific institution requesters.</E> ABMC shall provide documents to requesters in this category for the cost of reproduction alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. To be eligible for inclusion in this category, requesters must show that the request is being made as authorized by and under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use, but are sought in furtherance of scholarly (if the request is from an educational institution) or scientific (if the request is from a non-commercial scientific institution) research. Requesters must reasonably describe the records sought.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Requesters who are representatives of the news media.</E> ABMC shall provide documents to requesters in this category when serving the news dissemination function for the cost of reproduction alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. To be eligible for inclusion in this category, a requester must meet the criteria in § 404.4(j), and his or her request must not be made for a commercial use. In reference to this class of requester, a request for records supporting the news dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered to be a request that is for a commercial use. Requesters must reasonably describe the records sought.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">All other requesters.</E> ABMC shall charge requesters who do not fit into any of the categories above fees that recover the full reasonable direct cost of searching for and reproducing records that are responsive to the request, except that the first 100 pages of reproduction and the first 2 hours of search time shall be furnished without charge. Moreover, requests for records about the requesters filed in ABMC's systems of records will continue to be treated under the fee provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 which permit fees only for reproduction. Requesters must reasonably describe the records sought.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Miscellaneous fee provisions.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Charging interest—notice and rate.</E> ABMC may begin assessing interest charges on an unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the day on which the billing was sent. The fact that the fee has been received by ABMC within the 30-day grace period, even if not processed, will suffice to stay the accrual of interest. Interest will be at the rate prescribed in section 3717 of Title 31 of the United States Code and will accrue from the date of the billing.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Charges for unsuccessful search.</E> ABMC may assess charges for time spent searching, even if it fails to locate the records or if records located are determined to be exempt from disclosure. If ABMC estimates that search charges are likely to exceed $25, it shall notify the requester of the estimated amount of fees, unless the requester has indicated in advance his willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. Such a notice shall offer the requester the opportunity to confer with agency personnel with the object of reformulating the request to meet his or her needs at a lower cost.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Aggregating requests.</E> A requester may not file multiple requests at the same time, each seeking portions of a document or documents, solely in order to avoid payment of fees. When ABMC reasonably believes that a requester, or a group of requestors acting in concert, has submitted requests that constitute a single request, involving clearly related matters, ABMC may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly. One element to be considered in determining whether a belief would be reasonable is the time period over which the requests have occurred.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Advance payments.</E> ABMC may not require a requester to make an advance payment, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> payment before work is commenced or continued on a request, unless:</P>
          <P>(1) ABMC estimates or determines that allowable charges that a requester may be required to pay are likely to exceed $250. Then, ABMC will notify the requester of the likely cost and obtain satisfactory assurance of full payment where the requester has a history of prompt payment of FOIA fees, or require an advance payment of an amount up to the full estimated charges in the case of requesters with no history of payment; or</P>

          <P>(2) A requester has previously failed to pay a fee charged in a timely fashion (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> within 30 days of the date of the billing). Then, ABMC may require the requester to pay the full amount owed plus any applicable interest as provided above or demonstrate that he or she has, in fact, paid the fee, and to make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated fee before the agency begins to process a new request or a pending request from that requester.</P>

          <P>(3) When ABMC acts under paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section, the administrative time limits prescribed in the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6) (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> 20 working days from receipt of initial requests and 20 working days from receipt of appeals from initial denial, plus permissible extensions of these time limits), will begin only after ABMC has received fee payments described in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section. Effect of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365). ABMC should comply with provisions of the Debt Collection Act, including disclosure to consumer reporting agencies and use of collection agencies, where appropriate, to encourage repayment.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Waiver or reduction of charges.</SUBJECT>
          <P>Fees otherwise chargeable in connection with a request for disclosure of a record shall be waived or reduced where it is determined that disclosure is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the <PRTPAGE P="49"/>program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not—</P>
          <P>(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons; or</P>
          <P>(2) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 406.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods.</E> The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is nor required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Time period for compliance.</E> The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by June 6, 1986, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by April 7, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by October 7, 1986, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—</P>
          <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped persons;</P>
          <P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;</P>
          <P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</P>
          <P>(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.</P>

          <P>(c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.</P>
          <P>(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 406.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Purpose and scope of the regulations in this part.</SUBJECT>
          <P>The regulations in this part set forth ABMC's procedures under the Privacy Act, as required by 5 U.S.C. 552a(f), with respect to systems of records maintained by ABMC. The rules in this part apply to all records maintained by ABMC that are retrieved by an individual's name or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual. These regulations establish procedures by which an individual may exercise the rights granted by the Privacy Act to determine whether an ABMC system of records contains a record pertaining to him or her; to gain access to such records; and to request correction or amendment of such records. These rules should be read together with the Privacy Act, which provides additional information about records maintained on individuals.</P>

          <P>Inquiries about ABMC's systems of records or implementation of the Privacy Act should be sent to the following address: American Battle Monuments Commission, Office of the General Counsel, 2300 Clarendon Boulevard, Suite 500, Arlington VA 22201.</P>
        </SECTION>
        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 407.4</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Procedures for acquiring access to ABMC records pertaining to an individual.</SUBJECT>
          <P>The following procedures apply to records that are contained in an ABMC system:</P>
          <P>(a) You may request to be notified if a system of records that you name contains records pertaining to you, and to review any such records, by writing to the Office of the General Counsel (see § 407.3). You also may call the Office of the General Counsel at (703) 696-6902 on business days, between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., to schedule an appointment to make such a request in person. A request for records should be presented in writing and should identify specifically the ABMC system(s) involved. Your request to access records pertaining to you will be treated as a request under both the Privacy Act, as implemented by this part, and the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), as implemented by part 404 of this title (36 CFR 404.1 through 404.10).</P>
          <P>(b) Access to the records, or to any other information pertaining to you that is contained in the system, shall be provided if the identification requirements of § 407.5 are satisfied and the records are determined otherwise to be releasable under the Privacy Act and these regulations. ABMC shall provide you an opportunity to have a copy made of any such records about you. Only one copy of each requested record will be supplied, based on the fee schedule in § 407.8.</P>
          <P>(c) ABMC will comply promptly with requests made in person at scheduled appointments, if the requirements of this section are met and the records sought are immediately available. ABMC will acknowledge, within 10 business days, mailed requests or personal requests for records that are not immediately available, and the information requested will be provided promptly thereafter.</P>
          <P>(d) If you make your request in person at a scheduled appointment, you may, upon your request, be accompanied by a person of your choice to review your records. ABMC may require that you furnish a written statement authorizing discussion of your records in the accompanying person's presence. A record may be disclosed to a representative chosen by you upon your proper written consent.</P>
          <P>(e) Medical or psychological records pertaining to you shall be disclosed to you unless, in the judgment of ABMC, access to such records might have an adverse effect upon you. When such a determination has been made, ABMC may refuse to disclose such information directly to you. ABMC will, however, disclose this information to you through a licensed physician designated by you in writing.</P>
          <P>(f) If you are unsatisfied with an adverse determination on your request to access records pertaining to you, you may appeal that determination using the procedures set forth in § 407.7(a).</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 407.5</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Identification required when requesting access to ABMC records pertaining to an individual.</SUBJECT>
          <P>ABMC will require reasonable identification of all individuals who request access to records in an ABMC system to ensure that records are disclosed to the proper person.</P>
          <P>(a) The amount of personal identification required will of necessity vary with the sensitivity of the record involved. In general, if you request disclosure in person, you will be required to show an identification card, such as a driver's license, containing your photograph and sample signature. However, with regard to records in ABMC systems that contain particularly sensitive and/or detailed personal information, ABMC reserves the right to require additional means of identification as are appropriate under the circumstances. These means include, but are not limited to, requiring you to sign a statement under oath as to your identity, acknowledging that you are aware of the criminal penalties for requesting or obtaining records under false pretenses or falsifying information (see 5 U.S.C. 552a(i)(3); 18 U.S.C. 1001).</P>
          <P>(b) If you request disclosure by mail, ABMC will request such information as may be necessary to ensure that you are properly identified and for a response to be sent. Authorized means to achieve this goal include, but are not limited to, requiring that a mail request include a signed, notarized statement asserting your identity or a statement signed under oath as described in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 407.6</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Procedures for amending or correcting an individual's ABMC record.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) You are entitled to request amendments to or corrections of records pertaining to you that you believe are not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete, pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act, including 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(2). Such a request should be made in writing and addressed to the Office of the General Counsel (see § 407.3).</P>
          <P>(b) Your request for amendments or corrections should specify the following:</P>
          <P>(1) The particular record that you are seeking to amend or correct;</P>
          <P>(2) The ABMC system from which the record was retrieved;</P>
          <P>(3) The precise correction or amendment you desire, preferably in the form of an edited copy of the record reflecting the desired modification; and</P>
          <P>(4) Your reasons for requesting amendment or correction of the record.</P>
          <P>(c) ABMC will acknowledge a request for amendment or correction of a record within 10 business days of its receipt, unless the request can be processed and the individual informed of the General Counsel's decision on the request within that 10-day period.</P>
          <P>(d) If after receiving and investigating your request, the General Counsel agrees that the record is not accurate, timely, or complete, based on a preponderance of the evidence, then the record will be corrected or amended promptly. The record will be deleted without regard to its accuracy, if the record is not relevant or necessary to accomplish the ABMC function for which the record was provided or is maintained. In either case, you will be informed in writing of the amendment, correction, or deletion. In addition, if accounting was made of prior disclosures of the record, all previous recipients of the record will be informed of the corrective action taken.</P>
          <P>(e) If after receiving and investigating your request, the General Counsel does not agree that the record should be amended or corrected, you will be informed promptly in writing of the refusal to amend or correct the record and the reason for this decision. You also will be informed that you may appeal this refusal in accordance with § 407.7.</P>
          <P>(f) Requests to amend or correct a record governed by the regulations of another agency will be forwarded to such agency for processing, and you will be informed in writing of this referral.</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 407.7</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Procedures for appealing a refusal to amend or correct an ABMC record.</SUBJECT>

          <P>(a) You may appeal a refusal to amend or correct a record to the Secretary of ABMC. Such appeal must be made in writing within 30 business <PRTPAGE P="54"/>days of your receipt of the initial refusal to amend or correct your record. Your appeal should be sent to the Office of the General Counsel (see § 407.3), should indicate that it is an appeal, and should include the basis for the appeal.</P>
          <P>(b) The Secretary will review your request to amend or correct the record, the General Counsel's refusal, and any other pertinent material relating to the appeal. No hearing will be held.</P>
          <P>(c) The Secretary shall render his or her decision on your appeal within 30 business days of its receipt by ABMC, unless the Secretary, for good cause shown, extends the 30-day period. Should the Secretary extend the appeal period, you will be informed in writing of the extension and the circumstances of the delay.</P>
          <P>(d) If the Secretary determines that the record that is the subject of the appeal should be amended or corrected, the record will be so modified, and you will be informed in writing of the amendment or correction. Where an accounting was made of prior disclosures of the record, all previous recipients of the record will be informed of the corrective action taken.</P>
          <P>(e) If your appeal is denied, you will be informed in writing of the following:</P>
          <P>(1) The denial and the reasons for the denial;</P>
          <P>(2) That you may submit to ABMC a concise statement setting forth the reasons for your disagreement as to the disputed record. Under the procedures set forth in paragraph (f) of this section, your statement will be disclosed whenever the disputed record is disclosed; and</P>
          <P>(3) That you may seek judicial review of the Secretary's determination under 5 U.S.C. 552a(g)(1).</P>
          <P>(f) Whenever you submit a statement of disagreement to ABMC in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the record will be annotated to indicate that it is disputed. In any subsequent disclosure, a copy of your statement of disagreement will be disclosed with the record. If ABMC deems it appropriate, a concise statement of the Secretary's reasons for denying your appeal also may be disclosed with the record. While you will have access to this statement of the Secretary's reasons for denying your appeal, such statement will not be subject to correction or amendment. Where an accounting was made of prior disclosures of the record, all previous recipients of the record will be provided a copy of your statement of disagreement, as well as any statement of the Secretary's reasons for denying your appeal deemed appropriate.</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 407.8</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Fees charged to locate, review, or copy records.</SUBJECT>

          <P>(a) ABMC will charge no fees for search time or for any other time expended by ABMC to review a record. However, ABMC may charge fees where you request that a copy be made of a record to which you have been granted access. Where a copy of the record must be made in order to provide access to the record (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> computer printout where no screen reading is available), the copy will be made available to you without cost.</P>

          <P>(b) Copies of records made by photocopy or similar process will be charged to you at the rate of $0.15 per page. Where records are not susceptible to photocopying (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> punch cards, magnetic tapes, or oversize materials), you will be charged actual cost as determined on a case-by-case basis. Copying fees will not be charged if the cost of collecting a fee would be equal to or greater than the fee itself. Copying fees for contemporaneous requests by the same individual shall be aggregated to determine the total fee.</P>
          <P>(c) Special and additional services provided at your request, such as certification or authentication, postal insurance, and special mailing arrangement costs, will be charged to you at the rates set forth in § 404.7(e) of this chapter.</P>

          <P>(d) You may request that a copying fee not be charged or, alternatively, be reduced, by submitting a written petition to ABMC's General Counsel (see § 407.3) asserting that you are indigent. If the General Counsel determines, based on the petition, that you are indigent and that ABMC's resources permit a waiver of all or part of the fee, the General Counsel may, in his or her discretion, waive or reduce the copying fee.<PRTPAGE P="55"/>
          </P>
          <P>(e) All fees shall be paid before any copying request is undertaken. Payments shall be made by check or money order payable to “American Battle Monuments Commission.”</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 407.9</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Procedures for maintaining accounts of disclosures made by ABMC from its systems of records.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The Office of the General Counsel shall maintain a log containing the date, nature, and purpose of each disclosure of a record to any person or to another agency. Such accounting also shall contain the name and address of the person or agency to whom each disclosure was made. This log need not include disclosures made to ABMC employees in the course of their official duties, or pursuant to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552).</P>
          <P>(b) ABMC will retain the accounting of each disclosure for at least five years after the disclosure for which the accounting is made or for the life of the record that was disclosed, whichever is longer.</P>
          <P>(c) ABMC will make the accounting of disclosures of a record pertaining to you available to you at your request. Such a request should be made in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 407.4. This paragraph (c) does not apply to disclosures made for law enforcement purposes under 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(7).</P>

          <SUBJECT>Information about the Library.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Information about the Library.</E> It is the Library's policy to furnish freely information about the Library to the media. All requests from the media, for other than generally published information and Library records, should be referred to the Public Affairs Office. For information about access to, service of, and employment with the Library of Congress, go to <E T="03">http://www.loc.gov.</E>
          </P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Public Affairs Office.</E> The Public Affairs Office shall have the principal responsibility for responding to requests for information about the Library from representatives of the media; giving advice to Library officers and staff members on public-relations and public-information matters; keeping the Librarian and other officers informed of important developments in this field; and promoting the resources and activities of the Library.</P>
          <P>(1) During regular office hours (8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.) telephone operators shall refer requests for information, from the media only, about the Library to the Public Affairs Office. All other requests for information shall be referred to the National Reference Service or other appropriate offices of the Library.</P>
          <P>(2) All other Library offices and staff members who receive inquiries directly from representatives of the media for information about the Library, other than generally published information, shall refer such inquiries to the Public Affairs Office.</P>
          <P>(3) The Public Affairs Office shall respond directly to inquiries concerning the Library, calling upon other offices to supply information to it as necessary, or shall arrange for other offices or staff members, as appropriate, to supply such information directly and report back to Public Affairs after the contact has been made. Requests for Library of Congress records, however, shall be made in accordance with 36 CFR part 703.</P>
          <P>(4) When the Public Affairs Office is closed (evenings, Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays), requests from the media for information about the Library shall be referred to the Public Affairs Officer at his/her home. In the event that person is not available, inquiries shall be referred to the Acting Public Affairs Officer, or, in turn, a designated public affairs specialist.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Other Library Units and Staff Members.</E> All Other Library Units and Staff Members shall be responsible for keeping the Public Affairs Office fully and promptly informed of contacts with the press, except in those instances of routine reference inquiries; supplying the Public Affairs Office with any data it requires in order to respond to inquiries from representatives of the media; and reporting promptly to the Public Affairs Office substantive contacts with media representatives about the Library and its policies or activities.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Acquisition of Library material by non-purchase means.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Gifts.</E> It is the policy of the Library of Congress to foster the enrichment of its collections through gifts of materials within the terms of the Library's acquisitions policies. In implementing this policy, division chiefs and other authorized officers of the Library may undertake, as representatives of the Library, preliminary negotiations for gifts to the Library. However, responsibility for formal acceptance of gifts of material and for approval of conditions of such gifts rests with The Librarian of Congress or his designee. The Chief, African/Asian Acquisitions and Overseas Operations Division, Chief, Anglo-American Acquisitions <PRTPAGE P="68"/>Division, and Chief, European and Latin American Acquisitions Division are responsible for routine gifts in the geographic areas covered by their divisions.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Deposits.</E> (1) The Anglo-American Acquisitions Division is the only division in the Library authorized to make technical arrangements, formally negotiate for the transportation of materials and conditions of use at the Library, and prepare written Agreements of Deposit to formalize these negotiations. The term “deposit” is used to mean materials which are placed in the custody of the Library for general use on its premises, but which remain the property of their owners during the time of deposit and until such time as title in them may pass to the Library of Congress. A deposit becomes the permanent property of the Library when title to it is conveyed by gift or bequest. A deposit may be withdrawn by the owner rather than conveyed to the Library. A deposit shall be accompanied by a signed Agreement of Deposit.</P>
          <P>(2) It is the policy of the Library of Congress to accept certain individual items or special collections as deposits when: permanent acquisition of such materials cannot be effected immediately; the depositors give reasonable assurance of their intention to donate the materials deposited to the United States of America for the benefit of the Library of Congress; the Library of Congress determines that such ultimate transfer of title will enrich its collections; and the depositors agree that the materials so deposited may be available for unrestricted use or use in the Library under reasonable restrictions.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Conditional Gifts of Material to the Library.</E> In cases where donors wish to attach conditions of use, negotiating officers cannot commit the Library to acceptance of such conditions. The Librarian of Congress or designee will consult the appropriate division and service unit officers and the General Counsel to ascertain whether the conditions are generally acceptable.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Methods of disposition of surplus and/or duplicate materials.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Exchange.</E> All libraries may make selections on an exchange basis from the materials available in the “Exchange/Transfer” category. The policy governing these selections is that exchange be made only when materials of approximately equal value are expected to be furnished in return within a reasonable period. Dealers also may negotiate exchanges of this type for items selected from available exchange materials, but surplus copyright deposit copies of works published after 1977 shall not knowingly be exchanged with dealers. Offers of exchange submitted by libraries shall be submitted to the Chief of the African/Asian Acquisitions and Overseas Operations Division, Anglo-American Acquisitions Division, or European/Latin American Acquisitions Division, or their designees, as appropriate, who shall establish the value of the material concerned. Offers from dealers shall be referred to the Chief of the Anglo-American Acquisitions Division. Exchange offers involving materials valued at $1,000 or more must be approved by the Acquisitions Division Chief; offers of $10,000 or more must be approved by the Director for Acquisitions and Support Services; and offers of $50,000 or more must be approved by the Associate Librarian for Library Services. The Library also explicitly reserves the right to suspend, for any period of time it deems appropriate, the selection privileges of any book dealer who fails to comply fully with any rules prescribed for the disposal of library materials under this section or any other pertinent regulations or statutes.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Transfer of materials to Government Agencies.</E> Library materials no longer needed by the Library of Congress, including the exchange use mentioned above, shall be available for transfer to Federal agency libraries or to the District of Columbia Public Library, upon the request of appropriate officers of such entities, and may be selected from both the “Exchange/Transfer” and “Donation” categories. Existing arrangements for the transfer of materials, such as the automatic transfer of <PRTPAGE P="69"/>certain classes of books, etc., to specified Government libraries, shall be continued unless modified by the Library.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Donations of Library materials to educational institutions, public bodies, and nonprofit tax-exempt organizations in the United States.</E> It is the Library's policy, in keeping with the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, 40 U.S.C. 471 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> which does not cover the Library of Congress, to use materials no longer needed for any of the purposes mentioned above to strengthen the educational resources of the Nation by enriching the book collections of educational institutions (full-time, tax-supported or nonprofit schools, school systems, colleges, universities, museums, and public libraries), public bodies (agencies of local, State, or Federal Government), and nonprofit tax-exempt organizations (section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C. 501, by authorizing the Anglo-American Acquisitions Division to donate to such groups in the United States any materials selected by their representatives. Eligibility to participate in the donation program shall be limited as defined by procedures established by the Anglo-American Acquisitions Division.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Disposition of residue.</E> Library materials not needed for the collections of the Library, for its exchange and transfer programs, for sale, or for donation, and which, in the opinion of the Chief, Anglo-American Acquisitions Division, have no commercial value, may be turned over to the General Services Administration (GSA) to be disposed of in accordance with standard Government practice.</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The purpose of this part is three-fold:</P>
          <P>(1) To assure that the Library of Congress is properly and appropriately identified and credited as a source of materials in publications.</P>
          <P>(2) To assure that the name or logo of the Library of Congress, or any unit thereof, is used only with the prior approval of the Librarian of Congress or his designee; and</P>
          <P>(3) To assure that the seal of the Library of Congress is used only on official documents or publications of the Library.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> (1) For the purposes of this part, publication means any tangible expression of words or thoughts in any form or format, including print, sound recording, television, optical disc, software, online delivery, or other technology now known or hereinafter created. It includes the whole range of tangible products from simple signs, posters, pamphlets, and brochures to books, television productions, and movies.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Internal Library publication</E> means a publication over which any unit of the Library has complete or substantial control or responsibility.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Cooperative publications</E> are those in which the Library is a partner with the publisher by terms of a cooperative publishing agreement.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Commercial publications</E> are those known or likely to involve subsequent mass distribution, whether by a for-profit or not-for-profit organization or individual, which involve a cooperative agreement. A commercial publication can also include a significant number of LC references and is also approved by the LC office that entered into a formal agreement. Noncommercial publications are those which are produced by non-commercial entities.</P>
          <P>(5) <E T="03">Internet sites</E> are those on-line entities, both commercial and non-commercial, that have links to the Library's site.</P>
          <P>(6) <E T="03">Library logo</E> refers to any official symbol of the Library or any entity thereof and includes any design officially approved by the Librarian of Congress for use by Library officials.</P>
          <P>(7) <E T="03">Seal</E> refers to any statutorily recognized seal.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Credit and recognition policy.</E> (1) The name “Library of Congress,” or any abbreviation or subset such as <PRTPAGE P="70"/>“Copyright Office” or “Congressional Research Service,” thereof, is used officially to represent the Library of Congress and its programs, projects, functions, activities, or elements thereof. The use of the Library's name, explicitly or implicitly to endorse a product or service, or materials in any publication is prohibited, except as provided for in this part.</P>
          <P>(2) The Library of Congress seal symbolizes the Library's authority and standing as an official agency of the U.S. Government. As such, it shall be displayed only on official documents or publications of the Library. The seal of the Library of Congress Trust Fund Board shall be affixed to documents of that body as prescribed by the Librarian of Congress. The seal of the National Film Preservation Board shall be affixed to documents of that body as prescribed by the Librarian of Congress. Procedures governing the use of any Library of Congress logo or symbol are set out below. Any person or organization that uses the Library Seal or the Seal of the Library of Congress Trust Fund Board in a manner other than as authorized by the provisions of this section shall be subject to the criminal provisions of 18 U.S.C. 1017.</P>
          <P>(3) Questions regarding the appropriateness of the use of any Library logos or symbols, or the use of the Library's name, shall be referred to the Public Affairs Officer.</P>
          <P>(4) Cooperative Ventures. (i) Individual, commercial enterprises or non-commercial entities with whom the Library has a cooperative agreement to engage in cooperative efforts shall be instructed regarding Library policy on credit, recognition, and endorsement by the officer or manager with whom they are dealing.</P>
          <P>(ii) Ordinarily, the Library logo should appear in an appropriate and suitable location on all cooperative publications. The Library requires that a credit line accompany reproductions of images from its collections and reflect the nature of the relationship such as “published in association with * * *.”</P>
          <P>(iii) The size, location, and other attributes of the logo and credit line should be positioned in such a way that they do not imply Library endorsement of the publication unless such endorsement is expressly intended by the Library, as would be the case in cooperative activities. Use of the Library name or logo in any context suggesting an explicit or implicit endorsement may be approved in only those instances where the Library has sufficient control over the publication to make changes necessary to reflect Library expertise.</P>

          <P>(iv) Library officers working on cooperative projects shall notify all collaborators of Library policy in writing if the collaboration is arranged through an exchange of correspondence. All uses of the Library of Congress's name, seal or logo on promotional materials must be approved by the Public Affairs Officer, in consultation with the Office of the General Counsel, in advance. A statement of Library policy shall be incorporated into the agreement if the terms of the collaboration are embodied in any written instrument, such as a contract or letter of understanding. The statement could read as follows:

          <SUBJECT>Loans of library materials for blind and other physically handicapped persons.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Program.</E> In connection with the Library's program of service under the Act of March 3, 1931 (46 Stat. 1487), as amended, its National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped provides books in raised characters (braille), on sound reproduction recordings, or in any other form, under regulations established by the Library of Congress. The National Library Service also provides and maintains reproducers for such sound reproduction recordings for the use of blind and other physically handicapped residents of the United States, including the several States, Territories, Insular Possessions, and the District of Columbia, and American citizens temporarily domiciled abroad.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Eligibility criteria.</E> (1) The following persons are eligible for such service:</P>
          <P>(i) Blind persons whose visual acuity, as determined by competent authority, is 20/200 or less in the better eye with correcting glasses, or whose wide diameter if visual field subtends an angular distance no greater than 20 degrees.</P>
          <P>(ii) Persons whose visual disability, with correction and regardless of optical measurement, is certified by competent authority as preventing the reading of standard printed material.</P>
          <P>(iii) Persons certified by competent authority as unable to read or unable to use standard printed material as a result of physical limitations.</P>
          <P>(iv) Persons certified by competent authority as having a reading disability resulting from organic dysfunction and of sufficient severity to prevent their reading printed material in a normal manner.</P>
          <P>(2) In connection with eligibility for loan services “competent authority” is defined as follows:</P>

          <P>(i) In cases of blindness, visual disability, or physical limitations “competent authority” is defined to include doctors of medicine, doctors of osteopathy, ophthalmologist, optometrists, <PRTPAGE P="72"/>registered nurses, therapists, professional staff of hospitals, institutions, and public or welfare agencies (e.g., social workers, case workers, counselors, rehabilitation teachers, and superintendents). In the absence of any of these, certification may be made by professional librarians or by any persons whose competence under specific circumstances is acceptable to the Library of Congress.</P>
          <P>(ii) In the case of reading disability from organic dysfunction, competent authority is defined as doctors of medicine who may consult with colleagues in associated disciplines.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Loans through regional libraries.</E> Sound reproducers are lent to individuals and appropriate centers through agencies, libraries, and other organizations designated by the Librarian of Congress to service specific geographic areas, to certify eligibility of prospective readers, and to arrange for maintenance and repair of reproducers. Libraries designated by the Librarian of Congress serve as local or regional centers for the direct loan of such books, reproducers, or other specialized material to eligible readers in specific geographic areas. They share in the certification of prospective readers, and utilize all available channels of communication to acquaint the public within their jurisdiction with all aspects of the program.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">National collections.</E> The Librarian of Congress, through the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped, defines regions and determines the need for new regional libraries in cooperation with other libraries or agencies whose activities are primarily concerned with the blind and physically handicapped. It serves as the center from which books, recordings, sound reproducers, and other specialized materials are lent to eligible blind and physically handicapped readers who may be temporarily domiciled outside the jurisdictions enumerated by the Act. It maintains a special collection of books in raised characters and on sound reproduction recordings not housed in regional libraries and makes these materials available to eligible borrowers on interlibrary loan.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Institutions.</E> The reading materials and sound reproducers for the use of blind and physically handicapped persons may be loaned to individuals who qualify, to institutions such as nursing homes and hospitals, and to schools for the blind and physically handicapped for the use of such persons only. The reading materials and sound reproducers may also be used in public or private schools where handicapped students are enrolled; however, the students in public or private schools must be certified as eligible on an individual basis and must be the direct and only recipients of the materials and equipment.</P>

          <P>(b) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The purpose of this part is to accommodate the Library of Congress' legal status as a Federal agency of the United States and assure that the Library of Congress, when entering into license agreements, follows applicable Federal laws and regulations, including those related to fiscal law constraints, governing law, venue, and legal representation; to preserve the Library's rights under U.S., foreign, and international copyright law; and to preserve the Library's ability to make use of computer software and other materials it licenses.</P>

If any term of a license agreement (at the time the license agreement is executed or as it may be amended in the future) conflicts with or imposes any additional obligations on the Library of Congress with respect to a matter addressed by any of the clauses that are deemed to have been inserted into the license agreement as described above, the following shall apply:</P>
          <P>(i) Such term is unenforceable against the Library of Congress unless otherwise expressly authorized by Federal law and specifically authorized under applicable Library of Congress regulations and procedures;</P>
          <P>(ii) Neither the Library of Congress nor its employees shall be deemed to have agreed to such term by virtue of the term appearing in any license agreement;</P>

          <P>(4) If any provisions are invoked through an “I agree” click box or other comparable mechanism (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> “click-wrap” or “browse-wrap” agreements), such provisions do not bind the Library of Congress or any Library of Congress authorized end user to such provisions, unless agreed to on behalf of the Library of Congress by a person having the authority to contract referred to in § 701.4.</P>

          <P>(a) Library buildings and grounds are designated as limited public forums, except for those areas designated as nonpublic forums. However, only Library grounds (defined in 2 U.S.C. 167j), not buildings, may be utilized for demonstrations, including assembling, marching, picketing, or rallying. In addition, as the need for the determination of other matters arises, the Librarian will determine what additional First Amendment activities may not be permitted in a limited public forum. In making such determination, The Librarian will consider only whether the intended activity is incompatible with the primary purpose and intended use of that area.</P>
          <P>(b) The Director, Integrated Support Services, shall designate certain Library grounds as available for demonstrations. Persons seeking to use such designated areas for the purpose of demonstrations shall first secure written permission from the Director, Integrated Support Services.

          <P>(7) A concise statement detailing arrangements for the prompt cleanup of the site after the demonstration;</P>
          <P>(8) Any request for permission to use loudspeakers, microphones, or other amplifying devices, hand held or otherwise; and</P>
          <P>(9) A signed agreement by the applicant(s) to comply with Library regulations and terms and conditions established for the demonstration.</P>
          <P>(c) Upon receipt of an application, Facility Services shall forward the application, along with any comments and recommendations, to the Director, Integrated Support Services, within one business day of the office's receipt of said application.

The Director, Integrated Support Services, shall request advice from the Office of the General Counsel on any legal questions arising from said application.</P>
          <P>(d) Permission to demonstrate shall be based upon:</P>
          <P>(1) The availability of the requested location;</P>
          <P>(2) The likelihood that the demonstration will not interfere with Library operations or exceed city noise limitations as defined by District of Columbia regulations; and</P>
          <P>(3) The likelihood that the demonstration will proceed peacefully in the event that a volatile situation in the United States or abroad might lead to a potentially harmful threat toward the Capitol complex, including Library buildings and grounds.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose and scope of this subpart.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) This subpart implements the policy of the Library with respect to the public availability of Library of Congress records. Although the Library is not subject to the Freedom of Information Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552), this subpart follows the spirit of that Act consistent with the Library's duties, functions, and responsibilities to the Congress. The application of that Act to the Library is not to be inferred, nor should this subpart be considered as conferring on any member of the public a right under that Act of access to or information from the records of the Library. Nothing in this subpart modifies current instructions and practices in the Library with respect to handling Congressional correspondence.</P>

            <P>(b) The Copyright Office, although a service unit of the Library, is by law (17 U.S.C. 701) subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, as amended, only for purposes of actions taken under the copyright law. The Copyright Office has published its own regulation with respect to the general availability of information (<E T="03">see</E> 37 CFR 201.2) and requests for copyright records made pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (<E T="03">see</E> 37 CFR 203.1 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) and the Privacy Act (<E T="03">see</E> 37 CFR 204.1 <E T="03">et seq.</E>).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Policy.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Subject to limitations set out in this part, Library of Congress records shall be available as hereinafter provided and shall be furnished as promptly as possible within the Library to any member of the public at appropriate places and times and for an appropriate fee, if any.</P>
            <P>(b) The Library shall not provide records from its files that originate in another federal agency or non-federal organization to persons who may not be entitled to obtain the records from the originator. In such instances, the Library shall refer requesters to the agency or organization that originated the records.</P>

            <P>(c) In order to avoid disruption of work in progress, and in the interests of fairness to those who might be adversely affected by the release of information which has not been fully reviewed to assure its accuracy and completeness, it is the policy of the Library not to provide records which are part of on-going reviews or other current projects. In response to such requests, the Library will inform the requester of the estimated completion date of the review or project so that the requester may then ask for the <PRTPAGE P="80"/>records. At that time, the Library may release the records unless the same are exempt from disclosure as identified in § 703.5.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Records</E> includes all books, papers, maps, photographs, reports, and other documentary materials, exclusive of materials in the Library's collections, regardless of physical form or characteristics, made or received and under the control of the Library in pursuance of law or in connection with the transaction of public business, and retained, or appropriate for retention, by the Library as evidence of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the government or because of the informational value of data contained therein. The term refers only to such items in being and under the control of the Library. It does not include the compiling or procuring of a record, nor does the term include objects or articles, such as furniture, paintings, sculpture, three-dimensional models, structures, vehicles, and equipment.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Identifiable</E> means a reasonably specific description of a particular record sought, such as the date of the record, subject matter, agency or person involved, etc. which will permit location or retrieval of the record.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Records available to the public</E> means records which may be examined or copied or of which copies may be obtained, in accordance with this part, by the public or representatives of the press regardless of interest and without specific justification.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Records exempt from disclosure.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The public disclosure of Library records provided for by this part does not apply to records, or any parts thereof, within any of the categories set out below. Unless precluded by law, the Chief, OSS, nevertheless may release records within these categories, except for Congressional correspondence and other materials identified in § 703.5(b)(1), after first consulting with the General Counsel.</P>

            <P>(3) Records related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of the Library. This category includes, in addition to internal matters of personnel administration, internal rules and practices which cannot be disclosed without prejudice to the effective performance of a Library function, such as guidelines and procedures used by auditors, investigators, or examiners in the Office of the Inspector General.</P>
            <P>(4) Records specifically exempted from disclosure by statute, provided that such statute:</P>
            <P>(i) Requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or</P>
            <P>(ii) Establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld.</P>

            <P>(5) Records containing trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person as privileged or confidential. This exemption may include, but is not limited to, business sales statistics, inventories, customer lists, scientific or manufacturing processes or development information.<PRTPAGE P="81"/>
            </P>
            <P>(6) Personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which could constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. This exemption includes all private or personal information contained in files compiled to evaluate candidates for security clearances.</P>
            <P>(7) Materials and information contained in investigative or other records compiled for law enforcement purposes.</P>
            <P>(8) Materials and information contained in files prepared in connection with government litigation and adjudicative proceedings, except for those portions of such files which are available by law to persons in litigation with the Library.</P>
            <P>(9) Records having information contained in or related to examination, operation, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions.</P>
            <P>(10) Inter-agency or intra-agency memoranda, letters or other materials that are part of the deliberative process, the premature disclosure of which would inhibit internal communications or be detrimental to a Library function (e.g., case files in the Manuscript Division).</P>
            <P>(11) Records containing information customarily subject to protection as privileged in a court or other proceedings such as information protected by the doctor-patient, attorney work product, or attorney-client privilege.</P>
            <P>(12) Information submitted by a person to the Library in confidence or which the Library has obligated itself not to disclose such as information received by the Office of the Inspector General through its hotline.</P>
            <P>(13) Materials related to specific patron use of the Library's collections, resources, or facilities either on site or off site. This exemption includes:</P>
            <P>(i) Reader Records. Library records which identify readers by name, such as registration records, reading room logs or registers, telephone inquiry logs, and charge slips, if retained for administrative purposes.</P>
            <P>(ii) Use Records. Users of the Library are entitled to privacy with respect to their presence and use of the Library's facilities and resources. Records pertaining to the use of the Library and of Library collections and subjects of inquiry are confidential and are not to be disclosed either to other readers, to members of the staff who are not authorized, or to other inquirers including officials of law enforcement, intelligence, or investigative agencies, except pursuant to court order or administratively by order of the Librarian of Congress.</P>
            <P>(c) Any reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided to anyone requesting such records after deletion of the portions which are exempt under this section. A portion of a record shall be considered reasonably segregable when segregation can produce an intelligible record which is not distorted out of context, does not contradict the record being withheld, and can reasonably provide all relevant information.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Procedure for access to and copying of records.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A request to inspect or obtain a copy of an identifiable record of the Library of Congress shall be submitted in writing to the Chief, OSS, Library of Congress, 101 Independence Avenue, SE., Washington, DC 20540-9440, who shall promptly record and process the request.</P>
            <P>(b) Requests for records shall be specific and shall identify the precise records or materials that are desired by name, date, number, or other identifying data sufficient to allow the OSS staff to locate, retrieve, and prepare the record for inspection or copying and to delete exempted matter where appropriate to do so. Blanket or generalized requests (such as “all matters relating to” a general subject) shall not be honored and shall be returned to the requester.</P>
            <P>(c) Records shall be available for inspection and copying in person during business hours.</P>
            <P>(d) Records in media other than print (e.g., microforms and machine-readable media) shall be available for inspection in the medium in which they exist. Copies of records in machine-readable media shall be made in media determined by the Chief, OSS.</P>

            <P>(e) Library staff shall respond to requests with reasonable dispatch. Use of <PRTPAGE P="82"/>a record by the Library or Library employees, however, shall take precedence over any request. Under no circumstances shall official records be removed from Library control without the written authorization of the Librarian.</P>
            <P>(f) The Chief, OSS, shall make the initial determination on whether:</P>
            <P>(1) The record described in a request can be identified and located pursuant to a reasonable search, and</P>
            <P>(2) The record (or portions thereof) may be made available or withheld from disclosure under the provisions of this part. In making the initial determinations, the Chief shall consult with any unit in the Library having a continuing substantial interest in the record requested. Where the Chief finds no valid objection or doubt as to the propriety of making the requested record available, the Chief shall honor the request upon payment of prescribed fees, if any are required by § 703.8.</P>
            <P>(g) If the Chief, OSS, determines that a requested record should be withheld, the Chief shall inform the requester in writing that the request has been denied; shall identify the material withheld; and shall explain the basis for the denial. The Chief shall inform the requester that further consideration of the denied request may be obtained by a letter to the General Counsel setting out the basis for the belief that the denial of the request was unwarranted.</P>
            <P>(h) The General Counsel shall make the final determination on any request for reconsideration and shall notify the requester in writing of that determination. The decision of the General Counsel shall be the final administrative review within the Library.</P>
            <P>(1) If the General Counsel's decision reverses in whole or in part the initial determination by the Chief, OSS, the Chief shall make the requested record, or parts thereof, available to the requester, subject to the provisions of § 703.8.</P>
            <P>(2) If the General Counsel's decision sustains in whole or in part the initial determination by the Chief, OSS, the General Counsel shall explain the basis on which the record, or portions thereof, will not be made available.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Public Reading Facility.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The Chief, OSS, shall maintain a reading facility for the public inspection and copying of Library records. This facility shall be open to the public from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., except Saturdays, Sundays, holidays, and such other times as the Library shall be closed to the public.</P>
            <P>(b) The General Counsel shall advise the Chief, OSS, of the records to be available in the public reading facility following consultation with the Library managers who may be concerned.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Fees and charges.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The Library will charge no fees for:</P>
            <P>(1) Access to or copies of records under the provisions of this part when the direct search and reproduction costs are less than $10.</P>
            <P>(2) Records requested which are not found or which are determined to be exempt under the provisions of this part.</P>
            <P>(3) Staff time spent in resolving any legal or policy questions pertaining to a request.</P>
            <P>(4) Copies of records, including those certified as true copies, that are furnished for official use to any officer or employee of the federal government.</P>
            <P>(5) Copies of pertinent records furnished to a party having a direct and immediate interest in a matter pending before the Library, when furnishing such copies is necessary or desirable to the performance of a Library function.</P>
            <P>(b) When the costs for services are $10 or more, the Chief, OSS, shall assess and collect the fees and charges set out in appendix A to this part for the direct costs of search and reproduction of records available to the public.</P>

            <P>(c) The Chief, OSS, is authorized to waive fees and charges, in whole or in part, where it is determined that the public interest is best served to do so, because waiver is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Persons seeking a waiver or reduction of fees may be required to submit a written statement setting forth the intended purpose for which the records are requested or otherwise indicate <PRTPAGE P="83"/>how disclosure will primarily benefit the public and, in appropriate cases, explain why the volume of records requested is necessary. Determinations made pursuant to the authority set out herein are solely within the discretion of the Chief, OSS.</P>
            <P>(d) Fees and charges for services identified in the appendix to this part shall be paid in full by the requester before the records are delivered. Payment shall be made in U.S. funds by personal check, money order, or bank draft made payable to the Library of Congress. The Chief, OSS, shall remit all fees collected to the Director, Financial Services, who shall cause the same to be credited to appropriate accounts or deposited with the U.S. Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.</P>
            <P>(e) The Chief, OSS, shall notify a requester and may require an advance deposit where the anticipated fees will exceed $50.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Policy on presentation of testimony and production of documents.</SUBJECT>
            <P>No Library of Congress employee may provide testimony or produce documents in any proceeding to which this part applies concerning information acquired in the course of performing official duties or because of the employee's official relationship with the Library of Congress, unless authorized by the General Counsel or his/her designee, or the Director of the Congressional Research Service (CRS) with respect to records and testimony relating to CRS's work for Congress, or the Law Librarian for records and testimony relating to the Law Library's work for Congress or materials prepared for other federal agencies covered by evidentiary privileges. The aforementioned officials (hereinafter “deciding officials”) will consider and act upon demands under this part with due regard for the interests of Congress, where appropriate, statutory requirements, the Library's interests, and the public interest, taking into account factors such as applicable privileges and immunities, including the deliberative process privilege and the speech or debate clause, the need to conserve the time of employees for conducting official business, the need to avoid spending the time and money of the United States for private purposes, the need to maintain impartiality among private litigants in cases where a substantial government interest is not involved, the established legal standards for determining whether or not justification exists for the disclosure of confidential information and records, and any other purpose that the deciding official deems to be in the interest of Congress or the Library of Congress.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Procedures when testimony and/or documents are demanded.</SUBJECT>
            <P>A demand for testimony and/or documents by a Library employee must be in writing, must state the nature of the requested testimony and/or specify documents, and must meet the requirements of § 703.15. A demand must also show that the desired testimony or document is not reasonably available from any other source and must show that no document could be provided and used in lieu of testimony. When an employee of the Library receives such a request the employee will immediately forward it, with the recommendation of the employee's supervisors, to the appropriate deciding official under § 703.22 of this part. The deciding official, in consultation with the appropriate offices of the Library or congressional offices, will determine whether or not compliance with the request would be appropriate and will respond as soon as practicable.</P>

            <P>(b) If the deciding official has denied approval to comply with the subpoena, and the court or authority rules that the demand must be complied with irrespective of such a denial, the employee upon whom such a demand has been made shall produce a copy of this Part and shall respectfully refuse to provide any testimony or produce any documents. <E T="03">United States ex rel.

          <SUBJECT>Scope and purpose of this part.</SUBJECT>
          <P>The purpose of this part is to implement certain provisions of the American Television and Radio Archives Act, 2 U.S.C. 170. Specifically, this part prescribes rules pertaining to the reproduction, compilation, and distribution by the Library of Congress, under section 170(b) of title 2 of the United States Code, of television and radio transmission programs consisting of regularly scheduled newscasts or on-the-spot coverage of news events.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 705.2</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Authority.</SUBJECT>
          <P>Section 170(b) of Title 2 authorizes the Librarian, with respect to a transmission program which consists of a regularly scheduled newscast or on-the-spot coverage of news events, to prescribe by regulation standards and conditions to reproduce, compile, and distribute such a program as more particularly specified in the statute.</P>
        </SECTION>
        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 705.3</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
          <P>For purposes of this part:</P>

          <P>(a) The terms copies, fixed, phonorecords and transmission program, and their variant forms, have the meanings given to them in section 101 of title 17 of the United States Code. For the purpose of this part, the term transmission includes transmission via the Internet, cable, broadcasting, and satellite systems, and via any other existing or future devices or <PRTPAGE P="86"/>processes for the communication of a performance or display whereby images or sounds are received beyond the place from which they are sent. 17 U.S.C. 101; H.R. Rep. No. 94-1476, at 64 (1976).</P>
          <P>(b) The term regularly scheduled newscasts means transmission programs in any format that report on current events, regardless of quality, subject matter, or significance, and that air on a periodic basis, (including but not limited to daily, weekly, or quarterly), or on an occasional basis, but not on a special, one-time basis. The term on-the-spot coverage of news events refers to transmission programs in any format that report on reasonably recent current events, regardless of quality, subject matter, or significance, and that are aired in a timely manner but not necessarily contemporaneously with the recording of the events.</P>
          <P>(c) The term staff for the purpose of this part includes both Library employees and contractors.</P>
        </SECTION>
        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 705.4</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Reproduction.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Library of Congress staff acting under the general authority of the Librarian of Congress may reproduce fixations of television and radio transmission programs consisting of regularly scheduled newscasts or on-the-spot coverage of news events directly from transmissions to the public in the United States in accordance with section 170(b) of title 2 of the United States Code. Recording may be accomplished in the same or another tangible form as the original transmission. The choice of programs selected for recording will be made consistent with the purpose of, and based on the criteria set forth in, the American Television and Radio Archives Act at 2 U.S.C. 170(a), and on Library of Congress acquisition policies in effect at the time of recording.</P>
          <P>(b) Specific notice of an intent to copy a transmission program will ordinarily not be given. In general, the Library of Congress will seek to copy off-the-air selected portions of the programming transmitted by both noncommercial educational broadcast stations as defined in section 397 of title 47 of the United States Code, and by commercial broadcast stations. Upon written request addressed to the Chief, Motion Picture, Broadcasting and Recorded Sound Division by a broadcast station or other owner of the right of transmission, the Library of Congress will inform the requestor whether a particular transmission program has been copied by the Library.</P>

          <P>(a) All copies and phonorecords acquired under this part will be maintained by the Motion Picture, Broadcasting and Recorded Sound Division of the Library of Congress. The Library may make such copies or phonorecords of a program as are necessary for purposes of preservation, security, and, as specified in § 705.7, distribution.</P>
          <P>(b) To the extent that the Library of Congress's use of copies and phonorecords acquired under this part is not subject to the provisions of the American Television and Radio Archives Act (section 170 of title 2 of the United States Code) and this part, such use shall be subject to the restrictions concerning copying and access found in Library of Congress Regulation 818-17, “Policies Governing the Use and Availability of Motion Pictures and Other Audiovisual Works in the Collections of the Library of Congress,” and Library of Congress Regulation 818-18.1, “Recorded Sound Listening and Duplication Services” available from the Office of the General Counsel, Library of Congress, Washington, DC 20540-1050.

          <P>(b) Compilations shall be organized, to the greatest extent possible, in chronological order, and shall include the entirety of any particular news segment.<PRTPAGE P="87"/>
          </P>
          <P>(c) No compilation by the Librarian shall be deemed for any purpose or proceeding to be an official determination of the subject matter covered by such compilation.</P>

          <P>(b) Library staff will advise all recipients of such reproductions that such distribution shall be only for the purposes of research and not for further reproduction or performance, and that any use in excess of that permitted by the American Television and Radio Archives Act (section 170 of title 2 of the United States Code), title 17 of the United States Code, and this part may violate copyrights or other rights.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 800.1</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Purposes.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Purposes of the section 106 process.</E> Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act requires Federal agencies to take into account the effects of their undertakings on historic properties and afford the Council a reasonable opportunity to comment on such undertakings. The procedures in this part define how Federal agencies meet these statutory responsibilities. The section 106 process seeks to accommodate historic preservation concerns with the needs of Federal undertakings through consultation among the agency official and other parties with an interest in the effects of the undertaking on historic properties, commencing at the early stages of project planning. The goal of consultation is to identify historic properties potentially affected by the undertaking, assess its effects and seek ways to avoid, minimize or mitigate any adverse effects on historic properties.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Relation to other provisions of the act.</E> Section 106 is related to other provisions of the act designed to further the national policy of historic preservation. References to those provisions are included in this part to identify circumstances where they may affect actions taken to meet section 106 requirements. Such provisions may have their own implementing regulations or guidelines and are not intended to be implemented by the procedures in this part except insofar as they relate to the section 106 process. Guidelines, policies, and procedures issued by other agencies, including the Secretary, have been cited in this part for ease of access and are not incorporated by reference.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Timing.</E> The agency official must complete the section 106 process “prior to the approval of the expenditure of any Federal funds on the undertaking or prior to the issuance of any license.” This does not prohibit agency official from conducting or authorizing nondestructive project planning activities before completing compliance with section 106, provided that such actions do not restrict the subsequent consideration of alternatives to avoid, minimize or mitigate the undertaking's adverse effects on historic properties. The agency official shall ensure that the section 106 process is initiated early in the undertaking's planning, so that a broad range of alternatives may be considered during the planning process for the undertaking.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 800.2</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Participants in the Section 106 process.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Agency official.</E> It is the statutory obligation of the Federal agency to fulfill the requirements of section 106 and to ensure that an agency official with jurisdiction over an undertaking takes legal and financial responsibility for section 106 compliance in accordance with subpart B of this part. The agency official has approval authority for the undertaking and can commit the Federal agency to take appropriate action <PRTPAGE P="92"/>for a specific undertaking as a result of section 106 compliance. For the purposes of subpart C of this part, the agency official has the authority to commit the Federal agency to any obligation it may assume in the implementation of a program alternative. The agency official may be a State, local, or tribal government official who has been delegated legal responsibility for compliance with section 106 in accordance with Federal law.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Professional standards.</E> Section 112(a)(1)(A) of the act requires each Federal agency responsible for the protection of historic resources, including archeological resources, to ensure that all actions taken by employees or contractors of the agency shall meet professional standards under regulations developed by the Secretary.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Lead Federal agency.</E> If more than one Federal agency is involved in an undertaking, some or all the agencies may designate a lead Federal agency, which shall identify the appropriate official to serve as the agency official who shall act on their behalf, fulfilling their collective responsibilities under section 106. Those Federal agencies that do not designate a lead Federal agency remain individually responsible for their compliance with this part.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Use of contractors.</E> Consistent with applicable conflict of interest laws, the agency official may use the services of applicants, consultants, or designees to prepare information, analyses and recommendations under this part. The agency official remains legally responsible for all required findings and determinations. If a document or study is prepared by a non-Federal party, the agency official is responsible for ensuring that its content meets applicable standards and guidelines.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Consultation.</E> The agency official shall involve the consulting parties described in paragraph (c) of this section in findings and determinations made during the section 106 process. The agency official should plan consultations appropriate to the scale of the undertaking and the scope of Federal involvement and coordinated with other requirements of other statutes, as applicable, such as the National Environmental Policy Act, the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, the American Indian Religious Freedom Act, the Archeological Resources Protection Act, and agency-specific legislation. The Council encourages the agency official to use to the extent possible existing agency procedures and mechanisms to fulfill the consultation requirements of this part.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Council.</E> The Council issues regulations to implement section 106, provides guidance and advice on the application of the procedures in this part, and generally oversees the operation of the section 106 process. The Council also consults with and comments to agency officials on individual undertakings and programs that affect historic properties.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Council entry into the section 106 process.</E> When the Council determines that its involvement is necessary to ensure that the purposes of section 106 and the act are met, the Council may enter the section 106 process. Criteria guiding Council decisions to enter the section 106 process are found in appendix A to this part. The Council will document that the criteria have been met and notify the parties to the section 106 process as required by this part.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Council assistance.</E> Participants in the section 106 process may seek advice, guidance and assistance from the Council on the application of this part to specific undertakings, including the resolution of disagreements, whether or not the Council is formally involved in the review of the undertaking. If questions arise regarding the conduct of the section 106 process, participants are encouraged to obtain the Council's advice on completing the process.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Consulting parties.</E> The following parties have consultative roles in the section 106 process.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">State historic preservation officer.</E> (i) The State historic preservation officer (SHPO) reflects the interests of the State and its citizens in the preservation of their cultural heritage. In accordance with section 101(b)(3) of the act, the SHPO advises and assists Federal agencies in carrying out their section 106 responsibilities and cooperates with such agencies, local governments and organizations and individuals to <PRTPAGE P="93"/>ensure that historic properties are taking into consideration at all levels of planning and development.</P>
            <P>(ii) If an Indian tribe has assumed the functions of the SHPO in the section 106 process for undertakings on tribal lands, the SHPO shall participate as a consulting party if the undertaking takes place on tribal lands but affects historic properties off tribal lands, if requested in accordance with § 800.3(c)(1), or if the Indian tribe agrees to include the SHPO pursuant to § 800.3(f)(3).</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations.</E> (i) <E T="03">Consultation on tribal lands.</E> (A) <E T="03">Tribal historic preservation officer.</E> For a tribe that has assumed the responsibilities of the SHPO for section 106 on tribal lands under section 101(d)(2) of the act, the tribal historic preservation officer (THPO) appointed or designated in accordance with the act is the official representative for the purposes of section 106. The agency official shall consult with the THPO in lieu of the SHPO regarding undertakings occurring on or affecting historic properties on tribal lands.</P>
            <P>(B) <E T="03">Tribes that have not assumed SHPO functions.</E> When an Indian tribe has not assumed the responsibilities of the SHPO for section 106 on tribal lands under section 101(d)(2) of the act, the agency official shall consult with a representative designated by such Indian tribe in addition to the SHPO regarding undertakings occurring on or affecting historic properties on its tribal lands. Such Indian tribes have the same rights of consultation and concurrence that the THPOs are given throughout subpart B of this part, except that such consultations shall be in addition to and on the same basis as consultation with the SHPO.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Consultation on historic properties of significance to Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations.</E> Section 101(d)(6)(B) of the act requires the agency official to consult with any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization that attaches religious and cultural significance to historic properties that may be affected by an undertaking. This requirement applies regardless of the location of the historic property. Such Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization shall be a consulting party.</P>
            <P>(A) The agency official shall ensure that consultation in the section 106 process provides the Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization a reasonable opportunity to identify its concerns about historic properties, advise on the identification and evaluation of historic properties, including those of traditional religious and cultural importance, articulate its views on the undertaking's effects on such properties, and participate in the resolution of adverse effects. It is the responsibility of the agency official to make a reasonable and good faith effort to identify Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations that shall be consulted in the section 106 process. Consultation should commence early in the planning process, in order to identify and discuss relevant preservation issues and resolve concerns about the confidentiality of information on historic properties.</P>
            <P>(B) The Federal Government has a unique legal relationship with Indian tribes set forth in the Constitution of the United States, treaties, statutes, and court decisions. Consultation with Indian tribes should be conducted in a sensitive manner respectful of tribal sovereignty. Nothing in this part alters, amends, repeals, interprets, or modifies tribal sovereignty, any treaty rights, or other rights of an Indian tribe, or preempts, modifies, or limits the exercise of any such rights.</P>
            <P>(C) Consultation with an Indian tribe must recognize the government-to-government relationship between the Federal Government and Indian tribes. The agency official shall consult with representatives designated or identified by the tribal government or the governing body of a Native Hawaiian organization. Consultation with Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations should be conducted in a manner sensitive to the concerns and needs of the Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization.</P>

            <P>(D) When Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations attach religious and cultural significance to historic properties off tribal lands, section 101(d)(6)(B) of the act requires Federal agencies to consult with such Indian <PRTPAGE P="94"/>tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations in the section 106 process. Federal agencies should be aware that frequently historic properties of religious and cultural significance are located on ancestral, aboriginal, or ceded lands of Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations and should consider that when complying with the procedures in this part.</P>
            <P>(E) An Indian tribe or a Native Hawaiian organization may enter into an agreement with an agency official that specifies how they will carry out responsibilities under this part, including concerns over the confidentiality of information. An agreement may cover all aspects of tribal participation in the section 106 process, provided that no modification may be made in the roles of other parties to the section 106 process without their consent. An agreement may grant the Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization additional rights to participate or concur in agency decisions in the section 106 process beyond those specified in subpart B of this part. The agency official shall provide a copy of any such agreement to the Council and the appropriate SHPOs.</P>
            <P>(F) An Indian tribe that has not assumed the responsibilities of the SHPO for section 106 on tribal lands under section 101(d)(2) of the act may notify the agency official in writing that it is waiving its rights under § 800.6(c)(1) to execute a memorandum of agreement.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Representatives of local governments.</E> A representative of a local government with jurisdiction over the area in which the effects of an undertaking may occur is entitled to participate as a consulting party. Under other provisions of Federal law, the local government may be authorized to act as the agency official for purposes of section 106.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Applicants for Federal assistance, permits, licenses, and other approvals.</E> An applicant for Federal assistance or for a Federal permit, license, or other approval is entitled to participate as a consulting party as defined in this part. The agency official may authorize an applicant or group of applicants to initiate consultation with the SHPO/THPO and others, but remains legally responsible for all findings and determinations charged to the agency official. The agency official shall notify the SHPO/THPO when an applicant or group of applicants is so authorized. A Federal agency may authorize all applicants in a specific program pursuant to this section by providing notice to all SHPO/THPOs. Federal agencies that provide authorizations to applicants remain responsible for their government-to-government relationships with Indian tribes.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Additional consulting parties.</E> Certain individuals and organizations with a demonstrated interest in the undertaking may participate as consulting parties due to the nature of their legal or economic relation to the undertaking or affected properties, or their concern with the undertaking's effects on historic properties.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">The public</E>—(1) <E T="03">Nature of involvement.</E> The views of the public are essential to informed Federal decisionmaking in the section 106 process. The agency official shall seek and consider the views of the public in a manner that reflects the nature and complexity of the undertaking and its effects on historic properties, the likely interest of the public in the effects on historic properties, confidentiality concerns of private individuals and businesses, and the relationship of the Federal involvement to the undertaking.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Providing notice and information.</E> The agency official must, except where appropriate to protect confidentiality concerns of affected parties, provide the public with information about an undertaking and its effects on historic properties and seek public comment and input. Members of the public may also provide views on their own initiative for the agency official to consider in decisionmaking.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Use of agency procedures.</E> The agency official may use the agency's procedures for public involvement under the National Environmental Policy Act or other program requirements in lieu of public involvement requirements in subpart B of this part, if they provide adequate opportunities for public involvement consistent with this subpart.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 800.3</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Initiation of the section 106 process.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Establish undertaking.</E> The agency official shall determine whether the proposed Federal action is an undertaking as defined in § 800.16(y) and, if so, whether it is a type of activity that has the potential to cause effects on historic properties.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">No potential to cause effects.</E> If the undertaking is a type of activity that does not have the potential to cause effects on historic properties, assuming such historic properties were present, the agency official has no further obligations under section 106 or this part.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Program alternatives.</E> If the review of the undertaking is governed by a Federal agency program alternative established under § 800.14 or a programmatic agreement in existence before January 11, 2001, the agency official shall follow the program alternative.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Coordinate with other reviews.</E> The agency official should coordinate the steps of the section 106 process, as appropriate, with the overall planning schedule for the undertaking and with any reviews required under other authorities such as the National Environmental Policy Act, the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, the American Indian Religious Freedom Act, the Archeological Resources Protection Act, and agency-specific legislation, such as section 4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act. Where consistent with the procedures in this subpart, the agency official may use information developed for other reviews under Federal, State, or tribal law to meet the requirements of section 106.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Identify the appropriate SHPO and/or THPO.</E> As part of its initial planning, the agency official shall determine the appropriate SHPO or SHPOs to be involved in the section 106 process. The agency official shall also determine whether the undertaking may occur on or affect historic properties on any tribal lands and, if so, whether a THPO has assumed the duties of the SHPO. The agency official shall then initiate consultation with the appropriate officer or officers.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Tribal assumption of SHPO responsibilities.</E> Where an Indian tribe has assumed the section 106 responsibilities of the SHPO on tribal lands pursuant to section 101(d)(2) of the act, consultation for undertakings occurring on tribal land or for effects on tribal land is with the THPO for the Indian tribe in lieu of the SHPO. Section 101(d)(2)(D)(iii) of the act authorizes owners of properties on tribal lands which are neither owned by a member of the tribe nor held in trust by the Secretary for the benefit of the tribe to request the SHPO to participate in the section 106 process in addition to the THPO.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Undertakings involving more than one State.</E> If more than one State is involved in an undertaking, the involved SHPOs may agree to designate a lead SHPO to act on their behalf in the section 106 process, including taking actions that would conclude the section 106 process under this subpart.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Conducting consultation.</E> The agency official should consult with the SHPO/THPO in a manner appropriate to the agency planning process for the undertaking and to the nature of the undertaking and its effects on historic properties.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Failure of the SHPO/THPO to respond.</E> If the SHPO/THPO fails to respond within 30 days of receipt of a request for review of a finding or determination, the agency official may either proceed to the next step in the process based on the finding or determination or consult with the Council in lieu of the SHPO/THPO. If the SHPO/THPO re-enters the Section 106 process, the agency official shall continue the consultation without being required to reconsider previous findings or determinations.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Consultation on tribal lands.</E> Where the Indian tribe has not assumed the responsibilities of the SHPO on tribal lands, consultation with the Indian tribe regarding undertakings occurring on such tribe's lands or effects on such tribal lands shall be in addition to and on the same basis as consultation with the SHPO. If the SHPO has withdrawn from the process, the agency official may complete the section 106 process <PRTPAGE P="96"/>with the Indian tribe and the Council, as appropriate. An Indian tribe may enter into an agreement with a SHPO or SHPOs specifying the SHPO's participation in the section 106 process for undertakings occurring on or affecting historic properties on tribal lands.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Plan to involve the public.</E> In consultation with the SHPO/THPO, the agency official shall plan for involving the public in the section 106 process. The agency official shall identify the appropriate points for seeking public input and for notifying the public of proposed actions, consistent with § 800.2(d).</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Identify other consulting parties.</E> In consultation with the SHPO/THPO, the agency official shall identify any other parties entitled to be consulting parties and invite them to participate as such in the section 106 process. The agency official may invite others to participate as consulting parties as the section 106 process moves forward.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Involving local governments and applicants.</E> The agency official shall invite any local governments or applicants that are entitled to be consulting parties under § 800.2(c).</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Involving Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations.</E> The agency official shall make a reasonable and good faith effort to identify any Indian tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations that might attach religious and cultural significance to historic properties in the area of potential effects and invite them to be consulting parties. Such Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization that requests in writing to be a consulting party shall be one.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Requests to be consulting parties.</E> The agency official shall consider all written requests of individuals and organizations to participate as consulting parties and, in consultation with the SHPO/THPO and any Indian tribe upon whose tribal lands an undertaking occurs or affects historic properties, determine which should be consulting parties.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Expediting consultation.</E> A consultation by the agency official with the SHPO/THPO and other consulting parties may address multiple steps in §§ 800.3 through 800.6 where the agency official and the SHPO/THPO agree it is appropriate as long as the consulting parties and the public have an adequate opportunity to express their views as provided in § 800.2(d).</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 800.4</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Identification of historic properties.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Determine scope of identification efforts.</E> In consultation with the SHPO/THPO, the agency official shall:</P>
            <P>(1) Determine and document the area of potential effects, as defined in § 800.16(d);</P>
            <P>(2) Review existing information on historic properties within the area of potential effects, including any data concerning possible historic properties not yet identified;</P>
            <P>(3) Seek information, as appropriate, from consulting parties, and other individuals and organizations likely to have knowledge of, or concerns with, historic properties in the area, and identify issues relating to the undertaking's potential effects on historic properties; and</P>
            <P>(4) Gather information from any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization identified pursuant to § 800.3(f) to assist in identifying properties, including those located off tribal lands, which may be of religious and cultural significance to them and may be eligible for the National Register, recognizing that an Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization may be reluctant to divulge specific information regarding the location, nature, and activities associated with such sites. The agency official should address concerns raised about confidentiality pursuant to § 800.11(c).</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Identify historic properties.</E> Based on the information gathered under paragraph (a) of this section, and in consultation with the SHPO/THPO and any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization that might attach religious and cultural significance to properties within the area of potential effects, the agency official shall take the steps necessary to identify historic properties within the area of potential effects.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Level of effort.</E> The agency official shall make a reasonable and good faith effort to carry out appropriate identification efforts, which may include background research, consultation, <PRTPAGE P="97"/>oral history interviews, sample field investigation, and field survey. The agency official shall take into account past planning, research and studies, the magnitude and nature of the undertaking and the degree of Federal involvement, the nature and extent of potential effects on historic properties, and the likely nature and location of historic properties within the area of potential effects. The Secretary's standards and guidelines for identification provide guidance on this subject. The agency official should also consider other applicable professional, State, tribal, and local laws, standards, and guidelines. The agency official shall take into account any confidentiality concerns raised by Indian tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations during the identification process.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Phased identification and evaluation.</E> Where alternatives under consideration consist of corridors or large land areas, or where access to properties is restricted, the agency official may use a phased process to conduct identification and evaluation efforts. The agency official may also defer final identification and evaluation of historic properties if it is specifically provided for in a memorandum of agreement executed pursuant to § 800.6, a programmatic agreement executed pursuant to § 800.14(b), or the documents used by an agency official to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act pursuant to § 800.8. The process should establish the likely presence of historic properties within the area of potential effects for each alternative or inaccessible area through background research, consultation and an appropriate level of field investigation, taking into account the number of alternatives under consideration, the magnitude of the undertaking and its likely effects, and the views of the SHPO/THPO and any other consulting parties. As specific aspects or locations of an alternative are refined or access is gained, the agency official shall proceed with the identification and evaluation of historic properties in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) and (c) of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Evaluate historic significance</E>—(1) <E T="03">Apply National Register criteria.</E> In consultation with the SHPO/THPO and any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization that attaches religious and cultural significance to identified properties and guided by the Secretary's standards and guidelines for evaluation, the agency official shall apply the National Register criteria (36 CFR part 63) to properties identified within the area of potential effects that have not been previously evaluated for National Register eligibility. The passage of time, changing perceptions of significance, or incomplete prior evaluations may require the agency official to reevaluate properties previously determined eligible or ineligible. The agency official shall acknowledge that Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations possess special expertise in assessing the eligibility of historic properties that may possess religious and cultural significance to them.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Determine whether a property is eligible.</E> If the agency official determines any of the National Register criteria are met and the SHPO/THPO agrees, the property shall be considered eligible for the National Register for section 106 purposes. If the agency official determines the criteria are not met and the SHPO/THPO agrees, the property shall be considered not eligible. If the agency official and the SHPO/THPO do not agree, or if the Council or the Secretary so request, the agency official shall obtain a determination of eligibility from the Secretary pursuant to 36 CFR part 63. If an Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization that attaches religious and cultural significance to a property off tribal lands does not agree, it may ask the Council to request the agency official to obtain a determination of eligibility.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Results of identification and evaluation</E>—(1) <E T="03">No historic properties affected.</E> If the agency official finds that either there are no historic properties present or there are historic properties present but the undertaking will have no effect upon them as defined in § 800.16(i), the agency official shall provide documentation of this finding, as set forth in § 800.11(d), to the SHPO/THPO. The agency official shall notify all consulting parties, including Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations, and make the documentation available <PRTPAGE P="98"/>for public inspection prior to approving the undertaking.</P>
            <P>(i) If the SHPO/THPO, or the Council if it has entered the section 106 process, does not object within 30 days of receipt of an adequately documented finding, the agency official's responsibilities under section 106 are fulfilled.</P>
            <P>(ii) If the SHPO/THPO objects within 30 days of receipt of an adequately documented finding, the agency official shall either consult with the objecting party to resolve the disagreement, or forward the finding and supporting documentation to the Council and request that the Council review the finding pursuant to paragraphs (d)(1)(iv)(A) through (d)(1)(iv)(C) of this section. When an agency official forwards such requests for review to the Council, the agency official shall concurrently notify all consulting parties that such a request has been made and make the request documentation available to the public.</P>
            <P>(iii) During the SHPO/THPO 30 day review period, the Council may object to the finding and provide its opinion regarding the finding to the agency official and, if the Council determines the issue warrants it, the head of the agency. A Council decision to provide its opinion to the head of an agency shall be guided by the criteria in appendix A to this part. The agency shall then proceed according to paragraphs (d)(1)(iv)(B) and (d)(1)(iv)(C) of this section.</P>
            <P>(iv) (A) Upon receipt of the request under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, the Council will have 30 days in which to review the finding and provide the agency official and, if the Council determines the issue warrants it, the head of the agency with the Council's opinion regarding the finding. A Council decision to provide its opinion to the head of an agency shall be guided by the criteria in appendix A to this part. If the Council does not respond within 30 days of receipt of the request, the agency official's responsibilities under section 106 are fulfilled.</P>
            <P>(B) The person to whom the Council addresses its opinion (the agency official or the head of the agency) shall take into account the Council's opinion before the agency reaches a final decision on the finding.</P>
            <P>(C) The person to whom the Council addresses its opinion (the agency official or the head of the agency) shall then prepare a summary of the decision that contains the rationale for the decision and evidence of consideration of the Council's opinion, and provide it to the Council, the SHPO/THPO, and the consulting parties. The head of the agency may delegate his or her duties under this paragraph to the agency's senior policy official. If the agency official's initial finding will be revised, the agency official shall proceed in accordance with the revised finding. If the final decision of the agency is to affirm the initial agency finding of no historic properties affected, once the summary of the decision has been sent to the Council, the SHPO/THPO, and the consulting parties, the agency official's responsibilities under section 106 are fulfilled.</P>
            <P>(D) The Council shall retain a record of agency responses to Council opinions on their findings of no historic properties affected. The Council shall make this information available to the public.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Historic properties affected.</E> If the agency official finds that there are historic properties which may be affected by the undertaking, the agency official shall notify all consulting parties, including Indian tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations, invite their views on the effects and assess adverse effects, if any, in accordance with § 800.5.</P>

The agency official shall consider any views concerning such effects which have been provided by consulting parties and the public.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Criteria of adverse effect.</E> An adverse effect is found when an undertaking may alter, directly or indirectly, any of the characteristics of a <PRTPAGE P="99"/>historic property that qualify the property for inclusion in the National Register in a manner that would diminish the integrity of the property's location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, or association. Consideration shall be given to all qualifying characteristics of a historic property, including those that may have been identified subsequent to the original evaluation of the property's eligibility for the National Register. Adverse effects may include reasonably foreseeable effects caused by the undertaking that may occur later in time, be farther removed in distance or be cumulative.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Examples of adverse effects.</E> Adverse effects on historic properties include, but are not limited to:</P>
            <P>(i) Physical destruction of or damage to all or part of the property;</P>
            <P>(ii) Alteration of a property, including restoration, rehabilitation, repair, maintenance, stabilization, hazardous material remediation, and provision of handicapped access, that is not consistent with the Secretary's standards for the treatment of historic properties (36 CFR part 68) and applicable guidelines;</P>
            <P>(iii) Removal of the property from its historic location;</P>
            <P>(iv) Change of the character of the property's use or of physical features within the property's setting that contribute to its historic significance;</P>
            <P>(v) Introduction of visual, atmospheric or audible elements that diminish the integrity of the property's significant historic features;</P>
            <P>(vi) Neglect of a property which causes its deterioration, except where such neglect and deterioration are recognized qualities of a property of religious and cultural significance to an Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization; and</P>
            <P>(vii) Transfer, lease, or sale of property out of Federal ownership or control without adequate and legally enforceable restrictions or conditions to ensure long-term preservation of the property's historic significance.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Phased application of criteria.</E> Where alternatives under consideration consist of corridors or large land areas, or where access to properties is restricted, the agency official may use a phased process in applying the criteria of adverse effect consistent with phased identification and evaluation efforts conducted pursuant to § 800.4(b)(2).</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Finding of no adverse effect.</E> The agency official, in consultation with the SHPO/THPO, may propose a finding of no adverse effect when the undertaking's effects do not meet the criteria of paragraph (a)(1) of this section or the undertaking is modified or conditions are imposed, such as the subsequent review of plans for rehabilitation by the SHPO/THPO to ensure consistency with the Secretary's standards for the treatment of historic properties (36 CFR part 68) and applicable guidelines, to avoid adverse effects.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Consulting party review.</E> If the agency official proposes a finding of no adverse effect, the agency official shall notify all consulting parties of the finding and provide them with the documentation specified in § 800.11(e). The SHPO/THPO shall have 30 days from receipt to review the finding.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Agreement with, or no objection to, finding.</E> Unless the Council is reviewing the finding pursuant to papagraph (c)(3) of this section, the agency official may proceed after the close of the 30 day review period if the SHPO/THPO has agreed with the finding or has not provided a response, and no consulting party has objected. The agency official shall then carry out the undertaking in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Disagreement with finding.</E> (i) If within the 30 day review period the SHPO/THPO or any consulting party notifies the agency official in writing that it disagrees with the finding and specifies the reasons for the disagreement in the notification, the agency official shall either consult with the party to resolve the disagreement, or request the Council to review the finding pursuant to paragraphs (c)(3)(i) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section. The agency official shall include with such request the documentation specified in § 800.11(e). The agency official shall also concurrently notify all consulting parties that such a submission has been made and make the submission documentation available to the public.<PRTPAGE P="100"/>
            </P>
            <P>(ii) If within the 30 day review period the Council provides the agency official and, if the Council determines the issue warrants it, the head of the agency, with a written opinion objecting to the finding, the agency shall then proceed according to paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section. A Council decision to provide its opinion to the head of an agency shall be guided by the criteria in appendix A to this part.</P>
            <P>(iii) The agency official should seek the concurrence of any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization that has made known to the agency official that it attaches religious and cultural significance to a historic property subject to the finding. If such Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization disagrees with the finding, it may within the 30 day review period specify the reasons for disagreeing with the finding and request the Council to review and object to the finding pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Council review of findings.</E> (i) When a finding is submitted to the Council pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the Council shall review the finding and provide the agency official and, if the Council determines the issue warrants it, the head of the agency with its opinion as to whether the adverse effect criteria have been correctly applied. A Council decision to provide its opinion to the head of an agency shall be guided by the criteria in appendix A to this part. The Council will provide its opinion within 15 days of receiving the documented finding from the agency official. The Council at its discretion may extend that time period for 15 days, in which case it shall notify the agency of such extension prior to the end of the initial 15 day period. If the Council does not respond within the applicable time period, the agency official's responsibilities under section 106 are fulfilled.</P>
            <P>(ii)(A) The person to whom the Council addresses its opinion (the agency official or the head of the agency) shall take into account the Council's opinion in reaching a final decision on the finding.</P>
            <P>(B) The person to whom the Council addresses its opinion (the agency official or the head of the agency) shall prepare a summary of the decision that contains the rationale for the decision and evidence of consideration of the Council's opinion, and provide it to the Council, the SHPO/THPO, and the consulting parties. The head of the agency may delegate his or her duties under this paragraph to the agency's senior policy official. If the agency official's initial finding will be revised, the agency official shall proceed in accordance with the revised finding. If the final decision of the agency is to affirm the initial finding of no adverse effect, once the summary of the decision has been sent to the Council, the SHPO/THPO, and the consulting parties, the agency official's responsibilities under section 106 are fulfilled.</P>
            <P>(C) The Council shall retain a record of agency responses to Council opinions on their findings of no adverse effects. The Council shall make this information available to the public.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Results of assessment</E>—(1) <E T="03">No adverse effect.</E> The agency official shall maintain a record of the finding and provide information on the finding to the public on request, consistent with the confidentiality provisions of § 800.11(c). Implementation of the undertaking in accordance with the finding as documented fulfills the agency official's responsibilities under section 106 and this part. If the agency official will not conduct the undertaking as proposed in the finding, the agency official shall reopen consultation under paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Adverse effect.</E> If an adverse effect is found, the agency official shall consult further to resolve the adverse effect pursuant to § 800.6.</P>

The agency official should use appropriate mechanisms, taking into account the magnitude of the undertaking and the nature of its effects upon historic properties, the likely effects on historic properties, and the relationship of the Federal involvement to the undertaking to ensure that the public's views are considered in the consultation. The agency official should also consider the extent of notice and information concerning historic preservation issues afforded the public at earlier steps in the section 106 process to determine the appropriate level of public involvement when resolving adverse effects so that the standards of § 800.2(d) are met.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Restrictions on disclosure of information.</E> Section 304 of the act and other authorities may limit the disclosure of information under paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) of this section.

            <SUBJECT>Coordination With the National Environmental Policy Act.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General principles</E>—(1) <E T="03">Early coordination.</E> Federal agencies are encouraged to coordinate compliance with section 106 and the procedures in this part with any steps taken to meet the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Agencies should consider their section 106 responsibilities as early as possible in the NEPA process, and plan their public participation, analysis, and review in such a way that they can meet the purposes and requirements of both statutes in a timely and efficient manner. The determination of whether an undertaking is a “major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment,” and therefore requires preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS) under NEPA, should include consideration of the undertaking's likely effects on historic properties. A finding of adverse effect on a historic property does not necessarily require an EIS under NEPA.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Consulting party roles.</E> SHPO/THPOs, Indian tribes, and Native Hawaiian organizations, other consulting parties, and organizations and individuals who may be concerned with the possible effects of an agency action on historic properties should be prepared to consult with agencies early in the NEPA process, when the purpose of and need for the proposed action as well as the widest possible range of alternatives are under consideration.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Inclusion of historic preservation issues.</E> Agency officials should ensure that preparation of an environmental assessment (EA) and finding of no significant impact (FONSI) or an EIS and record of decision (ROD) includes appropriate scoping, identification of historic properties, assessment of effects upon them, and consultation leading to resolution of any adverse effects.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Actions categorically excluded under NEPA.</E> If a project, activity or program is categorically excluded from NEPA review under an agency's NEPA procedures, the agency official shall determine if it still qualifies as an undertaking requiring review under section 106 pursuant to § 800.3(a). If so, the agency official shall proceed with section 106 review in accordance with the procedures in this subpart.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Use of the NEPA process for section 106 purposes.</E> An agency official may use the process and documentation required for the preparation of an EA/FONSI or an EIS/ROD to comply with section 106 in lieu of the procedures set forth in §§ 800.3 through 800.6 if the agency official has notified in advance the SHPO/THPO and the Council that it intends to do so and the following standards are met.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Standards for developing environmental documents to comply with Section 106.</E> During preparation of the EA or draft EIS (DEIS) the agency official shall:</P>
            <P>(i) Identify consulting parties either pursuant to § 800.3(f) or through the NEPA scoping process with results consistent with § 800.3(f);</P>
            <P>(ii) Identify historic properties and assess the effects of the undertaking on such properties in a manner consistent with the standards and criteria of §§ 800.4 through 800.5, provided that the scope and timing of these steps may be phased to reflect the agency official's consideration of project alternatives in the NEPA process and the effort is commensurate with the assessment of other environmental factors;</P>
            <P>(iii) Consult regarding the effects of the undertaking on historic properties with the SHPO/THPO, Indian tribes, and Native Hawaiian organizations that might attach religious and cultural significance to affected historic properties, other consulting parties, and the Council, where appropriate, during NEPA scoping, environmental analysis, and the preparation of NEPA documents;</P>

            <P>(iv) Involve the public in accordance with the agency's published NEPA procedures; and (v) Develop in consultation with identified consulting parties alternatives and proposed measures that might avoid, minimize or mitigate any adverse effects of the undertaking on historic properties and describe them in the EA or DEIS.<PRTPAGE P="105"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Review of environmental documents.</E> (i) The agency official shall submit the EA, DEIS, or EIS to the SHPO/THPO, Indian tribes, and Native Hawaiian organizations that might attach religious and cultural significance to affected historic properties, and other consulting parties prior to or when making the document available for public comment. If the document being prepared is a DEIS or EIS, the agency official shall also submit it to the Council.</P>
            <P>(ii) Prior to or within the time allowed for public comment on the document, a SHPO/THPO, an Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization, another consulting party or the Council may object to the agency official that preparation of the EA, DEIS, or EIS has not met the standards set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section or that the substantive resolution of the effects on historic properties proposed in an EA, DEIS, or EIS is inadequate. If the agency official receives such an objection, the agency official shall refer the matter to the Council.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Resolution of objections.</E> Within 30 days of the agency official's referral of an objection under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, the Council shall review the objection and notify the agency as to its opinion on the objection.</P>
            <P>(i) If the Council agrees with the objection:</P>
            <P>(A) The Council shall provide the agency official and, if the Council determines the issue warrants it, the head of the agency with the Council's opinion regarding the objection. A Council decision to provide its opinion to the head of an agency shall be guided by the criteria in appendix A to this part. The person to whom the Council addresses its opinion (the agency official or the head of the agency) shall take into account the Council's opinion in reaching a final decision on the issue of the objection.</P>
            <P>(B) The person to whom the Council addresses its opinion (the agency official or the head of the agency) shall prepare a summary of the decision that contains the rationale for the decision and evidence of consideration of the Council's opinion, and provide it to the Council. The head of the agency may delegate his or her duties under this paragraph to the agency's senior Policy Official. If the agency official's initial decision regarding the matter that is the subject of the objection will be revised, the agency official shall proceed in accordance with the revised decision. If the final decision of the agency is to affirm the initial agency decision, once the summary of the final decision has been sent to the Council, the agency official shall continue its compliance with this section.</P>
            <P>(ii) If the Council disagrees with the objection, the Council shall so notify the agency official, in which case the agency official shall continue its compliance with this section.</P>
            <P>(iii) If the Council fails to respond to the objection within the 30 day period, the agency official shall continue its compliance with this section.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Approval of the undertaking.</E> If the agency official has found, during the preparation of an EA or EIS that the effects of an undertaking on historic properties are adverse, the agency official shall develop measures in the EA, DEIS, or EIS to avoid, minimize, or mitigate such effects in accordance with paragraph (c)(1)(v) of this section. The agency official's responsibilities under section 106 and the procedures in this subpart shall then be satisfied when either:</P>
            <P>(i) A binding commitment to such proposed measures is incorporated in:</P>
            <P>(A) The ROD, if such measures were proposed in a DEIS or EIS; or</P>

            <SUBJECT>Council review of section 106 compliance.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Assessment of agency official compliance for individual undertakings.</E> The Council may provide to the agency official its advisory opinion regarding the substance of any finding, determination or decision or regarding the adequacy of the agency official's compliance with the procedures under this part. The Council may provide such advice at any time at the request of any individual, agency or organization or on its own initiative. The agency official shall consider the views of the Council in reaching a decision on the matter in question.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Agency foreclosure of the Council's opportunity to comment.</E> Where an agency official has failed to complete the requirements of section 106 in accordance with the procedures in this part prior to the approval of an undertaking, the Council's opportunity to comment may be foreclosed. The Council may review a case to determine whether a foreclosure has occurred. The Council shall notify the agency official and the agency's Federal preservation officer and allow 30 days for the agency official to provide information as to whether foreclosure has occurred. If the Council determines foreclosure has occurred, the Council shall transmit the determination to the agency official and the head of the agency. The Council shall also make the determination available to the public and any parties known to be interested in the undertaking and its effects upon historic properties.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Intentional adverse effects by applicants</E>—(1) <E T="03">Agency responsibility.</E> Section 110(k) of the act prohibits a Federal agency from granting a loan, loan guarantee, permit, license or other assistance to an applicant who, with intent to avoid the requirements of section 106, has intentionally significantly adversely affected a historic property to which the grant would relate, or having legal power to prevent it, has allowed such significant adverse effect to occur, unless the agency, after consultation with the Council, determines that circumstances justify granting such assistance despite the adverse effect created or permitted by the applicant. Guidance issued by the Secretary pursuant to section 110 of the act governs its implementation.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Consultation with the Council.</E> When an agency official determines, based on the actions of an applicant, that section 110(k) is applicable and that circumstances may justify granting the assistance, the agency official shall notify the Council and provide documentation specifying the circumstances under which the adverse effects to the historic property occurred and the degree of damage to the integrity of the property. This documentation shall include any views obtained from the applicant, SHPO/THPO, an Indian tribe if the undertaking occurs on or affects historic properties on tribal lands, and other parties known to be interested in the undertaking.</P>
            <P>(i) Within thirty days of receiving the agency official's notification, unless otherwise agreed to by the agency official, the Council shall provide the agency official with its opinion as to whether circumstances justify granting assistance to the applicant and any possible mitigation of the adverse effects.</P>
            <P>(ii) The agency official shall consider the Council's opinion in making a decision on whether to grant assistance to the applicant, and shall notify the Council, the SHPO/THPO, and other parties known to be interested in the undertaking prior to granting the assistance.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Compliance with Section 106.</E> If an agency official, after consulting with the Council, determines to grant the assistance, the agency official shall comply with §§ 800.3 through 800.6 to take into account the effects of the undertaking on any historic properties.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Evaluation of Section 106 operations.</E> The Council may evaluate the operation of the section 106 process by periodic reviews of how participants have fulfilled their legal responsibilities and how effectively the outcomes reached advance the purposes of the act.<PRTPAGE P="107"/>
            </P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Information from participants.</E> Section 203 of the act authorizes the Council to obtain information from Federal agencies necessary to conduct evaluation of the section 106 process. The agency official shall make documentation of agency policies, operating procedures and actions taken to comply with section 106 available to the Council upon request. The Council may request available information and documentation from other participants in the section 106 process.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Improving the operation of section 106.</E> Based upon any evaluation of the section 106 process, the Council may make recommendations to participants, the heads of Federal agencies, and the Secretary of actions to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the process. Where the Council determines that an agency official or a SHPO/THPO has failed to properly carry out the responsibilities assigned under the process in this part, the Council may participate in individual case reviews conducted under such process in addition to the SHPO/THPO for such period that it determines is necessary to improve performance or correct deficiencies. If the Council finds a pattern of failure by a Federal agency in carrying out its responsibilities under section 106, the Council may review the policies and programs of the agency related to historic preservation pursuant to section 202(a)(6) of the act and recommend methods to improve the effectiveness, coordination, and consistency of those policies and programs with section 106.</P>

When commenting on such undertakings, the Council shall use the process set forth in §§ 800.6 through 800.7 and give special consideration to protecting National Historic Landmarks as specified in this section.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Resolution of adverse effects.</E> The agency official shall request the Council to participate in any consultation to resolve adverse effects on National Historic Landmarks conducted under § 800.6.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Involvement of the Secretary.</E> The agency official shall notify the Secretary of any consultation involving a National Historic Landmark and invite the Secretary to participate in the consultation where there may be an adverse effect. The Council may request a report from the Secretary under section 213 of the act to assist in the consultation.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Report of outcome.</E> When the Council participates in consultation under this section, it shall report the outcome of the section 106 process, providing its written comments or any memoranda of agreement to which it is a signatory, to the Secretary and the head of the agency responsible for the undertaking.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Documentation standards.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Adequacy of documentation.</E> The agency official shall ensure that a determination, finding, or agreement under the procedures in this subpart is supported by sufficient documentation to enable any reviewing parties to understand its basis. The agency official shall provide such documentation to the extent permitted by law and within available funds. When an agency official is conducting phased identification or evaluation under this subpart, the documentation standards regarding description of historic properties may be applied flexibly. If the Council, or the SHPO/THPO when the Council is not involved, determines the applicable documentation standards are not met, the Council or the SHPO/THPO, as appropriate, shall notify the agency official and specify the information needed to meet the standard. At the request of the agency official or any of the consulting parties, the Council shall review any disputes over whether documentation standards are met and provide its views to the agency official and the consulting parties.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Format.</E> The agency official may use documentation prepared to comply <PRTPAGE P="108"/>with other laws to fulfill the requirements of the procedures in this subpart, if that documentation meets the standards of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Confidentiality</E>—(1) <E T="03">Authority to withhold information.</E> Section 304 of the act provides that the head of a Federal agency or other public official receiving grant assistance pursuant to the act, after consultation with the Secretary, shall withhold from public disclosure information about the location, character, or ownership of a historic property when disclosure may cause a significant invasion of privacy; risk harm to the historic property; or impede the use of a traditional religious site by practitioners. When the head of a Federal agency or other public official has determined that information should be withheld from the public pursuant to these criteria, the Secretary, in consultation with such Federal agency head or official, shall determine who may have access to the information for the purposes of carrying out the act.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Consultation with the Council.</E> When the information in question has been developed in the course of an agency's compliance with this part, the Secretary shall consult with the Council in reaching determinations on the withholding and release of information. The Federal agency shall provide the Council with available information, including views of the SHPO/THPO, Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations, related to the confidentiality concern. The Council shall advise the Secretary and the Federal agency within 30 days of receipt of adequate documentation.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Other authorities affecting confidentiality.</E> Other Federal laws and program requirements may limit public access to information concerning an undertaking and its effects on historic properties. Where applicable, those authorities shall govern public access to information developed in the section 106 process and may authorize the agency official to protect the privacy of non-governmental applicants.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Finding of no historic properties affected.</E> Documentation shall include:</P>
            <P>(1) A description of the undertaking, specifying the Federal involvement, and its area of potential effects, including photographs, maps, drawings, as necessary;</P>

            <SUBJECT>Emergency situations.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Agency procedures.</E> The agency official, in consultation with the appropriate SHPOs/THPOs, affected Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations, and the Council, is encouraged to develop procedures for taking historic properties into account during operations which respond to a disaster or emergency declared by the President, a tribal government, or the Governor of a State or which respond to other immediate threats to life or property. If approved by the Council, the procedures shall govern the agency's historic preservation responsibilities during any disaster or emergency in lieu of §§ 800.3 through 800.6.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Alternatives to agency procedures.</E> In the event an agency official proposes an emergency undertaking as an essential and immediate response to a disaster or emergency declared by the President, a tribal government, or the Governor of a State or another immediate threat to life or property, and the agency has not developed procedures pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, the agency official may comply with section 106 by:</P>
            <P>(1) Following a programmatic agreement developed pursuant to § 800.14(b) that contains specific provisions for dealing with historic properties in emergency situations; or</P>
            <P>(2) Notifying the Council, the appropriate SHPO/THPO and any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization that may attach religious and cultural significance to historic properties likely to be affected prior to the undertaking and affording them an opportunity to comment within seven days of notification. If the agency official determines that circumstances do not permit seven days for comment, the agency official shall notify the Council, the SHPO/THPO and the Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization and invite any comments within the time available.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Local governments responsible for section 106 compliance.</E> When a local government official serves as the agency official for section 106 compliance, paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section also apply to an imminent threat to public health or safety as a result of a natural disaster or emergency declared by a local government's chief executive officer or legislative body, provided that if the Council or SHPO/THPO objects to the proposed action within seven days, the agency official shall comply with §§ 800.3 through 800.6.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> This section applies only to undertakings that will be implemented within 30 days after the disaster or emergency has been formally declared by the appropriate authority. An agency may request an extension of the period of applicability from the Council prior to the expiration of the 30 days. Immediate rescue and salvage operations conducted to preserve life or property are exempt from the provisions of section 106 and this part.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Planning for subsequent discoveries</E>—(1) <E T="03">Using a programmatic agreement.</E> An agency official may develop a programmatic agreement pursuant to § 800.14(b) to govern the actions to be taken when historic properties are discovered during the implementation of an undertaking.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Using agreement documents.</E> When the agency official's identification efforts in accordance with § 800.4 indicate that historic properties are likely to be discovered during implementation of an undertaking and no programmatic agreement has been developed pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the agency official shall include in any finding of no adverse effect or memorandum of agreement a process to resolve any adverse effects upon such properties. Actions in conformance with the process satisfy the agency official's responsibilities under section 106 and this part.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Discoveries without prior planning.</E> If historic properties are discovered or unanticipated effects on historic properties found after the agency official has completed the section 106 process <PRTPAGE P="110"/>without establishing a process under paragraph (a) of this section, the agency official shall make reasonable efforts to avoid, minimize or mitigate adverse effects to such properties and:</P>
            <P>(1) If the agency official has not approved the undertaking or if construction on an approved undertaking has not commenced, consult to resolve adverse effects pursuant to § 800.6; or</P>
            <P>(2) If the agency official, the SHPO/THPO and any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization that might attach religious and cultural significance to the affected property agree that such property is of value solely for its scientific, prehistoric, historic or archeological data, the agency official may comply with the Archeological and Historic Preservation Act instead of the procedures in this part and provide the Council, the SHPO/THPO, and the Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization with a report on the actions within a reasonable time after they are completed; or</P>
            <P>(3) If the agency official has approved the undertaking and construction has commenced, determine actions that the agency official can take to resolve adverse effects, and notify the SHPO/THPO, any Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization that might attach religious and cultural significance to the affected property, and the Council within 48 hours of the discovery. The notification shall describe the agency official's assessment of National Register eligibility of the property and proposed actions to resolve the adverse effects. The SHPO/THPO, the Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization and the Council shall respond within 48 hours of the notification. The agency official shall take into account their recommendations regarding National Register eligibility and proposed actions, and then carry out appropriate actions. The agency official shall provide the SHPO/THPO, the Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization and the Council a report of the actions when they are completed.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Eligibility of properties.</E> The agency official, in consultation with the SHPO/THPO, may assume a newly-discovered property to be eligible for the National Register for purposes of section 106. The agency official shall specify the National Register criteria used to assume the property's eligibility so that information can be used in the resolution of adverse effects.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Discoveries on tribal lands.</E> If historic properties are discovered on tribal lands, or there are unanticipated effects on historic properties found on tribal lands, after the agency official has completed the section 106 process without establishing a process under paragraph (a) of this section and construction has commenced, the agency official shall comply with applicable tribal regulations and procedures and obtain the concurrence of the Indian tribe on the proposed action.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Federal agency program alternatives.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Alternate procedures.</E> An agency official may develop procedures to implement section 106 and substitute them for all or part of subpart B of this part if they are consistent with the Council's regulations pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(E) of the act.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Development of procedures.</E> The agency official shall consult with the Council, the National Conference of State Historic Preservation Officers, or individual SHPO/THPOs, as appropriate, and Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations, as specified in paragraph (f) of this section, in the development of alternate procedures, publish notice of the availability of proposed alternate procedures in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and take other appropriate steps to seek public input during the development of alternate procedures.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Council review.</E> The agency official shall submit the proposed alternate procedures to the Council for a 60-day review period. If the Council finds the procedures to be consistent with this part, it shall notify the agency official and the agency official may adopt them as final alternate procedures.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Notice.</E> The agency official shall notify the parties with which it has consulted and publish notice of final alternate procedures in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              <PRTPAGE P="111"/>
            </P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Legal effect.</E> Alternate procedures adopted pursuant to this subpart substitute for the Council's regulations for the purposes of the agency's compliance with section 106, except that where an Indian tribe has entered into an agreement with the Council to substitute tribal historic preservation regulations for the Council's regulations under section 101(d)(5) of the act, the agency shall follow those regulations in lieu of the agency's procedures regarding undertakings on tribal lands. Prior to the Council entering into such agreements, the Council will provide Federal agencies notice and opportunity to comment on the proposed substitute tribal regulations.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Programmatic agreements.</E> The Council and the agency official may negotiate a programmatic agreement to govern the implementation of a particular program or the resolution of adverse effects from certain complex project situations or multiple undertakings.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Use of programmatic agreements.</E> A programmatic agreement may be used:</P>
            <P>(i) When effects on historic properties are similar and repetitive or are multi-State or regional in scope;</P>
            <P>(ii) When effects on historic properties cannot be fully determined prior to approval of an undertaking;</P>
            <P>(iii) When nonfederal parties are delegated major decisionmaking responsibilities;</P>
            <P>(iv) Where routine management activities are undertaken at Federal installations, facilities, or other land-management units; or</P>
            <P>(v) Where other circumstances warrant a departure from the normal section 106 process.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Developing programmatic agreements for agency programs.</E> (i) The consultation shall involve, as appropriate, SHPO/THPOs, the National Conference of State Historic Preservation Officers (NCSHPO), Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations, other Federal agencies, and members of the public. If the programmatic agreement has the potential to affect historic properties on tribal lands or historic properties of religious and cultural significance to an Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization, the agency official shall also follow paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Public participation.</E> The agency official shall arrange for public participation appropriate to the subject matter and the scope of the program and in accordance with subpart A of this part. The agency official shall consider the nature of the program and its likely effects on historic properties and take steps to involve the individuals, organizations and entities likely to be interested.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Effect.</E> The programmatic agreement shall take effect when executed by the Council, the agency official and the appropriate SHPOs/THPOs when the programmatic agreement concerns a specific region or the president of NCSHPO when NCSHPO has participated in the consultation. A programmatic agreement shall take effect on tribal lands only when the THPO, Indian tribe, or a designated representative of the tribe is a signatory to the agreement. Compliance with the procedures established by an approved programmatic agreement satisfies the agency's section 106 responsibilities for all individual undertakings of the program covered by the agreement until it expires or is terminated by the agency, the president of NCSHPO when a signatory, or the Council. Termination by an individual SHPO/THPO shall only terminate the application of a regional programmatic agreement within the jurisdiction of the SHPO/THPO. If a THPO assumes the responsibilities of a SHPO pursuant to section 101(d)(2) of the act and the SHPO is signatory to programmatic agreement, the THPO assumes the role of a signatory, including the right to terminate a regional programmatic agreement on lands under the jurisdiction of the tribe.</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Notice.</E> The agency official shall notify the parties with which it has consulted that a programmatic agreement has been executed under paragraph (b) of this section, provide appropriate public notice before it takes effect, and make any internal agency procedures implementing the agreement readily available to the Council, SHPO/THPOs, and the public.</P>

            <P>(v) If the Council determines that the terms of a programmatic agreement are not being carried out, or if such an <PRTPAGE P="112"/>agreement is terminated, the agency official shall comply with subpart B of this part with regard to individual undertakings of the program covered by the agreement.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Developing programmatic agreements for complex or multiple undertakings.</E> Consultation to develop a programmatic agreement for dealing with the potential adverse effects of complex projects or multiple undertakings shall follow § 800.6. If consultation pertains to an activity involving multiple undertakings and the parties fail to reach agreement, then the agency official shall comply with the provisions of subpart B of this part for each individual undertaking.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Prototype programmatic agreements.</E> The Council may designate an agreement document as a prototype programmatic agreement that may be used for the same type of program or undertaking in more than one case or area. When an agency official uses such a prototype programmatic agreement, the agency official may develop and execute the agreement with the appropriate SHPO/THPO and the agreement shall become final without need for Council participation in consultation or Council signature.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Exempted categories</E>—(1) <E T="03">Criteria for establishing.</E> The Council or an agency official may propose a program or category of undertakings that may be exempted from review under the provisions of subpart B of this part, if the program or category meets the following criteria:</P>
            <P>(i) The actions within the program or category would otherwise qualify as “undertakings” as defined in § 800.16;</P>
            <P>(ii) The potential effects of the undertakings within the program or category upon historic properties are foreseeable and likely to be minimal or not adverse; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Exemption of the program or category is consistent with the purposes of the act.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Public participation.</E> The proponent of the exemption shall arrange for public participation appropriate to the subject matter and the scope of the exemption and in accordance with the standards in subpart A of this part.

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Introduction.</E> This appendix sets forth the criteria that will be used by the Council to determine whether to enter an individual section 106 review that it normally would not be involved in.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">General policy.</E> The Council may choose to exercise its authorities under the section 106 regulations to participate in an individual project pursuant to the following criteria. However, the Council will not always elect to participate even though one or more of the criteria may be met.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Specific criteria.</E> The Council is likely to enter the section 106 process at the steps specified in the regulations in this part when an undertaking:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Has substantial impacts on important historic properties.</E> This may include adverse effects on properties that possess a national level of significance or on properties that are of unusual or noteworthy importance or are a rare property type; or adverse effects to large numbers of historic properties, such as impacts to multiple properties within a historic district.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Presents important questions of policy or interpretation.</E> This may include questions about how the Council's regulations are being applied or interpreted, including possible foreclosure or anticipatory demolition situations; situations where the outcome will set a precedent affecting Council policies or program goals; or the development of programmatic agreements that alter the way the section 106 process is applied to a group or type of undertakings.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Has the potential for presenting procedural problems.</E> This may include cases with substantial public controversy that is related to historic preservation issues; with disputes among or about consulting parties which the Council's involvement could help resolve; that are involved or likely to be involved in litigation on the basis of section 106; or carried out by a Federal agency, in a State or locality, or on tribal lands where the Council has previously identified problems with section 106 compliance pursuant to § 800.9(d)(2).</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Presents issues of concern to Indian tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations.</E> This may include cases where there have been concerns raised about the identification of, evaluation of or assessment of effects on historic properties to which an Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization attaches religious and cultural significance; where an Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization has requested Council involvement to assist in the resolution of adverse effects; or where there are questions relating to policy, interpretation or precedent under section 106 or its relation to other authorities, such as the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Purpose and authorities.</SUBJECT>

          <P>(a) These regulations are required by section 110(c) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1980 (HCDA) (42 U.S.C. 5320) and apply only to projects proposed to be funded by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) under the Urban Development Action Grant (UDAG) Program authorized by title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended (42 U.S.C. 5301). These regulations establish an expedited process for obtaining the comments of the Council specifically for the UDAG program and, except as specifically provided, substitute for the Council's regulations for the “Protection of Historic and Cultural Properties” (36 CFR part 800).<PRTPAGE P="117"/>
          </P>
          <P>(b) Section 110(c) of the HCDA of 1980 requires UDAG applicants to: (1) Identify all properties, if any, which are included in the National Register of Historic Places and which will be affected by the project for which the application is made; (2) identify all other properties, if any, which will be affected by such project and which, as determined by the applicant, may meet the Criteria established by the Secretary of the Interior for inclusion in the National Register (36 CFR 60.6); and (3) provide a description of the effect, as determined by the applicant, of the project on properties identified pursuant to (1) and (2). If the applicant determines that such properties are affected, the Act requires that the information developed by the applicant must be forwarded to the appropriate State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) for review and to the Secretary of the Interior for a determination as to whether the affected properties are eligible for inclusion in the National Register.</P>
          <P>(c) Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (16 U.S.C. 470), requires the head of any Federal agency with jurisdiction over a Federal, federally assisted or federally licensed undertaking that affects a property included in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places to take into account the effect of the undertaking on such property and afford the Council a reasonable opportunity to comment. Under the UDAG program, applicants assume the status of a Federal agency for purposes of complying with section 106.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
          <P>The terms defined in 36 CFR 800.2 shall be used in conjunction with this regulation. Furthermore, as used in these regulations:</P>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Urban Development Action Grant (UDAG) Program</E> means the program of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) authorized by title I of the Housing and Community Development Act (HCDA) of 1977 (42 U.S.C. 5318) to assist revitalization efforts in distressed cities and urban counties which require increased public and private investment.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Applicant</E> means cities and urban counties or Pocket of Poverty Communities which meet the criteria at 24 CFR 570.453. Except as specifically provided below, applicants, rather than the Secretary of HUD, must comply with these regulations.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Project</E> means a commercial, industrial, and/or neighborhood project supported by the UDAG program of the Department of HUD, as defined in 24 CFR 570.451(g). A project includes the group of integrally related public and private activities described in the grant application which are to be carried out to meet the objectives of the action grant program and consists of all action grant funded activities together with all non-action grant funded activities. A project is an <E T="03">undertaking</E> as defined in 36 CFR 800.2(c).</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">State Historic Preservation Officer Review Period</E> is a 45 day period provided to the appropriate State Historic Preservation Officer by section 110(c) of the Housing and Community Development Act (HCDA) of 1980 for comment on the formal submission by the applicant of data on properties listed in the National Register or which may meet the Criteria and which will be affected by the proposed UDAG project. This period does not include any period during which the applicant seeks information from the State Historic Preservation Officer to assist the applicant in identifying properties, determining whether a property meets the Criteria for listing in the National Register of Historic Places and determining whether such property is affected by the project.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Secretary of the Interior Determination Period</E> is a 45 day period provided by section 110(c) of the HCDA of 1980 for a determination as to whether the identified properties are eligible for inclusion in the National Register.</P>
        </SECTION>
        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 801.3</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Applicant responsibilities.</SUBJECT>

          <P>As early as possible before the applicant makes a final decision concerning a project and in any event prior to taking any action that would foreclose alternatives or the Council's ability to comment, the applicant should take the following steps to comply with the <PRTPAGE P="118"/>requirements of section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and section 110 of the HCDA of 1980.</P>
          <FP>In order to facilitate the commenting process the applicant should forward to the Council information on the proposed project at the earliest practicable time if it appears that National Register properties or properties which meet the Criteria for inclusion will be affected. This will allow the Council to assist the applicant in expeditiously meeting its historic preservation requirements and facilitate the development of the Council's comments.</FP>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Information required.</E> It is the primary responsibility of the applicant requesting Council comments to conduct the appropriate studies and to provide the information necessary for a review of the effect a proposed project may have on a National Register property or a property which meets the Criteria, as well as the information necessary for adequate consideration of modifications or alterations to the proposed project that could avoid, mitigate, or minimize any adverse effects. It is the responsibility of the applicant to provide the information specified in § 801.7, to make an informed and reasonable evaluation of whether a property meets the National Register Criteria (36 CFR 60.6) and to determine the effect of a proposed undertaking on a National Register property or property which meets the Criteria.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Identification of properties.</E> Section 110 of the HCDA of 1980 makes UDAG applicants responsible for the identification of National Register properties and properties which may meet the Criteria for listing in the National Register that may be affected by the project. An appendix to these regulations sets forth guidance to applicants in meeting their identification responsibilities but does not set a fixed or inflexible standard for such efforts. Meeting this responsibility requires the applicant to make an earnest effort to identify and evaluate potentially affected historic properties by:</P>
          <P>(1) Consulting the National Register of Historic Places to determine whether the project's impact area includes such properties;</P>
          <P>(2) Obtaining, prior to initiating the State Historic Preservation Officer Review Period, relevant information that the State Historic Preservation Officer may have available concerning historic properties, if any are known, in the project's impact area;</P>
          <P>(3) Utilizing local plans, surveys, and inventories of historic properties prepared by the locality or a recognized State or local historic authority;</P>
          <P>(4) Utilizing other sources of information or advice the applicant deems appropriate;</P>
          <P>(5) Conducting an on-the-ground inspection of the project's impact area by qualified personnel to identify properties which may meet the Criteria for evaluation taking into consideration the views of the State Historic Preservation Officer as to the need for and methodology of such inspections;</P>
          <P>(6) Applying the Department of the Interior Criteria for Evaluation (36 CFR 60.6) to properties within the project's impact area.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Evaluation of effect.</E> Applicants are required by section 110(a) of the HCDA of 1980 to include in their applications a description of the effect of a proposed UDAG project on any National Register property and or any property which may meet the Criteria.</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Criteria of Effect and Adverse Effect.</E> The following criteria, similar to those set forth in 36 CFR 800.3, shall be used to determine whether a project has an effect or an adverse effect.</P>
          <P>(i) <E T="03">Criteria of effect.</E> The effect of a project on a National Register or eligible property is evaluated in the context of the historical, architectural, archeological, or cultural significance possessed by the property. A project shall be considered to have an effect whenever any condition of the project causes or may cause any change, beneficial or adverse, in the quality of the historical, architectural, archeological, or cultural characteristics that qualify the property to meet the Criteria of the National Register. An effect occurs when a project changes the integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling or association of the property that contributes to its significance in accordance with the National Register Criteria. An effect may be direct or indirect. Direct effects are caused by the project and occur at the same time and place. Indirect effects <PRTPAGE P="119"/>include those caused by the undertaking that are later in time or farther removed in distance, but are still reasonably foreseeable. Such effects involve development of the project site around historic properties so as to affect the access to, use of, or significance of those properties.</P>
          <P>(ii) <E T="03">Criteria of adverse effect.</E> Adverse effects on National Register properties or properties which meet the Criteria may occur under conditions which include but are not limited to:</P>
          <P>(A) Destruction or alteration of all or part of a property;</P>
          <P>(B) Isolation from or alteration of the property's surrounding environment;</P>
          <P>(C) Introduction of visual, audible, or atmospheric elements that are out of character with the property or alter its setting;</P>
          <P>(D) Neglect of a property resulting in its deterioration or destruction;</P>
          <P>(iii) <E T="03">Special considerations.</E> If rehabilitation is a project activity, such components of the project may be considered to have no adverse effect and need not be referred to the Council if they are undertaken in accordance with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Historic Preservation Projects (U.S. Department of the Interior, Heritage Conservation and Recreation Service, Washington, DC, 1979) and the State Historic Preservation Officer concurs in the proposed activity. Additionally, the following types of project components or elements will be considered to not normally adversely affect properties listed in the National Register or which meet the Criteria.</P>
          <P>(A) Insulation (except for the use of granular or liquid injected foam insulation in exterior walls or other vertical surfaces);</P>
          <P>(B) Caulking;</P>
          <P>(C) Weatherstripping;</P>
          <P>(D) Replacement of Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) equipment, provided that such equipment is not historic and that replacement equipment is screened from public view and that the State Historic Preservation Officer and the applicant agree the equipment will not affect those qualities of the property which qualify it to meet the 36 CFR 60.6 Criteria;</P>
          <P>(E) In-kind refenestration (for example, replacement of deteriorated windows of a similar configuration, color and material);</P>
          <P>(F) Lowering of ceilings, provided the ceilings will not be visible from outside of the building or from an interior public space and that the State Historic Preservation Officer and the applicant agree it will not affect a quality which qualified the building to meet the 36 CFR 60.6 Criteria;</P>
          <P>(G) Replacement in-kind of substantially deteriorated material, provided that the State Historic Preservation Officer and the applicant agree;</P>
          <P>(H) Installation of machinery, equipment, furnishings, fixtures, etc., in the interior of existing buildings, provided that the State Historic Preservation Officer and the applicant agree such installations will not affect a quality which qualified the building to meet the 36 CFR 60.6 Criteria.</P>
          <P>(I) Site improvements such as sidewalk paving and landscaping, provided that the State Historic Preservation Officer and the applicant agree that the site improvement will not affect those qualities of the property which qualify it to meet the 36 CFR 60.6 Criteria.</P>
          <P>(iv) <E T="03">Special considerations for archeological sites.</E> Under certain conditions, alteration of land containing archeological resources in the project area may have no adverse effect on those resources. Procedures for determining whether such conditions exist were published by the Council in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> on November 26, 1980 (45 FR 78808), as part X of the “Executive Director's Procedures for Review of Proposals for Treatment of Archeological Properties.” Because the identification of archeological sites in an urban context, and consideration of appropriate treatment methods, present special problems, further guidance is provided in Appendix 2.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Determinations of Effect.</E> Prior to submitting an application to HUD, the applicant shall apply the Criteria of Effect and Adverse Effect to all properties which are listed in the National <PRTPAGE P="120"/>Register or which may meet the Criteria in the area of the project's potential environmental impact. The determination of the Secretary of the Interior shall be final with respect to properties which are eligible for listing in the National Register. The Council will not comment on affected properties which are not either listed in or eligible for listing in the National Register. In order to facilitate the process, information to be requested from the State Historic Preservation Officer under § 801.3(b)(2) should include advice on applying the Criteria of Effect and Adverse Effect provided that this period shall not be included in the 45 day State Historic Preservation Officer Review Period. Special attention should be paid to indirect effects, such as changes in land use, traffic patterns, street activity, population density and growth rate. While some aspects of a project may have little potential to adversely affect the significant qualities of a historic property, other project components may meet the Criteria of Effect and Adverse Effect. If any aspect of the project results in an effect determination, further evaluation of the effect shall be undertaken in accordance with these regulations. The resulting determination regarding the effect shall be included in the application.</P>
          <P>(i) <E T="03">No effect.</E> If the applicant determines that the project will have no effect on any National Register property and/or property which meets the Criteria, the project requires no further review by the Council unless a timely objection is made by the Executive Director. An objection may be made by the Executive Director at any time during the UDAG application process prior to the expiration of the period for receiving objections to HUD's release of funds as specified in 24 CFR 58.31. The manner in which the Executive Director shall make an objection is set forth in § 801.4(a).</P>
          <P>(ii) <E T="03">Determinations of no adverse effect.</E> If the applicant finds there is an effect on the property but it is not adverse, the applicant after receiving the comments of the State Historic Preservation Officer during the State Historic Preservation Officer Review Period shall forward adequate documentation (see § 801.7(a)) of the Determination, including the written comments of the State Historic Preservation Officer, if available, to the Executive Director for review in accordance with § 801.4.</P>
          <P>(iii) <E T="03">Adverse effect determination.</E> If the applicant finds the effect to be adverse or if the Executive Director objects to an applicant's no adverse effect determination pursuant to § 801.4(a), the applicant shall proceed with the consultation process in accordance with § 801.4(b).</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 801.4</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Council comments.</SUBJECT>
          <P>The following subsections specify how the Council will respond to an applicant's request for the Council's comments required to satisfy the applicant's responsibilities under section 106 of the Act and section 110 of the HCDA of 1980. When appropriate, an applicant may waive the Council time periods specified in these regulations.</P>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Executive Director's Objection to No Effect Determination.</E> If the Executive Director has reason to question an applicant's determination of no effect, he shall notify the applicant and HUD. If the Executive Director does not object within 15 days of such notification, the project may proceed. If the Executive Director objects, he shall specify whether or not the project will have an adverse effect on National Register property and/or property which meets the Criteria. Normally, the Executive Director will object to a determination of no effect when the record does not support the applicant's determination (see § 801.7(a)). The applicant must then comply with the provisions of subsection (b) if the Executive Director determines that the project will have no adverse effect or subsection (c) if the Executive Director has determined that the project will have an adverse effect.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Response to Determinations of No Adverse Effect.</E> (1) Upon receipt of a Determination of No Adverse Effect from an applicant, the Executive Director will review the Determination and supporting documentation required by § 801.7(a). Failure to provide the required information at the time the applicant requests Council comments will delay the process. The Executive Director will respond to the applicant within 15 days after receipt of the information <PRTPAGE P="121"/>required in § 801.7(a). Unless the Executive Director objects to the Determination within 15 days after receipt, the applicant will be considered to have satisfied its responsibilities under section 106 of the Act and these regulations and no further Council review is required.</P>
          <P>(2) If the Executive Director objects to a Determination of No Adverse Effect, the consultation process pursuant to § 801.4(c) shall be initiated.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Consultation process.</E> If any aspect of the project is found to have adverse effects on National Register property or property which has been determined by the applicant or the Secretary of the Interior to meet the Criteria, the applicant, the State Historic Preservation Officer and the Executive Director shall consult to consider feasible and prudent alternatives to the project that could avoid, mitigate, or minimize the adverse effect on the affected property.</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Parties.</E> The applicant, the State Historic Preservation Officer and the Executive Director shall be the consulting parties. The Department of HUD, other representatives of national, State, or local units of government, other parties in interest, and public and private organizations, may be invited by the consulting parties to participate in the consultation process.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Timing.</E> The consulting parties shall have a total of 45 days from the receipt by the Executive Director of the information required in § 801.7(a) to agree upon feasible and prudent alternatives to avoid, mitigate, or minimize any adverse effects of the project. Failure of an applicant to provide the information required in § 801.7(b) will delay the beginning of the time period specified above.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Information requirements.</E> The applicant shall provide copies of the information required in § 801.7(b) to the consulting parties at the initiation of the consultation process and make it readily available for public inspection.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Public meeting.</E> An onsite inspection and a Public Information Meeting may be held in accordance with the provisions of 36 CFR 800.6(b). Public hearings or meetings conducted by the applicant in the preparation of the application may, as specified below, substitute for such Public Information Meetings. Upon request of the applicant, the Executive Director may find that such public meetings have been adequate to consider the effect of the project on National Register properties or properties which meet the Criteria, and no further Public Information Meeting is required.</P>
          <P>(5) <E T="03">Consideration of alternatives.</E> During the consultation period, the consulting parties shall, in accordance with the policies set forth in 36 CFR 800.6(b) (4) and (5), review the proposed project to determine whether there are prudent and feasible alternatives to avoid or satisfactorily mitigate adverse effect. If they agree on such alternatives, they shall execute a Memorandum of Agreement in accordance with § 801.4(c) specifying how the undertaking will proceed to avoid or mitigate the adverse effect.</P>
          <P>(6) <E T="03">Acceptance of adverse effect.</E> If the consulting parties determine that there are no feasible and prudent alternatives that could avoid or satisfactorily mitigate the adverse effects and agree that it is in the public interest to proceed with the proposed project they shall execute a Memorandum of Agreement in accordance with § 801.4(c) acknowledging this determination and specifying any recording, salvage, or other measures associated with acceptance of the adverse effects that shall be taken before the project proceeds.</P>
          <P>(7) <E T="03">Failure to agree.</E> Upon the failure of the consulting parties to agree upon the terms for a Memorandum of Agreement within the specified time period, or upon notice of a failure to agree by any consulting party to the Executive Director, the Executive Director within 15 days shall recommend to the Chairman whether the matter should be scheduled for consideration at a Council meeting. If the Executive Director recommends that the Council not consider the matter, he shall simultaneously notify all Council members and provide them copies of the preliminary case report and the recommendation to the Chairman. The applicant and the State Historic Preservation Officer shall be notified in writing of the Executive Director's recommendation.<PRTPAGE P="122"/>
          </P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Memorandum of Agreement</E>—(1) <E T="03">Preparation of Memorandum of Agreement.</E> It shall be the responsibility of the Executive Director to prepare each Memorandum of Agreement required under this part. As appropriate, other parties may be invited by the consulting parties to be signatories to the Agreement or otherwise indicate their concurrence with the Agreement. In order to facilitate the process, the applicant may provide the Executive Director a draft for a Memorandum of Agreement. At the applicant's option, such draft may be prepared at the time the applicant makes its determinations that properties listed in the National Register or which may meet the Criteria for listing in the National Register may be adversely affected. The applicant must provide the State Historic Preservation Officer an opportunity to concur in or comment on its draft Agreement.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Review of Memorandum of Agreement.</E> Upon receipt of an executed Memorandum of Agreement, the Chairman shall institute a 15 day review period. Unless the Chairman notifies the applicant that the matter has been placed on the agenda for consideration at a Council meeting, the Agreement shall become final when ratified by the Chairman or upon the expiration of the 15 day review period with no action taken. Copies will be provided to signatories. A copy of the Memorandum of Agreement should be included in any Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement prepared pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Effect of Memorandum of Agreement.</E> (i) Agreements duly executed in accordance with these regulations shall constitute the comments of the Council and shall evidence satisfaction of the applicant's responsibilities for the proposed project under section 106 of the Act and these regulations.</P>
          <P>(ii) If the Council has commented on an application that is not approved by HUD and a subsequent UDAG application is made for the same project, the project need not be referred to the Council again unless there is a significant amendment to the project which would alter the effect of the project on previously considered properties or result in effects on additional National Register properties or properties which meet the Criteria.</P>
          <P>(iii) Failure to carry out the terms of a Memorandum of Agreement requires that the applicant again request the Council's comments in accordance with these regulations. In such instances, until the Council issues its comments under these regulations the applicant shall not take or sanction any action or make any irreversible or irretrievable commitment that could result in an adverse effect with respect to National Register properties or properties which are eligible for inclusion in the National Register covered by the Agreement or that would foreclose the Council's consideration of modifications or alternatives to the proposed project that could avoid or mitigate the adverse effect.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Amendment of a Memorandum of Agreement.</E> Amendments to the Agreement may be made as specified in 36 CFR 800.6(c)(4).</P>
          <P>(5) <E T="03">Report on Memorandum of Agreement.</E> Within 90 days after carrying out the terms of the Agreement, the applicant shall report to all signatories on the actions taken.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Council Meetings.</E> Council meetings to consider a project will be conducted in accordance with the policies set forth in 36 CFR 800.6(d).</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Response to recommendation concerning consideration at Council meeting.</E> Upon receipt of a recommendation from the Executive Director concerning consideration of a proposed project at a Council meeting, the Chairman shall determine whether or not the project will be considered. The Chairman shall make a decision within 15 days of receipt of the recommendation of the Executive Director. In reaching a decision the Chairman shall consider any comments from Council members. If three members of the Council object within the 15 day period to the Executive Director's recommendation, the project shall be scheduled for consideration at a Council or panel meeting. Unless the matter is scheduled for consideration by the Council the Chairman shall notify the applicant, the Department of HUD, the State Historic Preservation Officer and other parties known to be interested of <PRTPAGE P="123"/>the decision not to consider the matter. Such notice shall be evidence of satisfaction of the applicant's responsibilities for the proposed project under section 106 of the Act and these regulations.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Decision to consider the project.</E> When the Council will consider a proposed project at a meeting, the Chairman shall either designate five members as a panel to hear the matter on behalf of the full Council or schedule the matter for consideration by the full Council. In either case, the meeting shall take place within 30 days of the Chairman's decision to consider the project, unless the applicant agrees to a longer time.</P>
          <P>(i) A panel shall consist of three non-Federal members, one as Chairman, and two Federal members. The Department of HUD may not be a member of such panel.</P>
          <P>(ii) Prior to any panel or full Council consideration of a matter, the Chairman will notify the applicant and the State Historic Preservation Officer and other interested parties of the date on which the project will be considered. The Executive Director, the applicant, the Department of HUD, and the State Historic Preservation Officer shall prepare reports in accordance with § 801.7(b). Reports from the applicant and the State Historic Preservation Officer must be received by the Executive Director at least 7 days before any meeting.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Notice of Council meetings.</E> At least 7 days notice of all meetings held pursuant to this section shall be given by publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> The Council shall provide a copy of the notice by mail to the applicant, the State Historic Preservation Officer, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Council will inform the public of the meeting through appropriate local media.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Statements to the Council.</E> An agenda shall provide for oral statements from the Executive Director; the applicant; the Department of HUD; parties in interest; the Secretary of the Interior; the State Historic Preservation Officer; representatives of national, State, or local units of government; and interested public and private organizations and individuals. Parties wishing to make oral remarks should notify the Executive Director at least two days in advance of the meeting. Parties wishing to have their written statements distributed to Council members prior to the meeting should send copies of the statements to the Executive Director at least 5 days in advance.</P>
          <P>(5) <E T="03">Comments of the Council.</E> The written comments of the Council will be issued within 7 days after a meeting. Comments by a panel shall be considered the comments of the full Council. Comments shall be made to the applicant requesting comment and to the Department of HUD. Immediately after the comments are made to the applicant and the Department of HUD, the comments of the Council will be forwarded to the President and the Congress as a special report under authority of section 202(b) of the Act and a notice of availability will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> The comments of the Council shall be made available to the State Historic Preservation Officer, other parties in interest, and the public upon receipt of the comments by the applicant. The applicant should include the comments of the Council in any final Environmental Impact Statement prepared pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act.</P>
          <P>(6) <E T="03">Action in response to Council comments.</E> The comments of the Council shall be taken into account in reaching a final decision on the proposed project. When a final decision regarding the proposed project is reached by the applicant and the Department of HUD, they shall submit written reports to the Council describing the actions taken by them and other parties in response to the Council's comments and the impact that such actions will have on the affected National Register properties or properties eligible for inclusion in the National Register. Receipt of this report by the Chairman shall be evidence that the applicant has satisfied its responsibilities for the proposed project under section 106 of the Act and these regulations. The Council may issue a final report to the President and the Congress under authority of section 202(b) of the Act describing the actions taken in response to the <PRTPAGE P="124"/>Council's comments including recommendations for changes in Federal policy and programs, as appropriate.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Suspense of Action.</E> Until the Council issues its comments under these regulations and during the State Historic Preservation Officer Review Period and the determination period of the Secretary of the Interior, good faith consultation shall preclude the applicant from taking or sanctioning any action or making any irreversible or irretrievable commitment that could result in an adverse effect on a National Register property or property which may meet the Criteria or that would foreclose the consideration of modifications or alternatives to the proposed project that could avoid, mitigate, or minimize such adverse effects. In no case shall UDAG funds be used for physical activities on the project site until the Council comments have been completed. Normal planning and processing of applications short of actual commitment of funds to the project may proceed.</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Lead Agency.</E> If the project proposed by the applicant involves one or more Federal agencies, they may agree on a single lead agency to meet the requirements of section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and section 110 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1980 and notify the Executive Director. If the applicant is the designated lead agency, these regulations shall be followed. If a Federal agency is designated lead agency, the process in 36 CFR part 800 shall be used.</P>
          <P>(h) <E T="03">Compliance by a Federal Agency.</E> An applicant may make a finding that it proposes to accept a Federal agency's compliance with section 106 of the Act and 36 CFR 800 where its review of the Federal agency's findings indicate that:</P>
          <P>(1) The project is identical with an undertaking reviewed by the Council under 36 CFR part 800; and</P>
          <P>(2) The project and its impacts are included within the area of potential environmental impact described by the Federal agency;</P>
          <FP>The applicant shall notify the State Historic Preservation Officer and the Executive Director of its finding of compliance with section 106 of the Act and 36 CFR part 800 and provide a copy of the Federal agency's document where the finding occurs. Unless the Executive Director objects within 10 days of receipt of such notice the Council need not be afforded further opportunity for comment. If the Executive Director objects to the finding of the applicant, the applicant shall comply with § 801.4.</FP>

          <P>(a) The State Historic Preservation Officer shall have standing to participate in the review process established by section 110(c) of the HCDA of 1980 whenever it concerns a project located within the State Historic Preservation Officer's jurisdiction by the following means: providing, within 30 days, information requested by an applicant under § 801.3(b); responding, within 45 days, to submittal of a determination by the applicant under section 110 of the HCDA of 1980 that National Register property or property which meets the Criteria may be affected by the proposed project; participating in a Memorandum of Agreement that the applicant or the Executive Director may prepare under this part; and participating in a panel or full Council meeting that may be held pursuant to these regulations. Pursuant to section 110(c) of the HCDA of 1980, the State Historic Preservation Officer has a maximum period of 45 days in which to formally comment on an applicant's determination that the project may affect a property that is listed in the National Register or which may meet the Criteria for listing in the National Register. This period does not include the time during which the applicant seeks information from the State Historic Preservation Officer for determining whether a property meets the Criteria for listing in the National Register and whether such property is affected by the project.</P>
          <P>(b) The failure of a State Historic Preservation Officer to participate in any required steps of the process set forth in this part shall not prohibit the Executive Director and the applicant from concluding the section 106 process, including the execution of a Memorandum of Agreement.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Coordination with requirements under the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321 <E T="7462">et seq.</E>).</SUBJECT>
          <P>The National Historic Preservation Act and the National Environmental Policy Act create separate and distinct responsibilities. The National Historic Preservation Act applies to those aspects of a project which may affect National Register properties and those which are eligible for listing in the National Register. The requirements for the National Environmental Policy Act apply to the effect that the project will have on the human environment. To the extent that the applicant finds it practicable to do so, the requirements of these two statutes should be integrated. Some projects, for reasons other than the effects on historic properties, may require an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) subject to the time requirements for a draft and final EIS, in which case the applicant may choose to separately relate to the State Historic Preservation Officer, the Department of the Interior, and the Council for purposes of section 110(c) of the HCDA of 1980. In that event, information in the draft EIS should indicate that compliance with section 106 and these regulations is underway and the final EIS should reflect the results of this process. Applicants are directed to 36 CFR 800.9, which describes in detail the manner in which the requirements of these two acts should be integrated and applies to all UDAG applicants under these regulations.</P>
          <FP>In those instances in which an Environmental Impact Statement will be prepared for the project, the applicant should consider phasing compliance with these procedures and the preparation of the Statement.</FP>

          <SUBJECT>Information requirements.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Information To Be Retained by Applicants Determining No Effect.</E> (1) Recommended Documentation for a Determination of No Effect. Adequate documentation of a Determination of No Effect pursuant to § 801.3(c)(2)(i) should include the following:</P>
          <P>(i) A general discussion and chronology of the proposed project;</P>
          <P>(ii) A description of the proposed project including, as appropriate, photographs, maps, drawings, and specifications;</P>
          <P>(iii) A statement that no National Register property or property which meets the Criteria exist in the project area, or a brief statement explaining why the Criteria of Effect (See § 801.3(c)) was found inapplicable;</P>
          <P>(iv) Evidence of consultation with the State Historic Preservation Officer concerning the Determination of No Effect; and</P>
          <P>(v) Evidence of efforts to inform the public concerning the Determination of No Effect.</P>
          <P>(2) The information requirements set forth in this section are meant to serve as guidance for applicants in preparing No Effect Determinations. The information should be retained by the applicant, incorporated into any environmental reports or documents prepared concerning the project, and provided to the Executive Director only in the event of an objection to the applicant's determination.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Reports to the Council.</E> In order to adequately assess the impact of a proposed project on National Register and eligible properties, it is necessary for the Council to be provided certain information. For the purposes of developing Council comments on UDAG projects the following information is required. Generally, to the extent that relevant portions of a UDAG application meet the requirements set forth below it will be sufficient for the purposes of Council review and comment.</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Documentation for Determination of No Adverse Effect.</E> Adequate documentation of a Determination of No Adverse Effect pursuant to § 801.3(c)(1) should include the following:</P>
          <P>(i) A general discussion and chronology of the proposed project;</P>

          <SUBJECT>Public participation.</SUBJECT>

          <P>(a) The Council encourages maximum public participation in the process established by these regulations. Particularly important, with respect to the UDAG program, is participation by the citizens of neighborhoods directly or indirectly affected by projects, and by groups concerned with historic and cultural preservation.<PRTPAGE P="127"/>
          </P>
          <P>(b) The applicant, in preparing and following its citizen participation plan called for by 24 CFR 570.456(c)(11)(i)(A), should ensure that adequate provision is made for participation by citizens and organizations having interests in historic preservation and in the historic and cultural values represented in affected neighborhoods. 24 CFR 570.431(c) sets forth criteria for citizen participation plans. These should be carefully considered with specific reference to ensuring that local concerns relevant to historic preservation are fully identified, and that citizens are provided with full and accurate information about each project and its effects on historic properties. The applicant should ensure that potentially concerned citizens and organizations are fully involved in the identification of properties which may meet the National Register Criteria, and that they are fully informed, in a timely manner, of determinations of No Effect, No Adverse Effect, and Adverse Effect, and of the progress of the consultation process. Applicants are referred to 36 CFR 800.15 for Council guidelines for public participation.</P>
          <P>(c) The Council welcomes the views of the public, especially those groups which may be affected by the proposed project, during its evaluation of the applicant's determination of effect, and will solicit the participation of the public in Council and panel meetings held to consider projects.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Introduction</HD>
          <P>Because of the high probability of locating properties which are listed in the National Register or which meet the Criteria for listing in many older city downtowns, this appendix is designed to serve as guidance for UDAG applicants in identifying such properties. This appendix sets forth guidance for applicants and does not set a fixed or inflexible standard for identification efforts.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Role of the State Historic Preservation Officer</HD>
          <P>In any effort to locate National Register properties or properties which meet the Criteria, the State Historic Preservation Officer is a key source of information and advice. The State Historic Preservation Officer will be of vital assistance to the applicant. The State Historic Preservation Officer can provide information on known properties and on studies which have taken place in and around the project area. Early contact should be made with the State Historic Preservation Officer for recommendations about how to identify historic properties. For UDAG projects, identification of National Register properties and properties which meet the Criteria is the responsibility of the applicant. The extent of the identification effort should be made with the advice of the State Historic Preservation Officer. The State Historic Preservation Officer can be a knowledgeable source of information regarding cases wherein the need for a survey of historic properties is appropriate, recommended type and method of a survey and the boundaries of any such survey. Due consideration should be given to the nature of the project and its impacts, the likelihood of historic properties being affected and the state of existing knowledge regarding historic properties in the area of the project's potential environmental impact.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Levels of Identification</HD>
          <P>1. The area of the project's potential environmental impact consists of two distinct subareas: that which will be disturbed directly (generally the construction site and its immediate environs) and that which will experience indirect effects. Within the area of indirect impact, impacts will be induced as a result of carrying the project out. Historic and cultural properties subject to effect must be identified in both subareas, and the level of effort necessary in each may vary. The level of effort needed is also affected by the stage of planning and the quality of pre-existing information. Obviously, if the area of potential environmental impact has already been fully and intensively studied before project planning begins, there is no need to duplicate this effort. The State Historic Preservation Officer should be contacted for information on previous studies. If the area has not been previously intensively studied, identification efforts generally fall into three levels:</P>
          <P>a. <E T="03">Overview Study:</E> This level of study is normally conducted as a part of general planning and is useful at an early stage in project formulation. It is designed to obtain a general understanding of an area's historic and cultural properties in consultation with the State Historic Preservation Officer, by:</P>
          <P>(1) Assessing the extent to which the area has been previously subjected to study;</P>
          <P>(2) Locating properties previously recorded;</P>
          <P>(3) Assessing the probability that properties eligible for the National Register will be found if the area is closely inspected, and</P>

          <P>(4) Determining the need, if any, for further investigation.
            <PRTPAGE P="128"/>
          </P>
          <FP>An overview study includes study of pertinent records (local histories, building inventories, architectural reports, archeological survey reports, etc.), and usually some minor on-the-ground inspection.</FP>
          <P>b. <E T="03">Identification Study:</E> An identification study attempts to specifically identify and record all properties in an area that may meet the criteria for listing in the National Register. In conducting the study, the applicant should seek the advice of the State Historic Preservation Officer regarding pertinent background data. A thorough on-the-ground inspection of the subject area by qualified personnel should be undertaken. For very large areas, or areas with uncertain boundaries, such a study may focus on representative sample areas, from which generalizations may be made about the whole.</P>
          <P>c. <E T="03">Definition and Evaluation Study:</E> If an overview and/or an identification study have indicated the presence or probable presence of properties that may meet the National Register Criteria but has not documented them sufficiently to allow a determination to be made about their eligibility, a definition and evaluation study is necessary. Such a study is directed at specific potentially eligible properties or at areas known or suspected to contain such properties. It includes an intensive on-the-ground inspection and related studies as necessary, conducted by qualified personnel, and provides sufficient information to apply the National Register's “Criteria for Evaluation” (36 CFR 60.6).</P>
          <P>2. An overview study will normally be needed to provide basic information for planning in the area of potential environmental impact. Unless this study indicates clearly that no further identification efforts are needed (e.g., by demonstrating that the entire area has already been intensively inspected with negative results, or by demonstrating that no potentially significant buildings have ever been built there and there is virtually no potential for archeological resources), and identification study will probably be needed within the area of potential environmental impact. This study may show that there are no potentially eligible properties within the area, or may show that only a few such properties exist and document them sufficiently to permit a determination of eligibility to be made in accordance with 36 CFR part 60. Alternatively, the study may indicate that potentially eligible properties exist in the area, but may not document them to the standards of 36 CFR part 60. Should this occur, a definition and evaluation study is necessary for those properties falling within the project's area of direct effect and for those properties subject to indirect effects. If a property falls within the general area of indirect effect, but no indirect effects are actually anticipated on the property in question, a definition and evaluation study will normally be superfluous.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix 2 to Part 801—Special Procedures for Identification and Consideration of Archeological Properties in an Urban Context</HD>
          <P>A. Archeological sites in urban contexts are often difficult to identify and evaluate in advance of construction because they are sealed beneath modern buildings and structures. Prehistoric and historic sites within cities may be important both to science and to an understanding of each city's history, however, and should be considered in project planning. Special methods can be used to ensure effective and efficient consideration and treatment of archeological sites in UDAG projects.</P>
          <P>1. If it is not practical to physically determine the existence or nonexistence of archeological sites in the project area, the probability or improbability of their existence can be determined, in most cases, through study of:</P>
          <P>a. Information on the pre-urban natural environment, which would have had an effect on the location of prehistoric sites;</P>
          <P>b. Information from surrounding areas and general literature concerning the location of prehistoric sites;</P>
          <P>c. State and local historic property registers or inventories;</P>
          <P>d. Archeological survey reports;</P>
          <P>e. Historic maps, atlases, tax records, photographs, and other sources of information on the locations of earlier structures;</P>
          <P>f. Information on discoveries of prehistoric or historic material during previous construction, land levelling, or excavation, and</P>
          <P>g. Some minor on-the-ground inspection.</P>
          <P>2. Should the study of sources such as those listed in section (1)(a) above reveal that the following conditions exist, it should be concluded that a significant likelihood exists that archeological sites which meet the National Register Criteria exist on the project site:</P>
          <P>a. Discoveries of prehistoric or historic material remains have been reliably reported on or immediately adjacent to the project site, and these are determined by the State Historic Preservation Officer or other archeological authority to meet the Criteria for the National Register because of their potential value for public interpretation or the study of significant scientific or historical research problems; or</P>
          <P>b. Historical or ethnographic data, or discoveries of material, indicate that a property of potential cultural value to the community or some segment of the community (e.g., a cemetery) lies or lay within the project site; or</P>

          <P>c. The pre-urbanization environment of the project site would have been conducive to prehistoric occupation, or historic buildings or occupation sites are documented to have existed within the project site in earlier <PRTPAGE P="129"/>times, and such sites or buildings are determined by the State Historic Preservation Officer or other archeological authority to meet the Criteria of the National Register because of their potential value for public interpretation or the study of significant scientific or historical research questions, and</P>
          <P>d. The recent history of the project site has not included extensive and intensive ground disturbance (grading, blasting, cellar digging, etc.) in the location, or extending to the depth at which the remains of significant sites, buildings, or other features would be expected.</P>
          <P>B. Where review of sources of information such as those listed in section (1)(a) above reveals no significant likelihood that archeological resources which meet the National Register Criteria exist on the project site, no further review is required with respect to archeology provided the State Historic Preservation Officer concurs.</P>
          <P>C. Where review of sources of information such as those listed in section (1)(a) above, reveals that archeological resources which meet the National Register Criteria are likely to exist on the project site, but these resources are so deeply buried that the project will not intrude upon them, or they are in a portion of the project site that will not be disturbed, a determination of “No Effect” is appropriate in accordance with § 801.3(c)(2)(i).</P>
          <P>D. Where review of sources of information such as those listed in section (1)(a) above, reveals that archeological resources which meet the Criteria exist or are likely to exist on the project site, and that the project is likely to disturb them, a determination of “No Adverse Effect” may be made in accordance with § 801.3(c)(2)(ii) if:</P>
          <P>1. The applicant and/or developer is committed to fund a professionally supervised and planned pre-construction testing program, and to modification of the project in consultation with the State Historic Preservation Officer to protect or incorporate within the project the archeological resources discovered with a minimum of damage to them, or if:</P>
          <P>2. The applicant and/or developer is committed to fund a professionally supervised and planned archeological salvage program, coordinated with site clearing and construction, following the standards of the Secretary of the Interior issued pursuant to the Archeological and Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 469) and the applicant finds that this program negates the adverse effect, in accordance with the standards set forth in section X of the Council's “Supplementary Guidance for Review of Proposals for Treatment of Archeological Properties” (45 FR 78808).</P>
          <P>E. When archeological sites included in the National Register or which meet the Criteria are found to exist on the project site or in the area of the project's environmental impact, and where the project is likely to disturb such resources, and where the adverse effect of such disturbance cannot be negated by archeological salvage, a determination of “Adverse Effect” is appropriate in accordance with § 801.3(a)(2)(iii).</P>

          <SUBJECT>Background.</SUBJECT>

          <P>(a) The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) establishes national policies and goals for the protection of the environment. Section 102(2) of NEPA contains certain procedural requirements directed toward the attainment of such goals. In particular, all Federal agencies are required to give appropriate consideration to the environmental effects of their proposed actions in their decisionmaking and to prepare detailed environmental statements on recommendations or reports on proposals for legislation and other major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.</P>

          <P>(b) Executive Order 11991 of May 24, 1977, directed the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) to issue regulations to implement the procedural provisions of NEPA. Accordingly, CEQ issued final NEPA regulations (40 CFR parts 1500-1508) on November 29, 1978, which are binding on all Federal agencies as of July 30, 1979. These regulations provide that each Federal agency shall as necessary adopt implementing <PRTPAGE P="130"/>procedures to supplement the regulations. Section 1507.3(b) of the NEPA regulations identifies those sections of the regulations which must be addressed in agency procedures.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
          <P>The purpose of this part is to establish Council procedures that supplement the NEPA regulations and provide for the implementation of those provisions identified in § 1507.3(b) of the regulations (40 CFR 1507.3(b)).</P>

          <P>(a) These procedures apply to actions of the full Council and the Council staff acting on behalf of the full Council.</P>
          <P>(b) The following actions are covered by these procedures:</P>
          <P>(1) Recommendations for legislation.</P>
          <P>(2) Regulations implementing section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA).</P>
          <P>(3) Procedures implementing other authorities.</P>
          <P>(4) Policy recommendations that do not require implementation by another Federal agency.</P>
          <P>(c) In accordance with § 1508.4 of the NEPA regulations (40 CFR 1508.4), Council comments on Federal, federally assisted and federally licensed undertakings provided pursuant to section 106 of the NHPA and 36 CFR part 800 are categorically excluded from these procedures. This exclusion is justified because Federal agencies seeking the Council's comments under section 106 have the responsibility for complying with NEPA on the action they propose. The Council's role is advisory and its comments are to be considered in the agency decisionmaking process. Coordination between the section 106 and the NEPA processes is set forth in 36 CFR 800.9.</P>

          <P>(a) Section 1505.1 of the NEPA regulations (40 CFR 1505.1) contains requirements to ensure adequate consideration of environmental documents in agency decisionmaking. To implement these requirements the Council shall:</P>
          <P>(1) Consider all relevant environmental documents in evaluating proposals for action;</P>
          <P>(2) Ensure that all relevant environmental documents, comments, and responses accompany the proposal through internal Council review processes;</P>
          <P>(3) Consider only those alternatives encompassed by the range of alternatives discussed in the relevant environmental documents when evaluating proposals for the Council action; and,</P>
          <P>(4) Where an environmental impact statement (EIS) has been prepared consider the specific alternative analyzed in the EIS when evaluating the proposal which is the subject of the EIS.</P>
          <P>(b) For each of the Council's principal activities covered by NEPA, the following chart identifies the point at which the NEPA process begins, the point at which it ends, and the key officials required to consider environmental documents in their decisionmaking.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Purpose and scope.</SUBJECT>
          <P>This subpart contains the regulations of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation implementing the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552). Procedures for obtaining the records covered by the Act are established in these regulations. Persons seeking information or records of the Council are encouraged to consult first with the staff of the Council before filing a formal request under the Act pursuant to these regulations. The informal exchange of information is encouraged wherever possible.</P>
        </SECTION>
        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 810.2</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Procedure for requesting information.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Requests for information or records not available through informal channels shall be directed to the Administrative Officer, Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, 1522 K Street NW., Washington, DC 20005. All such requests should be clearly marked “FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST” in order to ensure timely processing. Requests that are not so marked will be honored, but will be deemed not to have been received by the Council, for purposes of computing the response time, until the date on which they are identified by a member of the Council staff as being a request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
          <P>(b) Requests should describe the records sought in sufficient detail to allow Council staff to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. Thus, where possible, specific information, including dates, geographic location of cases, and parties involved, should be supplied.</P>
          <P>(c) A request for all records falling within a reasonably specific category shall be regarded as conforming to the statutory requirement that records be reasonably described if the records can be identified by any process that is not unreasonably burdensome or disruptive of Council operations.</P>

          <P>(d) If a request is denied on the ground that it does not reasonably describe the records sought, the denial shall specify the reasons why the request was denied and shall extend to the requester an opportunity to confer <PRTPAGE P="132"/>with Council staff in order to reformulate the request in sufficient detail to allow the records to be produced.</P>
        </SECTION>
        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 810.3</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Action on requests.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Once a requested record has been identified, the Administrative Officer shall notify the requester of a date and location where the records may be examined or of the fact that copies are available. The notification shall also advise the requester of any applicable fees under § 810.5.</P>
          <P>(b) A reply denying a request shall be in writing, signed by the Administrative Officer and shall include:</P>
          <P>(1) Reference to the specific exemption under the Act which authorizes the denial of the record, a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record requested, and a brief statement of why a discretionary release is not appropriate; and,</P>
          <P>(2) A statement that the denial may be appealed under § 810.4 within 30 days by writing to the Executive Director, Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, 1522 K Street NW., Washington, DC 20005.</P>
          <P>(c) The requirements of § 810.3 (b)(1) and (2) do not apply to requests denied on the ground that they are not described with reasonable specificity and consequently cannot be identified.</P>
          <P>(d) Within 10 working days from receipt of a request, the Administrative Officer shall determine whether to grant or deny the request and shall promptly notify the requester of the decision. In certain unusual circumstances specified below, the time for determinations on requests may be extended up to a total of 10 additional working days. The requester shall be notified in writing of any extension and of the reason for it, as well as of the data on which a determination will be made. Unusual circumstances include:</P>
          <P>(1) The need to search for and collect records from field offices or other establishments that are separate from the Washington office of the Council;</P>
          <P>(2) The need to search for, collect, and examine a voluminous amount of material which is sought in a request; or,</P>
          <P>(3) The need for consultation with another agency having substantial interest in the subject matter of the request.</P>
          <FP>If no determination has been made by the end of the 10-day period or the end of the last extension, the requester may deem his request denied and may exercise a right of appeal in accordance with § 810.4.</FP>
        </SECTION>
        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 810.4</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Appeals.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) When a request has been denied, the requester may, within 30 days of receipt of the denial, appeal the denial to the Executive Director of the Council. Appeals to the Executive Director shall be in writing, shall be addressed to the Executive Director, Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, 1522 K Street NW., Washington, DC 20005, and shall be clearly marked “FREEDOM OF INFORMATION APPEAL.” Requests that are not so marked will be honored, but will be deemed not to have been received by the Council, for purposes of computing the response time, until the date on which they are identified by a member of the Council staff as being an appeal pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
          <P>(b) The appeal will be acted on within 20 working days of receipt. A written decision shall be issued. Where the decision upholds an initial denial of information, the decision shall include a reference to the specific exemption in the Freedom of Information Act which authorizes withholding the information, a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record withheld, and a brief statement of why a discretionary release is not appropriate. The decision shall also inform the requester of the right to seek judicial review in the U.S. District Court where the requester resides or has his principal place of business, or in which the agency records are situated, or in the District of Columbia.</P>
          <P>(c) If no decision has been issued within 20 working days, the requester is deemed to have exhausted his administrative remedies.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 810.5</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Fees.</SUBJECT>

          <P>(a) Fees shall be charged according to the schedules contained in paragraph (b) of this section unless it is determined that the requested information <PRTPAGE P="133"/>will be of primary benefit to the general public rather than to the requester. In that case, fees may be waived. Fees shall not be charged where they would amount to less than $3.00.</P>
          <P>(b) The following charges shall be assessed:</P>
          <P>(1) Copies of documents—$0.10 per page.</P>
          <P>(2) Clerical searches—$1.00 for each one quarter hour in excess of the first quarter hour spent by clerical personnel in searching for requested records.</P>
          <P>(3) Professional searches—$2.00 for each one quarter hour in excess of the first quarter hour spent by professional or managerial personnel in determining which records are covered by a request or other tasks that cannot be performed by clerical personnel.</P>
          <P>(c) Where it is anticipated that fees may amount to more than $25.00, the requester shall be advised of the anticipated amount of the fee and his consent obtained before the request is processed. The time limits for processing the request under § 810.3 shall not begin to run until the requester's written agreement to pay the fees has been received. In the discretion of the Administrative Officer, advance payment of fees may be required before requested records are made available.</P>
          <P>(d) Payment should be made by check or money order payable to the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation.</P>
        </SECTION>
        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 810.6</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Exemptions.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The Freedom of Information Act exempts from disclosure nine categories of records which are described in 5 U.S.C. 552(b).</P>
          <P>(b) When a request encompasses records which would be of concern to or which have been created primarily by another Federal agency, the record will be made available by the Council only if the document was created primarily to meet the requirements of the Council's regulations implementing section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act or other provisions of law administered primarily by the Council. If the record consists primarily of materials submitted by State or local governments, private individuals, organizations, or corporations, to another Federal agency in fulfillment of requirements for receiving assistance, permits, licenses, or approvals from the agency, the Council may refer the request to that agency. The requester shall be notified in writing of the referral.</P>

          <P>Except as otherwise provided in § 812.150, no qualified handicapped person shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Program accessibility: Existing facilities.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not—</P>
          <P>(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons;</P>
          <P>(2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or</P>
          <P>(3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 812.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Historic preservation programs.</E> In meeting the requirements of § 812.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to handicapped persons. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 812.150(a)(2) or (a)(3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—</P>

          <P>(i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;<PRTPAGE P="138"/>
          </P>
          <P>(ii) Assigning persons to guide handicapped persons into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or</P>
          <P>(iii) Adopting other innovative methods.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Time period for compliance.</E> The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by October 21, 1986, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by August 22, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by February 23, 1987, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—</P>
          <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped persons;</P>
          <P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;</P>
          <P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</P>
          <P>(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.</P>

          <P>(1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>
          <P>(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the handicapped person.</P>
          <P>(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.</P>
          <P>(2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf person (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.</P>
          <P>(b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.</P>
          <P>(c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.</P>

          <P>(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and adminstrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 812.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The <PRTPAGE P="139"/>decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>

          <P>Public Law 104-99, which incorporated the terms of the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1996 (H.R. 1977), as passed by the House of Representatives on December 13, 1995, provides that the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation terminates as of April 1, 1996. H.R. 1977 provides that “any regulations prescribed by the [Pennsylvania Avenue Development] Corporation in connection with the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation Act of 1972 (40 U.S.C. 871-885) and the Federal Triangle Development Act (40 U.S.C. 1101-1109) shall continue in effect until suspended by regulations prescribed by the Administrator of the General Services Administration.” Accordingly, the authority to administer the regulations in 36 CFR Chapter IX is transferred to the General Services Administration. See the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation document, “Transfer of Responsibilities and Effectiveness of PADC Regulations After PADC Termination”, published at 61 FR 11308, March 20, 1996.</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">Powers and responsibilities.</E> The business, property and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed and controlled by the Board of Directors, and all powers specified in the Act are vested in them.

          <P>(1) The fifteen voting members shall include the seven government agency representatives specified in subsection 3(c) of the Act (or, their designees), and eight individuals meeting the qualifications of that subsection, appointed by the President of the United States from private life, at least four of whom shall be residents and registered voters of the District of Columbia.</P>
          <P>(2) The Chairman and Vice Chairman shall be designated by the President of the United States from among those members appointed from private life.</P>
          <P>(3) Upon his appointment, the Chairman shall invite the eight representatives designated in subsection 3(g) of the Act to serve as non-voting members of the Board of Directors.</P>
          <P>(4) Each member of the Board of Directors appointed from private life shall serve a term of six years from the expiration of his predecessor's term; except that the terms of the Directors first taking office shall begin on October 27, 1972 and shall expire as designated at the time of appointment.

Notice by telephone shall be personal notice. Any Director may waive, in writing, notice as to himself, whether before or after the time of the meeting, and the presence of a Director at any meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of that meeting. Notice, in whatever form, shall be given so that a Director will have received it five working days prior to the time of the meeting.</P>
          <P>(4) Unless otherwise limited by the notice thereof, any and all Corporation business may be transacted at any meeting.</P>

          <P>(d) <E T="03">Quorum.</E> The presence of a majority of the number of voting Directors serving at the time of a meeting of the Board shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at such meeting of the Board. The act of a majority of the voting Directors at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be an act of the Board of Directors. If there shall be less than a quorum at any meeting, a majority of the voting Directors present may adjourn the meeting until such time as a quorum can practically and reasonably be obtained.</P>

These services are considered as part of any informational program of the Government and are readily made available to the public. There is no fee for individual copies of such materials as long as they are in supply. In addition, the Corporation will continue to respond, without charge, to routine oral or written inquiries that do not involve direct access to records of the Corporation.</P>

            <P>(2) Statements of financial interest furnished by officers and employees of the Corporation;</P>

            <P>(b) The purpose of this section is to authorize the protection of trade secrets and commercial or financial records that are customarily privileged or are appropriately given to the Corporation in confidence. It assures the confidentiality of trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained by the Corporation through questionnaires and required reports to the extent that the information would not customarily be made public by the person from whom it was obtained. In any case in which the Corporation has obligated itself not to disclose trade secrets and commercial or financial information it receives, this section indicates the Corporation's intention to honor that obligation to the extent permitted by law. In addition, this section recognizes that certain materials, such as research data and materials, formulae, designs, and architectural drawings, have significance not as records but as items of property acquired, in many cases at public expense. In any case in which similar proprietary material in private hands would be held in confidence, material covered in this section may be held in confidence.</P>
            <P>(c)(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> For commercial or financial information furnished to the Corporation on or after March 30, 1988, the Corporation shall require the submitter to designate, at the time the information is furnished or within a reasonable time thereafter, any information the submitter considers confidential or privileged. Commercial or financial information provided to the Corporation shall not be disclosed pursuant to a Freedom of Information Act request except in accordance with this paragraph.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Notice to submitters.</E> The Corporation shall provide a submitter with prompt written notice of a request encompassing its commercial or financial information whenever required under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, and except as is provided in paragraph (c)(7) of this section. Such written notice shall either describe the exact nature of the information requested or provide copies of the records or portions thereof containing the information. Concurrently with its notice to a submitter, the Corporation shall inform a requestor in writing that the submitter is afforded a reasonable period within which to object to disclosure and that the 10 workday initial determination period provided for in 36 CFR 902.60 may therefore be extended.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">When notice is required.</E> (i) For information submitted to the Corporation prior to March 30, 1988, the Corporation shall provide a submitter with notice of a request whenever:</P>
            <P>(A) The information is less than ten years old;</P>
            <P>(B) The information is subject to prior express commitment of confidentiality given by the Corporation to the submitter; or</P>
            <P>(C) The Corporation has reason to believe that disclosure of the information may result in substantial competitive harm to the submitter.</P>
            <P>(ii) For information submitted to the Corporation on or after March 30, 1988, the Corporation shall provide a submitter with notice of a request whenever:</P>
            <P>(A) The submitter has in good faith designated the information as confidential, or</P>
            <P>(B) The Corporation has reason to believe that disclosure of the information may result in substantial competitive harm to the submitter.</P>

            <FP>Notice of a request for information falling within the former category shall be required for a period of not more than ten years after the date of submission unless the submitter requests, and provides acceptable justification for, a specific notice period of greater duration.

            </FP>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Opportunity to object to disclosure.</E> Through the notice described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the Corporation shall afford a submitter a reasonable period within which to provide the Corporation with a detailed statement of any objection to disclosure. Such statement shall specify all grounds for withholding any of the information under any exemption of the Freedom of Information Act and, in the case of Exemption 4, shall demonstrate why the information is contended to be privileged or confidential. Information provided by a submitter pursuant to this paragraph may itself be subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Notice of intent to disclose.</E> The Corporation shall consider carefully a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure prior to determining whether to disclose information. Whenever the Corporation decides to disclose information over the objection of a submitter, the Corporation shall forward to the submitter a written notice which shall include:</P>
            <P>(i) A statement of the reasons for which the submitter's disclosure objections were not sustained;</P>
            <P>(ii) A description of the information to be disclosed; and</P>
            <P>(iii) A specified disclosure date.</P>
            <FP>Such notice of intent to disclose shall be forwarded a reasonable number of days, as circumstances permit, prior to the specified date upon which disclosure is intended. A copy of such disclosure notice shall be forwarded to the requester at the same time.</FP>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Notice of lawsuit.</E> Whenever a requester brings suit seeking to compel disclosure of information covered by paragraph (c) of this section, the Corporation shall promptly notify the submitter.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Exceptions to notice requirements.</E> The notice requirements of this section shall not apply if:</P>
            <P>(i) The Corporation determines that the information should not be disclosed;</P>
            <P>(ii) The information lawfully has been published or otherwise made available to the public;</P>
            <P>(iii) Disclosure of the information is required by law (other than 5 U.S.C. 552); or</P>
            <P>(iv) The designation made by the submitter in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section appears obviously frivolous; except that, in such case, the Corporation shall provide the submitter with written notice of any final decision to disclose information within a reasonable number of days prior to a specified disclosure date.</P>

            <P>(2) Information concerning any pending proceeding or similar matter including any claim or other dispute to be resolved before a court of law, administrative board, hearing officer, or contracting officer.</P>

            <P>(b) This section has two distinct purposes. One is to protect the full and frank exchange of ideas, views, and opinions necessary for the effective functioning of the Government and to afford this protection both before and after any action is taken. This judicially recognized privilege of protection against disclosure in litigation or elsewhere is intended to assure that these resources will be fully and readily available to those officials upon whom the responsibility rests to take official and final Corporation action. However, the action itself, any memoranda made part of that action, and the facts on which it is based are not within this protection. The other purpose is to protect against the premature disclosure of material that is in the development stage if premature disclosure would be detrimental to the authorized and appropriate purposes for which the material is being used, or if, because of its tentative nature, the material is likely to be revised or modified before it is officially presented to the public.<PRTPAGE P="155"/>
            </P>
            <P>(c) Examples of records covered by this section include minutes to the extent they contain matter described in paragraph (a) of this section; staff papers containing advice, opinions, suggestions, or exchanges of views, preliminary to final agency decision or action; budgetary planning and programming information; advance information on such things as proposed plans to procure, lease, or otherwise hire and dispose of materials, real estate, or facilities, documents exchanged preparatory to anticipated legal proceedings; material intended for public release at a specified future time, if premature disclosure would be detrimental to orderly processes of the Corporation; records of inspection, investigations, and surveys pertaining to internal management of the Department; and matters that would not be routinely disclosed under disclosure procedures in litigation and which are likely to be the subject of litigation. However, if such a record also contains factual information, that information must be made available under subpart E of this part unless the facts are so inextricably intertwined with deliverative or policymaking processes, that they cannot be separated without disclosing those processes.</P>

            <P>(2) Deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication;</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For purposes of this section—</P>
            <P>(1) A <E T="03">commercial use request</E> is a request from or on behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made. In determining whether a requester properly belongs in this category, the Corporation will determine the use to which the requester will put the records sought. Where the Corporation has reasonable cause to doubt the use to which a requester will put the records sought, or where that use is not clear from the request itself, the Corporation will seek additional clarification before assigning the request to a specific category.<PRTPAGE P="158"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Direct costs</E> means those expenditures the Corporation actually incurs in searching for and duplicating (and in the case of commercial requesters, reviewing) records to respond to an FOIA request. Direct costs include, for example, the salary of the employee performing work (the basic rate of pay for the employee plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating duplicating machinery. Not included in direct costs are overhead expenses such as costs of space, and heating or lighting the facility in which the records are stored.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Duplication</E> means the process of making a copy of a record necessary to respond to an FOIA request. Such copies can take the form of paper copy, microform, audio-visual materials, or machine-readable documentation (e.g., magnetic tape or disk), among others. The copy provided must be in a form that is reasonably usable by requesters.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Educational institution</E> means a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate higher education, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an institution of professional education, and an institution of vocational education, which operates a program or programs of scholarly research.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Non-commercial scientific institution</E> means an institution that is not operated on a <E T="03">commercial</E> basis, within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this section and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Representative of the new media</E> means any person actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public. The term <E T="03">news</E> means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of new media entities include television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of periodicals (but only in those instances when they can qualify as disseminators of <E T="03">news</E>) who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the general public. These examples are not intended to be all-inclusive. Moreover, as traditional methods of news delivery evolve (e.g., electronic dissemination of newspapers through telecommunications services), such alternative media would be included in this category. <E T="03">Freelance</E> journalists may be regarded as working for a news organization if they can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that organization, even though not actually employed by it. A publication contract would be the clearest proof, but the Corporation may also look to the past publication record of a requester in making this determination.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Review</E> means the process of examining records located in response to a request that is for a commercial use (see paragraph (a)(1) of this section) to determine whether any portion of any record located is permitted to be withheld. It also includes processing any records for disclosure, e.g., doing all that is necessary to excise them and otherwise prepare them for release. Review does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Search</E> includes all time spent looking for material that is responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line identification of material within records. A line-by-line search will not be conducted when merely duplicating an entire record would be the less expensive and quicker method of complying with the request. <E T="03">Search</E> does not include <E T="03">review</E> of material to determine whether the material is exempt from disclosure (see paragraph (a)(7) of this section). Searches may be done manually or by computer using existing programming.</P>
            <P>(b) The following provisions shall apply with respect to services rendered to the public in processing requests for disclosure of the Corporation's records under this part:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Fee for duplication of records:</E> $0.25 per page. When the Corporation estimates that duplication charges are likely to exceed $25.00, it will notify the requester of the estimated amount of fees, unless the requester has indicated in advance his willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. The <PRTPAGE P="159"/>Corporation will offer the requester the opportunity to confer with the Corporation's staff in order to reformulate the request to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Search and review fees.</E> (i) Searches for records by clerical personnel: $7.00 per hour, including the time spent searching for and copying any records.</P>
            <P>(ii) Search for and review of records by professional and supervisory personnel: $11.50 per hour spent searching for any record or reviewing any record to determine whether it may be disclosed, including time spent in copying any record.</P>

            <P>(iii) Except for requests seeking records for a commercial use, the Corporation will provide the first 100 pages of duplication and the first two hours of search time without charge. The word <E T="03">pages</E> means paper copies of a standard size, either 8<FR>1/2</FR>″ by 11″ or 14″ by 14″.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Duplication of architectural drawings, maps, and similar materials:</E> (per copy) $10.00.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Reproduction of 35 mm slides:</E> (per copy) $1.00.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Reproduction of enlarged, black and white photographs:</E> (per copy) $10.00.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Reproduction of enlarged color photographs:</E> (per copy) $17.00.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Certification and validation fee:</E> $1.75 for each certification or validation of a copy of any record.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Categories of FOIA requesters and fees to be charged</E>—(i) <E T="03">Commercial use requesters.</E> When the Corporation receives a request for records for commercial use, it will assess charges to recover the full direct costs of searching for, reviewing for release, and duplicating the records sought. Requesters must reasonably describe the records sought.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Educational and non-commercial scientific institution requesters.</E> The Corporation shall provide copies of records to requesters in this category for the cost of reproduction alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. To be eligible for inclusion in this category, requesters must show that the request is being made as authorized by and under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use but are sought in furtherance of scholarly (if the request is from an educational institution) or scientific (if the request is from a non-commercial scientific institution) research. Requesters must reasonably describe the records sought.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Requesters who are representatives of the news media.</E> The Corporation shall provide documents to requesters in this category for the cost of reproduction alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. To be eligible for inclusion in this category, a requester must meet the criteria in the definition of <E T="03">representative of the news media</E> in paragraph (a)(6) of this section, and his or her request must not be made for a commercial use. In reference to this class of requester, a request for records supporting the news dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered to be a request that is for a commercial use. Requestors must reasonably describe the records sought.</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">All other requesters.</E> The Corporation will charge requesters who do not fit into any of the categories above fees which recover the full reasonable direct cost of searching for and reproducing records that are responsive to the request, except that the first 100 pages of reproduction and the first two hours of search time shall be furnished without charge. Requests from record subjects for records about themselves filed in the Corporation's systems of records will be treated under the fee provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 which permit fees only for reproduction. Requesters must reasonably describe the records sought.</P>
            <P>(9) <E T="03">Interest.</E> In the event a requester fails to remit payment of fees charged for processing a request under this part within 30 days from the date such fees were billed, interest on such fees may be assessed beginning on the 31st day after the billing date at the rate prescribed in section 3717 of title 31 U.S.C., and will accrue from the date of the billing.</P>
            <P>(10) <E T="03">Unsuccessful searches.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (b)(8)(iv) of this section, the cost of searching for a requested record shall be charged even if the search fails to locate such record or it is determined that the record is exempt from disclosure.</P>
            <P>(11) <E T="03">Aggregating requests.</E> A requester must not file multiple requests at the same time, each seeking portions of a <PRTPAGE P="160"/>record or records, solely in order to avoid payment of fees. When the Corporation reasonably believes that a requester, or a group of requesters acting in concert, is attempting to break a request down into a series of requests for the purpose of evading the assessment of fees, the Corporation may aggregate any such requests and charge accordingly.</P>
            <P>(12) <E T="03">Advance payments.</E> The Corporation will not require a requester to make an advance payment, i.e., payment before work is commenced or continued on a request unless:</P>
            <P>(i) The Corporation estimates or determines that allowable charges that a requester may be required to pay are likely to exceed $250; or</P>
            <P>(ii) If a requester has previously failed to make timely payments (i.e., within 30 days of billing date) of fees charged under this part, the requester may be required to pay the full amount owed plus any applicable interest accrued thereon or demonstrate that he has, in fact, paid the fee, and to make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated fee before the Corporation begins to process a new request or a pending request from this requester.</P>
            <P>(iii) With regard to any request coming within paragraphs (b)(12) (i) and (ii) of this section, the administrative time limits set forth in §§ 902.60, 902.61, and 902.62 of this part will begin to run only after the Corporation has received the requisite fee payments.</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Non-payment.</E> In the event of nonpayment of billed charges for disclosure of records, the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365), including disclosure to consumer credit reporting agencies and referral to collection agencies, where appropriate, may be utilized to obtain payment.</P>

          <P>(2) Inform the individual of refusal to amend the record in accordance with the request. In reviewing a record pursuant to a request to amend it, the Corporation will assess the accuracy, relevance, timeliness and completeness of the record in terms of the criteria established in 5 U.S.C. 522a(e)(5). In reviewing a record in response to a request to amend it by deleting information, the Corporation will ascertain whether or not the information is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the Corporation required to be accomplished by statute or by executive order of the President, as prescribed by 5 U.S.C. 522a(e)(1).</P>
          <P>(b) The Corporation shall take the action specified in paragraph (a) of this section within 30 days of receipt of a request for amendment of a record, unless unusual circumstances preclude completion of the action within that time. If the expected completion date for the action, as indicated in the acknowledgement provided pursuant to § 903.5 cannot be met, the individual shall be advised of the delay and of a revised date when action is expected to be completed. If necessary for an accurate review of the record, the Corporation will seek, and the individual will supply, additional information in support of his or her request for amending the record.</P>
          <P>(c) If the Corporation agrees with all or any portion of an individual's request to amend a record, the Corporation will so advise the individual in writing, and amend the record to the extent agreed to by the Corporation. Where an accounting of disclosures has been kept, the Corporation will advise all previous recipients of the record of the fact that the amendment was made and the substance of the amendment.</P>
          <P>(d) If the Corporation disagrees with all or any portion of an individual's request to amend a record, the Corporation shall:</P>
          <P>(1) Advise the individual of its adverse determination and the reasons therefor, including the criteria used by the Corporation in conducting the review;</P>
          <P>(2) Inform the individual that he or she may request a review of the adverse determination by the Executive Director of the Corporation, or by an officer of the Corporation designated by the Executive Director; and,</P>
          <P>(3) Advise the individual of the procedures for requesting such a review including the name and address of the official to whom the request should be directed.</P>
          <P>(e) If the Corporation is apprised by another agency of any corrections or other amendments made to a record contained in the Corporation's system of records, the Corporation will promptly amend its record and advise in writing all previous recipients of the record of the fact that the amendment was made and the substance of the amendment.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Appeal of initial adverse determination of request for amendment of record.</SUBJECT>

          <P>(a) After receipt by an individual of notice of an adverse determination by <PRTPAGE P="164"/>the Privacy Protection Officer concerning a request to amend a record, the individual may, within 60 working days after the date of receipt of the notice, appeal the determination by seeking a review by the Executive Director of the Corporation, or by an officer of the Corporation designated by him. The appeal shall be in writing, mailed or delivered to the Executive Director, Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation, 1331 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Suite 1220 North, Washington, DC 20004. The appeal shall identify the record in the same manner as it was identified in the original request, shall indicate the dates of the original request and of the adverse determination and shall indicate the expressed basis for that determination. In addition, the appeal shall state briefly the reasons why the adverse determination should be reversed.</P>
          <P>(b) Not later than 30 days after receipt of an appeal, the Executive Director, or an officer of the Corporation designated by him, will complete a review of the appeal and the initial determination, and either: (1) Determine that the appeal should be granted, take the appropriate action with respect to the record in question, and notify the individual accordingly; or, (2) determine that the appeal should be denied.</P>
          <P>(c) The reviewing official may, at his or her option, request from the individual such additional information as is deemed necessary to properly conduct the review. If additional time is required, the Executive Director may, for good cause shown, extend the period for action beyond the 30 days specified above. The individual will then be informed in writing of the delay and the reasons therefor, and of the approximate date on which action is expected to be completed.</P>
          <P>(d) If the reviewing official denies the appeal, he or she shall advise the individual in writing:</P>
          <P>(1) Of the decision and the reasons for reaching it;</P>
          <P>(2) That the denial of the appeal is a final agency action entitling the individual to seek judicial review in the appropriate district court of the United States, as provided in 5 U.S.C. 552a(g); and,</P>
          <P>(3) That the individual may file with the Corporation a concise statement setting forth the reasons for his or her disagreement with the refusal of the Corporation to amend the record in question.</P>
          <P>(e) Any individual having received notices of a denial of an appeal to amend a record may file a statement of disagreement with the Executive Director not later than 60 working days from the date of receipt of the notice. Such statements shall ordinarily not exceed one page in length, and the Corporation reserves the right to reject statements of excessive length. Upon receipt of a proper and timely statement of disagrement, the Corporation will clearly annotate the record in question to indicate the portion of the record which is in dispute. In any subsequent disclosure containing information about which the individual has filed a statement of disagreement, the Corporation will provide a copy of the statement together with the record to which it pertains. In addition, prior recipients of the disputed record will be provided with a copy of statements of disagreement to the extent that an accounting of disclosures was maintained. If the Corporation deems it apropriate, it may also include in any disclosure its own concise statement of the reasons for not making the amendments requested.</P>

Certain standards are set by law. Others are set by regulation and by policy. This part incorporates by reference applicable general standards of conduct and prescribes additional necessary elements.

            <P>As used in this part:</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Board Member</E> means any member of the Board of Directors of the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation, appointed or serving under section 3, Pub. L. 92-578, 86 Stat. 1267 (40 U.S.C. 872).</P>

            <P>(d) <E T="03">Consultant</E> means an individual who serves as an advisor to an officer or division of the Corporation, as distinguished from an officer or employee who carries out the agency's duties and responsibilities. He gives his views or opinions on problems or questions presented him by the Corporation, but he neither performs nor supervises performance of operating functions. Ordinarily, he is expert in the field in which he advises, but he need not be a specialist. His expertness may lie in his possession of a high order of broad administrative, professional, or technical experience indicating that his ability and knowledge make his advice distinctively valuable to the agency. (Chapter 304, Federal Personnel Manual).</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Corporation</E> means the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation, created by the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation Act of 1972, Pub. L. 92-578, 86 Stat. 1266 (40 U.S.C. 871).</P>

The term includes those Board Members who are determined to be officers or employees of the executive or legislative branches of the United States or of the District of Columbia.

            <P>(g) <E T="03">Executive order</E> means Executive Order 11222 of May 8, 1965.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Expert</E> means a person with excellent qualifications and a high degree of attainment in a professional, scientific, technical, or other field. His knowledge and mastery of the principles, practices, problems, methods, and techniques of his field of activity, or of a specialized area in the field, are clearly superior to those usually possessed by ordinarily competent individuals in that activity. His attainment is such that he usually is regarded as an authority or as a practitioner of unusual competence and skill by other <PRTPAGE P="168"/>persons in the profession, occupation, or activity. (Chapter 304, Federal Personnel Manual.)</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Head of the agency</E> means the Chairman.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Person</E> means an individual, a corporation, a company, an association, a firm, a partnership, a society, a joint stock company, or any other institution or organization.</P>

When review discloses a conflict between the interests of an employee or special Government employee of the Corporation and the performance of his services for the Corporation, the Ethics Counselor shall bring the conflict to the attention of the employee or special Government employee, grant the individual an opportunity to explain the conflict, and attempt to resolve it. If the conflict cannot be resolved, the Ethics Counselor shall forward a written report on the conflict to the Chairman, recommending appropriate action. The Chairman shall review the report, solicit an explanation from the individual, and seek resolution of the conflict.</P>

            <P>(a) In addition to any penalties prescribed by law, the Chairman, after review and consideration of any explanation given by an employee or special Government employee concerning a conflict of interest, may institute appropriate remedial action to resolve or otherwise eliminate the conflict. Appropriate remedial action may include, but is not limited to:</P>
            <P>(1) Divestment by the employee or the special Government employee of the conflicting interest;</P>

The disciplinary action selected should reflect the character and degree of the offense which demands such action and should be reasonable in light of that offense.</P>
            <P>(c) Remedial action, whether disciplinary or otherwise, shall be effected in accordance with applicable laws, Executive orders, and regulations.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Major decision points.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The possible environmental effects of a proposed action or project must be considered along with technical, economic, and other factors throughout the decisionmaking process. For most Corporation projects there are three distinct stages in the decision making process:</P>
          <P>(1) Conceptual or preliminary stage;</P>
          <P>(2) Detailed planning or final approval stage;</P>
          <P>(3) Implementation stage.</P>

          <P>(b) Environmental review will be integrated into the decision making process of the Corporation as follows:<PRTPAGE P="182"/>
          </P>
          <P>(1) During the conceptual or preliminary approval study stage, the responsible Corporation official shall determine whether the proposed action or project is one which is categorically excluded, requires an environmental assessment or an EIS.</P>
          <P>(2) Prior to proceeding from the conceptual or preliminary approval stage to the detailed planning or final approval stage, an environmental assessment and the determination as to whether an EIS is required must be completed.</P>
          <P>(3) An EIS, if determined necessary, must be completed and circulated prior to the decision to proceed from the detailed planning stage to implementation.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Determination of requirement for EIS.</SUBJECT>
          <P>Determining whether to prepare an environmental impact statement is the first step in applying the NEPA process. In deciding whether to prepare an environmental impact statement, the responsible Corporation official will determine whether the proposal is one that:</P>
          <P>(a) Normally requires an environmental impact statement.</P>
          <P>(b) Normally does not require either an environmental impact statement or an environmental assessment (categorical exclusion).</P>
          <P>(c) Normally requires an environmental assessment, but not necessarily an environmental impact statement.</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 907.8</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Actions that normally require an EIS.</SUBJECT>
          <P>PADC shall perform or have performed an environmental assessment to determine if a proposal requires an environmental impact statement. However, it may be readily apparent that a proposed action will have a significant impact on the environment; in such cases, an environmental assessment is not required and PADC will immediately begin to prepare or have prepared the environmental impact statement. To assist in determining if a proposal or action normally requires the preparation of an environmental impact statement, the following criteria and categories of action are provided.</P>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Criteria.</E> Criteria used to determine whether or not actions or proposals may significantly affect the environment and therefore require an environmental impact statement are described in 40 CFR 1508.27 of the CEQ Regulations and as follows:</P>
          <P>(1) Buildings or facades designated for retention in the Plan will be adversely affected by the proposal or action.</P>
          <P>(2) Traffic generated by the proposal or action would represent a substantial increase over the traffic projections assessed in the Final EIS in the average daily traffic volume on avenues and streets within the Development Area or its environs;</P>
          <P>(3) Air quality in the Development Area and its environs would be substantially affected by the proposal or action based upon the District of Columbia's adopted standard for hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide;</P>
          <P>(4) Solid waste disposal generated by a project of the Corporation or of a developer who is constructing, reconstructing, or rehabilitating that project, would have an adverse effect on the capacity of the relevant solid waste disposal facility and compliance with “Solid Waste Management Guidelines” of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and related local and regional controls;</P>
          <P>(5) Public utilities have insufficient capacity to provide reliable service to a project within the Development Area; and</P>
          <P>(6) A project will be inconsistent with major elements of the Zoning Regulations of the District of Columbia as they are applicable to the Development Area.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Categories of action.</E> The following categories of action normally require an environmental impact statement:</P>
          <P>(1) Amendments or supplements to the Plan that constitute a “substantial change” to the Plan as defined in 40 U.S.C. 874(c) of the Act.</P>

          <P>(2) Acquisition or disposal of real property by the Corporation <E T="03">not</E> related to any specific decision, plan, or program adopted by the Board of Directors of the Corporation for which an environmental assessment or an assessment and an EIS has been prepared.<PRTPAGE P="183"/>
          </P>
          <P>(3) Legislative proposals made to Congress.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Preparation of an EIS.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Notice of intent.</E> When PADC decides to prepare an environmental impact statement, it shall publish a notice of intent in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> in accordance with 40 CFR 1501.7 and 1508.22 of the CEQ Regulations.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Preparation.</E> After determining that an environmental impact statement will be prepared and publishing the notice of intent, PADC will begin to prepare or have prepared the environmental impact statement. Procedures for preparing the environmental impact statement are set forth in 40 CFR part 1502, CEQ Regulations.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Supplemental environmental impact statements.</E> PADC may supplement a draft or final environmental impact statement at any time. PADC shall prepare a supplement to either the draft or final environmental impact statement when (1) substantial changes are proposed to an action contained in the draft or final EIS that are relevant to environmental concerns or there are significant new circumstances or information relevant to environmental concerns and bearing on the proposed action or its impacts; or (2) actions are proposed which relate or are similar to other action(s) taken or proposed and that together will have a cumulatively significantly impact on the environment.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Categorical exclusion.</SUBJECT>
          <P>The CEQ Regulations provide for the categorical exclusion (40 CFR 1508.4) of actions that do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required for such actions.</P>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Criteria.</E> Criteria used to determine those categories of action that normally do not require either an environmental impact statement or an environmental assessment include:</P>
          <P>(1) The action or proposal is consistent with the Plan or the Act, and the environmental effects have been previously analyzed in the Final EIS, a supplement thereto, or in an environmental assessment or an EIS previously prepared; or</P>
          <P>(2) The total estimated cost directly attributable to the action or proposal does not exceed $500,000; or</P>
          <P>(3) The action or proposal is related solely to internal administrative operations of the Corporation.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">List of categorical exclusions.</E> Categories of action, identified in appendix A (attached) have been determined by PADC to have no significant effect on the human environment and are therefore categorically excluded from the preparation of environmental impact statements and environmental assessments.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Changes to the list of categorical exclusion.</E> (1) The PADC List of Categorical Exclusion will be continually reviewed and refined as additional categories are identified and as experience is gained in the categorical exclusion process.</P>
          <P>(2) Additional categories of exclusion identified will be submitted to the Chairman of the Board of Directors for review and approval, and for amendments to this part, following public comment and review by the Council on Environmental Quality.</P>

          <P>(5) Contracts, work authorizations, and master agreements related to and implementing programs, policies, and proposals not categorically excluded and for which no environmental assessments or for which no environmental assessment and EIS have been previously prepared.</P>
          <P>(6) Street closures and other rearrangements of public space which were not covered in the Plan or the Final EIS.</P>
          <P>(7) Acquisition/disposal of personal property by the Corporation not related to any specific decision, plan, or program adopted by the Board of Directors of the Corporation for which an environmental assessment or an environmental assessment and an EIS is required to be prepared.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Preparation of an environmental assessment.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">When to prepare.</E> PADC will begin the preparation of an environmental assessment as early as possible after it is determined by the responsible corporation official to be required. PADC may prepare an environmental assessment at any time to assist planning and decision-making.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Content and format.</E> An environmental assessment is a concise public document used to determine whether to prepare an environmental impact statement. An environmental assessment aids in complying with the Act when no environmental impact statement is necessary, and it facilitates the preparation of an environmental impact statement, if one is necessary. The environmental assessment shall contain brief discussions of the following topics:</P>
          <P>(1) Purpose and need for the proposed action.</P>
          <P>(2) Description of the proposed action.</P>
          <P>(3) Alternatives considered, including the No Action alternative.</P>
          <P>(4) Environmental effects of the proposed action and alternative actions.</P>
          <P>(5) Listing of agencies, organizations or persons consulted.</P>
          <P>(6) In preparation of the environmental assessment, the most important or significant environmental consequences and effects on the areas listed below should be addressed. Only those areas which are specifically relevant to the particular proposal should be addressed. Those areas should be addressed in as much detail as is necessary to allow an analysis of the alternatives and the proposal. The areas to be considered are the following:</P>
          <P>(i) Natural/ecological features (such as floodplain, wetlands, coastal zones, wildlife refuges, and endangered species);</P>
          <P>(ii) Air quality;</P>
          <P>(iii) Sound levels;</P>
          <P>(iv) Water supply, wastewater treatment and water runoff;</P>
          <P>(v) Energy requirements and conservation;</P>
          <P>(vi) Solid waste;</P>
          <P>(vii) Transportation;</P>

          <P>(xi) Other relevant factors.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Finding of no significant impact.</E> If PADC completes an environmental assessment and determines that an environmental impact statement is not required, then PADC shall prepare a finding of no significant impact. The finding of no significant impact shall be <PRTPAGE P="185"/>made available to the public by PADC as specified in 40 CFR 1506.6 of the CEQ Regulations.</P>

          <P>(a) An environmental document, i.e., the EIS, Environmental Assessment, Finding of No Signficant Impact, or Notice of Intent, in addition to being prepared at the earliest point in the decision making process, shall accompany the relevant proposal or action through the Corporation's decision making process to ensure adequate consideration of environmental factors.</P>
          <P>(b) The decision maker shall consider in its decision making process only those decision alternatives discussed in the relevant environmental documents. Also, where an EIS has been prepared, the decision maker shall consider all alternatives described in the EIS. A written record of the consideration of alternatives during the decision making process shall be maintained.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Approval of private development proposals.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Each development proposal submitted by a private developer to the Corporation for its approval, unless categorically excluded, shall require, at a minimum, an environmental assessment.</P>
          <P>(b) The Board of Directors may not take any approval action on a submitted development proposal of a private developer until such time as the appropriate environmental review has been prepared and submitted to the Board of Directors.</P>
          <P>(c) At a minimum, and as part of any submission made by a private developer to the Board of Directors for its approval, a private developer shall make available data and materials concerning the development proposal sufficient to permit the Corporation to carry out its responsibilities on environmental review. When requested, the developer shall provide additional information that the Corporation believes is necessary to permit it to satisfy its environmental review functions.</P>
          <P>(d) As part of a development proposal submission, a private developer may submit an environmental assessment on its development proposal.</P>
          <P>(e) Where the responsible Corporation official determines that the preparation of an EIS is required, the EIS shall be prepared in accordance with part 1502 of the CEQ Regulations. The responsible Corporation official may set time limits for environmental review appropriate to each development proposal, consistent with CEQ Regulations 40 CFR 1601.8 and 1506.10.</P>
          <P>(f) The responsible Corporation official shall at the earliest possible time ensure that the Corporation commences its environmental review on a proposed development project and shall provide to a private developer any policies or information deemed appropriate in order to permit effective and timely review by the Corporation of a development proposal once it is submitted to the Board of Directors for approval. The official shall designate, for the benefit of the developer, staff members of the Corporation to advise the developer with regard to information that may be required in order to accomplish the Corporation's environmental review.</P>

          <P>(b) For an action that qualifies as one for which the Corporation will seek designation as lead agency, the Corporation will promptly consult with the appropriate Federal agencies such as the National Capital Planning Commission, the Department of the Interior, and the General Services Administration to establish lead agency and cooperating agency designations.</P>

            <P>One of the goals of The Pennsylvania Avenue Plan—1974, as amended, (<E T="03">The Plan</E>) is the reduction of hardships experienced by businesses and residents within the development area of the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation (<E T="03">the Corporation</E>) when they are displaced as a result of implementation of The Plan. It is the policy of the Corporation to provide displaced businesses and residents with a preferential opportunity to relocate within the development area so that they may share in the benefits brought to the area by the implementation of The Plan. This rule shall not be construed to affect the eligibility, rights or responsibilities of persons who may be entitled to benefits provided under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 as implemented by the Corporation (36 CFR part 904).</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not—<PRTPAGE P="195"/>
          </P>
          <P>(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons;</P>
          <P>(2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or</P>
          <P>(3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 909.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Historic preservation programs.</E> In meeting the requirements of § 909.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to handicapped persons. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 909.150(a)(2) or (a)(3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—</P>
          <P>(i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;</P>
          <P>(ii) Assigning persons to guide handicapped persons into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or</P>
          <P>(iii) Adopting other innovative methods.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Time period for compliance.</E> The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by October 21, 1986, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by August 22, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by February 23, 1987, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—<PRTPAGE P="196"/>
          </P>
          <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped persons;</P>
          <P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;</P>
          <P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</P>

          <P>(a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal entities, and members of the public.</P>
          <P>(1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>
          <P>(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the handicapped person.</P>
          <P>(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.</P>
          <P>(2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf person (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.</P>
          <P>(b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.</P>
          <P>(c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.</P>
          <P>(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and adminstrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 909.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>

          <P>(e) If the agency receives a complaint over which it does not have jurisdiction, it shall promptly notify the complainant and shall make reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate government entity.</P>
          <P>(f) The agency shall notify the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a building or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), or section 502 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 792), is not readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Policy.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) The Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation Act of 1972, Pub. L. 92-578, October 27, 1972, (the <E T="03">Act</E>), (40 U.S.C. 871 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) established the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation (the <E T="03">Corporation</E>) with jurisdiction over the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Area (<E T="03">Development Area</E>). The Development Area is generally described as an area in Washington DC, bounded by Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., on the south, East Executive Drive on the west, 3rd Street, NW., on the east, and E and F Streets, NW., on the north.</P>
            <P>(b) Prior to creation of the Corporation, the deterioration of the Development Area had an adverse impact upon the physical, economic, and social life of Washington, DC. The Corporation was created as the vehicle to develop, maintain, and use the Development Area in a manner suitable to its ceremonial, physical, and historic relationship to the legislative and executive branches of the Federal government, to the governmental buildings, monuments, memorials, and parks in and adjacent to that area, and to the downtown commercial core of Washington, DC. The Corporation was directed to prepare a development plan for the Development Area and to submit that plan to the United States Congress. Congress accepted that plan and directed its implementation by the Corporation. The Corporation through a broad range of statutory powers has begun this implementation process.</P>
            <P>(c) The Pennsylvania Avenue Plan—1974, as amended (<E T="03">the Plan</E>) is a blueprint for social, economic, and architectural rejuvenation of the Development Area. Its goal is to make the Development Area once again a relevant and contributing element of Washington, DC. With the implementation of <E T="03">the Plan,</E> the Development Area will become a showpiece of the Nation's Capital, proudly displaying the successful joint efforts of the Corporation, other Federal and District of Columbia government agencies, and private entrepreneurs.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">The Plan,</E> containing the goals and objectives for <E T="03">development,</E> is supplemented by various adopted policies and programs of the Corporation. <E T="03">The Plan,</E> in conjunction with these policies and programs, represents the basis upon which the <E T="03">development</E> and rejuvenation of the Development Area will proceed, whether publicly or privately inspired and accomplished. These policies and programs amplify, elaborate, and refine the planning and urban design concepts expressed in <E T="03">the Plan.</E>

            <SECTNO>§ 910.2</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Implementation of <E T="03">the Plan</E> occurs through two component actions: public improvements construction and square development. Public improvements construction consists of implementation by the Corporation of the Public Improvements Program which is a comprehensive plan for the design and construction of public amenities in public spaces and selected thoroughfares within the Development Area. This program outlines the details of roadway and sidewalk improvements, public space configuration, and pedestrian amenities. Square development consists of design and construction of <PRTPAGE P="199"/>
              <E T="03">development</E> projects primarily on city blocks, known as squares, within the Development Area. These <E T="03">development</E> projects are generally pursued by private entrepreneurs with varying degrees of participation and involvement by the Corporation, through such means as land assemblage and leasing.</P>
            <P>(b) This part 910, together with the <E T="03">Square Guidelines</E> applicable to the <E T="03">coordinated planning area,</E> pertains solely to square development and specifies the controlling mechanism for implementation of <E T="03">the Plan</E> required by Chapter Six of <E T="03">the Plan.</E>

            <SECTNO>§ 910.3</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Program administration.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) This part 910, together with <E T="03">Square Guidelines,</E> described below, provides interested parties with the urban planning and design information sufficient to understand and participate in the process of square development within the Development Area.</P>

            <P>(1) This part 910, General Guidelines and Uniform Standards for Urban Planning and Design of Development, sets forth the general planning and design goals and objectives which govern the implementation of <E T="03">the Plan,</E> specifies standards which are uniformly applicable to all <E T="03">developments</E> throughout the Development Area, and provides a glossary of defined terms applicable to this part as well as <E T="03">Square Guidelines.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Square Guidelines</E> specifies detailed urban planning and design requirements and recommendations which are applicable to each particular <E T="03">coordinated planning area,</E> a <E T="03">coordinated planning area</E> being a square, a portion of a square, or a combination of squares. These requirements and recommendations set forth intentions and refinements of <E T="03">the Plan</E> in light of the identified Planning and Design Concerns specified in subpart B of this part 910. Each set of <E T="03">Square Guidelines</E> is adopted by the Board of Directors, issued by the Chairman, and is available, upon request, at the Corporation's office.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Square Guidelines</E> are developed in the context of the existing environment. Several provisions in the <E T="03">Square Guidelines</E> are, therefore, established on the basis of certain assumptions in terms of existing buildings, a particular traffic pattern and roadway configuration, a market condition for a particular land use, etc. In the event of a major change or casualty which would render it impossible or impracticable to meet certain requirements of <E T="03">Square Guidelines,</E> the Corporation would expect to develop and issue up-to-date <E T="03">Square Guidelines.</E> This statement does not, of course, preclude the Corporation from issuing amendments to <E T="03">Square Guidelines</E> from time to time on any other basis.</P>

            <P>(b) Pursuant to section 7(b) of the Act, each proposal for <E T="03">development</E> within the Development Area must be submitted to the Corporation to determine its consistency with <E T="03">the Plan.</E> The Corporation's adopted development policy, entitled “Development Policies and Procedures,” sets forth the process for this determination. In determining whether a <E T="03">development</E> proposal is consistent with <E T="03">the Plan,</E> the Corporation shall review the proposal against all adopted Corporation programs, policies, and regulations, including:</P>
            <P>(1) This part 910.</P>
            <P>(2) Square Guidelines.</P>
            <P>(3) Development Policies and Procedures.</P>
            <P>(4) Historic Preservation Plan.</P>
            <P>(5) Energy Guidelines.</P>

            <P>(12) All other programs, policies, and regulations that may be approved and adopted by the Board of Directors from time to time.</P>

            <P>(c) Pursuant to the Act, Federal and District of Columbia agencies and departments may exercise such existing authority and lawful powers over urban planning and design features of <E T="03">development</E> as are consistent with <E T="03">the Plan.</E> No department or agency may release, modify, or depart from any feature of <E T="03">the Plan</E> without the prior approval of the Corporation.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Development density.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Land would be developed to the fullest extent appropriate in terms of uses, economics, and design so that the city's economic life and tax base can be enhanced.</P>
            <P>(b) New <E T="03">development</E> shall be designed to achieve maximum development density within the building envelope delineated by specific height restrictions, but shall also establish a compatible and appropriate scale for historic preservation, residential and other uses, and other urban design elements.</P>

            <P>(c) Development density is limited by the Zoning Regulations of the District of Columbia and may be further restricted by the Corporation in specific <E T="03">coordinated planning areas,</E> provided that any lower density would be economically feasible. Generally, <E T="03">the Plan</E> is structured to create high density <E T="03">development</E> west of the FBI and lower density <E T="03">development</E> east of the FBI.</P>
            <P>(d) The density of new <E T="03">development</E> should bring new economic life—jobs, shopping, and business opportunities—to Pennsylvania Avenue, while also reinforcing existing activity both on the Avenue and in the adjacent downtown, both within and beyond the Development Area.</P>

            <P>(a) Pennsylvania Avenue's unique role as the physical and symbolic link between the White House and the U.S. Capitol should be reinforced by new <E T="03">development</E> along it.</P>

            <P>(b) To reinforce and enrich the legacy of the L'Enfant Plan, the primary function of new <E T="03">development</E> in the Development Area is to define open spaces and <PRTPAGE P="201"/>plazas, or to reinforce vistas along major streets and thoroughfares.</P>

The Pennsylvania Avenue Area achieves national historic significance because of both its ceremonial role in the life of the nation and its social and economic role in the life of the residents of Washington for more than a century.</P>

            <P>(b) The Historic Preservation Plan of the Corporation sets forth the adopted policy of the Corporation on historic preservation and <E T="03">development</E> within the Development Area must be consistent with this policy.</P>
            <P>(c) New construction adjacent to historic structures will be required to take into account the qualities of the adjacent structures (with regard to height, scale, proportion, rhythm, texture, materials, architectural detail, and the amount of variety among the structures with respect to these qualities as well as style and date of erection) to ensure that these structures maintain their historic or architectural integrity, but will not necessarily be required to conform to them.</P>
            <P>(d) Wholly new construction and new construction in conjunction with preservation will, where appropriate, take into account the historic buildings to remain, aiming for the highest quality of contemporary design, consistent with the goals and objectives of the Historic Preservation Plan.</P>

          <P>(a) This part contains the procedures for submission to and consideration by the Presidio Trust of requests for records under the FOIA. As used in this part, the term “FOIA” means the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. The regulations in this part should be read in conjunction with the text of the FOIA. Requests made by individuals for records about themselves under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, are processed in accordance with the Presidio Trust's Privacy Act regulations as well as under this subpart.<PRTPAGE P="235"/>
          </P>
          <P>(b) Before invoking the formal procedures set out below, persons seeking records from the Presidio Trust may find it useful to consult with the Presidio Trust's FOIA Officer, who can be reached at The Presidio Trust, P.O. Box 29052, San Francisco, CA 94129-0052, Telephone: (415) 561-5300. As used in this part, the term “FOIA Officer” means the employee designated by the Executive Director to process FOIA requests and otherwise supervise the Presidio Trust's compliance with the FOIA, or the alternate employee so designated to perform these duties in the absence of the FOIA Officer.</P>
          <P>(c) The procedures in this part do not apply to:</P>
          <P>(1) Records published in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> the Bylaws of the Presidio Trust, statements of policy and interpretations, and other materials that have been published by the Presidio Trust on its internet website (<E T="03">http://www.presidiotrust.gov</E>) or are routinely made available for inspection and copying at the requester's expense.</P>
          <P>(2) Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes and covered by the disclosure exemption described in § 1007.2(c)(7) if:</P>
          <P>(i) The investigation or proceeding involves a possible violation of criminal law; and</P>
          <P>(ii) There is reason to believe that:</P>
          <P>(A) The subject of the investigation or proceeding is not aware of its pendency; and</P>
          <P>(B) Disclosure of the existence of the records could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings.</P>
          <P>(3) Informant records maintained by the United States Park Police under an informant's name or personal identifier, if requested by a third party according to the informant's name or personal identifier, unless the informant's status as an informant has been officially confirmed.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Records available.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Policy.</E> It is the policy of the Presidio Trust to make its records available to the public to the greatest extent possible consistent with the purposes of the Presidio Trust Act and the FOIA. The Presidio Trust administers the FOIA with a presumption of openness. As a matter of policy, the Presidio Trust may make discretionary disclosures of records or information exempt from disclosure under the FOIA whenever disclosure would not foreseeably harm an interest protected by a FOIA exemption. This policy does not create any right enforceable in court.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Statutory disclosure requirement.</E> The FOIA requires that the Presidio Trust, on a request from a member of the public submitted in accordance with the procedures in this part, make requested records available for inspection and copying.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Statutory exemptions.</E> Exempted from the FOIA's statutory disclosure requirement are matters that are:</P>
          <P>(1)(i) Specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy; and</P>
          <P>(ii) Are in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive order.</P>
          <P>(2) Related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency;</P>
          <P>(3) Specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than the Privacy Act), provided that such statute:</P>
          <P>(i) Requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue; or</P>
          <P>(ii) Establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld.</P>
          <P>(4) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential;</P>
          <P>(5) Inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency;</P>
          <P>(6) Personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;</P>

          <P>(7) Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records or information:<PRTPAGE P="236"/>

          <SUBJECT>Requests for records.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Submission of requests.</E> A request to inspect or copy records shall be submitted to the Presidio Trust's FOIA Officer at P.O. Box 29052, San Francisco, CA 94129-0052.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Form of perfected requests.</E> (1) Requests under this part shall be in writing and should specifically invoke the FOIA.</P>
          <P>(2) A request must reasonably describe the records requested. A request reasonably describes the records requested if it will enable an employee of the Presidio Trust familiar with the subject area of the request to locate the record with a reasonable amount of effort. If such information is available, the request should identify the subject matter of the record, the date when it was made, the place where it was made, the person or office that made it, the present custodian of the record, and any other information that will assist in locating the requested record. If the request involves a matter known by the requester to be in litigation, the request should also state the case name and court hearing the case. If after receiving a request the FOIA Officer determines that the request does not reasonably describe the records sought, the FOIA Officer will inform the requester what additional information is needed or why the request is otherwise insufficient. Requesters who are attempting to reformulate or modify such a request may discuss their request with the FOIA Officer. If a request does not reasonably describe the records sought, the Presidio Trust's response to the request may be delayed or an adverse determination under § 1007.5(e).</P>
          <P>(3)(i) A perfected request shall:</P>

          <P>(A) Specify the fee category (commercial use, educational institution, noncommercial scientific institution, news media, or other, as defined in § 1007.9) in which the requester claims the request falls and the basis of this claim;<PRTPAGE P="237"/>
          </P>
          <P>(B) State the maximum amount of fees that the requester is willing to pay or include a request for a fee waiver; and</P>
          <P>(C) Provide contact information for the requester, such as phone number, email address and/or mailing address, to assist the Presidio Trust in communicating with them and providing released records.</P>
          <P>(ii) Requesters who make requests for records about themselves must verify their identity.</P>

          <P>(iii) Where a request for records pertains to another individual, a requester may receive greater access by submitting either a notarized authorization signed by that individual or a declaration made in compliance with the requirements set forth in 28 U.S.C. 1746 by that individual authorizing disclosure of the records to the requester, or by submitting proof that the individual is deceased (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> a copy of a death certificate or an obituary). As an exercise of administrative discretion, the Presidio Trust may require a requester to supply additional information if necessary in order to verify that a particular individual has consented to disclosure.</P>
          <P>(iv) Requesters are advised that, under § 1007.9 (f), (g) and (h), the time for responding to requests may be delayed:</P>
          <P>(A) If a requester has not sufficiently identified the fee category applicable to the request;</P>
          <P>(B) If a requester has not stated a willingness to pay fees as high as anticipated by the Presidio Trust; or</P>
          <P>(C) If a fee waiver request is denied and the requester has not included an alternative statement of willingness to pay fees as high as anticipated by the Presidio Trust.</P>
          <P>(4) A request seeking a fee waiver shall, to the extent possible, address why the requester believes that the criteria for fee waivers set out in § 1007.10 are met.</P>
          <P>(5) To facilitate handling, both the envelope containing a request and the face of the request should bear the legend “FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST.”</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Creation of records.</E> A request may seek only records that are in existence at the time the request is received. A request may not seek records that come into existence after the date on which it is received and may not require that new records be created in response to the request by, for example, combining or compiling selected items from manual files, preparing a new computer program, or calculating proportions, percentages, frequency distributions, trends or comparisons. In those instances where the Presidio Trust determines that creating a new record will be less burdensome than disclosing large volumes of unassembled material, the Presidio Trust may, in its discretion, agree to creation of a new record as an alternative to disclosing existing records.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Preliminary processing of requests.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Scope of requests.</E> Unless a request clearly specifies otherwise, requests to the Presidio Trust may be presumed to seek only records of the Presidio Trust in possession of the Presidio Trust at the time the Presidio Trust begins its search. If any other date is used, the Presidio Trust will inform the requester of that date. A record that is excluded from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c) is not considered responsive to a request.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Records of other departments and agencies.</E> (1) When reviewing records in response to a request, the Presidio Trust will determine whether another Federal department or agency is better able to determine whether the record is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA. As to any such record, the Presidio Trust will proceed in one of the following ways:</P>
          <P>(i) <E T="03">Consultation.</E> When records originating with the Presidio Trust, but contain within them information of interest to another Federal department or agency, the Presidio Trust will consult with that other entity prior to making a release determination; or</P>
          <P>(ii) <E T="03">Referral.</E> (A) When the Presidio Trust believes that another department or agency is best able to determine whether to disclose the record, <PRTPAGE P="238"/>the Presidio Trust will refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding the record to that department or agency. Ordinarily, the department or agency that originated the record is presumed to be the best entity to make the disclosure determination. However, if the Presidio Trust and the originating department or agency jointly agree that the Presidio Trust is in the best position to respond to the request, then the record may be handled as a consultation.</P>
          <P>(B) If the Presidio Trust refers any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another department or agency, the Presidio Trust will document the referral, maintain a copy of the record that it refers, and notify the requester of the referral, informing the requester of the name(s) of the department or agency to which the record was referred, including that entity's FOIA contact information.</P>
          <P>(2) Timing of responses to consultations and referrals. All consultations and referrals received by the Presidio Trust will be handled according to the date that the Presidio Trust received the perfected FOIA request.</P>
          <P>(3) A request for documents that were classified by another agency shall be referred to that agency.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Consultation with submitters of commercial and financial information.</E> (1) If a request seeks a record containing trade secrets or commercial or financial information submitted by any person or entity, including a corporation, State, Native American tribe or nation, or foreign government, but not including another Federal Government entity, the Presidio Trust shall provide the submitter with notice of the request whenever:</P>
          <P>(i) The submitter has made a good faith designation of the information as commercially or financially sensitive; or</P>
          <P>(ii) The Presidio Trust has reason to believe that disclosure of the information may result in commercial or financial injury to the submitter.</P>
          <P>(2) Where notification of a voluminous number of submitters is required, such notification may be accomplished by posting or publishing the notice in a place reasonably calculated to accomplish notification.</P>
          <P>(3) The notice to the submitter shall afford the submitter a reasonable period within which to provide a detailed statement of any objection to disclosure. The submitter's statement shall explain the basis on which the information is claimed to be exempt under the FOIA, including a specification of any claim of competitive or other business harm that would result from disclosure. The statement shall also include a certification that the information is confidential, has not been disclosed to the public by the submitter, and is not routinely available to the public from other sources.</P>
          <P>(4) A submitter who fails to respond within the time period specified in the notice will be deemed to have no objection to disclosure of the information. The Presidio Trust shall not be required to consider any information received from the submitter after the date of any disclosure decision. Any information provided by a submitter under this subpart may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.</P>
          <P>(5) The Presidio Trust will notify the requester whenever it provides the submitter with notice and an opportunity to object to disclosure; whenever it notifies the submitter of its intent to disclose the requested information; and whenever a submitter files a lawsuit to prevent the disclosure of the information.</P>
          <P>(6) If a submitter's statement cannot be obtained within the time limit for processing the request under § 1007.6, the requester shall be notified of the delay as provided in § 1007.6(f).</P>
          <P>(7) Notification to a submitter is not required if:</P>
          <P>(i) The Presidio Trust determines, prior to giving notice, that the request for the record should be denied;</P>
          <P>(ii) The information has previously been lawfully published or officially made available to the public;</P>
          <P>(iii) Disclosure is required by a statute (other than the FOIA) or regulation (other than this part);</P>

          <P>(iv) Disclosure is clearly prohibited by a statute, as described in § 1007.2(c)(3);<PRTPAGE P="239"/>
          </P>
          <P>(v) The information was not designated by the submitter as confidential when it was submitted, or a reasonable time thereafter, if the submitter was specifically afforded an opportunity to make such a designation; however, a submitter will be notified of a request for information that was not designated as confidential at the time of submission, or a reasonable time thereafter, if there is substantial reason to believe that disclosure of the information would result in competitive harm;</P>
          <P>(vi) The designation of confidentiality made by the submitter is obviously frivolous; or</P>
          <P>(vii) The information was submitted to the Presidio Trust more than ten years prior to the date of the request, unless the Presidio Trust has reason to believe that it continues to be confidential.</P>
          <P>(8) If a requester brings suit to compel disclosure of information, the submitter of the information will be promptly notified.</P>

          <P>(2) Requesters must include the individualized tracking number in all communications with the Presidio Trust regarding the request.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Estimated dates of completion and interim responses.</E> Upon request, the Presidio Trust will provide an estimated date by which the Presidio Trust expects to provide a response to the requester.

If fees are due, the FOIA Officer shall state the amount of fees due and the procedures for payment, as described in § 1007.9.</P>

          <P>(2) The FOIA Officer shall honor a requester's specified preference of form or format of disclosure (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> paper, microform, audiovisual materials, or electronic records) if the record is readily available to the Presidio Trust in the requested form or format or if the record is reproducible by the Presidio Trust with reasonable efforts in the requested form or format.</P>
          <P>(3) If a requested record (or portion thereof) is being made available over the objections of a submitter made in accordance with § 1007.4(c), both the requester and the submitter shall be notified of the decision. The notice to the submitter (a copy of which shall be made available to the requester) shall be forwarded a reasonable number of days prior to the date on which disclosure is to be made and shall include:</P>
          <P>(i) A statement of the reasons why the submitter's objections were not sustained;</P>

          <P>(5) The requested record does not exist, cannot be located, or has been destroyed; or</P>
          <P>(6) The requested record is not readily reproducible in the form or format sought by the requester. Adverse determinations also include denials involving fees or fee waivers or denials of requests for expedited processing.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Form of denial.</E> (1) A decision withholding a requested record shall be in writing and shall include:</P>
          <P>(i) A list of the names and titles or positions of each person responsible for the denial;</P>
          <P>(ii) A reference to the specific exemption or exemptions authorizing the withholding;</P>
          <P>(iii) An estimate of the volume of records or information withheld, in number of pages or in some other reasonable form of estimation. This estimate does not need to be provided if the volume is otherwise indicated through deletions on records disclosed in part, or if providing an estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption;</P>
          <P>(iv) A statement that the denial may be appealed and a reference to the procedures in § 1007.7 for appeal; and</P>
          <P>(v) A statement notifying the requester of the dispute resolution services offered by the Office of Government Information Services.</P>

          <P>(ii) An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information;</P>
          <P>(iii) The loss of substantial due process rights; or</P>
          <P>(iv) A matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence.</P>
          <P>(2) A request for expedited processing may be made at the time of the initial request for records or at any later time.</P>
          <P>(3) A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct to the best of that person's knowledge and belief, explaining in detail the basis for requesting expedited processing.</P>
          <P>(4) Within ten calendar days of receiving of a request for expedited processing, the FOIA Officer shall decide whether to grant the request for expedited processing and shall notify the requester of the decision. If a request for expedited processing is granted, the underlying FOIA request shall be given priority and shall be processed as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited processing is denied, any appeal of that decision shall be acted on expeditiously.</P>

On expiration of the time limit, the requester shall be informed of the reason for the delay, of the date on which a determination may be reached to be dispatched, of the dispute resolution services offered by the Office of Government Information Services, and of the right to seek judicial review.</P>
          <P>(5) An appeal ordinarily will not be adjudicated if the request becomes a matter of FOIA litigation.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Form of decision.</E> (1) The final determination on an appeal shall be in writing and shall state the basis for the determination. If the determination is to release the requested records or portions thereof, the FOIA Officer shall immediately make the records available. If the determination upholds in whole or part the initial denial of a request for records, the determination shall advise the requester of the right to obtain judicial review in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California and shall set forth the names and titles or positions of each person responsible for the denial. The determination shall also inform the requester of the dispute resolution services offered by the Office of Government Information Services. Dispute resolution is a voluntary process. If the Presidio Trust agrees to participate in the dispute resolution services offered by the Office of Government Information Services, it will actively engage as a partner to the process in an attempt to resolve the dispute.</P>
          <P>(2) If a requested record (or portion thereof) is being made available over the objections of a submitter made in accordance with § 1007.4(c), the submitter shall be provided notice as described in § 1007.5(b)(3).</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 1007.9</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Fees.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Policy.</E> (1) Unless waived pursuant to the provisions of § 1007.10, fees for responding to FOIA requests shall be charged in accordance with the provisions of this section and the current schedule of charges determined by the Executive Director and published on the Presidio Trust's website. Such charges shall be set at the level necessary to recoup the full allowable direct costs to the Presidio Trust.</P>

          <P>(2) Fees shall not be charged if the total amount chargeable does not exceed the costs of routine collection and processing of the fee. The Presidio Trust shall periodically determine the <PRTPAGE P="243"/>cost of routine collection and processing of a fee and publish such amount on its website.</P>
          <P>(3) Where there is a reasonable basis to conclude that a requester or group of requesters acting in concert has divided a request into a series of requests on a single subject or related subjects to avoid assessment of fees, the requests may be aggregated and fees charged accordingly.</P>
          <P>(4) Fees shall be charged to recover the full costs of providing such services as certifying that records are true copies or sending records by a method other than regular mail, when the Presidio Trust elects to provide such services.</P>
          <P>(5) The following definitions shall apply to this part:</P>
          <P>(i) A <E T="03">commercial use request</E> is a request from or on behalf of a person who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made, which can include furthering those interest through litigation. The intended use of records may be determined on the basis of information submitted by a requester and from reasonable inferences based on the identity of the requester and any other available information.</P>
          <P>(ii) The term <E T="03">direct costs</E> refers to those expenses the Presidio Trust incurs in searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of commercial use requests, reviewing) records in order to respond to a FOIA request. For example, direct costs include the salary of the employee performing the work (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the basic rate of pay for the employee, plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating computers and other electronic equipment, such as photocopiers and scanners. Direct costs do not include overhead expenses such as the costs of space, and of heating or lighting a facility.</P>
          <P>(iii) The term <E T="03">duplication</E> refers to the process of making a copy of a record necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Such copies can take the form of paper copy, microform, audio-visual materials, or machine-readable documentation (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> magnetic tape or disk), among others. The copy provided shall be in a form that is reasonably usable by requesters.</P>
          <P>(iv) An <E T="03">educational institution</E> is a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate higher education, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an institution of professional education, or an institution of vocational education, which operates a program or programs of scholarly research.</P>
          <P>(v) A <E T="03">noncommercial scientific institution</E> is an institution that is not operated for commerce, trade or profit and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.</P>
          <P>(vi) A <E T="03">representative of the news media</E> is any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Non-exhaustive examples of news media entities include television or radio stations that broadcast “news” to the public at large and publishers of periodicals that disseminate “news” and make their products available through a variety of means to the general public, including news organizations that disseminate solely on the internet. A request for records supporting the news-dissemination function of the requester will not be considered to be for a commercial use. “Freelance” journalists who demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through a news media entity will be considered as a representative of the news media. A publishing contract would provide the clearest evidence that publication is expected; however, the Presidio Trust can also consider a requester's past publication record in making this determination. The Presidio Trust will advise requesters of their placement in this category.<PRTPAGE P="244"/>
          </P>
          <P>(vii) The term <E T="03">review</E> refers to the examination of a record located in response to a request in order to determine whether any portion of it is exempt from disclosure. Review time includes processing any record for disclosure, such as doing all that is necessary to prepare the record for disclosure, including the process of redacting the record and marking the appropriate exemptions. Review costs are properly charged even if a record ultimately is not disclosed. Review time also includes time spent both obtaining and considering any formal objection to disclosure under § 1007.4(c) made by a submitter of confidential commercial information, but it does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.</P>
          <P>(viii) The term <E T="03">search</E> includes all time spent looking for material that is responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line identification of material within documents, databases and information in other electronic records. Searches shall be undertaken in the most efficient and least expensive manner possible, consistent with the Presidio Trust's obligations under the FOIA and other applicable laws.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Commercial use requests.</E> (1) A requester seeking records for commercial use shall be charged fees for direct costs incurred in document search and review (even if the search and review fails to locate records that are not exempt from disclosure) and duplication.</P>
          <P>(2) A commercial use requester may not be charged fees for time spent resolving legal and policy issues affecting access to requested records.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Educational and noncommercial scientific institution requests.</E> (1) A requester seeking records under the auspices of an educational institution in furtherance of scholarly research or a noncommercial scientific institution in furtherance of scientific research shall be charged for document duplication, except that the first 100 pages of paper copies (or the equivalent cost thereof if the records are in some other form) shall be provided without charge.</P>
          <P>(2) Such requesters may not be charged fees for costs incurred in:</P>
          <P>(i) Searching for requested records;</P>
          <P>(ii) Examining requested records to determine whether they are exempt from mandatory disclosure;</P>
          <P>(iii) Deleting reasonably segregable exempt matter;</P>
          <P>(iv) Monitoring the requester's inspection of agency records; or</P>
          <P>(v) Resolving legal and policy issues affecting access to requested records.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">News media requests.</E> (1) A representative of the news media shall be charged for document duplication, except that the first 100 pages of paper copies (or the equivalent cost thereof if the records are in some other form) shall be provided without charge.</P>
          <P>(2) Representatives of the news media may not be charged fees for costs incurred in:</P>
          <P>(i) Searching for requested records;</P>
          <P>(ii) Examining requested records to determine whether they are exempt from mandatory disclosure;</P>
          <P>(iii) Deleting reasonably segregable exempt matter;</P>
          <P>(iv) Monitoring the requester's inspection of agency records; or</P>
          <P>(v) Resolving legal and policy issues affecting access to requested records.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Other requests.</E> (1) A requester not covered by paragraphs (b), (c), or (d) of this section shall be charged fees for the direct costs for document search (even if the search fails to locate records that are not exempt from disclosure) and duplication, except that the first two hours of search time and the first 100 pages of paper copies (or the equivalent cost thereof if the records are in some other form) shall be provided without charge.</P>
          <P>(2) Such requesters may not be charged for costs incurred in:</P>
          <P>(i) Examining requested records to determine whether they are exempt from disclosure;</P>
          <P>(ii) Deleting reasonably segregable exempt matter;</P>
          <P>(iii) Monitoring the requester's inspection of agency records; or</P>
          <P>(iv) Resolving legal and policy issues affecting access to requested records.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Requests for clarification.</E> Where a request does not provide sufficient information to determine whether it is covered by paragraph (b), (c), (d), or (e) of this section, the requester should be asked to provide additional clarification. If it is necessary to seek such <PRTPAGE P="245"/>clarification, the request may be deemed to have not been received for purposes of the time limits established in § 1007.6 until the clarification is received. Requests to requesters for clarification shall be made promptly.</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Notice of anticipated fees.</E> Where a request does not state a willingness to pay fees as high as anticipated by the Presidio Trust, and the requester has not sought and been granted a full waiver of fees under § 1007.10, the request may be deemed to have not been received for purposes of the time limits established in § 1007.6 until the requester has been notified of and agrees to pay the anticipated fee. Advice to requesters with respect to anticipated fees shall be provided promptly.</P>
          <P>(h) <E T="03">Advance payment.</E> (1) Where it is anticipated that allowable fees are likely to exceed $250.00, the requester may be required to make an advance payment of the entire fee before processing of his or her request.</P>
          <P>(2) Where a requester has previously failed to pay a fee within 30 days of the date of billing, processing of any request from that requester shall ordinarily be suspended until the requester pays any amount still owed, including applicable interest, and makes advance payment of allowable fees anticipated in connection with the request.</P>
          <P>(3) Advance payment of fees may not be required except as described in paragraphs (h) (1) and (2) of this section.</P>
          <P>(4) Issuance of a notice requiring payment of overdue fees or advance payment shall toll the time limit in § 1007.6 until receipt of payment.</P>
          <P>(i) <E T="03">Form of payment.</E> Payment of fees should be made by check or money order payable to the Presidio Trust. Where appropriate, the official responsible for handling a request may require that payment by check be made in the form of a certified check.</P>
          <P>(j) <E T="03">Billing procedures.</E> A bill for collection shall be prepared for each request that requires collection of fees.</P>
          <P>(k) <E T="03">Collection of fees.</E> The bill for collection or an accompanying letter to the requester shall include a statement that interest will be charged in accordance with the Debt Collection Act of 1982, 31 U.S.C. 3717, and implementing regulations, 4 CFR 102.13, if the fees are not paid within 30 days of the date of the bill for collection is mailed or hand-delivered to the requester. This requirement does not apply if the requester is a unit of State or local government. Other authorities of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 shall be used, as appropriate, to collect the fees.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 1007.10</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Waiver of fees.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Statutory fee waiver.</E> Documents shall be furnished without charge or at a charge reduced below the fees chargeable under § 1007.9 if disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it:</P>
          <P>(1) Is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and</P>
          <P>(2) Is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Elimination or reduction of fees.</E> Ordinarily, in the circumstances where the criteria of paragraph (a) of this section are met, fees will be reduced by twenty-five percent from the fees otherwise chargeable to the requester. In exceptional circumstances, and with the approval of the Executive Director, fees may be reduced below this level or waived entirely.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Notice of denial.</E> If a requested statutory fee waiver or reduction is denied, the requester shall be notified in writing. The notice shall include:</P>
          <P>(1) A statement of the basis on which the waiver or reduction has been denied;</P>
          <P>(2) A listing of the names and titles or positions of each person responsible for the denial; and</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 1008.4</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Standards for maintenance of records subject to the Privacy Act.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Content of records.</E> Records subject to the Privacy Act shall contain only such information about an individual as is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the Presidio Trust required to be accomplished by statute or Executive Order of the President.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Standards of accuracy.</E> Records subject to the Privacy Act which are used in making any determination about any individual shall be maintained with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness as is reasonably necessary to assure fairness to the individual in making the determination.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Collection of information.</E> (1) Information which may be used in making determinations about an individual's rights, benefits, and privileges under Federal programs shall, to the greatest extent practicable, be collected directly from that individual.</P>
          <P>(2) In deciding whether collection of information from an individual, as opposed to a third party source, is practicable, the following factors, among others, may be considered:</P>
          <P>(i) Whether the nature of the information sought is such that it can only be obtained from a third party;</P>
          <P>(ii) Whether the cost of collecting the information from the individual is unreasonable when compared with the cost of collecting it from a third party;</P>
          <P>(iii) Whether there is a risk that information collected from third parties, if inaccurate, could result in an adverse determination to the individual concerned;</P>
          <P>(iv) Whether the information, if supplied by the individual, would have to be verified by a third party; or (v) Whether provisions can be made for verification, by the individual, of information collected from third parties.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Advice to individuals concerning uses of information.</E> (1) Each individual who is asked to supply information about him or herself which will be added to a system of records shall be informed of the basis for requesting the information, how it may be used, and what the consequences, if any, are of not supplying the information.</P>
          <P>(2) At a minimum, the notice to the individual must state:</P>
          <P>(i) The authority (whether granted by statute or Executive Order of the President) which authorizes the solicitation of the information and whether disclosure of such information is mandatory or voluntary;</P>
          <P>(ii) The principal purpose or purposes for which the information is intended to be used;</P>
          <P>(iii) The routine uses which may be made of the information; and</P>
          <P>(iv) The effects on the individual, if any, of not providing all or any part of the requested information.</P>
          <P>(3)(i) When information is collected on a standard form, the notice to the individual shall be provided on the form, on a tear-off sheet attached to the form, or on a separate sheet, whichever is most practical.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Major decision points.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The possible environmental effects of a proposed action or project within the Presidio Trust Area must be considered along with technical, financial, and other factors throughout the decision-making process. Most Trust projects have three distinct stages in the decision-making process:</P>
          <P>(1) Conceptual or preliminary study stage;<PRTPAGE P="260"/>
          </P>
          <P>(2) Detailed planning or final decision stage;</P>
          <P>(3) Implementation stage.</P>
          <P>(b) Environmental review will be integrated into the decision-making process of the Trust as follows:</P>

          <P>(1) During the conceptual or preliminary study stage, the NEPA Compliance Coordinator shall determine whether the proposed action or project is one which is categorically excluded under § 1010.7, has been adequately reviewed in a previously prepared EA and/or EIS, or requires further NEPA review (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> an EA or an EIS).</P>
          <P>(2) If the proposed action or project is not categorically excluded and has not been adequately reviewed in a previously prepared EA and/or EIS, then prior to the Trust's proceeding beyond the conceptual or preliminary study stage, the NEPA Compliance Coordinator must determine whether an EIS is required. When appropriate, prior to the determination as to whether an EIS is required, the NEPA Compliance Coordinator may initiate a public scoping process in order to inform such a determination.</P>
          <P>(3) If an EIS is determined to be necessary, the Trust shall initiate a public scoping process in accordance with 40 CFR 1501.7. An EIS, if determined necessary, must be completed and circulated at the earliest point at which meaningful analysis can be developed for the proposed action or project and prior to the Trust's final approval of the proposed action or project.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Determination of requirement for EA or EIS.</SUBJECT>
          <P>In deciding whether to require the preparation of an EA or an EIS, the NEPA Compliance Coordinator will determine whether the proposal is one that:</P>
          <P>(a) Normally does not require either an EA or an EIS;</P>
          <P>(b) Normally requires an EIS; or</P>
          <P>(c) Normally requires an EA, but not necessarily an EIS.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Actions that do not require an EA or EIS.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Categorical Exclusions.</E> Pursuant to 40 CFR 1508.4, the Trust has determined that the categories of action identified in this paragraph have no significant effect, either individually or cumulatively, on the human environment and are therefore categorically excluded.

          <P>(1) Personnel actions and investigations and personal services contracts;</P>
          <P>(2) Administrative actions and operations directly related to the operation of the Trust (e.g., purchase of furnishings, services, and equipment) provided such actions and operations are consistent with applicable Executive Orders;</P>
          <P>(3) Internal organizational changes and facility and office expansions, reductions, and closings;</P>

          <P>(10) Proposal, adoption, revision, and termination of policies, directives, regulations, and guidelines:</P>

          <P>(i) That are of an administrative, financial, legal, technical, or procedural <PRTPAGE P="261"/>nature, the environmental effects of which are too broad, speculative, or conjectural to lend themselves to environmental analysis and the implementation of which will be subject to the NEPA process either collectively or on a case-by-case basis; or</P>
          <P>(ii) Where such actions will not potentially:</P>

          <P>(16) Archaeological surveys and permits involving only surface collection or small-scale test excavations;</P>
          <P>(17) Changes or amendments to an approved plan or action when such changes or amendments would cause no or only minimal environmental impact;</P>

          <P>(b) <E T="03">Extraordinary circumstances.</E> An action that falls into one or more of the categories in paragraph (a) of this section may still require the preparation of an EIS or an EA if the NEPA Compliance Coordinator determines that it meets the criteria stated in § 1010.8(b) or § 1010.10(b), respectively, or involves extraordinary circumstances that may have a significant environmental effect. At its discretion, the Trust may require the preparation of an EA or an EIS for a proposal or action that otherwise qualifies for a categorical exclusion. Criteria used in determining whether to prepare an EA or EIS for an action that otherwise qualifies for a categorical exclusion include whether an action may:</P>
          <P>(1) Have significant adverse effects on public health or safety;</P>

          <SUBJECT>Actions that normally require an EIS.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">General procedure.</E> So long as a proposed action or project is not categorically excluded under § 1010.7, the Trust shall require the preparation of an EA to determine if the proposed action or project requires an EIS. Nevertheless, if it is readily apparent to the NEPA Compliance Coordinator that the proposed action or project will have a significant impact on the environment, an EA is not required, and the Trust will prepare or direct the preparation of an EIS without preparing or completing the preparation of an EA. To assist the NEPA Compliance Coordinator in determining if a proposal or action normally requires the preparation of an EIS, the following criteria and categories of action are provided.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Criteria.</E> Criteria used to determine whether proposals or actions may significantly affect the environment and therefore require an EIS are described in 40 CFR 1508.27.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Categories of action.</E> The following categories of action normally require an EIS:</P>
          <P>(1) Legislative proposals made by the Trust to the United States Congress, other than those described in § 1010.7(b)(9);</P>
          <P>(2) Approval, funding, construction, and/or demolition in preparation for construction of any new building, if that activity has a significant effect on the human environment;</P>
          <P>(3) Proposals that would significantly alter the kind and amount of natural, recreational, historical, scenic, or cultural resources of the Presidio Trust Area or the integrity of the setting; and</P>
          <P>(4) Approval or amendment of a general land use or resource management plan for the entire Presidio Trust Area.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Preparation of an EIS.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Notice of intent.</E> When the Trust decides to prepare an EIS, it shall publish a notice of intent in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> in accordance with 40 CFR 1501.7 and 1508.22. Where there is a lengthy period between the Trust's decision to prepare an EIS and the time of actual preparation, then at the discretion of the NEPA Compliance Coordinator the notice of intent shall be published at a reasonable time in advance of preparation of the EIS.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Preparation.</E> After having determined that an EIS will be prepared and having published the notice of intent, the Trust will begin to prepare or to direct the preparation of the EIS. The EIS shall be formatted in accordance with 40 CFR 1502.10.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Supplemental environmental impact statements.</E> The Trust may supplement a draft or final EIS at any time. The Trust shall prepare a supplement to either a draft or final EIS when:</P>
          <P>(1) Substantial changes are proposed to an action analyzed in the draft or final EIS that are relevant to environmental concerns;</P>
          <P>(2) There are significant new circumstances or information relevant to environmental concerns and bearing on the proposed action or its impacts; or</P>

          <P>(3) Actions are proposed which relate to or are similar to other actions taken or proposed and that together will have <PRTPAGE P="264"/>a cumulatively significant impact on the human environment.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Actions that normally require an EA.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">General procedure.</E> If a proposal or action is not one that normally requires an EIS, and does not qualify for a categorical exclusion under § 1010.7, the Trust will require, prepare, or direct the preparation of an EA. An EA should be prepared when the Trust has insufficient information on which to determine whether a proposal may have significant impacts. An EA assists the Trust in complying with NEPA when no EIS is necessary, and it facilitates the preparation of an EIS, if one is necessary.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Criteria.</E> Criteria used to determine those categories of action that normally require an EA, but not necessarily an EIS, include:</P>
          <P>(1) Potential for degradation of environmental quality;</P>
          <P>(2) Potential for cumulative adverse impact on environmental quality; and</P>
          <P>(3) Potential for adverse impact on protected resources (e.g., natural, scenic, recreational, historical, and cultural resources).</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Categories of action.</E> The following categories of action normally require the preparation of an EA:</P>
          <P>(1) Promulgation of regulations and requirements that are not categorically excluded;</P>
          <P>(2) Proposals submitted by project applicants to the Trust for its review, as described in § 1010.14;</P>
          <P>(3) Proposals to add or alter access between the Presidio Trust Area and surrounding neighborhoods; and</P>
          <P>(4) Contracts, work authorizations, and master agreements related to and implementing programs, policies, and proposals which are not categorically excluded and for which there is no previously prepared EA and/or EIS.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Preparation of an EA.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">When to prepare.</E> The Trust will begin the preparation of an EA (or require it to be begun) as early as possible after it is determined by the NEPA Compliance Coordinator to be required. The Trust will provide notice of such determinations in accordance with § 1010.12. The Trust may prepare or require an EA at any time to assist planning and decision-making.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Content and format.</E> An EA is a concise public document used to determine whether to prepare an EIS. An EA should address impacts, including cumulative impacts, on those resources that are specifically relevant to the particular proposal. Those impacts should be addressed in as much detail as is necessary to allow an analysis of the alternatives and the proposal. The EA shall contain brief discussions of the following topics:</P>
          <P>(1) Purpose and need for the proposed action.</P>
          <P>(2) Description of the proposed action.</P>
          <P>(3) Alternatives considered, including a No Action alternative.</P>
          <P>(4) Environmental effects of the proposed action and the alternatives, including mitigation measures.</P>
          <P>(5) Listing of agencies, organizations, and/or persons consulted.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Finding of no significant impact (FONSI).</E> If an EA is completed and the NEPA Compliance Coordinator determines that an EIS is not required, then the NEPA Compliance Coordinator shall prepare a finding of no significant impact. The finding of no significant impact shall be made available to the public by the Trust as specified in 40 CFR 1506.6.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Mitigated FONSI.</E> If an EA is completed and the NEPA Compliance Coordinator determines that an EIS is required, then prior to preparation of an EIS, the proposal may be revised in order to mitigate the impacts identified in the EA through adherence to legal requirements, inclusion of mitigation as an integral part of the proposal, and/or fundamental changes to the proposal. A supplemental EA will be prepared on the revised proposal and will result in a Mitigated Finding of No Significant Impact, preparation of an EIS, or additional revision of the proposal and a supplemental EA.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Trust decision-making procedures.</SUBJECT>
          <P>To ensure that at major decision-making points all relevant environmental concerns are considered by the decision-maker, the following procedures are established.</P>
          <P>(a) An environmental document (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the EA, finding of no significant impact, EIS, or notice of intent), in addition to being prepared at the earliest point in the decision-making process, shall accompany the relevant proposal or action through the Trust's decision-making process to ensure adequate consideration of environmental factors.</P>
          <P>(b) The Trust shall consider in its decision-making process only decision alternatives encompassed by the range of alternatives discussed in the relevant environmental documents. Also, where an EIS has been prepared, the Trust shall consider all alternatives described in the EIS, a written record of the consideration of alternatives during the decision-making process shall be maintained, and a monitoring and enforcement program shall be adopted and summarized where applicable for any mitigation.</P>
          <P>(c) Any environmental document prepared for a proposal or action shall be made part of the record of any formal rulemaking by the Trust.</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 1010.14</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Review of proposals by project applicants.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) An EA shall be required for each proposal for demolition, construction, reconstruction, development, preservation, rehabilitation, or restoration of real property submitted by a project applicant to the Trust for its review, and which the decision-maker agrees to consider, unless categorically excluded or covered by a previously prepared EA and/or EIS.</P>
          <P>(b) The decision-maker may not take any approval action on such a proposal submitted by a project applicant until such time as the appropriate environmental review documents have been prepared and submitted to the decision-maker.</P>
          <P>(c) At a minimum, and as part of any submission made by a project applicant to the decision-maker for its approval, such project applicant shall make available data and materials concerning the proposal sufficient to permit the Trust to carry out its environmental review responsibilities. When requested, the project applicant shall provide additional information that the NEPA Compliance Coordinator believes is necessary to permit it to satisfy its environmental review functions.</P>
          <P>(d) With respect to each project proposed for consideration for which the NEPA Compliance Coordinator determines that an EA shall be prepared, the decision-maker may require a project applicant to submit a draft EA regarding its proposal for the Trust's evaluation and revision. In accordance with 40 CFR 1506.5(b), the Trust shall make its own evaluation of the environmental issues and shall take responsibility for the scope and content of the final EA.</P>

          <P>(e) With respect to each project proposed for consideration for which the NEPA Compliance Coordinator determines an EIS shall be prepared, the decision-maker may require a project applicant to pay a non-refundable fee to the Trust sufficient to cover a portion or all of the Trust's anticipated costs <PRTPAGE P="266"/>associated with preparation and review of the EIS, including costs associated with review under other applicable laws. Such fee shall be paid to the Trust in full prior to commencement of the preparation of the EIS or any amendment or supplement thereto.</P>
          <P>(f) In accordance with 40 CFR 1506.5(c), the EIS shall be prepared by the Trust and/or by contractors who are selected by the Trust and who certify that they have no financial or other interest in the outcome of the project, and the Trust shall independently evaluate the EIS prior to its approval and take responsibility for ensuring its adequacy. The EIS shall be prepared in accordance with 40 CFR part 1502.</P>
          <P>(g) The NEPA Compliance Coordinator may set time limits for environmental review appropriate to each proposal, consistent with 40 CFR 1501.8 and 1506.10.</P>
          <P>(h) The NEPA Compliance Coordinator shall at the earliest possible time ensure that the Trust commences its environmental review on a proposed project and shall provide the project applicant with any policies or information deemed appropriate in order to permit effective and timely review by the Trust of a proposal once it is submitted to the decision-maker for approval.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Actions where lead agency designation is necessary.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Consistent with 40 CFR 1501.5, where a proposed action by the Trust involves one or more other Federal agencies, or where actions by the Trust and one or more Federal agencies are directly related to each other because of their functional interdependence or geographical proximity, the Trust will seek designation as lead agency for those actions that relate solely to the Presidio Trust Area.</P>
          <P>(b) For an action that qualifies as one for which the Trust will seek designation as lead agency, the Trust will promptly consult with the appropriate Federal agencies to establish lead agency, joint lead agency, and/or cooperating agency designations.</P>
          <P>(c) For an action as to which the Trust undertakes lead, joint lead, or cooperating agency status, the Trust is authorized to enter into a memorandum of understanding or agreement to define the rights and responsibilities of the relevant agencies.</P>

          <P>Consistent with 40 CFR 1501.6, the Trust may request the NPS to be a cooperating agency for actions or projects significantly affecting the quality of the Presidio. In addition, upon request of the Trust, any other Federal, State, local, or tribal agency that has jurisdiction by law or special expertise with respect to any environmental issue that should be addressed in the analysis may be a cooperating agency. The Trust shall use the environmental analysis and proposals of cooperating agencies with jurisdiction by law or special expertise to the maximum extent possible consistent with its responsibility as lead or joint lead agency.</P>

          <P>Consistent with 40 CFR 1506.2, the Trust shall cooperate with State and local agencies to the fullest extent possible to reduce duplication between NEPA and State and local requirements. Such cooperation shall to the fullest extent possible include:</P>
          <P>(a) Joint planning processes;</P>
          <P>(b) Joint environmental research and studies;</P>
          <P>(c) Joint public hearings (except where otherwise provided by statute); and</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Interest.</E> (1) The Presidio Trust will assess interest on all delinquent debts unless prohibited by statute, regulation or contract.</P>

            <P>(2) Interest begins to accrue on all debts from the date the debt becomes delinquent. The Presidio Trust will waive collection of interest on that portion of the debt that is paid within 30 days after the date on which interest begins to accrue. The Presidio Trust will assess interest at the rate established by the Treasury Department under 31 U.S.C. 3717, unless a different rate is established by a contract, repayment agreement or statute. The <PRTPAGE P="271"/>Presidio Trust will notify the debtor of the basis for the interest rate assessed.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Penalty.</E> The Presidio Trust will assess a penalty of not more than 6% a year, or such other higher rate as authorized by law, on any portion of a debt that is delinquent for more than 90 days.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Administrative costs.</E> The Presidio Trust will assess charges to cover administrative costs incurred as a result of the debtor's failure to pay a debt. The Presidio Trust will waive collection of administrative costs on that portion of the debt that is paid within 30 days after the date on which the administrative costs begin to accrue. Administrative costs include the costs of processing and handling a debt, obtaining a credit report, using a private collection contractor, costs of a hearing including, the costs of a hearing officer, and service fees charged by a Federal agency for collection activities undertaken on behalf of the Presidio Trust.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Allocation of payments.</E> A partial or installment payment by a debtor will be applied first to outstanding penalty assessments, second to administrative costs, third to accrued interest, and fourth to outstanding debt principal.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Additional authority.</E> The Presidio Trust may have additional policies, guidelines and procedures regarding how interest, penalties and administrative costs are assessed on particular types of debts. The Presidio Trust will explain in the notice to the debtor described in § 1011.4 of this part how interest, penalties, administrative costs and other charges are assessed, unless the requirements are included in a contract or repayment agreement.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Waiver.</E> (1) The Presidio Trust may waive collection of all or part of accrued interest, penalties and administrative costs when it would be against equity and good conscience or not in the Presidio Trust's best interest to collect such charges.</P>
            <P>(2) A decision to waive interest, penalties or administrative costs may be made at any time before a debt is paid. However, unless otherwise provided in these regulations, when these charges have been collected before the waiver decision, they will not be refunded.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Accrual during suspension of debt collection.</E> In most cases, interest, penalties and administrative costs will continue to accrue during any period when collection has been suspended for any reason (for example, when the debtor has requested a hearing). The Presidio Trust may suspend accrual of any or all of these charges when accrual would be against equity and good conscience or not in the Presidio Trust's best interest.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Cross-servicing.</E> Unless a delinquent debt has previously been transferred to the FMS for administrative offset in accordance with § 1011.10, the Presidio Trust will transfer any eligible debt that is more than 180 days delinquent to the FMS for debt collection services, a process known as “cross-servicing.” The Presidio Trust may transfer debts delinquent 180 days or less to the FMS in accordance with the procedures described in 31 CFR 285.12. The FMS takes appropriate action to collect or compromise the transferred debt, or to suspend or terminate collection action thereon, in accordance with the statutory and regulatory requirements and authorities applicable to the debt and the collection action to be taken. Appropriate action includes, without limitation, contact with the debtor, referral of the debt to the Treasury Offset Program, private collection agencies or the Department of Justice, reporting of the debt to credit bureaus, and administrative wage garnishment.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Notice; certification.</E> At least 60 days prior to transferring a debt to the FMS, the Presidio Trust will send notice to the debtor as required by § 1011.4 of this part. The Presidio Trust will certify to the FMS, in writing, that the debt is valid, delinquent, legally enforceable and that there are no legal bars to collection. In addition, the Presidio Trust will certify its compliance with all applicable due process and other requirements as described in this part and other Federal laws.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Treasury Offset Program.</E> As part of its debt collection process, the FMS uses the Treasury Offset Program to collect debts by administrative and tax refund offset. The Treasury Offset Program is a centralized offset program administered by the FMS to collect delinquent debts owed to Federal agencies and states (including past-due child support). Under the Treasury Offset Program, before a federal payment is disbursed, the FMS compares the name and taxpayer identification number (TIN) of the payee with the names and TINs of debtors that have been submitted by Federal agencies and states to the Treasury Offset Program database. If there is a match, the FMS (or, in some cases, another Federal disbursing agency) offsets all or a portion of the federal payment, disburses any remaining payment to the payee, and pays the offset amount to the creditor agency. Federal payments eligible for offset include, without limitation, income tax refunds, salary, travel advances and reimbursements, retirement and vendor payments, and Social Security and other benefit payments.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Centralized administrative offset through the Treasury Offset Program.</E> (1) The Presidio Trust will refer any eligible debt over 120 days delinquent to the Treasury Offset Program for collection by centralized administrative offset. The Presidio Trust may refer any eligible debt less than 120 days delinquent to the Treasury Offset Program for offset.</P>

            <P>(2) At least 60 days prior to referring a debt to the Treasury Offset Program, in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of <PRTPAGE P="273"/>this section, the Presidio Trust will send notice to the debtor in accordance with the requirements of § 1011.4 of this part. The Presidio Trust will certify to the FMS, in writing, that the debt is valid, delinquent, legally enforceable and that there are no legal bars to collection by offset. In addition, the Presidio Trust will certify its compliance with the due process requirements under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) and with the requirements described in this part.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Non-centralized administrative offset for a debt.</E> (1) When centralized administrative offset through the Treasury Offset Program is not available or appropriate, the Presidio Trust may collect delinquent, legally enforceable debts through non-centralized administrative offset. In these cases, the Presidio Trust may offset a payment internally or make an offset request directly to a federal paying agency.</P>
            <P>(2) At least 30 days prior to offsetting a payment internally or requesting a federal paying agency to offset a payment, the Presidio Trust will send notice to the debtor in accordance with the requirements of § 1011.4 of this part. When referring a debt for offset under this paragraph (b), the Presidio Trust will certify, in writing, that the debt is valid, delinquent, legally enforceable and that there are no legal bars to collection by offset. In addition, the Presidio Trust will certify its compliance with the due process requirements under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) and with these regulations concerning administrative offset.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Administrative review.</E> The notice described in § 1011.4 of this part will explain to the debtor how to request an administrative review of the Presidio Trust determination that the debtor owes a debt and how to present evidence that the debt is not delinquent or legally enforceable. In addition to challenging the existence and amount of the debt, the debtor may seek a review of the terms of repayment. In most cases, the Presidio Trust will provide the debtor with a “paper hearing” based upon a review of the written record, including documentation provided by the debtor. The Presidio Trust will provide the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for an oral hearing when the debtor requests reconsideration of the debt and the Presidio Trust determines that the question of the indebtedness cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence, for example, when the validity of the debt turns on an issue of credibility or veracity. Unless otherwise required by law, an oral hearing under this section is not required to be a formal evidentiary hearing, although the Presidio Trust will document all significant matters presented at the hearing. The Presidio Trust may suspend collection through administrative offset and/or other collection actions pending the resolution of a debtor's dispute. The Presidio Trust may establish policies, guidelines and procedures concerning the administrative review process consistent with the FCCS and the regulations in this section.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Procedures for expedited offset.</E> Under the circumstances described by the FCCS, the Presidio Trust may effect an offset against a payment to be made to the debtor prior to sending a notice to the debtor, as described in § 1011.4 of this part, or completing the procedures described in paragraph (b)(2) and (c) of this section. The Presidio Trust will give the debtor notice and an opportunity for review as soon as practicable and promptly refund any money ultimately found not to have been owed to the Government.</P>

            <SUBJECT>How will the Presidio Trust offset a Federal employee's salary to collect a debt?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Federal salary offset.</E> (1) Salary offset is used to collect debts owed to the United States by Federal employees. If a Presidio Trust employee owes a debt, the Presidio Trust may offset the employee's federal salary to collect the debt in the manner described in this section. For information on how a Federal agency other than the Presidio Trust may collect a debt from the salary of a Presidio Trust employee, see § 1011.21 and 1011.22, subpart C, of this part.</P>
            <P>(2) Nothing in this part requires the Presidio Trust to collect a debt in accordance with the provisions of this section if Federal law allows otherwise.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Centralized salary offset through the Treasury Offset Program.</E> As described in § 1011.9(a) of this part, the Presidio Trust will refer debts to the FMS for collection by administrative offset, including salary offset, through the Treasury Offset Program.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Non-centralized salary offset for Treasury debts.</E> The Presidio Trust may collect delinquent debts through non-centralized salary offset. In these cases, the Presidio Trust may offset a payment internally or make a request directly to a paying agency to offset a salary payment to collect a delinquent debt owed by a Federal employee. At least 30 days prior to offsetting internally or requesting a Federal agency to offset a salary payment, the Presidio Trust will send notice to the debtor in accordance with the requirements of § 1011.4 of this part. When referring a debt for offset, the Presidio Trust will certify to the paying agency, in writing, that the debt is valid, delinquent and legally enforceable in the amount stated, and there are no legal bars to collection by salary offset. In addition, the Presidio Trust will certify that all due process and other prerequisites to salary offset have been met. See 5 U.S.C. 5514, 31 U.S.C. 3716(a), and this section for a description of the process for salary offset.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">When prior notice not required.</E> The Presidio Trust is not required to provide prior notice to a Presidio Trust employee when the following adjustments are made:</P>
            <P>(1) Any adjustment to pay arising out of a Presidio Trust employee's election of coverage or a change in coverage under a Federal benefits program requiring periodic deductions from pay, if the amount to be recovered was accumulated over four pay periods or fewer;</P>
            <P>(2) A routine intra-agency adjustment of pay that is made to correct an overpayment of pay attributable to clerical or administrative errors or delays in processing pay documents, if the overpayment occurred within the four pay periods preceding the adjustment, and, at the time of such adjustment, or as soon thereafter as practical, the individual is provided written notice of the nature and the amount of the adjustment and point of contact for contesting such adjustment; or</P>
            <P>(3) Any adjustment to collect a debt amounting to $50 or less, if, at the time of such adjustment, or as soon thereafter as practical, the individual is provided written notice of the nature and the amount of the adjustment and a point of contact for contesting such adjustment.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Hearing procedures.</E> (1) <E T="03">Request for a hearing.</E> A Presidio Trust employee who has received a notice that a debt will be collected by means of salary offset may request a hearing concerning the existence or amount of the debt. The employee also may request a <PRTPAGE P="275"/>hearing concerning the amount proposed to be deducted from the employee's pay each pay period. The employee must send any request for hearing, in writing, to the office designated in the notice described in § 1011.4(a)(11). The request must be received by the designated office on or before the 15th business day following the employee's receipt of the notice. The employee must sign the request and specify whether an oral or paper hearing is requested. If an oral hearing is requested, the employee must explain why the matter cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence alone.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Failure to submit timely request for hearing.</E> If the employee fails to submit a request for hearing within the time period described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the employee will have waived the right to a hearing, and salary offset may be initiated. However, the Presidio Trust may accept a late request for hearing if the employee can show that the late request was the result of circumstances beyond the employee's control or because of a failure to receive actual notice of the filing deadline.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Hearing official.</E> The Presidio Trust hearing must be conducted by a hearing official who is not under the supervision or control of the Board of Directors of the Presidio Trust. The hearing official need not be an employee of the Federal Government.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Notice of hearing.</E> After the employee requests a hearing, a designated hearing official will inform the employee of the form of the hearing to be provided. For oral hearings, the notice will set forth the date, time and location of the hearing. For paper hearings, the notice will notify the employee of the date by which the employee should submit written arguments to the designated hearing official. The hearing official will give the employee reasonable time to submit documentation in support of the employee's position. The hearing official will schedule a new hearing date if requested by both parties. The hearing official will give both parties reasonable notice of the time and place of a rescheduled hearing.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Oral hearing.</E> The hearing official will conduct an oral hearing if the official determines that the matter cannot be resolved by review of documentary evidence alone (for example, when an issue of credibility or veracity is involved). The hearing official will determine the procedure for the oral hearing, determining, for example, the hearing length.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Paper hearing.</E> If the hearing official determines that an oral hearing is not necessary, the official will make the determination based upon a review of the available written record, including any documentation submitted by the employee in support of the employee's position.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Date of decision.</E> The hearing official will issue a written opinion setting forth the decision, based upon documentary evidence and information developed at the hearing, as soon as practicable after the hearing.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Final agency action.</E> The hearing official's decision will be final.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Salary offset process.</E> (1) <E T="03">Determination of disposable pay.</E> The Presidio Trust payroll office will determine the amount of the employee's disposable pay (as defined in § 1011.1 of this part) and will implement salary offset.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">When salary offset begins.</E> Deductions will begin within three official pay periods.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Amount of salary offset.</E> The amount to be offset from each salary payment will be up to 15% of the employee's disposable pay, as follows:</P>
            <P>(i) If the amount of the debt is equal to or less than 15% of the disposable pay, such debt generally will be collected in one lump sum payment;</P>
            <P>(ii) Installment deductions will be made over a period of no greater than the anticipated period of employment. An installment deduction will not exceed 15% of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made unless the employee has agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Final salary payment.</E> After the employee's employment with the Presidio Trust ends, the Presidio Trust may make a lump sum deduction exceeding 15% of disposable pay from any final salary or other payments in order to satisfy a debt.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Authority and process.</E> The Presidio Trust is authorized to collect debts from a debtor's wages by means of administrative wage garnishment in accordance with the requirements of the FCCS and other applicable law. This part adopts and incorporates all of the provisions of 31 CFR 285.11 concerning administrative wage garnishment, including the hearing procedures described therein. The Presidio Trust may use administrative wage garnishment to collect a delinquent debt unless the debtor is making timely payments under an agreement to pay the debt in installments (see § 1011.6 of this part). At least 30 days prior to initiating an administrative wage garnishment, the Presidio Trust will send notice to the debtor in accordance with the requirements of § 1011.4 of this part, including the requirements of § 1011.4(a)(10) of this part. For debts referred to the FMS under § 1011.9 of this part, the Presidio Trust may authorize the FMS to send a notice informing the debtor that administrative wage garnishment will be initiated and how the debtor may request a hearing as described in § 1011.4(a)(10) of this part. If a debtor makes a timely request for a hearing, administrative wage garnishment will not begin until a hearing is held and a decision is sent to the debtor. If a debtor's hearing request is not timely, the Presidio Trust may suspend collection by administrative wage garnishment. All travel expenses incurred by the debtor in connection with an in-person hearing will be borne by the debtor.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Material change in circumstances.</E> A debtor who owes a debt may, at any time, request a special review by the Presidio Trust of the amount of any offset, administrative wage garnishment or voluntary payment, based on materially changed circumstances beyond the control of the debtor such as, without limitation, catastrophic illness, divorce, death or disability.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Inability to pay.</E> For purposes of this section, in determining whether an involuntary or voluntary payment would prevent the debtor from meeting essential subsistence expenses (costs incurred for food, housing, clothing, transportation and medical care), the debtor must submit a detailed statement and supporting documents for the debtor, the debtor's, and dependents, indicating:</P>
            <P>(1) Income from all sources;</P>

The Presidio Trust will evaluate the statement and documentation and determine whether the current offset, garnishment or repayment schedule imposes extreme financial hardship on the debtor. The Presidio Trust will notify the debtor in writing of such determination, including, if appropriate, a revised offset, garnishment or payment schedule. If the special review results in a revised offset, garnishment or repayment schedule, the Presidio Trust will notify the appropriate agency or other persons about the new terms.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HED">Subpart C—Procedures for Offset of Presidio Trust Payments To Collect Debts Owed To Other Federal Agencies</HD>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 1011.21</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>How do other Federal agencies use the offset process to collect debts from payments issued by the Presidio Trust?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Offset of Presidio Trust payments to collect debts owed to other Federal agencies.</E> (1) In most cases, Federal agencies submit eligible debts to the Treasury Offset Program to collect delinquent debts from payments issued by other Federal agencies, a process known as “centralized offset.” When centralized offset is not available or appropriate, any Federal agency may ask the Presidio Trust (when acting as a paying agency) to collect a debt owed to such agency by offsetting funds payable to a debtor by the Presidio Trust, including salary payments issued to the Presidio Trust employees. This section and § 1011.22 of this subpart C apply when a Federal agency asks the Presidio Trust to offset a payment issued by the Presidio Trust to a person who owes a debt to the United States.<PRTPAGE P="278"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) This subpart C does not apply to the collection of debts through tax refund offset.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Administrative offset (including salary offset); certification.</E> The Presidio Trust will initiate a requested offset only upon receipt of written certification from the creditor agency that the debtor owes the delinquent, legally enforceable debt in the amount stated, and that the creditor agency has fully complied with all applicable due process and other requirements, and the creditor agency's regulations, as applicable. Offsets will continue until the debt is paid in full or otherwise resolved to the satisfaction of the creditor agency.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Where a creditor agency makes requests for offset.</E> Requests for offset under this section must be sent to the Presidio Trust, ATTN: Chief Financial Officer, P.O. Box 29052, San Francisco, CA 94129-0052.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Incomplete certification.</E> The Presidio Trust will return an incomplete debt certification to the creditor agency with notice that the creditor agency must comply with paragraph (b) of this section before action will be taken to collect a debt from a payment issued by the Presidio Trust.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Review.</E> The Presidio Trust is not authorized to review the merits of the creditor agency's determination with respect to the amount or validity of the debt certified by the creditor agency.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">When the Presidio Trust will not comply with offset request.</E> The Presidio Trust will comply with the offset request of another agency unless the Presidio Trust determines that the offset would not be in the best interests of the United States, or would otherwise be contrary to law.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Multiple debts.</E> When two or more creditor agencies are seeking offsets from payments made to the same person, or when two or more debts are owed to a single creditor agency, the Presidio Trust may determine the order in which the debts will be collected or whether one or more debts should be collected by offset simultaneously.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Priority of debts owed to the Presidio Trust.</E> For purposes of this section, debts owed to the Presidio Trust generally take precedence over debts owed to other agencies. The Presidio Trust may determine whether to pay debts owed to other agencies before paying a debt owed to the Presidio Trust. The Presidio Trust will determine the order in which the debts will be collected based on the best interests of the United States.</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 1011.22</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>What does the Presidio Trust do upon receipt of a request to offset the salary of a Presidio Trust employee to collect a debt owed by the employee to another Federal agency?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Notice to the Presidio Trust employee.</E> When the Presidio Trust receives proper certification of a debt owed by one of its employees, the Presidio Trust will begin deductions from the employee's pay at the next officially established pay interval. The Presidio Trust will send a written notice to the employee indicating that a certified debt claim has been received from the creditor agency, the amount of the debt claimed to be owed to the creditor agency, the date deductions from salary will begin, and the amount of such deductions.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Amount of deductions from a Presidio Trust employee's salary.</E> The amount deducted under § 1011.21(b) of this part will be the lesser of the amount of the debt certified by the creditor agency or an amount up to 15% of the debtor's disposable pay. Deductions will continue until the Presidio Trust knows that the debt is paid in full or until otherwise instructed by the creditor agency. Alternatively, the amount offset may be an amount agreed upon, in writing, by the debtor and the creditor agency. See § 1011.12(g) (salary offset process).</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">When the debtor is no longer employed by the Presidio Trust</E>—(1) <E T="03">Offset of final and subsequent payments.</E> If the Presidio Trust employee retires or resigns or if his or her employment ends before collection of the debt is complete, the Presidio Trust will continue to offset up to 100% of an employee's subsequent payments until the debt is paid or otherwise resolved. Such payments include a debtor's final salary payment, lump-sum leave payment, and other payments payable to the debtor by the Presidio Trust.<PRTPAGE P="279"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Notice to the creditor agency.</E> If the employee's employment with the Presidio Trust terminates before the debt is paid in full, the Presidio Trust will certify to the creditor agency the total amount of its collection. If the Presidio Trust is aware that the employee is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, Federal Employee Retirement System, or other similar payments, the Presidio Trust will provide written notice to the agency making such payments that the debtor owes a debt (including the amount) and that the provisions of 5 CFR 550.1109 have been fully complied with. The creditor agency is responsible for submitting a certified claim to the agency responsible for making such payments before collection may begin. Generally, creditor agencies will collect such monies through the Treasury Offset Program as described in § 1011.9(c) of this part.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Notice to the debtor.</E> The Presidio Trust will provide to the debtor a copy of any notices sent to the creditor agency under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">When the debtor transfers to another Federal agency</E>—(1) <E T="03">Notice to the creditor agency.</E> If the debtor transfers to another Federal agency before the debt is paid in full, the Presidio Trust will notify the creditor agency and will certify the total amount of its collection on the debt. The Presidio Trust will provide a copy of the certification to the creditor agency. The creditor agency is responsible for submitting a certified claim to the debtor's new employing agency before collection may begin.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Notice to the debtor.</E> The Presidio Trust will provide to the debtor a copy of any notices and certifications sent to the creditor agency under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Request for hearing official.</E> The Presidio Trust will provide a hearing official upon the creditor agency's request with respect to the Presidio Trust employee.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Can I get an authenticated copy of a Presidio Trust record?</SUBJECT>
            <P>Yes. We may provide an authenticated copy of a Presidio Trust record, for purposes of admissibility under Federal, State or Tribal law. We will do this only if the record has been officially released or would otherwise be released under parts 1007 or 1008 of this chapter, or this part.</P>

            <P>(a) If you receive a request or subpoena that does not include a <E T="03">Touhy</E> Request, you must immediately notify your supervisor and the Presidio Trust's General Counsel for assistance in issuing the proper response.</P>
            <P>(b) If you receive a <E T="03">Touhy</E> Request, you must promptly notify your supervisor and forward the request to the General Counsel.

            <SUBJECT>Purpose and scope of this part.</SUBJECT>
            <P>This part contains the general rules of the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board for public access to Board records. These regulations implement 5 U.S.C. 552, the Freedom of Information Act, as amended, and the policy of the Board. It is the Board's policy to disseminate information on matters of interest to the public and to disclose on request all information contained in records in its custody insofar as is compatible with the discharge of its responsibilities and consistent with the law. This part sets forth generally the categories of records accessible to the public, the types of records subject to prohibitions or restrictions on disclosure, and the places and procedures to obtain information from records in the custody of the A&amp;TBCB.</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 1120.2</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>For the purposes of this part:</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">A&amp;TBCB</E> or <E T="03">Board</E> means the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">A&amp;TBCB record</E> or <E T="03">record</E> means any document, writing, photograph, sound or magnetic recording, drawing or other similar thing by which information has been preserved, from which the information can be retrieved and copied, and which is, was, or is alleged to be under the control of the A&amp;TBCB.</P>
            <P>(1) The term includes—</P>
            <P>(i) Informal writings such as handwritten notes and drafts;</P>
            <P>(ii) Information preserved in a form which must be translated or deciphered by machine in order to be intelligible to humans;</P>
            <P>(iii) Records which were created or acquired by the A&amp;TBCB, its members, its employees, its members' employees, or persons acting on behalf of its members, by use of A&amp;TBCB funds or in the course of transacting official business for the A&amp;TBCB.</P>
            <P>(2) The term does not include—</P>

            <P>(i) Materials which are legally owned by an A&amp;TBCB member, employee, or member's employee or representative <PRTPAGE P="286"/>in his or her purely personal capacity; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Materials published by non-Federal organizations which are readily available to the public, such as books, journals, standards, and periodicals available through reference libraries, even if such materials are in the A&amp;TBCB's possession.</P>
            <P>(c) The terms <E T="03">agency, person, party, rule, rulemaking, order,</E> and <E T="03">adjudication</E> have the meanings given in 5 U.S.C. 551, except where the context demonstrates that a different meaning is intended, and except that for purposes of the Freedom of Information Act the term <E T="03">agency</E> as defined in 5 U.S.C. 551 includes any executive department, military department, Government corporation, Government controlled corporation, the United States Postal Service, or other establishment in the executive branch of the Government (including the Executive Office of the President) or any independent regulatory agency.</P>
            <P>(d) A government record <E T="03">under the control of the A&amp;TBCB</E> means that the record is subject to the free disposition of the A&amp;TBCB. This includes keeping the record available for governmental use as required and protecting, preserving, and exercising such control over it as may be necessary for that purpose. Control of a record is not synonymous with, and does not require, actual physical possession of the record.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Request</E> means a request to inspect or obtain a copy of one or more records.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Requestor</E> means any person who submits a request to the A&amp;TBCB.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Public member</E> means a member appointed by the President from among members of the general public.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Direct Costs</E> means those expenditures which an agency actually incurs in searching for and duplicating (and in the case of commercial requesters, reviewing) documents to respond to a FOIA request. Direct costs include, for example, the salary of the employee performing work (the basic rate of pay for the employee plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating duplicating machinery. Not included in direct costs are overhead expenses such as costs of space, and heating or lighting the facility in which the records are stored.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Search</E> includes all time spent looking for material that is responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line identification of material within documents. Agencies should ensure that searching for material is done in the most efficient and least expensive manner so as to minimize costs for both the agency and the requester. For example, agencies should not engage in line-by-line search when merely duplicating an entire document would prove the less expensive and quicker method of complying with a request. <E T="03">Search</E> should be distinguished, moreover, from <E T="03">review</E> of material in order to determine whether the material is exempt from disclosure (see paragraph (k) of this section). Searches may be done manually or by computer using existing programming.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Duplication</E> refers to the process of making a copy of a document necessary to respond to an FOIA request. Such copies can take the form of paper copy, microform, audio-visual materials, or machine readable documentation (e.g., magnetic tape or disk), among others. The copy provided must be in a form that is reasonably usable by requesters.</P>
            <P>(k) <E T="03">Review</E> refers to the process of examining documents located in response to a request that is for a commercial use (see paragraph (l) of this section) to determine whether any portion of any document located is permitted to be withheld. It also includes processing any documents for disclosure, e.g., doing all that is necessary to excise them and otherwise prepare them for release. Review does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.</P>
            <P>(l) <E T="03">Commercial Use Request</E> refers to a request from or on behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made. In determining whether a requester properly belongs in this category, agencies must determine the use to which a requester will put the documents requested. Moreover, where an agency has reasonable cause to doubt <PRTPAGE P="287"/>the use to which a requester will put the records sought, or where that use is not clear from the request itself, agencies should seek additional clarification before assigning the request to a specific category.</P>
            <P>(m) <E T="03">Educational Institution</E> refers to a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate higher education, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an institution of professional education, and an institution of vocational education, which operates a program or programs of scholarly research.</P>
            <P>(n) <E T="03">Non-Commercial Scientific Institution</E> refers to an institution that is not operated on a <E T="03">commercial</E> basis as that term is referenced in paragraph (l) of this section, and which is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.</P>
            <P>(o) <E T="03">Representative of the News Media</E> refers to any person actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public. The term <E T="03">news</E> means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of periodicals (but only in those instances when they can qualify as disseminators of <E T="03">news</E>) who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the general public. These examples are not intended to be all-inclusive.</P>

            <FP>Moreover, as traditional methods of news delivery evolve (e.g., electronic dissemination of newspapers through telecommunications services), such alternative media would be included in this category. In the case of <E T="03">freelance</E> journalists, they may be regarded as working for a news organization if they can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that organization, even though not actually employed by it. A publication contract would be the clearest proof, but agencies may also look to the past publication record of a requester in making this determination.</FP>

            <SUBJECT>Policy on disclosure of records.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) It is the policy of the A&amp;TBCB to make information available to the public to the greatest extent possible in keeping with the spirit of the Freedom of Information Act. Therefore, all records of the A&amp;TBCB, except those that the A&amp;TBCB specifically determines must not be disclosed in the national interest, for the protection of private rights, or for the efficient conduct of public business to the extent permitted by the Freedom of Information Act, are declared to be available for public inspection and copying as provided in this part. Each member and employee of the A&amp;TBCB is directed to cooperate to this end and to make records available to the public promptly and to the fullest extent consistent with this policy. A record may not be withheld from the public solely because its release might suggest administrative error or embarrass a member or employee of the A&amp;TBCB.</P>
            <P>(b) Subject to § 1120.51, any nonexempt A&amp;TBCB record is available to the public upon request regardless of whether the requestor shows any justification or need for the record.</P>
            <P>(c) An A&amp;TBCB office may waive the procedures on this subpart in favor of the requestor, for reasons of the public interest, simplicity, or speed.</P>
            <P>(d) If a requested record contains both exempt and nonexempt material, the nonexempt material shall be disclosed, after the exempt material has been deleted in accordance with § 1120.42.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Requests to which this subpart applies.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) This subpart applies to any written request (other than a request made by another Federal agency) received by the A&amp;TBCB, whether or not the request cites the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, except with respect to records for which a less formal disclosure procedure is provided specifically in this part.<PRTPAGE P="290"/>
            </P>
            <P>(b) Any written request to the A&amp;TBCB for existing records prepared by the A&amp;TBCB for routine public distribution, e.g., pamphlets, copies of speeches, press releases, and educational materials, shall be honored. No individual determination under § 1120.32 is necessary in these cases, since preparation of the materials for routine public distribution itself constitutes that a determination that the records are available to the public.</P>

            <P>(c) This subpart applies only to records that exist at the time the request for information is made. (See § 1120.3, <E T="03">Existing records.)</E>

            <P>A written request for records must be filed with the A&amp;TBCB Freedom of Information Officer, Suite 501, 1111 18th Street NW., Washington, DC 20036. Requests may be mailed to that address or filed in person at that address during the A&amp;TBCB's normal business hours.</P>

            <P>(a) The A&amp;TBCB cannot assure that a timely for satisfactory response under this subpart will be given to written requests that are addressed to A&amp;TBCB offices, members, or employees other than the Freedom of Information Officer listed in § 1120.23. Any A&amp;TBCB member or employee who receives a written request for inspection or disclosure of A&amp;TBCB records must promptly forward a copy of the request to the Freedom of Information Officer, by the fastest practicable means, and must, if appropriate, commence action under § 1120.32.</P>
            <P>(b) While A&amp;TBCB members and employees will attempt in good faith to comply with oral requests for inspection or disclosure of A&amp;TBCB records, by telephone or otherwise, these requests are not required to be processed in accordance with this subpart.</P>

            <P>A request must be in writing, must reasonably describe the records sought in a way that will permit their identification and location, and must be addressed to the address set forth in § 1120.23, but otherwise need not be in any particular form. Each request under the Freedom of Information Act should be clearly and prominently identified by a legend on the first page, such as “Freedom of Information Act Request.” The envelope in which the request is sent should be prominently marked with the letters “FOIA.” It is helpful, but not necessary, for the requestor to include his or her phone number and the reason for the request. A request may state the maximum amount of fees which the requester is willing to pay. Under § 1120.33(d), the failure to state willingness to pay fees as high as are anticipated by the A&amp;TBCB will delay running of the time limit and delay processing of the request, if the responsible official anticipates that the fees chargeable may exceed $250.00.</P>

            <P>(a) If the description of the records sought in the request is not sufficient to allow the A&amp;TBCB to identify and locate the requested records, the office taking action under § 1120.32 must notify the requestor (by telephone when practicable) that the request cannot be further processed until additional information is furnished.</P>
            <P>(b) The A&amp;TBCB must make every reasonable effort to assist the requestor in formulating his or her request. If a request is described in general terms (e.g., all records having to do with a certain area), the A&amp;TBCB office taking action under § 1120.32 may communicate with the requestor (by telephone when practicable) with a view toward reducing the administrative burden of processing a broad request and minimizing the fee payable by the requestor. Such attempts must not be used as a means to discourage requests, but rather as a means to help identify with more specificity the records actually sought.</P>

            <P>(a) The FOIA Officer is delegated the authority to issue initial determinations concerning records which he or she believes are in the custody of a Board member, an employee of a member's agency, or an employee of a public member. When the FOIA Officer receives such a request, he or she shall forward it to the member, employee of a member agency, or employee of a public member whom the FOIA Officer believes to have custody of the records, requesting the records. The person to whom the request is forwarded shall, within three days of receipt of the FOIA Officer's request, either furnish the records requested to the FOIA Officer or inform the FOIA Officer of the time when they will be furnished. The FOIA Officer shall then determine whether or not to disclose the documents. For purposes of such requests and their processing under this subpart, the FOIA Officer is considered the office handling the requests.</P>
            <P>(b) Heads of staff offices are delegated the authority to issue initial determinations, other records which are in their respective custody.</P>
            <P>(c) Whenever an A&amp;TBCB office receives a request forwarded by the FOIA Officer, the office should:</P>
            <P>(1) Take action under § 1120.26, if required, to obtain a better description of the records requested;</P>
            <P>(2) Locate the records as promptly as possible, or determine that:</P>
            <P>(i) The records are not known to exist; or</P>
            <P>(ii) They are located at another A&amp;TBCB office; or</P>
            <P>(iii) They are located at another Federal agency and not possessed by the A&amp;TBCB.</P>
            <P>(3) When appropriate, take action under § 1120.53(b) to obtain payment or assurance of payment;</P>

            <P>(4) Determine which of the requested records legally must be withheld, and why (see § 1120.42(b), <E T="03">Release of exempt documents</E>);</P>
            <P>(5) Of the requested records which are exempt from mandatory disclosure but which legally may be disclosed (see § 1120.42(a)), determine which records will be withheld, and why;</P>

            <P>(6) Issue an initial determination within the allowed period (see § 1120.31), specifying (individually or by category) which records will be disclosed and which will be withheld, and signed by a person authorized to issue the determination under paragraph (a) of this section (see § 1120.33, <E T="03">Initial denials of requests</E>);</P>
            <P>(7) Furnish the Freedom of Information Officer a copy of the determination; and</P>
            <P>(8) If the determination denies a request, furnish the Freedom of Information Officer the name of the A&amp;TBCB member(s) or employee(s) having custody of the records and maintain the records in a manner permitting their prompt forwarding to the General Counsel upon request if an appeal from the initial denial is filed. (See also § 1120.34.)</P>

            <P>(d) If it appears that some or all of the requested records are not in the possession of the A&amp;TBCB office which has been assigned responsibility for responding to the request but may be in the possession of some A&amp;TBCB office, the responding office must so inform <PRTPAGE P="292"/>the Freedom of Information officer immediately.</P>

            <P>(b) The period of 10 working days is measured from the date the request is first received and logged in by the Freedom of Information Officer.</P>
            <P>(c) There is excluded from the period of 10 working days (or any extension) any time which elapses between the date that a requestor is notified by the A&amp;TBCB under § 1120.26 that his or her request does not reasonably identify the records sought, and the date that the requestor furnishes a reasonable identification.</P>

            <P>(e) The A&amp;TBCB office taking action under § 1120.31 may extend the basic 10-day period established under paragraph (a) of this section by a period not to exceed 10 additional working days if—</P>
            <P>(1) The office notifies the Freedom of Information Officer;</P>
            <P>(2) The office notifies the requestor in writing within the basic 10-day period stating the reasons for the extension and the date by which the office expects to be able to issue a determination;</P>
            <P>(3) The extension is reasonably necessary to properly process the particular request; and</P>
            <P>(4) One or more of the following unusual circumstances require the extension:</P>
            <P>(i) There is a need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the office processing the request;</P>
            <P>(ii) There is a need to search for, collect, and/or appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in a single request; or</P>
            <P>(iii) There is need for consultation with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or more components of the A&amp;TBCB. The office must conduct the consultation with all practicable speed.</P>
            <P>(f) Should the A&amp;TBCB fail to issue a determination within the 10-day period or any authorized extension as to an initial request, or during the period for consideration of an appeal, the requestor shall be deemed to have exhausted his or her administrative remedies with respect to such.</P>
            <FP>In the latter situation, the requestor may commence an action in an appropriate Federal district court to obtain the records.</FP>

            <P>(c) If the issuance of the determination to deny a request was directed by some A&amp;TBCB officer or employee other than the person signing the determination letter, that other person's identity and position must be stated in the determination letter.</P>

(See § 1120.36.)</P>
            <P>(e) A determination is deemed issued on the date the determination letter is placed in A&amp;TBCB mailing channels for first class mailing to the requestor, delivered to the U.S. Postal Service for mailing, or personally delivered to the requestor, whichever date first occurs.</P>
            <P>(f) When a request must be denied because the record has not yet been located (although it is believed to be in the A&amp;TBCB's possession), the A&amp;TBCB office responsible for maintaining the record must continue to search diligently until it is located or it appears that the record does not exist or is not in the A&amp;TBCB's possession, and must periodically inform the requestor of the office's progress.</P>

            <P>(a) The General Counsel must make one of the following legal determinations in connection with every appeal from the initial denial of a request for an existing, located record:</P>
            <P>(1) The record must be disclosed;</P>
            <P>(2) The record must not be disclosed because a statute or a provision of this part so requires; or</P>
            <P>(3) The record is exempt from mandatory disclosure but legally may be disclosed as a matter of agency discretion.</P>
            <P>(b) Whenever the General Counsel has determined under paragraph (a)(3) of this section that a record is exempt from mandatory disclosure but legally may be disclosed, the matter must be referred to the Executive Director. If the Executive Director determines that an important purpose would be served by withholding the record, the General Counsel shall issue a determination denying the appeal. If the Executive Director determines that no important purpose would be served by withholding the record, the General Counsel must disclose the record.</P>

            <P>(c) The General Counsel may delegate his or her authority under this section to any other attorney employed by the A&amp;TBCB in connection <PRTPAGE P="294"/>with any cateogory of appeals or any individual appeals.</P>

            <P>(4) One or more of the following unusual circumstances require the extension:</P>
            <P>(i) There is a need to search for and collect the records from field facilities or other establishments that are separated from the office processing the appeal;</P>
            <P>(ii) There is a need to search for, collect, and/or appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in a single request; or</P>
            <P>(iii) There is a need for consultation with another agency or among two or more components of the A&amp;TBCB. The General Counsel must conduct the consultation with all practicable speed.</P>
            <P>(d) No extension of the 20-day period may be issued under paragraph (c) of this section which would cause the total of all such extensions and of any extensions issued under § 1120.33(c) to exceed 10 working days.</P>

            <P>(a) Generally, 5 U.S.C. 552(b) establishes nine exclusive categories of matters which are exempt from the mandatory disclosure requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552(a). No request under 5 U.S.C. 552 for an existing, located, unpublished record in the A&amp;TBCB's control may be denied by any A&amp;TBCB office or employee unless the record contains (or its disclosure would reveal) matters that are—</P>
            <P>(1) Specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and which are in fact properly classified pursuant to the Executive order;</P>
            <P>(2) Related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency;</P>
            <P>(3) Specifically exempted from disclosure by statute;</P>
            <P>(4) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential;</P>
            <P>(5) Interagency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency;</P>
            <P>(6) Personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;</P>

            <P>(7) Investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to <PRTPAGE P="295"/>the extent that the production of such records would—</P>
            <P>(i) Interfere with enforcement proceedings;</P>
            <P>(ii) Deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication;</P>
            <P>(iii) Constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;</P>
            <P>(iv) Disclose the identity of a confidential source and, in the case of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, confidential information furnished only by the confidential source;</P>
            <P>(v) Disclose investigative techniques and procedures; or</P>
            <P>(vi) Endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel;</P>
            <P>(8) Contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions; or</P>
            <P>(9) Geological and geophysical information and data, including maps, concerning wells.</P>

            <P>(b) The fact that the applicability of an exemption permits the withholding of a requested record (or portion of a record) does not necessarily mean that the record must or should be withheld. (See § 1120.42 <E T="03">Release of exempt documents.)</E>

            <SUBJECT>Release of exempt documents.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) An A&amp;TBCB office may, in its discretion, release requested records despite the applicability of one or more of the exemptions listed in § 1120.41 (a)(2), (5), or (7). Disclosure of such records is encouraged if no important purpose would be served by withholding the records.</P>
            <P>(b) Though the policy of the A&amp;TBCB is to honor all requests, as indicated in § 1120.21(a), there are circumstances when the A&amp;TBCB will not disclose a record if one or more of the FOIA exemptions applies to the record. The exemptions usually in such circumstances are exemptions (2), (3), (4), (6), (8) and (9). In these cases, where the A&amp;TBCB has withheld a requested record, or portions thereof, the A&amp;TBCB will disclose the exempted record when ordered to do so by a Federal court or in exceptional circumstances under appropriate restrictions with the approval of the Office of General Counsel.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Charges for services, generally.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) It shall be the policy of the ATBCB to comply with requests for documents made under the FOIA using the most efficient and least costly methods available. Requesters will be charged fees, in accordance with the administrative provisions and fee schedule set forth below, for searching for, reviewing (in the case of commercial use requesters only), and duplicating requested records.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Categories of requesters.</E> For the purpose of standard FOIA fee assessment, the four categories of requesters are: Commercial use requesters; educational and non-commercial scientific institution requesters; requesters who are representatives of the news media; and, all other requesters (see § 1120.2 (l) through (o), Definitions).</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Levels of fees.</E> Levels of fees prescribed for each category of requester are as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) Commercial Use Requesters—When the ATBCB receives a request for documents which appears to be a request for commercial use, the Board may assess charges in accordance with the fee schedule set forth below, which recover the full direct costs of searching for, reviewing for release, and duplicating the records sought. Costs for time spent reviewing records to determine whether they are exempt from mandatory disclosure applies to the initial review only. No fees will be assessed for reviewing records, at the administrative appeal level, of the exemptions already applied.</P>

            <P>(2) Educational and Non-Commercial Scientific Institution Requesters—The ATBCB shall provide documents to requesters in this category for the cost of reproduction alone, in accordance with the fee schedule set forth below, excluding charges for the first 100 pages of reproduced documents.<PRTPAGE P="296"/>
            </P>
            <P>(i) To be eligible for inclusion in this category, requesters must demonstrate the request is being made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use, but are sought in furtherance of scholarly (if the request is from an educational institution) or scientific (it the request is from a non-commercial scientific institution) research.</P>
            <P>(ii) Requesters eligible for free search must reasonably describe the records sought.</P>
            <P>(3) Requesters Who Are Representatives of the News Media—The ATBCB shall provide documents to requesters in this category for the cost of reproduction alone, in accordance with the fee schedule set forth below, excluding charges for the first 100 pages of reproduced documents.</P>
            <P>(4) All Other Requestors—The ATBCB shall charge requestors who do not fit into any of the categories described above, fees which recover the full direct cost of searching for and reproducing records that are responsive to the request, except that the first two hours of search time and the first 100 pages of reproduction shall be furnished without charge.</P>
            <P>(d) Schedule of FOIA fees.</P>
            <P>(1) Record search (ATBCB employees)—$14.00 per hour</P>
            <P>(2) Document review (ATBCB employees)—$20.00 per hour</P>
            <P>(3) Duplication of documents (paper copy of paper original)—$.20 per page</P>
            <P>(e) No charge shall be made:</P>
            <P>(1) If the costs of routine collection and processing of the fee are likely to equal or exceed the amount of the fee;</P>
            <P>(2) For any request made by an individual or group of individuals falling into the categories listed at paragraph (b) of this section, and described in paragraph (c) of this section, (excepting commercial use requests) the first two hours of search time and first 100 pages of duplication;</P>
            <P>(3) For the cost of preparing or reviewing letters of response to a request or appeal;</P>
            <P>(4) For responding to a request for one copy of the official personnel record of the requestor;</P>
            <P>(5) For furnishing records requested by either House of Congress, or by duly authorized committee or subcommittee or Congress, unless the records are requested for the benefit of an individual Member of Congress or for a constituent;</P>
            <P>(6) For furnishing records requested by and for the official use of other Federal agencies; or</P>
            <P>(7) For furnishing records needed by an A&amp;TBCB contractor or grantee to perform the work required by the A&amp;TBCB contract or grant.</P>
            <P>(f) Requestors may be charged for unsuccessful or unproductive searches or for searches when records located are determined to be exempt from disclosure.</P>
            <P>(g) Where the ATBCB reasonably believes that a requestor or group of requestors is attempting to break a request down into a series of requests for the purpose of evading the assessment of fees, the ATBCB shall aggregate any such requests and charge accordingly.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Computerized records.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Information available in whole or in part in computerized form which is disclosable under the Freedom of Information Act is available to the public as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) When there is an existing printout from the computer which permits copying the printout, the material will be made available at the per page rate stated in § 1120.51(a) for each 8<FR>1/2</FR> by 11 inch page.</P>
            <P>(2) When there is not an existing printout of information disclosable under the Freedom of Information Act, a printout shall be made if the applicant pays the cost to the A&amp;TBCB as stated in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</P>

            <P>(3) Obtaining information from computerized records frequently involves a minimum computer time cost of approximately $100 per request. Multiple requests involving the same subject may cost less per request. Services of personnel in the nature of a search shall be charged for at rates prescribed in § 1120.51(a). A charge shall be made for the computer time involved based upon the prevailing level of costs to Government organizations and upon the particular types of computer and associated equipment and the amounts <PRTPAGE P="297"/>of time on such equipment that are utilized. A charge shall also be made for any substantial amounts of special supplies or materials used to contain, present, or make available the output of computers based upon the prevailing levels of costs to Government organizations and upon the type and amount of the supplies and materials that are used.</P>
            <P>(b) Information in the Board's computerized records which could be produced only by additional programming of the computer, thus producing information not previously in being, is not required to be furnished under the Freedom of Information Act. In view of the usually heavy workloads of the computers used by the Board, such a service cannot ordinarily be offered to the public.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Payment of fees.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Method of payment.</E> All fee payments shall be in the form of a check or money order payable to the order of the “U.S. Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board” and shall be sent (accompanied by a reference to the pertinent Request Indentification Number(s)) to the address in § 1120.23.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Charging interest.</E> The ATBCB may charge interest to those requestors failing to pay fees assessed in accordance with the procedures described in § 1120.51. Interest charges, computed at the rate prescribed in section 3717 of title 31 U.S.C.A., will be assessed on the full amount billed starting on the 31st day following the day on which the bill was sent.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Advance payment or assurance of payment.</E> (1) When an ATBCB office determines or estimates that the allowable charges a requestor may be required to pay are likely to exceed $250.00, the ATBCB may require the requestor to make an advance payment or arrangements to pay the entire fee before continuing to process the request. The ATBCB shall promptly inform the requestor (by telephone, if practicable) of the need to make an advance payment or arrangements to pay the fee. That office need not search for, review, duplicate, or disclose records in response to any request by that requestor until he or she pays, or makes acceptable arrangements to pay, the total amount of fees due (or estimated to become due) under this subpart.</P>
            <P>(2) Where a requestor has previously failed to pay a fee charged in a timely fashion, the ATBCB may require the requestor to pay the full amount owed, plus any applicable interest, as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, and to make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated fee before any new or pending requests will be processed from that requestor.</P>
            <P>(3) In those instances described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section, the administrative time limits prescribed in § 1120.33(d) will begin only after the ATBCB has received all fee payments due or acceptable arrangements have been made to pay all fee payments due.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Effect of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365).</E> Requestors are advised that the ATBCB shall use the authorities of the Debt Collection Act of 1982, including disclosure to consumer reporting agencies and use of collection agencies, where appropriate, to encourage repayment of debts arising from freedom of information act requests.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Waiver or reduction of fees.</E> (1) Records responsive to a request under 5 U.S.C. 552 shall be furnished without charge or at a charge reduced below that establsihed under paragraph (d) of § 1120.51 where the Freedom of Information Officer determines, based upon information provided by a requestor in support of a fee waiver request or otherwise made known to the Freedom of Information Officer, that disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor. Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees shall be considered on a case-by-case basis.</P>

            <P>(2) In order to determine whether the first fee waiver requirement is met—i.e., that disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government—Freedom of Information Officer <PRTPAGE P="298"/>shall consider the following four factors in sequence:</P>
            <P>(i) The subject of the request: Whether the subject of the requested records concerns “the operations or activities of the government.” The subject matter of the requested records, in the context of the request, must specifically concern identifiable operations or activities of the federal government—with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated. Furthermore, the records must be sought for their informative value with respect to those government operations or activities; a request for access to records for their intrinsic informational content alone will not satisfy this threshold consideration.</P>
            <P>(ii) The informative value of the information to be disclosed: Whether the disclosure is “likely to contribute” to an understanding of government operations or activities. The disclosable portions of the requested records must be meaningfully informative on specific government operations or activities in order to hold potential for contributing to increase public understanding of those operations and activities. The disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in either a duplicative or a substantially identical form, would not be likely to contribute to such understanding, as nothing new would be added to the public record.</P>
            <P>(iii) The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the public likely to result from disclosure: Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to “public understanding.” The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of the public at large, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requestor or a narrow segment of interested persons. A requestor's identity and qualifications—e.g., expertise in the subject area and ability and intention to effectively convey information to the general public—should be considered. It reasonably may be presumed that a representative of the news media (as defined in § 1120.2(o)) who has access to the means of public dissemination readily will be able to satisfy this consideration. Requests from libraries or other record repositories (or requestors who intend merely to disseminate information to such institutions) shall be analyzed, like those of other requestors to identify a particular person who represents that he actually will use the requested information in scholarly or other analytic work and then disseminate it to the general public.</P>
            <P>(iv) The significance of the contribution to public understanding: Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute “significantly” to public understanding of government operations or activities. The public's understanding of the subject matter in question, as compared to the level of public understanding existing prior to the disclosure, must be likely to be enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent. Freedom of Information Officer shall not make separate value judgments as to whether information, even though it in fact would contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government, is “important” enough to be made public.</P>
            <P>(3) In order to determine whether the second fee waiver requirement is met—i.e., that disclosure of the requested information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor—the Freedom of Information Officer shall consider the following two factors in sequence:</P>

            <P>(i) The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: Whether the requestor has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. The Freedom of Information Officer shall consider all commercial interests of the requester (with reference to the definition of “commercial use” in § 1120.2(l)) or any person on whose behalf the requestor may be acting, but shall consider only those interests which would be furthered by the requested disclosure. In assessing the magnitude of identified commercial interests, consideration shall be given to the role that such FOIA-disclosed information plays with respect to those commercial interests, as well as to the extent to which FOIA disclosures serve those interests overall. Requestors shall be given a reasonable opportunity in the administrative process to provide information bearing upon this consideration.<PRTPAGE P="299"/>
            </P>
            <P>(ii) The primary interest in disclosure: Whether the magnitude of the identified commercial interest of the requestor is sufficiently large, in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is “primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor.” A fee waiver or reduction is warranted only where, once the “public interest” standard set out in paragraph (e)(2) of this section is satisfied, that public interest can fairly be regarded as greater in magnitude than that of the requestor's commercial interest in disclosure. The Freedom of Information Officer shall ordinarily presume that where a news media requestor has satisfied the “public interest” standard, that will be the interest primarily served by disclosure to that requestor. Disclosure to data brokers or others who compile and market government information for direct economic return shall not be presumed to primarily serve “public interest.”</P>
            <P>(4) Where only a portion of the requested records satisfies both of the requirements for a waiver or reduction of fees under this paragraph, a waiver or reduction shall be granted only as to that portion.</P>
            <P>(5) Requests for the waiver or reduction of fees shall address each of the factors listed in paragraphs (e) (2) and (3) of this section, as they apply to each record request. One hundred pages of reproduction shall be furnished without charge.</P>
            <P>(6) A request for reduction or waiver of fees shall be addressed to the Freedom of Information Officer at the address shown in § 1120.23. The ATBCB office which is responding to the request for records shall initially determine whether the fee shall be reduced or waived and shall so inform the requestor. The initial determination may be appealed by letter addressed to the address shown in § 1120.23. The General Counsel or his or her designee shall decide such appeals.</P>

The Executive Director may seek a protective order authorizing the use of allegedly confidential materials on terms and conditions specified by the judge.</P>
            <P>(e) Complaints should be resolved informally and expeditiously, by the interested persons or agencies. If compliance with the applicable standards is not achieved informally or an impasse concerning the allegations of compliance or noncompliance is reached, the Executive Director will review the matter, including previous attempts by agencies to resolve the complaint, and take actions including, but not limited to, surveying and investigating buildings, monitoring compliance programs of agencies, furnishing technical assistance, such as standard interpretation, to agencies, and obtaining assurances, certifications, and plans of action as may be necessary to ensure compliance.</P>

            <P>(f) All actions to informally resolve complaints under paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section shall be completed within one hundred eighty <PRTPAGE P="307"/>(180) days after receipt of the complaint by all affected agencies and persons.

            <P>(2) Corrects the violation, or</P>
            <P>(3) Agrees in writing to implement specific compliance action within a definite time agreed to by the Executive Director, or</P>
            <P>(4) Are timely implementing a plan for compliance agreed to by the Executive Director.</P>
            <FP>No later than ten (10) days after the determination of the one hundred eighty (180) day period, the Executive Director shall either issue a citation under § 1150.42, or determine in writing that a citation will not be issued at that time and the reasons that it is considered unnecessary.</FP>
            <P>(g) A determination not to issue a citation shall be served in accordance with § 1150.23 on all interested agencies and persons upon whom a citation would have been served if it had been issued. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (i) of this section, the failure of the Executive Director to take action within the ten (10) day period after termination of the one hundred eighty (180) day informal resolution period shall not preclude the Executive Director from taking action thereafter.</P>

In issuing an order for PER, the judge shall make the following specific findings of fact and conclusions of law—</P>
            <P>(1) The Executive Director is likely to succeed on the merits of the proceedings;</P>
            <P>(2) The threatened injury or violation outweighs the threatened harm to the respondent if PER is granted; and</P>

            <P>(c) The judge may dismiss any citation or part of a citation seeking PER when the judge finds that the timely processing of a citation not requesting PER will adequately ensure the objectives of section 502 of the Rehabilitation Act and that immediate and irreparable harm caused by noncompliance with the standards or guidelines and requirements is not occurring or about to occur.</P>

When the Chair is a public member, the Vice-Chair shall be a Federal member; and when the Chair is a Federal member, the Vice-Chair shall be a public member. Upon the expiration of the term as Chair of a Federal member, the subsequent Chair shall be a public member; and vice versa.</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not—</P>
          <P>(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons; or</P>
          <P>(2) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1154.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his/her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods.</E> The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualfied handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Time period for compliance.</E> The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by September 4, 1987 except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by July 6, 1990, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop by January 6, 1988, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall <PRTPAGE P="322"/>provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—</P>
          <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped persons;</P>
          <P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;</P>
          <P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</P>
          <P>(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementatin of the plan.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Accessibility guidelines.</SUBJECT>

          <P>(a) The accessibility guidelines for buildings and facilities covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act are set forth in Appendices B and D to this part. The guidelines serve as the basis for accessibility standards adopted by the Department of Justice and the Department of Transportation under the Americans with Disabilities Act.

          <NOTE>
            <HD SOURCE="HED">Note 1 to paragraph (<E T="01">a</E>):</HD>

            <P>1. Advisory sections and figures that illustrate the technical requirements in Appendix D are available on the Internet at: <E T="03">www.access-board.gov.</E> The advisory sections provide guidance only and do not contain mandatory requirements.</P>

            <P>2. The Department of Justice adopted the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design (2010 Standards) as the regulatory standards for the new construction and alteration of facilities subject to its regulations under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), effective March 15, 2012. 28 CFR 35.151(c)(3), as amended at 75 FR 56163, September 15, 2010; and 28 CFR 36.406(a)(3), as amended at 75 FR 56236, September 15, 2010. For state and local governments, the 2010 Standards consist of the regulations at 28 CFR 35.151 and the versions of Appendices B and D to this part published in the 2009 edition of the Code of Federal Regulations. 28 CFR 35.104. For public accommodations and commercial facilities, the 2010 Standards consist of the regulations at 28 CFR part 36, subpart D and the versions of Appendices B and D to this part published in the 2009 edition of the Code of Federal Regulations. 28 CFR 36.104. Because Appendices B and D to this part, as published in the 2009 edition of the Code of Federal Regulations, were adopted by reference by the Department of Justice as part of the 2010 Standards for new construction and alteration of facilities subject to its ADA regulations, subsequent revisions to Appendices B and D by the Access Board are not included in the 2010 Standards and have no legal effect for facilities subject to its ADA regulations until adopted by the Department of Justice. Therefore, the public is cautioned not to use Appendices B and D to this part published in any edition of the Code of Federal Regulations after 2013, until such time as the later edition is adopted by the Department of Justice as a regulatory standard. Complete copies of the 2010 Standards can be obtained from the Department of Justice's ADA Web site at: <E T="03">http://www.ada.gov/2010ADAstandards_index.htm,</E> or by contacting the DOJ Information Line, at: 800-514-0301 (Voice) or 800-514-0383 (TTY).</P>

            <P>1. The Department of Transportation has adopted by reference Appendices B and D to this part with modifications as the regulatory standards for the construction and alteration of transportation facilities subject to its regulations under the Americans with Disabilities Act, effective November 29, 2006. 49 CFR 37.9 and Appendix A to 49 CFR part 37, as amended at 71 FR 63263, October 30, 2006; and corrected at 72 FR 11089, March 12, 2007.

          <HD SOURCE="HD1">ADA Chapter 1: Application and Administration</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">101 Purpose</HD>
          <P>101.1 General. This document contains scoping and technical requirements for accessibility to sites, facilities, buildings, and elements by individuals with disabilities. The requirements are to be applied during the design, construction, additions to, and alteration of sites, facilities, buildings, and elements to the extent required by regulations issued by Federal agencies under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA).</P>
          <P>101.2 Effect on Removal of Barriers in Existing Facilities. This document does not address existing facilities unless altered at the discretion of a covered entity. The Department of Justice has authority over existing facilities that are subject to the requirement for removal of barriers under title III of the ADA. Any determination that this document applies to existing facilities subject to the barrier removal requirement is solely within the discretion of the Department of Justice and is effective only to the extent required by regulations issued by the Department of Justice.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">102 Dimensions for Adults and Children</HD>
          <P>102.1 General. The technical requirements are based on adult dimensions and anthropometrics. In addition, this document includes technical requirements based on children's dimensions and anthropometrics for drinking fountains, water closets, toilet compartments, lavatories and sinks, dining surfaces, and work surfaces.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">103 Equivalent Facilitation</HD>
          <P>103.1 General. Nothing in these requirements prevents the use of designs, products, or technologies as alternatives to those prescribed, provided they result in substantially equivalent or greater accessibility and usability.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">104 Conventions</HD>
          <P>104.1 Dimensions. Dimensions that are not stated as “maximum” or “minimum” are absolute.</P>
          <P>104.1.1 Construction and Manufacturing Tolerances. All dimensions are subject to conventional industry tolerances except where the requirement is stated as a range with specific minimum and maximum end points.</P>
          <P>104.2 Calculation of Percentages. Where the required number of elements or facilities to be provided is determined by calculations of ratios or percentages and remainders or fractions result, the next greater whole number of such elements or facilities shall be provided. Where the determination of the required size or dimension of an element or facility involves ratios or percentages, rounding down for values less than one half shall be permitted.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">105 Referenced Standards</HD>

          <P>105.1 General. The standards listed in 105.2 are incorporated by reference in this document and are part of the requirements to the prescribed extent of each such reference.

          <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix F to Part 1191—Modifications Adopted by the Department of Transportation</HD>
          <P>The Department of Transportation has adopted by reference Appendices B and D to this part with modifications as the regulatory standards for the construction and alteration of transportation facilities subject to its regulations under the Americans with Disabilities Act, effective November 29, 2006. 49 CFR 37.9 and Appendix A to 49 CFR part 37, as amended at 71 FR 63263, October 30, 2006; and corrected at 72 FR 11089, March 12, 2007. The Department of Transportation has modified section 206.3 in Appendix B to this part; and sections 406, 810.2.2, and 810.5.3 in Appendix D to this part. The modified sections adopted by the Department of Transportation are reprinted in this appendix. Entities that are required to comply with the Department of Transportation's regulatory standards, must comply with modified sections adopted by the Department of Transportation that are reprinted in this appendix. The Department of Transportation has provided supplemental information on the modified sections in Appendix D to 49 CFR part 37.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">Modification to 206.3 of Appendix B</HD>
          <P>
            <E T="03">206.3 Location.</E> Accessible routes shall coincide with, or be located in the same area as general circulation paths. Where circulation paths are interior, required accessible routes shall also be interior. Elements such as ramps, elevators, or other circulation devices, fare vending or other ticketing areas, and fare collection areas shall be placed to minimize the distance which wheelchair users and other persons who cannot negotiate steps may have to travel compared to the general public.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">Modification to 406 of Appendix D</HD>
          <P>
            <E T="03">406.8 Detectable Warnings.</E> A curb ramp shall have a detectable warning complying with 705. The detectable warning shall extend the full width of the curb ramp (exclusive of flared sides) and shall extend either <PRTPAGE P="426"/>the full depth of the curb ramp or 24 inches (610 mm) deep minimum measured from the back of the curb on the ramp surface.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">Modification to 810.2.2 of Appendix D</HD>
          <P>
            <E T="03">810.2.2 Dimensions.</E> Bus boarding and alighting areas shall provide a clear length of 96 inches (2440 mm), measured perpendicular to the curb or vehicle roadway edge, and a clear width of 60 inches (1525 mm), measured parallel to the vehicle roadway. Public entities shall ensure that the construction of bus boarding and alighting areas comply with 810.2.2, to the extent the construction specifications are within their control.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">Modification to 810.5.3 of Appendix D</HD>
          <P>
            <E T="03">810.5.3 Platform and Vehicle Floor Coordination.</E> Station platforms shall be positioned to coordinate with vehicles in accordance with the applicable requirements of 36 CFR part 1192. Low-level platforms shall be 8 inches (205 mm) minimum above top of rail. In light rail, commuter rail, and intercity rail systems where it is not operationally or structurally feasible to meet the horizontal gap or vertical difference requirements of part 1192 or 49 CFR part 38, mini-high platforms, car-borne or platform-mounted lifts, ramps or bridge plates or similarly manually deployed devices, meeting the requirements of 49 CFR part 38, shall suffice.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="04">Exception:</E> Where vehicles are boarded from sidewalks or street-level, low-level platforms shall be permitted to be less than 8 inches (205 mm).</P>

Space to accommodate wheelchairs and mobility aids may be provided within the normal area used by standees and designation of specific spaces is not required.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Exception.</E> If lifts, ramps or bridge plates meeting the requirements of this section are provided on station platforms or other stops, or mini-high platforms complying with § 1192.73(d) are provided, at stations or stops required to be accessible by 49 CFR part 37, the vehicle is not required to be equipped with a car-borne device. Where each new vehicle is compatible with a single platform-mounted access system or device, additional systems or devices are not required for each vehicle provided that the single device could be used to provide access to each new vehicle if passengers using wheelchairs or mobility aids could not be accommodated on a single vehicle.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Vehicle lift</E>—(1) <E T="03">Design load.</E> The design load of the lift shall be at least 600 pounds. Working parts, such as cables, pulleys, and shafts, which can be expected to wear, and upon which the lift depends for support of the load, shall have a safety factor of at least six, based on the ultimate strength of the material. Nonworking parts, such as platform, frame, and attachment hardware which would not be expected to wear, shall have a safety factor of at least three, based on the ultimate strength of the material.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Controls</E>—(i) <E T="03">Requirements.</E> The controls shall be interlocked with the vehicle brakes, propulsion system, or door, or shall provide other appropriate mechanisms or systems, to ensure that the vehicle cannot be moved when the lift is not stowed and so the lift cannot be deployed unless the interlocks or systems are engaged. The lift shall deploy to all levels (i.e., ground, curb, and intermediate positions) normally encountered in the operating environment. Where provided, each control for deploying, lowering, raising, and stowing the lift and lowering the roll-off barrier shall be of a momentary contact type requiring continuous manual pressure by the operator and shall not allow improper lift sequencing when the lift platform is occupied. The controls shall allow reversal of the lift operation sequence, such as raising or lowering a platform that is part way down, without allowing an occupied platform to fold or retract into the stowed position.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Exception.</E> Where physical or safety constraints prevent the deployment at some stops of a lift having its long dimension perpendicular to the vehicle axis, the transportation entity may specify a lift which is designed to deploy with its long dimension parallel to the vehicle axis and which pivots into or out of the vehicle while occupied (i.e., “rotary lift”). The requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section prohibiting the lift from being stowed while occupied shall not apply to a lift design of this type if the stowed position is within the passenger compartment and the lift is intended to be stowed while occupied.<PRTPAGE P="433"/>
            </P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Exception.</E> The brake or propulsion system interlocks requirement does not apply to a station platform mounted lift provided that a mechanical, electrical or other system operates to ensure that vehicles do not move when the lift is in use.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Emergency operation.</E> The lift shall incorporate an emergency method of deploying, lowering to ground level with a lift occupant, and raising and stowing the empty lift if the power to the lift fails. No emergency method, manual or otherwise, shall be capable of being operated in a manner that could be hazardous to the lift occupant or to the operator when operated according to manufacturer's instructions, and shall not permit the platform to be stowed or folded when occupied, unless the lift is a rotary lift intended to be stowed while occupied.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Power or equipment failure.</E> Lift platforms stowed in a vertical position, and deployed platforms when occupied, shall have provisions to prevent their deploying, falling, or folding any faster than 12 inches/second or their dropping of an occupant in the event of a single failure of any load carrying component.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Platform barriers.</E> The lift platform shall be equipped with barriers to prevent any of the wheels of a wheelchair or mobility aid from rolling off the lift during its operation. A movable barrier or inherent design feature shall prevent a wheelchair or mobility aid from rolling off the edge closest to the vehicle until the lift is in its fully raised position. Each side of the lift platform which extends beyond the vehicle in its raised position shall have a barrier a minimum 1<FR>1/2</FR> inches high. Such barriers shall not interfere with maneuvering into or out of the aisle. The loading-edge barrier (outer barrier) which functions as a loading ramp when the lift is at ground level, shall be sufficient when raised or closed, or a supplementary system shall be provided, to prevent a power wheelchair or mobility aid from riding over or defeating it. The outer barrier of the lift shall automatically rise or close, or a supplementary system shall automatically engage, and remain raised, closed, or engaged at all times that the lift is more than 3 inches above the station platform or roadway and the lift is occupied. Alternatively, a barrier or system may be raised, lowered, opened, closed, engaged or disengaged by the lift operator provided an interlock or inherent design feature prevents the lift from rising unless the barrier is raised or closed or the supplementary system is engaged.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Platform surface.</E> The lift platform surface shall be free of any protrusions over <FR>1/4</FR> inch high and shall be slip resistant. The lift platform shall have a minimum clear width of 28<FR>1/2</FR> inches at the platform, a minimum clear width of 30 inches measured from 2 inches above the lift platform surface to 30 inches above the surface, and a minimum clear length of 48 inches measured from 2 inches above the surface of the platform to 30 inches above the surface. (See Fig. 1)</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Platform gaps.</E> Any openings between the lift platform surface and the raised barriers shall not exceed <FR>5/8</FR> inch wide. When the lift is at vehicle floor height with the inner barrier (if applicable) down or retracted, gaps between the forward lift platform edge and vehicle floor shall not exceed <FR>1/2</FR> inch horizontally and <FR>5/8</FR> inch vertically. Platforms on semiautomatic lifts may have a hand hold not exceeding 1<FR>1/2</FR> inches by 4<FR>1/2</FR> inches located between the edge barriers.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Platform entrance ramp.</E> The entrance ramp, or loading-edge barrier used as a ramp, shall not exceed a slope of 1:8 measured on level ground, for a maximum rise of 3 inches, and the transition from the station platform or roadway to ramp may be vertical without edge treatment up to <FR>1/4</FR> inch. Thresholds between <FR>1/4</FR> inch and <FR>1/2</FR> inch high shall be beveled with a slope no greater than 1:2.</P>
            <P>(9) <E T="03">Platform deflection.</E> The lift platform (not including the entrance ramp) shall not deflect more than 3 degrees (exclusive of vehicle roll) in any direction between its unloaded position and its position when loaded with 600 pounds applied through a 26 inch by 26 inch test pallet at the centroid of the lift platform.</P>
            <P>(10) <E T="03">Platform movement.</E> No part of the platform shall move at a rate exceeding 6 inches/second during lowering and <PRTPAGE P="434"/>lifting an occupant, and shall not exceed 12 inches/second during deploying or stowing. This requirement does not apply to the deployment or stowage cycles of lifts that are manually deployed or stowed. The maximum platform horizontal and vertical acceleration when occupied shall be 0.3g.</P>
            <P>(11) <E T="03">Boarding direction.</E> The lift shall permit both inboard and outboard facing of wheelchairs and mobility aids.</P>
            <P>(12) <E T="03">Use by standees.</E> Lifts shall accommodate persons using walkers, crutches, canes or braces or who otherwise have difficulty using steps. The lift may be marked to indicate a preferred standing position.</P>
            <P>(13) <E T="03">Handrails.</E> Platforms on lifts shall be equipped with handrails, on two sides, which move in tandem with the lift which shall be graspable and provide support to standees throughout the entire lift operation. Handrails shall have a usable component at least 8 inches long with the lowest portion a minimum 30 inches above the platform and the highest portion a maximum 38 inches above the platform. The handrails shall be capable of withstanding a force of 100 pounds concentrated at any point on the handrail without permanent deformation of the rail or its supporting structure. Handrails shall have a cross-sectional diameter between 1<FR>1/4</FR> inches and 1<FR>1/2</FR> inches or shall provide an equivalent grasping surface, and have eased edges with corner radii of not less than <FR>1/8</FR> inch.

            <SUBJECT>Mobility aid accessibility.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a)(1) <E T="03">General.</E> All new commuter rail cars, other than level entry cars, covered by this subpart shall provide a level-change mechanism or boarding device (e.g., lift, ramp or bridge plate) complying with either paragraph (b) or (c) of this section; sufficient clearances to permit a wheelchair or mobility aid user to reach a seating location; and at least two wheelchair or mobility aid seating locations complying with paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Exception.</E> If portable or platform lifts, ramps or bridge plates meeting the applicable requirements of this section are provided on station platforms or other stops, or mini-high platforms complying with § 1192.93(d) are provided, at stations or stops required to be accessible by 49 CFR part 37, the car is not required to be equipped with a car-borne device. Where each new car is compatible with a single platform-mounted access system or device, additional systems or devices are not required for each car provided that the single device could be used to provide access to each new car if passengers using wheelchairs or mobility aids could not be accommodated on a single car.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Car Lift</E>—(1) <E T="03">Design load.</E> The design load of the lift shall be at least 600 pounds. Working parts, such as cables, pulleys, and shafts, which can be expected to wear, and upon which the lift depends for support of the load, shall have a safety factor of at least six, based on the ultimate strength of the material. Nonworking parts, such as platform, frame, and attachment hardware which would not be expected to wear, shall have a safety factor of at least three, based on the ultimate strength of the material.<PRTPAGE P="437"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Controls</E>—(i) <E T="03">Requirements.</E> The controls shall be interlocked with the car brakes, propulsion system, or door, or shall provide other appropriate mechanisms or systems, to ensure that the car cannot be moved when the lift is not stowed and so the lift cannot be deployed unless the interlocks or systems are engaged. The lift shall deploy to all platform levels normally encountered in the operating environment. Where provided, each control for deploying, lowering, raising, and stowing the lift and lowering the roll-off barrier shall be of a momentary contact type requiring continuous manual pressure by the operator and shall not allow improper lift sequencing when the lift platform is occupied. The controls shall allow reversal of the lift operation sequence, such as raising or lowering a platform that is part way down, without allowing an occupied platform to fold or retract into the stowed position.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Exception.</E> Where physical or safety constraints prevent the deployment at some stops of a lift having its long dimension perpendicular to the car axis, the transportation entity may specify a lift which is designed to deploy with its long dimension parallel to the car axis and which pivots into or out of the car while occupied (i.e., “rotary lift”). The requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section prohibiting the lift from being stowed while occupied shall not apply to a lift design of this type if the stowed position is within the passenger compartment and the lift is intended to be stowed while occupied.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Exception.</E> The brake or propulsion system interlock requirement does not apply to a platform mounted or portable lift provided that a mechanical, electrical or other system operates to ensure that cars do not move when the lift is in use.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Emergency operation.</E> The lift shall incorporate an emergency method of deploying, lowering to ground or platform level with a lift occupant, and raising and stowing the empty lift if the power to the lift fails. No emergency method, manual or otherwise, shall be capable of being operated in a manner that could be hazardous to the lift occupant or to the operator when operated according to manufacturer's instructions, and shall not permit the platform to be stowed or folded when occupied, unless the lift is a rotary lift intended to be stowed while occupied.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Power or equipment failure.</E> Platforms stowed in a vertical position, and deployed platforms when occupied, shall have provisions to prevent their deploying, falling, or folding any faster than 12 inches/second or their dropping of an occupant in the event of a single failure of any load carrying component.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Platform barriers.</E> The lift platform shall be equipped with barriers to prevent any of the wheels of a wheelchair or mobility aid from rolling off the lift during its operation. A movable barrier or inherent design feature shall prevent a wheelchair or mobility aid from rolling off the edge closest to the car until the lift is in its fully raised position. Each side of the lift platform which, in its raised position, extends beyond the car shall have a barrier a minimum 1<FR>1/2</FR> inches high. Such barriers shall not interfere with maneuvering into or out of the car. The loading-edge barrier (outer barrier) which functions as a loading ramp when the lift is at ground or station platform level, shall be sufficient when raised or closed, or a supplementary system shall be provided, to prevent a power wheelchair or mobility aid from riding over or defeating it. The outer barrier of the lift shall automatically rise or close, or a supplementary system shall automatically engage, and remain raised, closed, or engaged at all times that the lift platform is more than 3 inches above the station platform and the lift is occupied. Alternatively, a barrier or system may be raised, lowered, opened, closed, engaged or disengaged by the lift operator provided an interlock or inherent design feature prevents the lift from rising unless the barrier is raised or closed or the supplementary system is engaged.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Platform surface.</E> The lift platform surface shall be free of any protrusions over <FR>1/4</FR> inch high and shall be slip resistant. The lift platform shall have a minimum clear width of 28<FR>1/2</FR> inches at the platform, a minimum clear width of 30 inches measured from 2 inches above the lift platform surface to 30 <PRTPAGE P="438"/>inches above the surface, and a minimum clear length of 48 inches measured from 2 inches above the surface of the platform to 30 inches above the surface. (See Fig. 1)</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Platform gaps.</E> Any openings between the lift platform surface and the raised barriers shall not exceed <FR>5/8</FR> inch wide. When the lift is at car floor height with the inner barrier down (if applicable) or retracted, gaps between the forward lift platform edge and car floor shall not exceed <FR>1/2</FR> inch horizontally and <FR>5/8</FR> inch vertically. Platforms on semi-automatic lifts may have a hand hold not exceeding 1<FR>1/2</FR> inches by 4<FR>1/2</FR> inches located between the edge barriers.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Platform entrance ramp.</E> The entrance ramp, or loading-edge barrier used as a ramp, shall not exceed a slope of 1:8, when measured on level ground, for a maximum rise of 3 inches, and the transition from station platform to ramp may be vertical without edge treatment up to <FR>1/4</FR> inch. Thresholds between <FR>1/4</FR> inch and <FR>1/2</FR> inch high shall be beveled with a slope no greater than 1:2.</P>
            <P>(9) <E T="03">Platform deflection.</E> The lift platform (not including the entrance ramp) shall not deflect more than 3 degrees (exclusive of vehicle roll) in any direction between its unloaded position and its position when loaded with 600 pounds applied through a 26 inch by 26 inch test pallet at the centroid of the lift platform.</P>
            <P>(10) <E T="03">Platform movement.</E> No part of the platform shall move at a rate exceeding 6 inches/second during lowering and lifting an occupant, and shall not exceed 12 inches/second during deploying or stowing. This requirement does not apply to the deployment or stowage cycles of lifts that are manually deployed or stowed. The maximum platform horizontal and vertical acceleration when occupied shall be 0.3g.</P>
            <P>(11) <E T="03">Boarding direction.</E> The lift shall permit both inboard and outboard facing of wheelchairs and mobility aids.</P>
            <P>(12) <E T="03">Use by standees.</E> Lifts shall accommodate persons using walkers, crutches, canes or braces or who otherwise have difficulty using steps. The lift may be marked to indicate a preferred standing position.</P>
            <P>(13) <E T="03">Handrails.</E> Platforms on lifts shall be equipped with handrails, on two sides, which move in tandem with the lift which shall be graspable and provide support to standees throughout the entire lift operation. Handrails shall have a usable component at least 8 inches long with the lowest portion a minimum 30 inches above the platform and the highest portion a maximum 38 inches above the platform. The handrails shall be capable of withstanding a force of 100 pounds concentrated at any point on the handrail without permanent deformation of the rail or its supporting structure. The handrail shall have a cross-sectional diameter between 1<FR>1/4</FR> inches and 1<FR>1/2</FR> inches or shall provide an equivalent grasping surface, and have eased edges with corner radii of not less than <FR>1/8</FR> inch. Handrails shall be placed to provide a minimum 1<FR>1/2</FR> inches knuckle clearance from the nearest adjacent surface. Handrails shall not interfere with wheelchair or mobility aid maneuverability when entering or leaving the car.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Car ramp or bridge plate</E>—(1) <E T="03">Design load.</E> Ramps or bridge plates 30 inches or longer shall support a load of 600 pounds, placed at the centroid of the ramp or bridge plate distributed over an area of 26 inches by 26 inches, with a safety factor of at least 3 based on the ultimate strength of the material. Ramps or bridge plates shorter than 30 inches shall support a load of 300 pounds.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Ramp surface.</E> The ramp or bridge plate surface shall be continuous and slip resistant, shall not have protrusions from the surface greater than <FR>1/4</FR> inch high, shall have a clear width of 30 inches and shall accommodate both four-wheel and three-wheel mobility aids.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Ramp threshold.</E> The transition from station platform to the ramp or bridge plate and the transition from car floor to the ramp or bridge plate may be vertical without edge treatment up to <FR>1/4</FR> inch. Changes in level between <FR>1/4</FR> inch and <FR>1/2</FR> inch shall be beveled with a slope no greater than 1:2.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Ramp barriers.</E> Each side of the ramp or bridge plate shall have barriers at least 2 inches high to prevent mobility aid wheels from slipping off.<PRTPAGE P="439"/>
            </P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Slope.</E> Ramps or bridge plates shall have the least slope practicable. If the height of the vehicle floor, under 50% passenger load, from which the ramp is deployed is 3 inches or less above the station platform a maximum slope of 1:4 is permitted; if the height of the vehicle floor, under 50% passenger load, from which the ramp is deployed is 6 inches or less, but more than 3 inches, above the station platform a maximum slope of 1:6 is permitted; if the height of the vehicle floor, under 50% passenger load, from which the ramp is deployed is 9 inches or less, but more than 6 inches, above the station platform a maximum slope of 1:8 is permitted; if the height of the vehicle floor, under 50% passenger load, from which the ramp is deployed is greater than 9 inches above the station platform a slope of 1:12 shall be achieved. Folding or telescoping ramps are permitted provided they meet all structural requirements of this section.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Attachment</E>—(i) <E T="03">Requirement.</E> When in use for boarding or alighting, the ramp or bridge plate shall be attached to the vehicle, or otherwise prevented from moving such that it is not subject to displacement when loading or unloading a heavy power mobility aid and that any gaps between vehicle and ramp or bridge plates, and station platform and ramp or bridge plate, shall not exceed <FR>5/8</FR> inch.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Exception.</E> Ramps or bridge plates which are attached to, and deployed from, station platforms are permitted in lieu of car devices provided they meet the displacement requirements of paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Stowage.</E> A compartment, securement system, or other appropriate method shall be provided to ensure that stowed ramps or bridge plates, including portable ramps or bridge plates stowed in the passenger area, do not impinge on a passenger's wheelchair or mobility aid or pose any hazard to passengers in the event of a sudden stop.</P>

            <P>(a)(1) <E T="03">General.</E> All intercity rail cars, other than level entry cars, required to be accessible by § 1192.111 (a) and (e) of this subpart shall provide a level-change mechanism or boarding device (e.g., lift, ramp or bridge plate) complying with either paragraph (b) or (c) of this section and sufficient clearances to permit a wheelchair or other mobility aid user to reach a seating location complying with paragraph (d) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="444"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Exception.</E> If portable or platform lifts, ramps or bridge plates meeting the applicable requirements of this section are provided on station platforms or other stops, or mini-high platforms complying with § 1192.113(d) are provided, at stations or stops required to be accessible by 49 CFR part 37, the car is not required to be equipped with a car-borne device.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Car Lift</E>—(1) <E T="03">Design load.</E> The design load of the lift shall be at least 600 pounds. Working parts, such as cables, pulleys, and shafts, which can be expected to wear, and upon which the lift depends for support of the load, shall have a safety factor of at least six, based on the ultimate strength of the material. Nonworking parts, such as platform, frame, and attachment hardware which would not be expected to wear, shall have a safety factor of at least three, based on the ultimate strength of the material.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Controls</E>—(i) <E T="03">Requirements.</E> The controls shall be interlocked with the car brakes, propulsion system, or door, or shall provide other appropriate mechanisms or systems, to ensure that the car cannot be moved when the lift is not stowed and so the lift cannot be deployed unless the interlocks or systems are engaged. The lift shall deploy to all platform levels normally encountered in the operating environment. Where provided, each control for deploying, lowering, raising, and stowing the lift and lowering the roll-off barrier shall be of a momentary contact type requiring continuous manual pressure by the operator and shall not allow improper lift sequencing when the lift platform is occupied. The controls shall allow reversal of the lift operation sequence, such as raising or lowering a platform that is part way down, without allowing an occupied platform to fold or retract into the stowed position.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Exception.</E> Where physical or safety constraints prevent the deployment at some stops of a lift having its long dimension perpendicular to the car axis, the transportation entity may specify a lift which is designed to deploy with its long dimension parallel to the car axis and which pivots into or out of the car while occupied (i.e., “rotary lift”). The requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section prohibiting the lift from being stowed while occupied shall not apply to a lift design of this type if the stowed position is within the passenger compartment and the lift is intended to be stowed while occupied.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Exception.</E> The brake or propulsion system interlocks requirement does not apply to platform mounted or portable lifts provided that a mechanical, electrical or other system operates to ensure that cars do not move when the lift is in use.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Emergency operation.</E> The lift shall incorporate an emergency method of deploying, lowering to ground or station platform level with a lift occupant, and raising and stowing the empty lift if the power to the lift fails. No emergency method, manual or otherwise, shall be capable of being operated in a manner that could be hazardous to the lift occupant or to the operator when operated according to manufacturer's instructions, and shall not permit the platform to be stowed or folded when occupied, unless the lift is a rotary lift and is intended to be stowed while occupied.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Power or equipment failure.</E> Platforms stowed in a vertical position, and deployed platforms when occupied, shall have provisions to prevent their deploying, failing, or folding any faster than 12 inches/second or their dropping of an occupant in the event of a single failure of any load carrying component.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Platform barriers.</E> The lift platform shall be equipped with barriers to prevent any of the wheels of a wheelchair or mobility aid from rolling off the lift during its operation. A movable barrier or inherent design feature shall prevent a wheelchair or mobility aid from rolling off the edge closest to the car until the lift is in its fully raised position. Each side of the lift platform which, in its raised position, extends beyond the car shall have a barrier a minimum 1<FR>1/2</FR> inches high. Such barriers shall not interfere with maneuvering into or out of the car. The loading-edge barrier (outer barrier) which functions as a loading ramp when the lift is at ground or station platform level, shall be sufficient when raised or closed, or a supplementary system <PRTPAGE P="445"/>shall be provided, to prevent a power wheelchair or mobility aid from riding over or defeating it. The outer barrier of the lift shall automatically rise or close, or a supplementary system shall automatically engage, and remain raised, closed, or engaged at all times that the lift platform is more than 3 inches above the station platform and the lift is occupied. Alternatively, a barrier or system may be raised, lowered, opened, closed, engaged or disengaged by the lift operator provided an interlock or inherent design feature prevents the lift from rising unless the barrier is raised or closed or the supplementary system is engaged.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Platform surface.</E> The lift platform surface shall be free of any protrusions over <FR>1/4</FR> inch high and shall be slip resistant. The lift platform shall have a minimum clear width of 28<FR>1/2</FR> inches at the platform, a minimum clear width of 30 inches measured from 2 inches above the lift platform surface to 30 inches above the surface, and a minimum clear length of 48 inches measured from 2 inches above the surface of the platform to 30 inches above the surface. (See Fig. 1.)</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Platform gaps.</E> Any openings between the lift platform surface and the raised barriers shall not exceed <FR>5/8</FR> inch wide. When the lift is at car floor height with the inner barrier (if applicable) down or retracted, gaps between the forward lift platform edge and car floor shall not exceed <FR>1/2</FR> inch horizontally and <FR>5/8</FR> inch vertically. Platforms on semi-automatic lifts may have a hand hold not exceeding 1<FR>1/2</FR> inches by 4<FR>1/2</FR> inches located between the edge barriers.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Platform entrance ramp.</E> The entrance ramp, or loading-edge barrier used as a ramp, shall not exceed a slope of 1:8, when measured on level ground, for a maximum rise of 3 inches, and the transition from station platform to ramp may be vertical without edge treatment up to <FR>1/4</FR> inch. Thresholds between <FR>1/4</FR> inch and <FR>1/2</FR> inch high shall be beveled with a slope no greater than 1:2.</P>
            <P>(9) <E T="03">Platform deflection.</E> The lift platform (not including the entrance ramp) shall not deflect more than 3 degrees (exclusive of car roll) in any direction between its unloaded position and its position when loaded with 600 pounds applied through a 26 inch by 26 inch test pallet at the centroid of the lift platform.</P>
            <P>(10) <E T="03">Platform movement.</E> No part of the platform shall move at a rate exceeding 6 inches/second during lowering and lifting an occupant, and shall not exceed 12 inches/second during deploying or stowing. This requirement does not apply to the deployment or stowage cycles of lifts that are manually deployed or stowed. The maximum platform horizontal and vertical acceleration when occupied shall be 0.3g.</P>
            <P>(11) <E T="03">Boarding direction.</E> The lift shall permit both inboard and outboard facing of wheelchairs and mobility aids.</P>
            <P>(12) <E T="03">Use by standees.</E> Lifts shall accommodate persons using walkers, crutches, canes or braces or who otherwise have difficulty using steps. The lift may be marked to indicate a preferred standing position.</P>
            <P>(13) <E T="03">Handrails.</E> Platforms on lifts shall be equipped with handrails, on two sides, which move in tandem with the lift, and which shall be graspable and provide support to standees throughout the entire lift operation. Handrails shall have a usable component at least 8 inches long with the lowest portion a minimum 30 inches above the platform and the highest portion a maximum 38 inches above the platform. The handrails shall be capable of withstanding a force of 100 pounds concentrated at any point on the handrail without permanent deformation of the rail or its supporting structure. The handrail shall have a cross-sectional diameter between 1<FR>1/4</FR> inches and 1<FR>1/2</FR> inches or shall provide an equivalent grasping surface, and have eased edges with corner radii of not less than <FR>1/8</FR> inch. Handrails shall be placed to provide a minimum 1<FR>1/2</FR> inches knuckle clearance from the nearest adjacent surface. Handrails shall not interfere with wheelchair or mobility aid maneuverability when entering or leaving the car.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Car ramp or bridge plate</E>—(1) <E T="03">Design load.</E> Ramps or bridge plates 30 inches or longer shall support a load of 600 pounds, placed at the centroid of the ramp or bridge plate distributed over an area of 26 inches by 26 inches, with a safety factor of at least 3 based on <PRTPAGE P="446"/>the ultimate strength of the material. Ramps or bridge plates shorter than 30 inches shall support a load of 300 pounds.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Ramp surface.</E> The ramp or bridge plate surface shall be continuous and slip resistant, shall not have protrusions from the surface greater than <FR>1/4</FR> inch high, shall have a clear width of 30 inches and shall accommodate both four-wheel and three-wheel mobility aids.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Ramp threshold.</E> The transition from station platform to the ramp or bridge plate and the transition from car floor to the ramp or bridge plate may be vertical without edge treatment up to <FR>1/4</FR> inch.

          </FP>

          <P>The purpose of this part is to implement section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 794d). Section 508 requires that when Federal agencies develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology, Federal employees with disabilities have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access and use by Federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency. Section 508 also requires that individuals with disabilities, who are members of the public seeking information or services from a Federal agency, have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that provided to the public who are not individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency.

          </FP>
          <P>(a) Products covered by this part shall comply with all applicable provisions of this part. When developing, procuring, maintaining, or using electronic and information technology, each agency shall ensure that the products comply with the applicable provisions of this part, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency.</P>
          <P>(1) When compliance with the provisions of this part imposes an undue burden, agencies shall provide individuals with disabilities with the information and data involved by an alternative means of access that allows the individual to use the information and data.</P>
          <P>(2) When procuring a product, if an agency determines that compliance with any provision of this part imposes an undue burden, the documentation by the agency supporting the procurement shall explain why, and to what extent, compliance with each such provision creates an undue burden.</P>
          <P>(b) When procuring a product, each agency shall procure products which comply with the provisions in this part when such products are available in the commercial marketplace or when such products are developed in response to a Government solicitation. Agencies cannot claim a product as a whole is nt commercially available because no product in the marketplace meets all the standards. If products are commercially available that meet some but not all of the standards, the agency must procure the product that best meets the standards.</P>

          <P>(c) Except as provided by § 1194.3(b), this part applies to electronic and information technology developed, procured, maintained, or used by agencies directly or used by a contractor under a contract with an agency which requires the use of such product, or requires the use, to a significant extent, of such product in the performance of a service or the furnishing of a product.

          <P>(a) This part does not apply to any electronic and information technology operated by agencies, the function, operation, or use of which involves intelligence activities, cryptologic activities related to national security, command and control of military forces, equipment that is an integral part of a weapon or weapons system, or systems which are critical to the direct fulfillment of military or intelligence missions. Systems which are critical to the direct fulfillment of military or intelligence missions do not include a system that is to be used for routine administrative and business applications (including payroll, finance, logistics, and personnel management applications).</P>
          <P>(b) This part does not apply to electronic and information technology that is acquired by a contractor incidental to a contract.</P>
          <P>(c) Except as required to comply with the provisions in this part, this part does not require the installation of specific accessibility-related software or the attachment of an assistive technology device at a workstation of a Federal employee who is not an individual with a disability.</P>

          <P>(d) When agencies provide access to the public to information or data through electronic and information technology, agencies are not required to make products owned by the agency available for access and use by individuals with disabilities at a location other than that where the electronic and information technology is provided to the public, or to purchase products for access and use by individuals with disabilities at a location other than that where the electronic and information technology is provided to the public.<PRTPAGE P="478"/>
          </P>
          <P>(e) This part shall not be construed to require a fundamental alteration in the nature of a product or its components.</P>

              <P>(b) These regulations provide that NARA will attempt to collect debts owed to it or other Government agencies either directly, or by other means including salary, administrative, tax refund offsets, or administrative wage garnishment.</P>
              <P>(c) These regulations also provide that NARA may enter a cross-servicing agreement with the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) under which the Treasury will take authorized action to collect amounts owed to NARA.</P>

              <P>NARA uses the services of a private collection contractor where it determines that such use is in NARA's best interest. When NARA determines that there is a need to contract for collection services, NARA:</P>
              <P>(a) Retains sole authority to:</P>
              <P>(1) Resolve any dispute with the debtor regarding the validity of the debt;</P>
              <P>(2) Compromise the debt;</P>
              <P>(3) Suspend or terminate collection action;</P>
              <P>(4) Refer the debt to the DOJ for litigation; and</P>
              <P>(5) Take any other action under this part;</P>
              <P>(b) Requires the contractor to comply with the:</P>
              <P>(1) Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, to the extent specified in 5 U.S.C. 552a(m);</P>
              <P>(2) Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (15 U.S.C. 1692-1692o); and</P>
              <P>(3) Other applicable Federal and State laws pertaining to debt collection practices and applicable regulations of NARA in this part;</P>
              <P>(c) Requires the contractor to account accurately and fully for all amounts collected; and</P>
              <P>(d) Requires the contractor to provide to NARA, upon request, all data and reports contained in its files related to its collection actions on a debt.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What should I expect to receive from NARA if I owe a debt to NARA?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) NARA will send you a written notice when we determine that you owe a debt to NARA. The notice will be hand-delivered or sent to you at the most current address known to NARA. The notice will inform you of the following:</P>
              <P>(1) The amount, nature, and basis of the debt;</P>
              <P>(2) That a designated NARA official has reviewed the claim and determined that it is valid;</P>
              <P>(3) That payment of the debt is due as of the date of the notice, and that the debt will be considered delinquent if you do not pay it within 30 days of the date of the notice;</P>

              <P>(4) NARA's policy concerning interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs (<E T="03">see</E> § 1201.18), including a statement that such assessments must be made against you unless excused in accordance with the FCCS and this part;<PRTPAGE P="512"/>
              </P>
              <P>(5) That you have the right to inspect and copy disclosable NARA records pertaining to your debt, or to receive copies of those records if personal inspection is impractical;</P>

              <P>(6) That you have the opportunity to enter into an agreement, in writing and signed by both you and the designated NARA official, for voluntary repayment of the debt (<E T="03">see</E> § 1201.19);</P>
              <P>(7) The address, telephone number, and name of the NARA official available to discuss the debt;</P>

              <P>(8) Possible collection actions that might be taken if the debt is not paid within 60 days of the notice, or arrangements to pay the debt are not made within 60 days of the notice (<E T="03">see</E> § 1201.15 for a fuller description of possible actions);</P>
              <P>(9) That NARA may suspend or revoke any licenses, permits, or other privileges for failure to pay a debt; and</P>

              <P>(10) Information on your opportunity to obtain a review of the debt (<E T="03">see</E> § 1201.16).</P>
              <P>(b) NARA will respond promptly to communications from you.</P>

              <P>(c) Exception to entitlement to notice, hearing, written responses, and final decisions. With respect to the regulations covering internal salary offset collections (<E T="03">see</E> § 1230.32), NARA excepts from the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section—</P>
              <P>(1) Any adjustment to pay arising out of an employee's election of coverage or a change in coverage under a Federal benefits program requiring periodic deductions from pay, if the amount to be recovered was accumulated over 4 pay periods or less;</P>
              <P>(2) A routine intra-agency adjustment of pay that is made to correct an overpayment of pay attributable to clerical or administrative errors or delays in processing pay documents, if the overpayment occurred within the 4 pay periods preceding the adjustment and, at the time of such adjustment, or as soon thereafter as practical, the individual is provided written notice of the nature and the amount of the adjustment and point of contact for contesting such adjustment; or</P>
              <P>(3) Any adjustment to collect a debt amounting to $50 or less, if, at the time of such adjustment, or as soon thereafter as practical, the individual is provided written notice of the nature and the amount of the adjustment and a point of contact for contesting such adjustment.</P>

              <P>The notice provided under § 1201.14 will advise you that within 60 days of the date of the notice, your debt (including any interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs) must be paid or you must enter into a voluntary repayment agreement. If you do not pay the debt or enter into the agreement within that deadline, NARA may enforce collection of the debt by any or all of the following methods:</P>
              <P>(a) By referral to a credit reporting agency (<E T="03">see</E> § 1201.12), private collection contractor (<E T="03">see</E> § 1201.13), or the DOJ (<E T="03">see</E> § 1201.11).</P>

              <P>(b) By transferring any debt to the Treasury for collection, including under a cross-servicing agreement with the Treasury (<E T="03">see</E> § 1201.10).</P>

              <P>(c) If you are a NARA employee, by deducting money from your disposable pay account until the debt (and all accumulated interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs) is paid in full (<E T="03">see</E> subpart C of this part). NARA will specify the amount, frequency, approximate beginning date, and duration of the deduction. 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 31 U.S.C. 3716 govern such proceedings;</P>

              <P>(d) If you are an employee of a Federal agency other than NARA, by initiating certification procedures to implement a salary offset by that Federal agency (<E T="03">see</E> subpart C of this part). 5 U.S.C. 5514 governs such proceedings;</P>

              <P>(e) By referring the debt to the Treasury for offset against any refund of overpayment of tax (<E T="03">see</E> subpart D of this part);</P>
              <P>(f) By administrative offset (<E T="03">see</E> subpart E of this part);</P>
              <P>(g) By administrative wage garnishment (<E T="03">see</E> subpart F of this part); or</P>

              <P>(h) By liquidation of security or collateral. NARA has the right to hold security or collateral, liquidate it, and apply the proceeds to your debt through the exercise of a power of sale <PRTPAGE P="513"/>in the security instrument or a foreclosure. NARA will not follow the procedures in this paragraph (h) if the cost of disposing the collateral will be disproportionate to its value.</P>

              <P>(a) The name, address, and telephone number of a NARA official whom you may contact concerning procedures for requesting a review;</P>
              <P>(b) The method and time period for requesting a review;</P>

              <P>(f) That any knowingly false or frivolous statements, representations, or evidence may subject you to:</P>
              <P>(1) Disciplinary procedures appropriate under 5 U.S.C. Chapter 75, 5 CFR part 752, or any other applicable statute or regulations;</P>
              <P>(2) Penalties under the False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. 3729-3733) or any other applicable statutory authority; and</P>

              <SUBJECT>What must I do to obtain a review of my debt, and how will the review process work?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Request for review.</E> (1) You have the right to request a review by NARA of the existence or amount of your debt, the proposed schedule for offset of Federal employee salary payments, or whether the debt is past due or legally enforceable. If you want a review, you must send a written request to the NARA official designated in the notice (<E T="03">see</E> § 1201.16(d)).</P>
              <P>(2) You must sign your request for review and fully identify and explain with reasonable specificity all the facts, evidence, and witnesses that support your position. Your request for review should be accompanied by available evidence to support your contentions.</P>
              <P>(3) Your request for review must be received by the designated officer or employee of NARA on or before the 60th calendar day following the date of the notice. Timely filing will stay the commencement of collection procedures. NARA may consider requests filed after the 60-day period provided for in this section if you:</P>
              <P>(i) Can show that the delay was the result of circumstances beyond your control; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Did not receive notice of the filing deadline (unless you had actual notice of the filing deadline).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Inspection of NARA records related to the debt.</E> (1) If you want to inspect or copy NARA records related to the debt (<E T="03">see</E> § 1201.14(a)(5)), you must send a letter to the NARA official designated in the notice. Your letter must be received within 30 days of the date of the notice.</P>

              <P>(2) In response to the timely request described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the designated NARA official will notify you of the location and time when you may inspect and copy records related to the debt.<PRTPAGE P="514"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) If personal inspection of NARA records related to the debt is impractical, reasonable arrangements will be made to send you copies of those records.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Review official.</E> (1) When required by Federal law or regulation, such as in a salary offset situation, NARA will request an administrative law judge, or hearing official from another agency who is not under the supervision or control of the Archivist, to conduct the review. In these cases, the hearing official will, following the review, submit the review decision to the Archivist for the issuance of NARA's final decision (<E T="03">see</E> paragraph (f) of this section for content of the review decision).</P>

              <P>(2) When Federal law or regulation does not require NARA to have the review conducted by an administrative law judge, or by a hearing official from another agency who is not under the supervision or control of the Archivist, NARA has the right to appoint a hearing official to conduct the review. In these cases, the hearing official will, following the review, submit the review decision to the Archivist for the issuance of NARA's final decision (<E T="03">see</E> paragraph (f) of this section for the content of the review decision).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Review procedure.</E> If you request a review, the review official will notify you of the form of the review to be provided. The review official will determine whether an oral hearing is required, or if a review of the written record is sufficient, in accordance with the FCCS. Although you may request an oral hearing, such a hearing is required only when a review of the documentary evidence cannot determine the question of indebtedness, such as when the validity of the debt turns on an issue of credibility or truthfulness. In either case, the review official will conduct the review in accordance with the FCCS. If the review will include an oral hearing, the notice sent to you by the review official will set forth the date, time, and location of the hearing.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Date of decision.</E> (1) The review official will issue a written decision, based upon either the written record or documentary evidence and information developed at an oral hearing. This decision will be issued as soon as practical, but not later than 60 days after the date on which NARA received your request for a review, unless you request, and the review official grants, a delay in the proceedings.</P>
              <P>(2) If NARA is unable to issue a decision within 60 days after the receipt of the request for a hearing:</P>
              <P>(i) NARA may not issue a withholding order or take other action until the hearing (in whatever form) is held and a decision is rendered; and</P>
              <P>(ii) If NARA previously issued a withholding order to the debtor's employer, NARA must suspend the withholding order beginning on the 61st day after the receipt of the hearing request and continuing until a hearing (in whatever form) is held and a decision is rendered.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Content of review decision.</E> The review official will prepare a written decision that includes:</P>
              <P>(1) A statement of the facts presented to support the origin, nature, and amount of the debt;</P>
              <P>(2) The review official's findings, analysis, and conclusions; and</P>
              <P>(3) The terms of any repayment schedule, if applicable.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Interest, penalty charge, and administrative cost accrual during review period.</E> Interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs authorized by law will continue to accrue during the review period.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Interest.</E> (1) NARA will assess interest on all delinquent debts unless prohibited by statute, regulation, or contract.</P>

              <P>(2) Interest begins to accrue on all debts from the date that the debt becomes delinquent. NARA will not recover interest if you pay the debt within 30 days of the date on which interest begins to accrue. NARA will assess interest at the rate established annually by the Secretary of the Treasury under 31 U.S.C. 3717, unless a different rate is either necessary to protect the interests of NARA or established by a contract, repayment agreement, or statute. NARA will notify you of the basis for its finding when a different rate is necessary to protect the interests of NARA.<PRTPAGE P="515"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) The Archivist may extend the 30-day period for payment without interest where he or she determines that such action is in the best interest of NARA. A decision to extend or not to extend the payment period is final and is not subject to further review.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Penalty.</E> NARA will assess a penalty charge of 6 percent a year on any portion of a debt that is delinquent for more than 90 days.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Administrative costs.</E> NARA will assess charges to cover administrative costs incurred as a result of your failure to pay a debt before it becomes delinquent. Administrative costs include the additional costs incurred in processing and handling the debt because it became delinquent, such as costs incurred in obtaining a credit report or in using a private collection contractor, or service fees charged by a Federal agency for collection activities undertaken on behalf of NARA.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Allocation of payments.</E> A partial or installment payment by a debtor will be applied first to outstanding penalty assessments, second to administrative costs, third to accrued interest, and fourth to the outstanding debt principal.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Additional authority.</E> NARA may assess interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs on debts that are not subject to 31 U.S.C. 3717 to the extent authorized under common law or other applicable statutory authority.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Waiver.</E> (1) The Archivist may (without regard to the amount of the debt) waive collection of all or part of accrued interest, penalty charges, or administrative costs, if he or she determines that collection of these charges would be against equity and good conscience or not in the best interest of NARA.</P>
              <P>(2) A decision to waive interest, penalty charges, or administrative costs may be made at any time before a debt is paid. However, and unless otherwise stated in these regulations, where these charges have been collected before the waiver decision, they will not be refunded. The Archivist's decision to waive or not waive collection of these charges is final and is not subject to further review.</P>

              <SUBJECT>How can I resolve my debt through voluntary repayment?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) In response to a notice of debt, you may propose to NARA that you be allowed to repay the debt through a voluntary repayment agreement in lieu of NARA taking other collection actions under this part.</P>
              <P>(b) Your request to enter into a voluntary repayment agreement must:</P>
              <P>(1) Be in writing;</P>
              <P>(2) Admit the existence of the debt; and</P>
              <P>(3) Either propose payment of the debt (together with interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs) in a lump sum, or set forth a proposed repayment schedule.</P>
              <P>(c) NARA will collect claims in one lump sum whenever feasible. However, if you are unable to pay your debt in one lump sum, NARA may accept payment in regular installments that bear a reasonable relationship to the size of the debt and your ability to pay.</P>
              <P>(d) NARA will consider a request to enter into a voluntary repayment agreement in accordance with the FCCS. The Archivist may request additional information from you, including financial statements if you request to make payments in installments, in order to determine whether to accept a voluntary repayment agreement. It is within the Archivist's discretion to accept a repayment agreement instead of proceeding with other collection actions under this part, and to set the necessary terms of any voluntary repayment agreement. No repayment agreement will be binding on NARA unless it is in writing and signed by both you and the Archivist. At NARA's option, you may be required to provide security as part of the agreement to make payments in installments. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, 31 U.S.C. 3711 will govern any reduction or compromise of a claim.</P>

              <P>(a) The Archivist may compromise, suspend, or terminate collection action on those debts owed to NARA that do not exceed $100,000 excluding interest, <PRTPAGE P="516"/>in conformity with the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended. NARA will follow the policies in § 902.2 of the FCCS.</P>
              <P>(b) The uncollected portion of a debt owed to NARA that is not recovered as the result of a compromise will be reported to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as income to the debtor in accordance with IRS procedures if the debt is at least $600.00.</P>

              <P>(a) NARA will coordinate salary deductions under this subpart as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(b) If you are a NARA employee who owes a debt to NARA, NARA's payroll office will determine the amount of your disposable pay and will implement the salary offset.</P>
              <P>(c) Deductions will begin within three official pay periods following receipt by NARA's payroll office of certification of debt from the creditor agency.</P>

              <P>(d) The Notice provisions of these regulations do not apply to certain debts arising under this section (<E T="03">see</E> § 1201.14(c)).</P>
              <P>(e) Types of collection. (1) <E T="03">Lump-sum offset.</E> If the amount of the debt is equal to or less than 15 percent of disposable pay, the debt generally will be collected through one lump-sum offset.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Installment deductions.</E> Installment deductions will be made over a period not greater than the anticipated period of employment.

However, the amount deducted from any period will not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made unless you have agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount. If possible, installment payments will be sufficient in size and frequency to liquidate the debt in three years or less.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Deductions from final check.</E> A deduction exceeding the 15 percent of disposable pay limitation may be made from any final salary payment under 31 U.S.C. 3716 and the FCCS in order to liquidate the debt, whether the employee is being separated voluntarily or involuntarily.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Deductions from other sources.</E> If an employee subject to salary offset is separated from NARA and the balance of the debt cannot be liquidated by offset of the final salary check, NARA may offset later payments of any kind against the balance of the debt, as allowed by 31 U.S.C. 3716 and the FCCS.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Multiple debts.</E> In instances where two or more creditor agencies are seeking salary offsets, or where two or <PRTPAGE P="517"/>more debts are owed to a single creditor agency, NARA's payroll office may, at its discretion, determine whether one or more debts should be offset simultaneously within the 15 percent limitation.</P>

              <SUBJECT>How will NARA coordinate salary offsets with other agencies?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Responsibilities of NARA as the creditor agency (i.e. when the debtor owes a debt to NARA and is an employee of another agency).</E> Upon completion of the procedures established in this subpart and pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 31 U.S.C. 3716, NARA must submit a claim to a paying agency or disbursing official.</P>
              <P>(1) In its claim, NARA must certify, in writing, the following:</P>
              <P>(i) That the employee owes the debt;</P>
              <P>(ii) The amount and basis of the debt;</P>
              <P>(iii) The date NARA's right to collect the debt first accrued;</P>
              <P>(iv) That NARA's regulations in this subpart have been approved by OPM under 5 CFR part 550, subpart K; and</P>
              <P>(v) That NARA has met the certification requirements of the paying agency.</P>
              <P>(2) If the collection must be made in installments, NARA's claim will also advise the paying agency of the amount or percentage of disposable pay to be collected in each installment. NARA may also advise the paying agency of the number of installments to be collected and the date of the first installment, if that date is other than the next officially established pay period.</P>
              <P>(3) NARA will also include in its claim:</P>
              <P>(i) The employee's written consent to the salary offset;</P>
              <P>(ii) The employee's signed statement acknowledging receipt of the procedures required by 5 U.S.C. 5514; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Information regarding the completion of procedures required by 5 U.S.C. 5514, including the actions taken and the dates of those actions.</P>
              <P>(4) If the employee is in the process of separating and has not received a final salary check or other final payment(s) from the paying agency, NARA must submit its claim to the paying agency or disbursing official for collection under 31 U.S.C. 3716. The paying agency will (under its regulations adopted under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K), certify the total amount of its collection on the debt and notify the employee and NARA. If the paying agency's collection does not fully satisfy the debt, and the paying agency is aware that the debtor is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund or other similar payments that may be due the debtor employee from other Federal government sources, then (under its regulations adopted under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K), the paying agency will provide written notice of the outstanding debt to the agency responsible for making the other payments to the debtor employee. The written notice will state that the employee owes a debt, the amount of the debt, and that the provisions of this section have been fully complied with. However, NARA must submit a properly certified claim under this paragraph (a)(4) to the agency responsible for making the other payments before the collection can be made.</P>
              <P>(5) If the employee is already separated and all payments due from his or her former paying agency have been paid, NARA may request, unless otherwise prohibited, that money due and payable to the employee from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund or other similar funds be administratively offset to collect the debt.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Employee transfer.</E> When an employee transfers from one paying agency to another paying agency, NARA will not repeat the due process procedures described in 5 U.S.C. 5514 and this subpart to resume the collection. NARA will submit a properly certified claim to the new paying agency and will subsequently review the debt to ensure that the collection is resumed by the new paying agency.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Responsibilities of NARA as the paying agency (i.e. when the debtor owes a debt to another agency and is an employee of NARA).</E> (1) Complete claim. When NARA receives a certified claim from a creditor agency (under the creditor agency's regulations adopted under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR part 550, <PRTPAGE P="518"/>subpart K), deductions should be scheduled to begin within three officially established pay intervals. Before deductions can begin, NARA sends the employee a written notice containing:</P>
              <P>(i) A statement that NARA has received a certified claim from the creditor agency;</P>
              <P>(ii) The amount of the claim;</P>
              <P>(iii) The date salary offset deductions will begin; and</P>
              <P>(iv) The amount of such deductions.</P>
              <P>(2) Incomplete claim. When NARA receives an incomplete certification of debt from a creditor agency, NARA will return the claim with a notice that the creditor agency must:</P>
              <P>(i) Comply with the procedures required under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K, and</P>
              <P>(ii) Properly certify a claim to NARA before NARA will take action to collect from the employee's current pay account.</P>
              <P>(3) NARA is not authorized to review the merits of the creditor agency's determination with respect to the amount or validity of the debt certified by the creditor agency.</P>
              <P>(4) Employees who transfer from NARA to another paying agency. If, after the creditor agency has submitted the claim to NARA, the employee transfers from NARA to a different paying agency before the debt is collected in full, NARA will certify the total amount collected on the debt and notify the employee and the creditor agency in writing. The notification to the creditor agency will include information on the employee's transfer.</P>

              <P>(a) If NARA is the creditor agency, it will promptly refund any amount deducted under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 5514, when:</P>
              <P>(1) The debt is waived or all or part of the funds deducted are otherwise found not to be owed (unless expressly prohibited by statute or regulation); or</P>

              <SUBJECT>Which debts can NARA refer to the Treasury for collection by offsetting tax refunds?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The regulations in this subpart implement 31 U.S.C. 3720A, which authorizes the Treasury to reduce a tax refund by the amount of a past-due, legally enforceable debt owed to a Federal agency.</P>
              <P>(b) For purposes of this section, a past-due, legally enforceable debt referrable to the Treasury for tax refund offset is a debt that is owed to NARA and:</P>
              <P>(1) Is at least $25.00;</P>
              <P>(2) Except in the case of a judgment debt, has been delinquent for at least three months and will not have been delinquent more than 10 years at the time the offset is made;</P>
              <P>(3) With respect to which NARA has:</P>
              <P>(i) Given the debtor at least 60 days to present evidence that all or part of the debt is not past due or legally enforceable;</P>
              <P>(ii) Considered evidence presented by the debtor; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Determined that an amount of the debt is past due and legally enforceable;</P>
              <P>(4) With respect to which NARA has notified or has made a reasonable attempt to notify the debtor that:</P>
              <P>(i) The debt is past due, and</P>
              <P>(ii) Unless repaid within 60 days of the date of the notice, the debt may be referred to the Treasury for offset against any refund of overpayment of tax; and</P>
              <P>(5) All other requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3720A and the Treasury regulations relating to the eligibility of a debt for tax return offset (31 CFR 285.2) have been satisfied.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What are NARA's procedures for collecting debts by tax refund offset?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) NARA's Financial Services Division will be the point of contact with the Treasury for administrative matters regarding the offset program.</P>
              <P>(b) NARA will ensure that the procedures prescribed by the Treasury are followed in developing information about past-due debts and submitting the debts to the Treasury.</P>
              <P>(c) NARA will submit to the Treasury a notification of a taxpayer's liability for past-due legally enforceable debt. This notification will contain the following:</P>
              <P>(1) The name and taxpayer identification number of the debtor;</P>
              <P>(2) The amount of the past-due and legally enforceable debt;</P>
              <P>(3) The date on which the original debt became past due;</P>
              <P>(4) A statement certifying that, with respect to each debt reported, all of the requirements of § 1201.40(b) have been satisfied; and</P>
              <P>(5) Any other information as prescribed by Treasury.</P>
              <P>(d) For purposes of this section, notice that collection of the debt is stayed by a bankruptcy proceeding involving the debtor will bar referral of the debt to the Treasury.</P>
              <P>(e) NARA will promptly notify the Treasury to correct data when NARA:</P>
              <P>(1) Determines that an error has been made with respect to a debt that has been referred;</P>
              <P>(2) Receives or credits a payment on the debt; or</P>
              <P>(3) Receives notice that the person owing the debt has filed for bankruptcy under Title 11 of the United States Code and the automatic stay is in effect or has been adjudicated bankrupt and the debt has been discharged.</P>

              <P>(f) When advising debtors of NARA's intent to refer a debt to the Treasury for offset, NARA will also advise debtors of remedial actions (<E T="03">see</E> §§ 1201.9 and 1201.14 through 1201.16 of this part) available to defer the offset or prevent it from taking place.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Under what circumstances will NARA collect amounts that I owe to NARA (or some other Federal agency) by offsetting the debt against payments that NARA (or some other Federal agency) owes me?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The regulations in this subpart apply to the collection of any debts you owe to NARA, or to any request from another Federal agency that NARA collect a debt you owe by offsetting your debt against a payment NARA owes you. Administrative offset is authorized under section 5 of the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended (31 U.S.C. 3716). NARA will carry out administrative offset in accordance with the provisions of the FCCS. The regulations in this subpart are intended only to supplement the provisions of the Federal Claims Collection Standards.</P>
              <P>(b) The Archivist, after attempting to collect a debt you owe to NARA under Section 3(a) of the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended (31 U.S.C. 3711(a)), may collect the debt by administrative offset only after giving you:</P>
              <P>(1) Written notice of the type and amount of the claim, the intention of the head of the agency to collect the claim by administrative offset, and an explanation of the rights of the debtor;</P>
              <P>(2) An opportunity to inspect and copy the records of the agency related to the claim;</P>
              <P>(3) An opportunity for a review within the agency of the decision of the agency related to the claim; and</P>
              <P>(4) An opportunity to make a written agreement with the head of the agency to repay the amount of the claim.</P>
              <P>(c) No collection by administrative offset will be made on any debt that has been outstanding for more than 10 years, unless facts material to NARA or a Federal agency's right to collect the debt were not known, and reasonably could not have been known, by the official or officials responsible for discovering and collecting the debt.</P>
              <P>(d) The regulations in this subpart do not apply to:</P>

              <P>The Archivist may request that funds due and payable to you by another Federal agency instead be paid to NARA to satisfy a debt you owe to NARA. NARA will refer debts to the Treasury for centralized administrative offset in accordance with the FCCS and the procedures established by the Treasury.

In requesting administrative offset, NARA will certify in writing to the Federal agency that is holding funds for you:</P>
              <P>(a) That you owe the debt;</P>
              <P>(b) The amount and basis of the debt; and</P>
              <P>(c) That NARA has complied with the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3716, its own administrative offset regulations in this subpart, the applicable administrative offset regulations of the agency holding the funds, and the applicable provisions of the FCCS with respect to providing you with due process.</P>

              <P>(a) Any Federal agency may request that NARA administratively offset funds due and payable to you in order to collect a debt you owe to that agency. NARA will initiate the requested offset only upon:</P>
              <P>(1) Receipt of written certification from the creditor agency stating:</P>
              <P>(i) That you owe the debt;</P>
              <P>(ii) The amount and basis of the debt;</P>

              <P>(2) A determination by the Archivist that offsetting funds payable to you by NARA in order to collect a debt owed by you would be in the best interest of the United States as determined by the facts and circumstances of the particular case, and that such an offset would not otherwise be contrary to law.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Multiple debts.</E> In instances where two or more creditor agencies are seeking administrative offsets, or where two or more debts are owed to a single creditor agency, NARA may, in its discretion, allocate the amount it owes to you to the creditor agencies in accordance with the best interest of the United States as determined by the facts and circumstances of the particular case, paying special attention to applicable statutes of limitations.</P>

              <P>(a) NARA will acknowledge your request within 10 workdays of its receipt by NARA and if possible, will make the records available to you at that time. If NARA cannot make the records immediately available, the acknowledgment will indicate when the system manager will make the records available.</P>
              <P>(b) If NARA anticipates more than a 10 workday delay in making a record you requested available, NARA also will explain in the acknowledgment specific reasons for the delay.</P>
              <P>(c) If your request for access does not contain sufficient information to permit the system manager to locate the records, NARA will request additional information from you.

              <P>(a) At your request, NARA will provide you, or a person authorized by you, a copy of the records by mail or by making the records available in person during normal business hours at the NARA facility where the records are located. If you are seeking access in person, the system manager will permit you to examine the original record, will provide you with a copy of the records, or both.</P>
              <P>(b) When obtaining access to the records in person at a NARA facility, you must provide proof of identification either by producing at least one piece of identification bearing a name or signature and either a photograph or physical description (e.g., a driver's license or employee identification card) or by signing the Certification of Identity form described in § 1204.40 (b)(5). NARA reserves the right to ask you to produce additional pieces of identification to assure NARA of your identity.

              <P>(a) The Investigative Case Files of the Inspector General (NARA-23) and the Personnel Security Case Files (NARA-24) systems of records are eligible for exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1) because the records in these systems:</P>
              <P>(1) Contain information specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and</P>
              <P>(2) Are in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive Order.</P>
              <P>(b) The systems described in paragraph (a) are exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), and (e)(4)(G) and (H). Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the following reasons:</P>
              <P>(1) From subsection (c)(3) because accounting for each disclosure could result in the release of properly classified information which would compromise the national defense or disrupt foreign policy.</P>
              <P>(2) From the access and amendment provisions of subsection (d) because access to the records in these systems of records could result in the release of properly classified information which would compromise the national defense or disrupt foreign policy. Amendment of either of these series of records would interfere with ongoing investigations and law enforcement or national security activities and impose an impossible administrative burden by requiring investigations to be continuously reinvestigated.</P>
              <P>(3) From subsection (e)(1) because verification of the accuracy of all information to the records could result in the release of properly classified information which would compromise the national defense or disrupt foreign policy.</P>
              <P>(4) From subsection (e)(4)(G) and (H) because these systems are exempt from the access and amendment provisions of subsection (d), pursuant to subsection (k)(1) of the Privacy Act.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What NARA systems of records are exempt from release under the Law Enforcement Exemption of the Privacy Act?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Investigative Files of the Inspector General (NARA-23) and the Insider Threat Program Records (NARA-45) systems of records are eligible for exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) because these record systems contain investigatory material of actual, potential, or alleged criminal, civil, or administrative violations, compiled for law enforcement purposes other than within the scope of subsection (j)(2) of 5 U.S.C. 552a. If you are denied any right, privilege, or benefit to which you would otherwise be entitled by Federal law, or for which you would otherwise be eligible, as a result of the record, NARA will make the record available to you, except for any information in the record that would disclose the identity of a confidential source as described in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2).</P>
              <P>(b) The systems described in paragraph (a) of this section are exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1) and (e)(4), (G) and (H), and (f). Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the following reasons:</P>
              <P>(1) From subsection (c)(3) of 5 U.S.C. 552a because releasing disclosure accounting could alert the subject of an investigation about the alleged violations, about the existence of the investigation, and about the fact that they are being investigated by the Office of Inspector General (OIG), the Insider Threat Office, or another agency. Releasing these records could provide significant information concerning the nature of the investigation and result in tampering with or destroying evidence, influencing witnesses, endangering individuals involved, and other activities that could impede or compromise the investigation.</P>

              <P>(2) From the access and amendment provisions of subsection (d) of 5 U.S.C. 552a because access to the information contained in these systems of records could inform the subject of an investigation about an actual or potential criminal, civil, or administrative violation; about the existence of that investigation; about the nature and scope of the information and evidence obtained on the person's activities; about the <PRTPAGE P="531"/>identity of confidential sources, witnesses, and law enforcement personnel; and about information that may enable the person to avoid being detected or apprehended. These factors present a serious impediment to effective law enforcement when they prevent investigators from successfully completing the investigation, endanger the physical safety of confidential sources, witnesses, and law enforcement personnel, or lead to improperly influencing witnesses, destroying evidence, or fabricating testimony. In addition, granting access to such records could disclose security-sensitive or confidential business information or information that would constitute an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of third parties. Amending these records could allow the subject to avoid being detected or apprehended and interfere with ongoing investigations and law enforcement activities.</P>
              <P>(3) From subsection (e)(1) of 5 U.S.C. 552a because applying this provision could impair investigations and interfere with the law enforcement responsibilities of the OIG, the Insider Threat Office, or another agency for the following reasons:</P>
              <P>(i) It is not possible to detect relevance or need for specific information in the early stages of an investigation, case, or matter. After the investigators evaluate the information, they may establish its relevance and need.</P>
              <P>(ii) During an investigation, the investigating office may obtain information about other actual or potential criminal, civil, or administrative violations, including those outside the scope of its jurisdiction. The office should retain this information, as it may help establish patterns of inappropriate activity, and can provide valuable leads for Federal and other law enforcement agencies.</P>
              <P>(iii) When interviewing individuals or obtaining other forms of evidence during an investigation, the investigator may receive information that relates to matters incidental to the primary purpose of the investigation but which may also relate to matters under the investigative jurisdiction of another office or agency. The investigator cannot readily segregate such information.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What NARA systems of records are exempt from release under the Investigatory Information Material exemption of the Privacy Act?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Personnel Security Case Files (NARA-24) system of records is eligible for exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5) because it contains investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for federal employment or access to classified information. The only information exempt under this provision is that which would disclose the identity of a confidential source described in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2).</P>
              <P>(b) The system of records described in paragraph (a) of this section is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1). Exemption from the particular subsection is justified as access to records in the system would reveal the identity(ies) of the source(s) of information collected in the course of a background investigation.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Types of grants.</E> (1) <E T="03">Matching grant.</E> A matching grant is a Federal grant awarded only after the applicant raises its share of non-Federal support for a project. We will match only funds raised from non-Federal sources, either monies provided by the applicant's own institution specifically for the project or from a non-Federal third-party source. The Commission does not ordinarily make matching grants.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Outright grant.</E> Outright grants are those awards we make without any matching requirement. However, outright grants usually include a cost-sharing requirement.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Cost sharing.</E> (1) Cost sharing consists of the applicant's contribution to the cost of the project. The Commission ordinarily expects the applicant to provide cost sharing in an amount equal to the amount of the Federal grant award. Exceptions to the one-to-one cost sharing requirement may be set by the Commission in specific grant opportunity announcements.</P>
              <P>(2) Cost sharing may include cash or in-kind contributions provided by the applicant or by a non-Federal third party.</P>
              <P>(3) As indicated in 2 CFR part 2600, we do not pay indirect costs from grant funds, but allow indirect costs to be used for cost sharing.</P>

            <P>Except as otherwise provided in § 1208.150, no qualified individual with handicaps shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with handicaps, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Program accessibility: Existing facilities.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph does not—</P>
            <P>(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps;</P>
            <P>(2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or</P>
            <P>(3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1208.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, <PRTPAGE P="544"/>or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Historic preservation programs.</E> In meeting the requirements of § 1208.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals with handicaps. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 1208.150(a)(2) or (3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—</P>
            <P>(i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;</P>
            <P>(ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or</P>
            <P>(iii) Adopting other innovative methods.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Time period for compliance.</E> The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by November 7, 1988, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by September 6, 1991, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by March 6, 1989, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—</P>
            <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals with handicaps;</P>

            <P>(a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal entities, and members of the public.</P>
            <P>(1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>

            <P>(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall <PRTPAGE P="545"/>give primary consideration to the requests of the individual with handicaps.</P>
            <P>(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.</P>
            <P>(2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate with persons with impaired hearing.</P>
            <P>(b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.</P>
            <P>(c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.</P>
            <P>(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1208.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Right to counsel.</E> In all proceedings under this section, the applicant or recipient and the agency shall have the right to be represented by counsel.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Procedures, evidence, and record.</E> (1) The hearing, decision, and any administrative review thereof shall be conducted in conformity with 5 U.S.C. 554-557 (sections 5 through 8 of the Administrative Procedure Act), and in accordance with such rules of procedure as are proper (and not inconsistent with this section) relating to the conduct of the hearing, giving of notices subsequent to those provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, taking of testimony, exhibits, arguments and briefs, requests for findings, and other related matters. Both the agency and the applicant or recipient shall be entitled to introduce all relevant evidence on the issues as stated in the notice for hearing or as determined by the hearing officer at the outset of or during the hearing. Any person (other than a Government employee considered to be on official business) who, having been invited or requested to appear and testify as a witness on the Government's behalf, attends at a time and place scheduled for a hearing provided for by these Title IX regulations, may be reimbursed for his or her travel and actual expenses of attendance in an amount not to exceed the amount payable under the standardized travel regulations to a Government employee traveling on official business.</P>
              <P>(2) Technical rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings conducted pursuant to these Title IX regulations, but rules or principles designed to assure production of the most credible evidence available and to subject testimony to test by cross-examination shall be applied where reasonably necessary by the hearing officer. The hearing officer may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. All documents and other evidence offered or taken for the record shall be open to examination by the parties and opportunity shall be given to refute facts and arguments advanced on either side of the issues. A transcript shall be made of the oral evidence except to the extent the substance thereof is stipulated for the record. All decisions shall be based upon the hearing record and written findings shall be made.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Consolidated or joint hearings.</E> In cases in which the same or related facts are asserted to constitute noncompliance with these Title IX regulations with respect to two or more programs to which these Title IX regulations apply, or noncompliance with <PRTPAGE P="566"/>these Title IX regulations and the regulations of one or more other Federal departments or agencies issued under Title IX, the designated agency official may, by agreement with such other departments or agencies where applicable, provide for the conduct of consolidated or joint hearings, and for the application to such hearings of rules of procedures not inconsistent with these Title IX regulations. Final decisions in such cases, insofar as these Title IX regulations are concerned, shall be made in accordance with § 1211.625.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Decisions and notices.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Decisions by hearing officers.</E> After a hearing is held by a hearing officer such hearing officer shall either make an initial decision, if so authorized, or certify the entire record including recommended findings and proposed decision to the reviewing authority for a final decision, and a copy of such initial decision or certification shall be mailed to the applicant or recipient and to the complainant, if any. Where the initial decision referred to in this paragraph or in paragraph (c) of this section is made by the hearing officer, the applicant or recipient or the counsel for the agency may, within the period provided for in the rules of procedure issued by the designated agency official, file with the reviewing authority exceptions to the initial decision, with the reasons therefor. Upon the filing of such exceptions the reviewing authority shall review the initial decision and issue its own decision thereof including the reasons therefor. In the absence of exceptions the initial decision shall constitute the final decision, subject to the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Decisions on record or review by the reviewing authority.</E> Whenever a record is certified to the reviewing authority for decision or it reviews the decision of a hearing officer pursuant to paragraph (a) or (c) of this section, the applicant or recipient shall be given reasonable opportunity to file with it briefs or other written statements of its contentions, and a copy of the final decision of the reviewing authority shall be given in writing to the applicant or recipient and to the complainant, if any.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Decisions on record where a hearing is waived.</E> Whenever a hearing is waived pursuant to § 1211.620, the reviewing authority shall make its final decision on the record or refer the matter to a hearing officer for an initial decision to be made on the record. A copy of such decision shall be given in writing to the applicant or recipient, and to the complainant, if any.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Rulings required.</E> Each decision of a hearing officer or reviewing authority shall set forth a ruling on each finding, conclusion, or exception presented, and shall identify the requirement or requirements imposed by or pursuant to these Title IX regulations with which it is found that the applicant or recipient has failed to comply.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Review in certain cases by the Archivist of the United States.</E> If the Archivist has not personally made the final decision referred to in paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section, a recipient or applicant or the counsel for the agency may request the Archivist to review a decision of the reviewing authority in accordance with rules of procedure issued by the designated agency official. Such review is not a matter of right and shall be granted only where the Archivist determines there are special and important reasons therefor. The Archivist may grant or deny such request, in whole or in part. The Archivist may also review such a decision upon his own motion in accordance with rules of procedure issued by the National Archives and Records Administration. In the absence of a review under this paragraph (e), a final decision referred to in paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section shall become the final decision of the agency when the Archivist transmits it as such to Congressional committees with the report required under 20 U.S.C. 1682. Failure of an applicant or recipient to file an exception with the reviewing authority or to request review under this paragraph (e) shall not be deemed a failure to exhaust administrative remedies for the purpose of obtaining judicial review.<PRTPAGE P="567"/>
              </P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Content of orders.</E> The final decision may provide for suspension or termination of, or refusal to grant or continue Federal financial assistance, in whole or in part, to which these Title IX regulations apply, and may contain such terms, conditions, and other provisions as are consistent with and will effectuate the purposes of Title IX and these Title IX regulations, including provisions designed to assure that no Federal financial assistance to which these Title IX regulations apply will thereafter be extended under such law or laws to the applicant or recipient determined by such decision to be in default in its performance of an assurance given by it pursuant to these Title IX regulations, or to have otherwise failed to comply with these Title IX regulations unless and until it corrects its noncompliance and satisfies the designated agency official that it will fully comply with these Title IX regulations.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Post-termination proceedings.</E> (1) An applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance if it satisfies the terms and conditions of that order for such eligibility or if it brings itself into compliance with these Title IX regulations and provides reasonable assurance that it will fully comply with these Title IX regulations. An elementary or secondary school or school system that is unable to file an assurance of compliance shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance if it files a court order or a plan for desegregation that meets the applicable requirements and provides reasonable assurance that it will comply with the court order or plan.</P>
              <P>(2) Any applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order entered pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section may at any time request the designated agency official to restore fully its eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance. Any such request shall be supported by information showing that the applicant or recipient has met the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. If the designated agency official determines that those requirements have been satisfied, the official shall restore such eligibility.</P>
              <P>(3) If the designated agency official denies any such request, the applicant or recipient may submit a request for a hearing in writing, specifying why it believes such official to have been in error. It shall thereupon be given an expeditious hearing, with a decision on the record, in accordance with rules of procedure issued by the designated agency official. The applicant or recipient will be restored to such eligibility if it proves at such hearing that it satisfied the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. While proceedings under this paragraph (g) are pending, the sanctions imposed by the order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall remain in effect.</P>

Any action taken, determination made, or requirement imposed by an official of another department or agency acting pursuant to an assignment of responsibility <PRTPAGE P="568"/>under this section shall have the same effect as though such action had been taken by the designated official of this agency.</P>

The specific measures that you must take in this regard are described in more detail in subsequent sections of this subpart. Briefly, those measures are to—</P>
              <P>(1) Publish a drug-free workplace statement and establish a drug-free awareness program for your employees (see §§ 1212.205 through 1212.220); and</P>
              <P>(2) Take actions concerning employees who are convicted of violating drug statutes in the workplace (see § 1212.225).</P>
              <P>(b) Second, you must identify all known workplaces under your Federal awards (see § 1212.230).</P>

              <P>(b) Specifies the actions that you will take against employees for violating that prohibition; and</P>
              <P>(c) Lets each employee know that, as a condition of employment under any award, he or she:</P>
              <P>(1) Will abide by the terms of the statement; and</P>
              <P>(2) Must notify you in writing if he or she is convicted for a violation of a criminal drug statute occurring in the workplace and must do so no more than five calendar days after the conviction.</P>

              <P>There are two actions you must take if an employee is convicted of a drug violation in the workplace:</P>
              <P>(a) First, you must notify Federal agencies if an employee who is engaged in the performance of an award informs you about a conviction, as required by § 1212.205(c)(2), or you otherwise learn of the conviction. Your notification to the Federal agencies must_</P>
              <P>(1) Be in writing;</P>
              <P>(2) Include the employee's position title;</P>
              <P>(3) Include the identification number(s) of each affected award;</P>
              <P>(4) Be sent within ten calendar days after you learn of the conviction; and</P>
              <P>(5) Be sent to every Federal agency on whose award the convicted employee was working. It must be sent to every awarding official or his or her official designee, unless the Federal agency has specified a central point for the receipt of the notices.</P>
              <P>(b) Second, within 30 calendar days of learning about an employee's conviction, you must either_</P>
              <P>(1) Take appropriate personnel action against the employee, up to and including termination, consistent with the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794), as amended; or</P>
              <P>(2) Require the employee to participate satisfactorily in a drug abuse assistance or rehabilitation program approved for these purposes by a Federal, State or local health, law enforcement, or other appropriate agency.</P>

              <P>(a) You must identify all known workplaces under each NARA award. A failure to do so is a violation of your drug-free workplace requirements. You may identify the workplaces_</P>
              <P>(1) To the NARA official that is making the award, either at the time of application or upon award; or</P>
              <P>(2) In documents that you keep on file in your offices during the performance of the award, in which case you must make the information available for inspection upon request by NARA officials or their designated representatives.</P>
              <P>(b) Your workplace identification for an award must include the actual address of buildings (or parts of buildings) or other sites where work under the award takes place. Categorical descriptions may be used (e.g., all vehicles of a mass transit authority or State highway department while in operation, State employees in each local unemployment office, performers in concert halls or radio studios).</P>
              <P>(c) If you identified workplaces to the NARA awarding official at the time of application or award, as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and any workplace that you identified changes during the performance of the award, you must inform the NARA awarding official.</P>

              <P>These regulations conform with guidance provided in ISO 15489-1:2001, Information and documentation—Records management. Paragraphs 7.1 (Principles of records management programmes), 7.2 (Characteristics of a record), 8.3.5 (Conversion and migration), 8.3.6 (Access, retrieval and use), and 9.6 (Storage and handling) apply to records creation and maintenance.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 1222.10</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>How should agencies apply the statutory definition of Federal records?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The statutory definition of Federal records is contained in 44 U.S.C. 3301 and provided in § 1220.18 of this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(b) Several key terms, phrases, and concepts in the statutory definition of a Federal record are further explained as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Documentary materials</E> has the meaning provided in § 1220.18 of this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Regardless of physical form or characteristics</E> means that the medium may be paper, film, disk, or other physical type or form; and that the method of recording may be manual, mechanical, photographic, electronic, or any other combination of these or other technologies.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Made</E> means the act of creating and recording information by agency personnel in the course of their official duties, regardless of the method(s) or the medium involved.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Received</E> means the acceptance or collection of documentary materials by <PRTPAGE P="580"/>or on behalf of an agency or agency personnel in the course of their official duties regardless of their origin (for example, other units of their agency, private citizens, public officials, other agencies, contractors, Government grantees) and regardless of how transmitted (in person or by messenger, mail, electronic means, or by any other method). In this context, the term does not refer to misdirected materials. It may or may not refer to loaned or seized materials depending on the conditions under which such materials came into agency custody or were used by the agency. Advice of legal counsel should be sought regarding the “record” status of loaned or seized materials.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Preserved</E> means the filing, storing, or any other method of systematically maintaining documentary materials in any medium by the agency. This term covers materials not only actually filed or otherwise systematically maintained but also those temporarily removed from existing filing systems.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Appropriate for preservation</E> means documentary materials made or received which, in the judgment of the agency, should be filed, stored, or otherwise systematically maintained by an agency because of the evidence of agency activities or information they contain, even if the materials are not covered by its current filing or maintenance procedures.</P>
            </SECTION>
            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 1222.12</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>What types of documentary materials are Federal records?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> To ensure that complete and accurate records are made and retained in the Federal Government, agencies must distinguish between records and nonrecord materials by applying the definition of records (see 44 U.S.C. 3301 and 36 CFR 1220.18 and 1222.10 of this subchapter) to agency documentary materials in all formats and media.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Record status.</E> Documentary materials are records when they meet the conditions specified in § 1222.10(b).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Working files and similar materials.</E> Working files, such as preliminary drafts and rough notes, and other similar materials, are records that must be maintained to ensure adequate and proper documentation if:</P>
              <P>(1) They were circulated or made available to employees, other than the creator, for official purposes such as approval, comment, action, recommendation, follow-up, or to communicate with agency staff about agency business; and</P>
              <P>(2) They contain unique information, such as substantive annotations or comments that adds to a proper understanding of the agency's formulation and execution of basic policies, decisions, actions, or responsibilities.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Record status of copies.</E> The determination as to whether a particular document is a record does not depend upon whether it contains unique information. Multiple copies of the same document and documents containing duplicative information may each have record status depending on how they are used in conducting agency business.</P>

            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 1222.14</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>What are nonrecord materials?</SUBJECT>
              <P>Nonrecord materials are U.S. Government-owned documentary materials that do not meet the conditions of records status (see § 1222.12(b)) or that are specifically excluded from the statutory definition of records (see 44 U.S.C. 3301). An agency's records management program also needs to include managing nonrecord materials. There are three specific categories of materials excluded from the statutory definition of records:</P>
              <P>(a) Library and museum material (but only if such material is made or acquired and preserved solely for reference or exhibition purposes), including physical exhibits, artifacts, and other material objects lacking evidential value.</P>
              <P>(b) Extra copies of documents (but only if the sole reason such copies are preserved is for convenience of reference).</P>

              <P>(c) Stocks of publications and of processed documents. Catalogs, trade journals, and other publications that are received from other Government agencies, commercial firms, or private institutions and that require no action and are not part of a case on which action is taken. (Stocks do not include <PRTPAGE P="581"/>serial or record sets of agency publications and processed documents, including annual reports, brochures, pamphlets, books, handbooks, posters and maps.)</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 1222.16</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>How are nonrecord materials managed?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Agencies must develop recordkeeping requirements to distinguish records from nonrecord materials.</P>
              <P>(b) The following guidelines should be used in managing nonrecord materials:</P>
              <P>(1) If a clear determination cannot be made, the materials should be treated as records. Agencies may consult with NARA for guidance.</P>
              <P>(2) Nonrecord materials must be physically segregated from records or, for electronic non-record materials, readily identified and segregable from records;</P>
              <P>(3) Nonrecord materials should be purged when no longer needed for reference. NARA's approval is not required to destroy such materials.</P>
            </SECTION>
            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 1222.18</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Under what conditions may nonrecord materials be removed from Government agencies?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Nonrecord materials, including extra copies of unclassified or formally declassified agency records kept only for convenience of reference, may be removed by departing employees from Government agency custody only with the approval of the head of the agency or the individual(s) authorized to act for the agency on records issues.</P>
              <P>(b) National security classified information may not be removed from Government custody, except for a removal of custody taken in accordance with the requirements of the National Industrial Security Program established under Executive Order 12829, as amended, or a successor Order.</P>
              <P>(c) Information which is restricted from release under the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), as amended, or other statutes may not be removed from Government custody except as permitted under those statutes.</P>
              <P>(d) This section does not apply to use of records and nonrecord materials in the course of conducting official agency business, including telework and authorized dissemination of information.</P>
            </SECTION>
            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 1222.20</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>How are personal files defined and managed?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Personal files are defined in § 1220.18 of this subchapter. This section does not apply to agencies and positions that are covered by the Presidential Records Act of 1978 (44 U.S.C. 2201-2207) (see 36 CFR part 1270 of this chapter).</P>
              <P>(b) Personal files must be clearly designated as such and must be maintained separately from the office's official records.</P>
              <P>(1) Information about private (non-agency) matters and agency business must not be mixed in outgoing agency documents, such as correspondence and messages.</P>
              <P>(2) If information about private matters and agency business appears in a received document, the document is a Federal record. Agencies may make a copy of the document with the personal information deleted or redacted, and treat the copy as the Federal record.</P>
              <P>(3) Materials labeled “personal,” “confidential,” or “private,” or similarly designated, and used in the transaction of public business, are Federal records. The use of a label such as “personal” does not affect the status of documentary materials in a Federal agency.</P>

              <P>(a) Agencies must ensure that procedures, directives and other issuances; systems planning and development documentation; and other relevant records include recordkeeping requirements for records in all media, including those records created or received on electronic mail systems. Recordkeeping requirements must:</P>
              <P>(1) Identify and prescribe specific categories of records to be systematically created or received and maintained by agency personnel in the course of their official duties;</P>

              <P>Agencies must comply with recordkeeping requirements that are imposed government-wide by another agency with jurisdiction over the program or activity being conducted, e.g., requirements for records concerning hazardous waste. Affected agencies must include these requirements in appropriate directives or other official issuances prescribing the agency's organization, functions, or activities.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 1222.32</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>How do agencies manage records created or received by contractors?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Agency officials responsible for administering contracts must safeguard records created, processed, or in the possession of a contractor or a non-Federal entity by taking the following steps:</P>
              <P>(1) Agencies must ensure that contractors performing Federal government agency functions create and maintain records that document these activities. Agencies must specify in the contract Government ownership and the delivery to the Government of all records necessary for the adequate and proper documentation of contractor-operated agency activities and programs in accordance with requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93-400), as amended by Pub. L. 96-83 41 U.S.C.), and, where applicable, the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) (48 CFR parts 200-299).</P>
              <P>(2) Records management oversight of contract records is necessary to ensure that all recordkeeping needs are met. All records created for Government use and delivered to, or under the legal control of, the Government must be managed in accordance with Federal law. In addition, electronic records and background electronic data specified for delivery to the contracting agency must be accompanied by sufficient technical documentation to permit understanding and use of the records and data.</P>
              <P>(3) Contracts that require the creation of data for the Government's use must specify, in addition to the final product, delivery of background supporting data or other records that may have reuse value to the Government. To determine what background supporting data or other records that contractors must deliver, program and contracting officials must consult with agency records and information managers and historians and, when appropriate, with other Government agencies to ensure that all Government needs are met, especially when the data deliverables support a new agency mission or a new Government program.</P>
              <P>(4) Deferred ordering and delivery-of-data clauses and rights-in-data clauses must be included in contracts whenever necessary to ensure adequate and proper documentation or because the data have reuse value to the Government.</P>
              <P>(b) All data created for Government use and delivered to, or falling under the legal control of, the Government are Federal records subject to the provisions of 44 U.S.C. chapters 21, 29, 31, and 33, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) (5 U.S.C. 552), as amended, and the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), as amended, and must be managed and scheduled for disposition only as provided in Subchapter B.</P>
              <P>(c) Agencies must ensure that appropriate authority for retention of classified materials has been granted to contractors or non-Government entities participating in the National Industrial Security Program (NISP), established under Executive order 12829, as amended, or a successor Order.</P>

              <P>Agencies must implement a records maintenance program so that complete records are filed or otherwise identified and preserved, records can be readily found when needed, and permanent and temporary records are physically segregated from each other or, for electronic records, segregable. Agency records maintenance programs must:<PRTPAGE P="584"/>
              </P>
              <P>(a) Institute procedures for organizing and storing records;</P>
              <P>(b) Maintain electronic, audiovisual and cartographic, and microform records in accordance with 36 CFR parts 1236, 1237, and 1238 of this subchapter, respectively;</P>
              <P>(c) Assign responsibilities for maintenance of records in all formats within each agency component, including designation of the officials that are responsible for maintenance and disposition of electronic records and management of automated systems used for recordkeeping;</P>
              <P>(d) Institute reference and retrieval procedures and controls that:</P>
              <P>(1) Facilitate the finding, charging out, and refiling of records, including safeguards against loss during transit; and</P>
              <P>(2) Ensure that access to electronic records minimizes the risk of unauthorized additions, deletions, or alterations;</P>
              <P>(e) Issue appropriate instructions to all agency employees on handling and protecting records;</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1223.10</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>What is the purpose of Part 1223?</SUBJECT>
            <P>Part 1223 specifies policies and procedures needed to establish a program to identify, protect, and manage vital records as part of an agency's continuity of operation plan designed to meet emergency management responsibilities.</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 1223.12</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>What are the objectives of a vital records program?</SUBJECT>
            <P>A vital records program has two objectives:</P>
            <P>(a) It provides an agency with the information it needs to conduct its business under other than normal operating conditions and to resume normal business afterward; and</P>
            <P>(b) It enables agency officials to identify and protect the most important records dealing with the legal and financial rights of the agency and of persons directly affected by the agency's actions.</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 1223.14</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>What elements must a vital records program include?</SUBJECT>
            <P>To achieve compliance with this section, an agency's vital records program must contain all elements listed in FCD 1, Annex I (incorporated by reference, see § 1223.4). In carrying out a vital records program, agencies must:</P>
            <P>(a) Specify agency staff responsibilities;</P>
            <P>(b) Appropriately inform all staff about vital records;</P>
            <P>(c) Ensure that the designation of vital records is current and complete; and</P>
            <P>(d) Ensure that vital records are adequately protected, accessible, and immediately usable.</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 1223.16</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>How are vital records identified?</SUBJECT>
            <P>Agencies identify vital records in the context of the emergency management function. Vital records are those that are needed to perform the most critical functions of the agency and those needed to protect legal and financial rights of the Government and of the persons affected by its actions. Vital records also include emergency plans and related records that specify how an agency will respond to an emergency. The informational content of records series and electronic records systems determines which are vital records. Only the most recent and complete sources of the information are vital records.</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 1223.18</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Must vital records be in a particular form or format?</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) Vital records can be original records or copies of records. Consult NARA records management guidance on vital records at <E T="03">http://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/vital-records/index.html</E> for further information.</P>
            <P>(b) Records may be maintained on a variety of media including paper, magnetic tape, optical disk, photographic film, and microform. In selecting the media, agencies must ensure that equipment needed to read the specific media will be available following an emergency or disaster.</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 1223.20</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>What are the requirements for accessing vital records during an emergency?</SUBJECT>
            <P>Agencies must establish retrieval procedures for vital records that are easily implemented, especially since individuals unfamiliar with the records may need to use them in an emergency. For electronic records systems, agencies must also ensure that appropriate hardware, software, and system documentation adequate to operate the system and access the records will be available in case of an emergency.</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 1223.22</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>How must agencies protect vital records?</SUBJECT>
            <P>Agencies must take appropriate measures to ensure the survival of the vital records or copies of vital records in case of an emergency.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Duplication.</E> Agencies may choose to duplicate vital records as the primary protection method. Duplication can be to the same medium as the original record or to a different medium. When agencies choose duplication as a protection method, the copy of the vital record stored off-site is normally a duplicate of the original <PRTPAGE P="587"/>record. The agency may store the original records off-site if their protection is necessary, or if it does not need to keep the original records at its normal place of business.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Dispersal.</E> Once records are duplicated, they must be dispersed to sites a sufficient distance away to avoid being subject to the same emergency. Dispersal sites may be other office locations of the same agency or some other site.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Storage considerations.</E> Copies of emergency operating vital records must be accessible in a very short period of time for use in the event of an emergency. Copies of legal and financial rights records may not be needed as quickly. In deciding where to store vital record copies, agencies must treat records that have the properties of both categories, that is, emergency operating and legal and financial rights records, as emergency operating records.</P>
            <P>(1) The off-site copy of legal and financial rights vital records may be stored at an off-site agency location or, in accordance with § 1233.12 of this subchapter, at a records storage facility.</P>
            <P>(2) When using a NARA records storage facility for storing vital records that are duplicate copies of original records, the agency must specify on the SF 135, Records Transmittal and Receipt, that they are vital records (duplicate copies) and the medium on which they are maintained. The agency must also periodically cycle (update) them by removing obsolete items and replacing them with the most recent version.</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 1223.24</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>When can vital records be destroyed?</SUBJECT>
            <P>The disposition of vital records that are original records is governed by records schedules approved by NARA (see part 1225, Scheduling Records, of this subchapter). Agencies must not destroy original records that are not scheduled. Duplicate copies created and maintained for vital records purposes only may be destroyed when superseded or obsolete during the routine vital records cycle process.</P>

            <P>All Federal records, including those created or maintained for the Government by a contractor, must be covered by a NARA-approved agency disposition authority, SF 115, Request for Records Disposition Authority, or the NARA General Records Schedules.</P>

            <SUBJECT>How are records schedules developed?</SUBJECT>

            <P>The principal steps in developing agency records schedules are listed below. Additional details that may be helpful are provided in the NARA records management handbook, <E T="03">Disposition of Federal Records</E> at <E T="03">http://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/publications/disposition-of-federal-records/index.html.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(a) Conduct a functional or work process analysis to identify the functions or activities performed by each organization or unit. Identify the recordkeeping requirements for each.</P>
            <P>(b) Prepare an inventory for each function or activity to identify records series, systems, and nonrecord materials.</P>

            <P>(c) Determine the appropriate scope of the records schedule items, e.g., individual series/system component, work process, group of related work processes, or broad program area.<PRTPAGE P="589"/>
            </P>
            <P>(d) Evaluate the period of time the agency needs each records series or system based on use, value to agency operations and oversight agencies, and legal obligations. Determine whether a fixed or flexible retention period is more appropriate. For records proposed as temporary, specify a retention period that meets agency business needs and legal requirements. For records proposed as permanent records, identify how long the records are needed by the agency before they are transferred to NARA.</P>

            <P>(e) Determine whether the proposed disposition should be limited to records in a specific medium. Records schedules submitted to NARA for approval on or after December 17, 2007, are media neutral, <E T="03">i.e.</E>, the disposition instructions apply to the described records in any medium, unless the schedule identifies a specific medium for a specific series.</P>
            <P>(f) Compile a schedule for records, including descriptions and disposition instructions for each item, using an SF 115.</P>
            <P>(g) Obtain internal clearances, as appropriate, from program offices and other stakeholders such as the legal counsel, chief information officer, electronic systems manager, and agency historian, as appropriate.</P>
            <P>(h) Obtain approval from the Government Accountability Office (GAO), when required (see § 1225.20(a) for the categories that require GAO approval).</P>
            <P>(i) Submit an SF 115 covering only new or revised record items to NARA for approval (see § 1225.18(d)).</P>
            <P>(j) The disposition instructions on SF 115s approved by the Archivist of the United States are mandatory (44 U.S.C. 3314).</P>

            <SUBJECT>How do agencies schedule permanent records?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Identification.</E> Identify potentially permanent records. Useful guidelines in the identification of permanent Federal records may be found in the NARA records management handbook, <E T="03">Disposition of Federal Records</E> (see § 1225.12 for the Web site address of this publication).</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Requirements.</E> Each item proposed for permanent retention on an SF 115 must include the following:</P>
            <P>(1) Descriptive title of the records series, component of an information system, or appropriate aggregation of series and/or information system components. The descriptive title must be meaningful to agency personnel;</P>
            <P>(2) Complete description of the records including:</P>
            <P>(i) Agency function;</P>
            <P>(ii) Physical type, if appropriate;</P>
            <P>(iii) Inclusive dates;</P>
            <P>(iv) Statement of how records are arranged;</P>
            <P>(v) Statement of restrictions on access under the FOIA if the records are proposed for immediate transfer;</P>
            <P>(3) Disposition instructions developed using the following guidelines:</P>
            <P>(i) If the records series or system is current and continuing, the SF 115 must specify the period of time after which the records will be transferred to the National Archives of the United States, and if appropriate, the time period for returning inactive records to an approved records storage facility.</P>
            <P>(ii) If the records series or system is nonrecurring, i.e., no additional records will be created or acquired, the agency must propose either that the records be transferred to the National Archives of the United States immediately or set transfer for a fixed date in the future.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Determination.</E> NARA will appraise the records to determine if they have sufficient value to warrant archival permanent preservation. If NARA determines either that records are not permanent or that the transfer instructions are not appropriate:</P>
            <P>(1) NARA will notify the agency and negotiate an appropriate disposition. The disposition instruction on the SF 115 will be modified prior to NARA approval; or</P>
            <P>(2) If NARA and the agency cannot agree on the disposition instruction for an item(s), the items(s) will be withdrawn. In these cases, the agency must submit an SF 115 with a revised proposal for disposition; unscheduled records must be treated as permanent until a new schedule is approved.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1225.16</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>How do agencies schedule temporary records?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Identification.</E> Federal agencies request authority to dispose of records, <PRTPAGE P="590"/>either immediately or on a recurring basis. Requests for immediate disposal are limited to existing records that no longer accumulate. For recurring records, approved schedules provide continuing authority to destroy the records. The retention periods approved by NARA are mandatory, and the agency must dispose of the records after expiration of the retention period, except as provided in §§ 1226.18 and 1226.20 of this subchapter.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Requirements.</E> Each item on an SF 115 proposed for eventual destruction must include the following:</P>
            <P>(1) Descriptive title familiar to agency personnel;</P>
            <P>(2) Description of the records including agency function, physical type(s) and informational content;</P>
            <P>(3) Disposition instructions developed using the following guidelines:</P>
            <P>(i) If the record series, component of an electronic information system, or appropriate aggregation of series and/or automated system components is current and continuing, the SF 115 must include file breaks, retention period or event after which the records will be destroyed, and, if appropriate, transfer period for retiring inactive records to an approved records storage facility.</P>

            <P>(ii) If the records series, system, or other aggregation is nonrecurring, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> no additional records will be created or acquired, the SF 115 must specify either immediate destruction or destruction on a future date.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Determination.</E> If NARA determines that the proposed disposition is not consistent with the value of the records, it will request that the agency make appropriate changes.</P>
            <P>(1) If NARA determines that records proposed as temporary merit permanent retention and transfer to the National Archives of the United States, the agency must change the disposition instruction prior to approval of the SF 115.</P>
            <P>(2) If NARA and the agency cannot agree on the retention period for an item(s), the items(s) will be withdrawn. In these cases, the agency must submit an SF 115 with a revised proposal for disposition; unscheduled records must be treated as permanent until a new schedule is approved.</P>

            <SUBJECT>How do agencies request records disposition authority?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Federal agencies submit an SF 115 to NARA to request authority to schedule (establish the disposition for) permanent and temporary records, either on a recurring or one-time basis.</P>
            <P>(b) SF 115s include only records not covered by the General Records Schedules (GRS) (see part 1227 of this subchapter), deviations from the GRS (see § 1227.12 of this subchapter), or previously scheduled records requiring changes in retention periods or substantive changes in description.</P>
            <P>(c) SF 115s do not include nonrecord material. The disposition of nonrecord materials is determined by agencies and does not require NARA approval.</P>
            <P>(d) The following elements are required on a SF 115:</P>
            <P>(1) Title and description of the records covered by each item.</P>
            <P>(2) Disposition instructions that can be readily applied. Records schedules must provide for:</P>
            <P>(i) The destruction of records that no longer have sufficient value to justify further retention (see § 1224.10(b) of this subchapter); and</P>
            <P>(ii) The identification of potentially permanent records and provisions for their transfer to the legal custody of NARA.</P>
            <P>(3) Certification that the records proposed for disposition are not now needed for the business of the agency or will not be needed after the specified retention periods. The signature of the authorized agency representative on the SF 115 provides certification.</P>
            <P>(e) NARA will return SF 115s that are improperly prepared. The agency must make the necessary corrections and resubmit the form to NARA.</P>

            <P>(1) Program records less than 3 years old,</P>

            <P>(2) Deviations from General Records Schedule 2-10 (see § 1227.10 of this subchapter for a definition of general records schedules), and<PRTPAGE P="591"/>

            <P>Agencies must submit an SF 115, Request for Records Disposition Authority, to NARA in the following situations:</P>
            <P>(a) If an interagency reorganization reassigns functions to an existing department or agency, the gaining organization must submit an SF 115 to NARA within one year of the reorganization. Schedules approved for one department or independent agency do not apply to records of other departments or agencies.</P>
            <P>(b) If a new department or agency assumes functions from an existing one, the new agency must schedule records documenting the acquired functions and all other records not covered by the GRS within two years.</P>
            <P>(c) If an agency needs to deviate from retention periods in the GRS.</P>
            <P>(d) If an agency needs to change retention periods for records previously appraised as temporary by NARA.</P>
            <P>(e) If an agency needs to change the approved disposition of records from permanent to temporary or vice versa.</P>
            <P>(f) If an agency needs to modify the description of records because the informational content of the records and/or the function documented by the records changes.</P>
            <P>(g) If an agency decides to change the scope of the records schedule items to include a greater or lesser aggregation of records (see § 1225.12(c)), unless § 1225.24 applies.</P>
            <P>(h) Agencies must submit a new schedule to NARA for electronic versions of previously scheduled records if:</P>
            <P>(1) The content and function of the records have changed significantly (e.g., the electronic records contain information that is substantially different from the information included in the hard copy series or are used for different purposes).</P>
            <P>(2) The previously approved schedule explicitly excludes electronic records.</P>
            <P>(3) The electronic records consist of program records maintained on an agency Web site.</P>
            <P>(4) The electronic records consist of temporary program records maintained in a format other than scanned image AND the previously approved schedule is not media neutral.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1225.24</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>When can an agency apply previously approved schedules to electronic records?</SUBJECT>
            <P>If the conditions specified in § 1225.22(h) do not apply, the following conditions apply:</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Permanent records.</E> (1) The agency may apply a previously approved schedule for hard copy records to electronic versions of the permanent records when the electronic records system replaces a single series of hard copy permanent records or the electronic records consist of information drawn from multiple previously scheduled permanent series. Agencies must notify NARA, by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Office of the Chief Records Officer (AC); 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001, or by email at <E T="03">RM.Communications@nara.gov</E>, in writing of series of records that have been previously scheduled as permanent in hard copy form, including special media records as described in 36 CFR 1235.52 of this subchapter. An agency should send the notification to the NARA unit that processes its schedules. The notification must be submitted within 90 days of when the electronic recordkeeping system becomes operational and must contain the:</P>
            <P>(i) Name of agency;</P>
            <P>(ii) Name of the electronic system;</P>
            <P>(iii) Organizational unit(s) or agency program that records support;</P>
            <P>(iv) Current disposition authority reference; and</P>

            <P>(v) Format of the records (e.g., database, scanned images, digital photographs, <E T="03">etc.</E>).</P>

            <P>(2) If the electronic records include information drawn from both temporary and permanent hard copy series, an agency either may apply a previously approved permanent disposition authority, after submitting the notification required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section or may submit a new schedule if the agency believes the electronic records do not warrant permanent retention.<PRTPAGE P="592"/>
            </P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Temporary still pictures, sound recordings, motion picture film, and video recordings.</E> The agency must apply the previously approved schedule to digital versions. If changes in the approved schedule are required, follow § 1225.26.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Scanned images of temporary records, including temporary program records.</E> The agency must apply the previously approved schedule. If changes in the approved schedule are required, follow § 1225.26.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Other temporary records maintained in an electronic format other than scanned images.</E> (1) For temporary records that are covered by an item in a General Records Schedule (other than those General Records Schedule items that exclude electronic master files and databases) or an agency-specific schedule that pertains to administrative housekeeping activities, apply the previously approved schedule. If the electronic records consist of information drawn from multiple hard copy series, apply the previously approved schedule item with the longest retention period.</P>

            <P>(2) For temporary program records covered by a NARA-approved media neutral schedule item (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, the item appears on a schedule submitted to NARA for approval before December 17, 2007, that is explicitly stated to be media neutral, or it appears on a schedule submitted to NARA for approval on or after December 17, 2007, that is not explicitly limited to a specific recordkeeping medium), apply the previously approved schedule.</P>

            <SUBJECT>How do agencies change a disposition authority?</SUBJECT>
            <P>Agencies must submit an SF 115 to permanently change the approved disposition of records. Disposition authorities are automatically superseded by approval of a later SF 115 for the same records unless the later SF 115 specifies an effective date. As provided in § 1226.20(c) of this subchapter, agencies are authorized to retain records eligible for destruction until the new schedule is approved.</P>
            <P>(a) SF 115s that revise previously approved disposition authorities must cite all of the following, if applicable:</P>
            <P>(1) The SF 115 and item numbers to be superseded;</P>
            <P>(2) The General Records Schedules and item numbers that cover the records, if any; and</P>
            <P>(3) The current published records disposition manual and item numbers; or the General Records Schedules and item numbers that cover the records.</P>
            <P>(b) Agencies must submit with the SF 115 an explanation and justification for the change.</P>
            <P>(c) For temporary retention of records beyond their normal retention period, see § 1226.18 of this subchapter.</P>

            <P>(d) Agencies must secure NARA approval of a change in the period of time that permanent records will remain in agency legal custody prior to transfer to the National Archives of the United States. To request approval, agencies send written requests to NARA, by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Office of the Chief Records Officer (AC); 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001, or by email at <E T="03">RM.Communications@nara.gov.</E> NARA approval is documented as an annotation to the schedule item. A new SF 115 is not required to extend the time period of agency legal custody.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What are the limitations in applying approved records schedules?</SUBJECT>
            <P>Agencies must apply the approved records disposition schedules to their agency's records as follows</P>
            <P>(a) Records described by items marked “disposition not approved” or “withdrawn” may not be destroyed until a specific disposition has been approved by NARA.</P>
            <P>(b) Disposition authorities for items on approved SF 115s that specify an organizational component of the department or independent agency as the creator or custodian of the records may be applied to the same records after internal reorganization, but only if the nature, content, and functional importance of the records remain the same. Authority approved for items described in a functional format may be applied to any organizational component within the department or independent agency that is responsible for the relevant function.</P>
            <P>(c) Disposition authorities approved for one department or independent agency may not be applied to records of another department or agency. Departments or agencies that acquire records from another department or agency, and/or continue creating the same series of records previously created by another department or agency through interagency reorganization must promptly submit an SF 115 to NARA for disposition authorization. Until the new records schedule is approved, the records are unscheduled. See § 1225.22 of this subchapter.</P>
            <P>(d) Unless otherwise specified, newly approved disposition authorities apply retroactively to all existing records as described in the schedule.</P>
            <P>(e) When required by court order (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, order for expungement or destruction), an agency may destroy temporary <PRTPAGE P="594"/>records before their NARA-authorized disposition date. In accordance with § 1230.14 of this subchapter, an agency must notify NARA, by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Office of the Chief Records Officer (AC); 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001, or by email at <E T="03">RM.Communications@nara.gov,</E> when permanent or unscheduled records are to be destroyed in response to a court order. If the records have significant historical value, NARA will promptly advise the agency of any concerns over their destruction.</P>

            <P>(a) When required to ensure the preservation of Government records, or when required by an emergency, or to maintain efficiency of Government operations, NARA will withdraw disposal authorizations in approved schedules (44 U.S.C. 2909). This withdrawal may apply to particular items on agency schedules or may apply to all existing authorizations for a specified type of record in any or all agencies.</P>
            <P>(b) To both impose and rescind the withdrawal, NARA will notify the affected agency or agencies in writing, either by letter or NARA bulletin.</P>

            <P>(a) Agencies may temporarily retain records approved for destruction beyond their NARA-approved retention period if special circumstances alter the normal administrative, legal, or fiscal value of the records.</P>
            <P>(1) Agencies must not retain records whose disposal after a specified period is required by statute, unless retention is ordered by a Court.</P>
            <P>(2) In determining whether or not to temporarily extend the retention period of records, agencies must ensure that the extension of retention is consistent with the requirement contained in 5 U.S.C. 552a (Privacy Act of 1974, as amended) that records concerning individuals are maintained only if relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the agency that is required by law or Executive order.</P>
            <P>(b) If the records that are to be temporarily retained beyond their approved destruction date have been transferred to records storage facilities, agencies must notify the facility.</P>
            <P>(c) Once the special circumstances that require extended retention of records have elapsed, agencies must destroy the records in accordance with the NARA-approved disposition instructions.</P>
            <P>(d) Agencies must submit an SF 115 to NARA to change schedule provisions on a continuing basis in accordance with § 1225.26 of this subchapter. Agencies may retain records eligible for destruction until the new schedule is approved.</P>

            <P>(a) Agencies must secure NARA written approval to retain records series or systems that are eligible for destruction under NARA-approved schedules except when:</P>
            <P>(1) The agency has requested a change in the records schedule in accordance with § 1225.26 of this subchapter, in which case the agency is authorized to retain records eligible for destruction until the new SF 115 is approved;</P>
            <P>(2) The records will be needed for less than one year; or</P>
            <P>(3) A court order requires retention of the records.</P>

            <P>(b) To request an extension, agencies must send a letter to NARA, by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Office of the Chief Records Officer (AC); 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001, or by email at <E T="03">RM.Communications@nara.gov.</E> Along with a justification, the request must include:</P>

            <P>(b) Within six months after the destruction of any records under this authorization, the agency official who directed the destruction must submit to NARA, by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Office of the Chief Records Officer (AC); 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001, or by email at <E T="03">RM.Communications@nara.gov,</E> a written statement explaining the reasons for the destruction and a description of the records and how, when, and where the destruction was accomplished.</P>

            <P>An agency must meet the following requirements before it transfers records to a records storage facility:</P>
            <P>(a) Ensure that the requirements of 36 CFR part 1234 are met. Special attention must be paid to ensuring appropriate storage conditions for records on non-paper based media (e.g., film, audio tape, magnetic tape), especially those that are scheduled for long-term or permanent retention, as those records typically require more stringent environmental controls (see 36 CFR parts 1236 and 1237).</P>

            <P>(b) To transfer unscheduled records, notify NARA in writing prior to the transfer, by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Office of the Chief Records Officer (AC); 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001, or by email at <E T="03">RM.Communications@nara.gov.</E> The notification must identify the records storage facility and include a copy of the information required by § 1232.16(a).</P>
            <P>(c) For all records being transferred, create documentation sufficient to identify and locate files. (See § 1232.16.)</P>
            <P>(d) Ensure that NARA-approved retention periods are implemented properly and that records documenting final disposition actions (destruction or transfer to the National Archives of the United States) are created and maintained.</P>

            <P>(1) Creating office;</P>
            <P>(2) Series title;</P>
            <P>(3) Description (in the case of permanent or unscheduled records, the description must include a folder title list of the box contents or equivalent detailed records description);</P>
            <P>(4) Date span;</P>
            <P>(5) Physical form and medium of records (e.g., paper, motion picture film, sound recordings, photographs, or digital images);</P>
            <P>(6) Volume;</P>
            <P>(7) Citation to NARA-approved records schedule or agency records disposition manual (unscheduled records must cite the date the agency notified NARA or, if available, the date the SF 115 was submitted to NARA);</P>
            <P>(8) Restrictions on access if applicable;</P>
            <P>(9) Disposition (“permanent,” “temporary,” or “unscheduled; SF 115 pending”);</P>
            <P>(10) Date of disposition action (transfer to the National Archives of the United States or destruction);</P>
            <P>(11) Physical location, including name and address of facility; and</P>
            <P>(12) Control number or identifier used to track records.</P>

            <P>(b) In the case of permanent and unscheduled records, provide copies of such documentation to NARA and advise NARA in writing of the new location whenever the records are moved to a new storage facility. For permanent records, the agency must transmit this documentation to NARA no later than 30 days after transferring records to the agency records center or commercial records storage facility. Transmit documentation by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Office of the Chief Records Officer (AC); 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001, or by email at <E T="03">RM.Communications@nara.gov.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(1) Retain temporary records until the expiration of their NARA-approved retention period and no longer, except as provided for in § 1226.18 of this subchapter.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What procedures must an agency follow to transfer records to an agency records center or commercial records storage facility?</SUBJECT>

            <P>Federal agencies must use the following procedures to transfer records to an agency records center or commercial records storage facility:<PRTPAGE P="604"/>
            </P>
            <P>(a) Agreements with agency records centers or contracts with commercial records storage facilities must incorporate the standards in 36 CFR part 1234 and allow for inspections by the agency and NARA to ensure compliance. An agency must remove records promptly from a facility if deficiencies identified during an inspection are not corrected within six months of issuance of the report.</P>
            <P>(b) For temporary records, the agency must make available to NARA on request the documentation specified in § 1232.16.</P>
            <P>(c) Retain temporary records until the expiration of their NARA-approved retention period and no longer, except as provided for in § 1226.18 of this subchapter.</P>
            <P>(d) Ensure that NARA-approved retention periods are implemented properly and that records documenting final disposition actions (destruction or transfer to the National Archives of the United States) are created and maintained as required by 36 CFR 1232.14.</P>
            <P>(1) Agencies must establish procedures that ensure that temporary records are destroyed in accordance with NARA-approved records schedules and that NARA-approved changes to schedules, including the General Records Schedules, are applied to records in agency records centers or commercial records storage facilities in a timely fashion. Procedures must include a requirement that the agency records center or commercial records storage facility notify agency records managers or the creating office before the disposal of temporary records unless disposal of temporary records is initiated by the agency.</P>
            <P>(2) Move temporary records that are subsequently reappraised as permanent to a facility that meets the environmental control requirements for permanent records in § 1234.14 of this subchapter within one year of their re-appraisal, if not already in such a facility. (Paper-based permanent records in an existing records storage facility that does not meet the environmental control requirements in § 1234.14 of this subchapter on October 1, 2009, must be moved from that facility no later than February 28, 2010.)</P>
            <P>(3) Agencies must establish procedures to ensure that the agency records centers or commercial records storage facilities transfer permanent records to the National Archives of the United States as individual series spanning one or more years and in accordance with the provisions of part 1235 of this subchapter.</P>
            <P>(e) Agencies must ensure that records that are restricted because they are security classified or exempt from disclosure by statute, including the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a, as amended), or regulation are stored and maintained in accordance with applicable laws, Executive orders, or regulations.</P>
            <P>(f) Agencies must ensure that temporary records, including restricted records (security classified or exempted from disclosure by statute, including the Privacy Act of 1974, or regulation), are destroyed in accordance with the requirements specified in § 1226.24 of this subchapter.</P>
            <P>(g) Agencies must ensure that emergency operating vital records, as defined in 36 CFR part 1223, that are transferred to an agency records center or commercial records storage facility are available in accordance with 36 CFR 1223.24.</P>
            <P>(h) Provide access to appropriate NARA staff to records wherever they are located in order to conduct an inspection in accordance with 36 CFR part 1239 or to process a request for records disposition authority.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What are the facility requirements for all records storage facilities?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The facility must be constructed with non-combustible materials and building elements, including walls, columns and floors. There are two exceptions to this requirement:</P>
              <P>(1) Roof elements may be constructed with combustible materials if installed in accordance with local building codes and if roof elements are protected by a properly installed, properly maintained wet-pipe automatic sprinkler system, as specified in NFPA 13 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3).</P>

              <P>(2) An agency may request a waiver of the requirement specified in paragraph (a) from NARA for an existing records storage facility with combustible building elements to continue to operate until October 1, 2009. In its request for a waiver, the agency must provide documentation that the facility has a fire suppression system specifically designed to mitigate this hazard and that the system meets the requirements of § 1234.12(s). Submit waiver requests to NARA by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Storage Coordination and Logistics (B-AD); 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001.<PRTPAGE P="611"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) A facility with two or more stories must be designed or reviewed by a licensed fire protection engineer and civil/structural engineer to avoid catastrophic failure of the structure due to an uncontrolled fire on one of the intermediate floor levels. For new buildings the seals on the construction drawings serve as proof of this review. For existing buildings, this requirement may be demonstrated by a professional letter of opinion under seal by a licensed fire protection engineer that the fire resistance of the separating floor(s) is/(are) at least four hours, and a professional letter of opinion under seal by a licensed civil/structural engineer that there are no obvious structural weaknesses that would indicate a high potential for structural catastrophic collapse under fire conditions.</P>
              <P>(c) The building must be sited a minimum of five feet above and 100 feet from any 100 year flood plain areas, or be protected by an appropriate flood wall that conforms to local or regional building codes.</P>
              <P>(d) The facility must be designed in accordance with the applicable national, regional, state, or local building codes (whichever is most stringent) to provide protection from building collapse or failure of essential equipment from earthquake hazards, tornadoes, hurricanes and other potential natural disasters.</P>
              <P>(e) Roads, fire lanes and parking areas must permit unrestricted access for emergency vehicles.</P>
              <P>(f) A floor load limit must be established for the records storage area by a licensed structural engineer. The limit must take into consideration the height and type of the shelving or storage equipment, the width of the aisles, the configuration of the space, etc. The allowable load limit must be posted in a conspicuous place and must not be exceeded.</P>
              <P>(g) The facility must ensure that the roof membrane does not permit water to penetrate the roof. NARA strongly recommends that this requirement be met by not mounting equipment on the roof and placing nothing else on the roof that may cause damage to the roof membrane. Alternatively, a facility may meet this requirement with stringent design specifications for roof-mounted equipment in conjunction with a periodic roof inspection program performed by appropriately certified professionals.</P>
              <P>(1) New records storage facilities must meet the requirements in this paragraph (g) beginning on September 28, 2005.</P>
              <P>(2) Existing facilities must meet the requirements in this paragraph (g) no later than October 1, 2009.</P>
              <P>(h) Piping (with the exception of fire protection sprinkler piping and storm water roof drainage piping) must not be run through records storage areas unless supplemental measures such as gutters or shields are used to prevent water leaks and the piping assembly is inspected for potential leaks regularly. If drainage piping from roof drains must be run though records storage areas, the piping must be run to the nearest vertical riser and must include a continuous gutter sized and installed beneath the lateral runs to prevent leakage into the storage area. Vertical pipe risers required to be installed in records storage areas must be fully enclosed by shaft construction with appropriate maintenance access panels.</P>
              <P>(1) New records storage facilities must meet the requirements in this paragraph (h) beginning on September 28, 2005.</P>
              <P>(2) Existing facilities must meet the requirements in this paragraph (h) no later than October 1, 2009.</P>
              <P>(i) The following standards apply to records storage shelving and racking systems:</P>
              <P>(1) All storage shelving and racking systems must be designed and installed to provide seismic bracing that meets the requirements of the applicable state, regional, and local building code (whichever is most stringent);</P>
              <P>(2) Racking systems, steel shelving, or other open-shelf records storage equipment must be braced to prevent collapse under full load. Each racking system or shelving unit must be industrial style shelving rated at least 50 pounds per cubic foot supported by the shelf;</P>

              <P>(3) Compact mobile shelving systems (if used) must be designed to permit proper air circulation and fire protection. Request detailed specifications that meet this requirement from <PRTPAGE P="612"/>NARA by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Storage Coordination and Logistics (B-AD); 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001.</P>
              <P>(j) The area occupied by the records storage facility must be equipped with an anti-intrusion alarm system, or equivalent, meeting the requirements of UL 1076 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3), level AA, to protect against unlawful entry after hours and to monitor designated interior storage spaces. This intrusion alarm system must be monitored in accordance with UL 611, (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3).</P>
              <P>(k) The facility must comply with the requirements for a Level III facility as defined in the Department of Justice, U. S. Marshals Service report Vulnerability Assessment of Federal Facilities dated June 28, 1995. These requirements are provided in Appendix A to this part 1234. Agencies may require compliance with Level IV or Level V facility security requirements if the facility is classified at the higher level.</P>
              <P>(l) Records contaminated by hazardous materials, such as radioactive isotopes or toxins, infiltrated by insects, or exhibiting active mold growth must be stored in separate areas having separate air handling systems from other records.</P>
              <P>(m) To eliminate damage to records and/or loss of information due to insects, rodents, mold and other pests that are attracted to organic materials under specific environmental conditions, the facility must have an Integrated Pest Management program as defined in the Food Protection Act of 1996 (Section 303, Pub. L. 104-170, 110 Stat. 1512). This states in part that Integrated Pest Management is a sustainable approach to managing pests by combining biological, cultural, physical, and chemical tools in a way that minimizes economic, health, and environmental risks. The IPM program emphasizes three fundamental elements:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Prevention.</E> IPM is a preventive maintenance process that seeks to identify and eliminate potential pest access, shelter, and nourishment. It also continually monitors for pests themselves, so that small infestations do not become large ones;</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Least-toxic methods.</E> IPM aims to minimize both pesticide use and risk through alternate control techniques and by favoring compounds, formulations, and application methods that present the lowest potential hazard to humans and the environment; and</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Systems approach.</E> The IPM pest control contract must be effectively coordinated with all other relevant programs that operate in and around a building, including plans and procedures involving design and construction, repairs and alterations, cleaning, waste management, food service, and other activities.</P>
              <P>(n) For new records storage facilities only, the additional requirements in this paragraph (n) must be met:</P>
              <P>(1) Do not install mechanical equipment, excluding material handling and conveyance equipment that have operating thermal breakers on the motor, containing motors rated in excess of 1 HP within records storage areas (either floor mounted or suspended from roof support structures).</P>

              <P>(2) Do not install high-voltage electrical distribution equipment (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> 13.2kv or higher switchgear and transformers) within records storage areas (either floor mounted or suspended from roof support structures).</P>
              <P>(3) A redundant source of primary electric service such as a second primary service feeder should be provided to ensure continuous, dependable service to the facility especially to the HVAC systems, fire alarm and fire protection systems. Manual switching between sources of service is acceptable.</P>
              <P>(4) A facility storing permanent records must be kept under positive air pressure, especially in the area of the loading dock. In addition, to prevent fumes from vehicle exhausts from entering the facility, air intake louvers must not be located in the area of the loading dock, adjacent to parking areas, or in any location where a vehicle engine may be running for any period of time. Loading docks must have an air supply and exhaust system that is separate from the remainder of the facility.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What are the fire safety requirements that apply to records storage facilities?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The fire detection and protection systems must be designed or reviewed by a licensed fire protection engineer. If the system was not designed by a licensed fire protection engineer, the review requirement is met by furnishing a report under the seal of a licensed fire protection engineer that describes the design intent of the fire detection and suppression system, detailing the characteristics of the system, and describing the specific measures beyond the minimum features required by code that have been incorporated to minimize loss. The report should make specific reference to appropriate industry standards used in the design, such as those issued by the National Fire Protection Association, and any testing or modeling or other sources used in the design.</P>
              <P>(b) All interior walls separating records storage areas from each other and from other storage areas in the building must be at least three-hour fire barrier walls. A records storage facility may not store more than 250,000 cubic feet total of Federal records in a single records storage area. When Federal records are combined with other records in a single records storage area, only the Federal records will apply toward this limitation.</P>
              <P>(c) Fire barrier walls that meet the following specifications must be provided:</P>
              <P>(1) For existing records storage facilities, at least one-hour-rated fire barrier walls must be provided between the records storage areas and other auxiliary spaces.</P>
              <P>(2) For new records storage facilities, two-hour-rated fire barrier walls must be provided between the records storage areas and other auxiliary spaces. One exterior wall of each stack area must be designed with a maximum fire resistive rating of one hour, or, if rated more than one hour, there must be at least one knock-out panel in one exterior wall of each stack area.</P>
              <P>(d) Penetrations in the walls must not reduce the specified fire resistance ratings. The fire resistance ratings of structural elements and construction assemblies must be in accordance with ASTM E 119-98 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3).</P>
              <P>(e) The fire resistive rating of the roof must be a minimum of <FR>1/2</FR> hour for all records storage facilities, or must be protected by an automatic sprinkler system designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA 13 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3).</P>
              <P>(f) Openings in fire barrier walls separating records storage areas must be avoided to the greatest extent possible. If openings are necessary, they must be protected by self-closing or automatic Class A fire doors, or equivalent doors that maintain the same rating as the wall.</P>
              <P>(g) Roof support structures that cross or penetrate fire barrier walls must be cut and supported independently on each side of the fire barrier wall.</P>
              <P>(h) If fire barrier walls are erected with expansion joints, the joints must be protected to their full height.</P>
              <P>(i) Building columns in the records storage areas must be at least 1-hour fire resistant or protected in accordance with NFPA 13 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3).</P>
              <P>(j) Automatic roof vents for routine ventilation purposes must not be designed into new records storage facilities. Automatic roof vents, designed solely to vent in the case of a fire, with a temperature rating at least twice that of the sprinkler heads are acceptable.</P>

              <P>(k) Where lightweight steel roof or floor supporting members (e.g., bar joists having top chords with angles 2 by 12 inches or smaller, 1/4-inch thick or smaller, and 13/16-inch or smaller Web diameters) are present, they must be protected either by applying a 10-minute fire resistive coating to the top chords of the joists, or by retrofitting the sprinkler system with large drop sprinkler heads. If a fire resistive coating is applied, it must be a product that will not release (off gas) harmful fumes into the facility. If fire resistive coating is subject to air erosion or flaking, it must be fully enclosed in a drywall containment constructed of metal studs with fire retardant drywall. Retrofitting may require modifications to the piping system to ensure that adequate water capacity and pressure are provided in the areas <PRTPAGE P="614"/>to be protected with these large drop sprinkler heads.</P>
              <P>(l) Open flame (oil or gas) unit heaters or equipment, if used in records storage areas, must be installed or used in the records storage area in accordance with NFPA 54 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3), and the IAPMO/ANSI UMC 1, Uniform Mechanical Code (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3).</P>
              <P>(m) For existing records storage facilities, boiler rooms or rooms containing equipment operating with a fuel supply (such as generator rooms) must be separated from records storage areas by 2-hour-rated fire barrier walls with no openings directly from these rooms to the records storage areas. Such areas must be vented directly to the outside to a location where fumes will not be drawn back into the facility.</P>
              <P>(n) For new records storage facilities, boiler rooms or rooms containing equipment operating with a fuel supply (such as generator rooms) must be separated from records storage areas by 4-hour-rated fire barrier walls with no openings directly from these rooms to the records storage areas. Such areas must be vented directly to the outside to a location where fumes will not be drawn back into the facility.</P>
              <P>(o) For new records storage facilities, fuel supply lines must not be installed in areas containing records and must be separated from such areas with 4-hour rated construction assemblies.</P>
              <P>(p) Equipment rows running perpendicular to the wall must comply with NFPA 101 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3), with respect to egress requirements.</P>
              <P>(q) No oil-type electrical transformers, regardless of size, except thermally protected devices included in fluorescent light ballasts, may be installed in the records storage areas. All electrical wiring must be in metal conduit, except that armored cable may be used where flexible wiring connections to light fixtures are required. Battery charging areas for electric forklifts must be separated from records storage areas with at least a 2-hour rated fire barrier wall.</P>
              <P>(r) Hazardous materials, including records on cellulose nitrate film, must not be stored in records storage areas. Nitrate motion picture film and nitrate sheet film may be stored in separate areas that meet the requirements of the appropriate NFPA standards, NFPA 40-1997 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3), or NFPA 42 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3).</P>
              <P>(s) All record storage and adjoining areas must be protected by a professionally-designed fire-safety detection and suppression system that is designed to limit the maximum anticipated loss in any single fire event involving a single ignition and no more than 8 ounces of accelerant to a maximum of 300 cubic feet of records destroyed by fire. Section 1234.32 specifies how to document compliance with this requirement.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What are the requirements for environmental controls for records storage facilities?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Paper-based temporary records.</E> Paper-based temporary records must be stored under environmental conditions that prevent the active growth of mold. Exposure to moisture through leaks or condensation, relative humidities in excess of 70%, extremes of heat combined with relative humidity in excess of 55%, and poor air circulation during periods of elevated heat and relative humidity are all factors that contribute to mold growth.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Nontextual temporary records.</E> Nontextual temporary records, including microforms and audiovisual and electronic records, must be stored in records storage space that is designed to preserve them for their full retention period. New records storage facilities that store nontextual temporary records must meet the requirements in this paragraph (b) beginning on September 28, 2005. Existing records storage facilities that store nontextual temporary records must meet the requirements in this paragraph (b) no later than October 1, 2009. At a minimum, nontextual temporary records must be stored in records storage space that meets the requirements for medium term storage set by the appropriate standard in this paragraph (b). In general, medium term conditions as defined by these standards are those that will ensure the preservation of the <PRTPAGE P="615"/>materials for at least 10 years with little information degradation or loss. Records may continue to be usable for longer than 10 years when stored under these conditions, but with an increasing risk of information loss or degradation with longer times. If temporary records require retention longer than 10 years, better storage conditions (cooler and drier) than those specified for medium term storage will be needed to maintain the usability of these records. The applicable standards are:</P>
              <P>(1) ANSI/PIMA IT9.11 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3);</P>
              <P>(2) ANSI/NAPM IT9.23 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3);</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Paper-based permanent, unscheduled and sample/select records.</E> Paper-based permanent, unscheduled, and sample/select records must be stored in records storage space that provides 24 hour/365 days per year air conditioning (temperature, humidity, and air exchange) equivalent to that required for office space. See ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3), and ASHRAE Standard 62 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3), for specific requirements. New records storage facilities that store paper-based permanent, unscheduled, and/or sample/select records must meet the requirement in this paragraph (c) beginning on September 28, 2005. Existing storage facilities that store paper-based permanent, unscheduled, and/or sample/select records must meet the requirement in this paragraph (c) no later than October 1, 2009.</P>

              <SUBJECT>How does an agency request authority to establish or relocate records storage facilities?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General policy.</E> Agencies are responsible for ensuring that records in their legal custody are stored in appropriate space as outlined in this part. Under § 1232.18(a), agencies are responsible for initiating action to remove records from space that does not meet these standards if deficiencies are not corrected within 6 months after initial discovery of the deficiencies by NARA or the agency and to complete removal of the records within 18 months after initial discovery of the deficiencies.<PRTPAGE P="617"/>
              </P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Agency records centers.</E> Agencies must obtain prior written approval from NARA before establishing or relocating an agency records center. Each separate agency records center must be specifically approved by NARA prior to the transfer of any records to that individual facility. If an agency records center has been approved for the storage of Federal records of one agency, any other agency that proposes to store its records in that facility must still obtain NARA approval to do so.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Commercial records storage facilities.</E> An agency may contract for commercial records storage services. However, before any agency records are transferred to a commercial records storage facility, the transferring agency must ensure that the facility meets all of the requirements for an agency records storage facility set forth in this subpart and must submit the documentation required in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Exclusions.</E> For purposes of this section, the term “agency records center” excludes NARA-owned and operated records centers. For purposes of this section and § 1234.34, the term “agency records center” also excludes agency records staging and/or holding areas with a capacity for containing less than 25,000 cubic feet of records. However, such records centers and areas, including records centers operated and maintained by NARA, must comply with the facility standards in §§ 1234.10 through 1234.14.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Content of requests for agency records centers.</E> Submit requests for authority to establish or relocate an agency records center, or to use an agency records center operated by another agency, to NARA by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Storage Coordination and Logistics (B-AD); 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001. The request must identify the specific facility and, for requests to establish or relocate the agency's own records center, document compliance with the standards in this subpart. Documentation requirements for § 1234.12(s) are specified in § 1234.32.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Approval of requests for agency records centers.</E> NARA will review the submitted documentation to ensure the facility demonstrates full compliance with the standards in this subpart. NARA reserves the right to visit the facility, if necessary, to make the determination of compliance. NARA will inform the agency of its decision within 45 calendar days after the request is received, and will provide the agency information on the areas of noncompliance if the request is denied. Requests will be denied only if NARA determines that the facility does not demonstrate full compliance with the standards in this subpart. Approvals will be valid for a period of 10 years, unless the facility is materially changed before then or an agency or NARA inspection finds that the facility does not meet the standards in this subpart. Material changes require submission of a new request for NARA approval.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Documentation requirements for storing Federal records in commercial records storage facilities.</E> At least 45 calendar days before an agency first transfers records to a commercial records storage facility, the agency must submit documentation to NARA that the facility complies with the standards in this subpart.The documentation may take the form of a copy of the agency's contract that incorporates this subpart in its provisions or a statement from the agency records officer that certifies that the facility meets the standards in this subpart.An agency must provide the documentation for each separate commercial records storage facility where its records will be stored.Send documentation to NARA by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Storage Coordination and Logistics (B-AD); 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001. The agency must submit updated documentation to NARA every 10 years if it continues to store records in that commercial records storage facility.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What does an agency have to do to certify a fire-safety detection and suppression system?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Content of documentation.</E> The agency must submit documentation to NARA, by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Storage Coordination and Logistics (B-AD); <PRTPAGE P="618"/>8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001, that describes the space being protected (e.g., the type and stacking height of the storage equipment used, or how the space is designed, controlled, and operated) and the characteristics of the fire-safety detection and suppression system used. The documentation must demonstrate how that system meets the requirement in § 1234.12(s) through:</P>
              <P>(1) A statement that the facility is using a NARA certified system as described in Appendix B to this part;</P>
              <P>(2) A report of the results of independent live fire testing (Factory Mutual, Underwriters Laboratories or Southwest Research Institute); or</P>
              <P>(3) A report under seal of a licensed fire protection engineer that:</P>
              <P>(i) Describes the design intent of the fire suppression system to limit the maximum anticipated loss in any single fire event involving a single ignition and no more than 8 fluid ounces of petroleum-type hydrocarbon accelerant (such as, for example, heptanes or gasoline) to a maximum of 300 cubic feet of Federal records destroyed by fire. The report need not predict a maximum single event loss at any specific number, but rather should describe the design intent of the fire suppression system. The report may make reasonable engineering and other assumptions such as that the fire department responds within XX minutes (the local fire department's average response time) and promptly commences suppression actions. In addition, any report prepared under this paragraph should assume that the accelerant is saturated in a cotton wick that is 3 inches in diameter and 6 inches long and sealed in a plastic bag and that the fire is started in an aisle at the face of a carton at floor level. Assumptions must be noted in the report;</P>
              <P>(ii) Details the characteristics of the system; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Describes the specific measures beyond the minimum features required by the applicable building code that have been incorporated to limit destruction of records. The report should make specific references to industry standards used in the design, such as those issued by the National Fire Protection Association, and any testing or modeling or other sources used in the design.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">NARA action.</E> (1) NARA will approve the fire-safety detection and suppression system within 10 work days if NARA has previously approved the system design for similarly configured space or if a report of independent testing of a new system design is furnished as documentation.</P>
              <P>(2) If, in NARA's judgment, the supporting documentation provided in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section clearly demonstrates compliance with § 1234.12(s), NARA will approve the fire-safety detection and suppression system within 30 calendar days.</P>
              <P>(3) If NARA questions whether supporting documentation demonstrates compliance with § 1234.12(s), NARA will consult the appropriate industry standards body or other qualified expert before making a determination. Before any consultation, NARA may ask the agency for additional clarifying information. NARA will notify the requesting agency within 30 calendar days of receipt of the request that consultation is necessary and will provide a final determination within 60 calendar days. If NARA does not approve the system, NARA will furnish a full explanation of the reasons for its decision.</P>
              <P>(4) NARA will maintain a list of approved alternative systems.</P>

              <SUBJECT>When may NARA conduct an inspection of a records storage facility?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) At the time an agency submits a request to establish an agency records center, pursuant to § 1234.30, NARA may conduct an inspection of the proposed facility to ensure that the facility complies fully with the standards in this subpart. NARA may also conduct periodic inspections of agency records centers so long as such facility is used as an agency records center. NARA will inspect its own records center facilities on a periodic basis to ensure that they are in compliance with the requirements of this subpart.</P>

              <P>(b) Agencies must ensure, by contract or otherwise, that agency and NARA officials, or their delegates, <PRTPAGE P="619"/>have the right to inspect commercial records storage facilities to ensure that such facilities fully comply with the standards in this subpart. NARA may conduct periodic inspections of commercial records storage facilities so long as agencies use such facilities to store agency records. The using agency, not NARA, will be responsible for paying any fee or charge assessed by the commercial records storage facility for NARA's conducting an inspection.</P>
              <P>(c) NARA will contact the agency operating the records center or the agency holding a contract with a commercial records storage facility in advance to set a date for the inspection.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix B to Part 1234—Alternative Certified Fire-Safety Detection and Suppression System(s)</HD>
              <P>1. <E T="03">General.</E> This Appendix B contains information on the Fire-safety Detection and Suppression System(s) tested by NARA through independent live fire testing that are certified to meet the requirement in § 1234.12(s) for storage of Federal Records. Use of a system specified in this appendix is optional. A facility may choose to have an alternate fire-safety detection and suppression system approved under § 1234.32).</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Specifications for NARA facilities using 15 foot high records storage.</E> NARA fire-safety systems that incorporate all components specified in paragraphs 2.a. through n. of this appendix have been tested and certified to meet the requirements in § 1234.12(s) for an acceptable fire-safety detection and suppression system for storage of Federal records.</P>
              <P>a. The records storage height must not exceed the nominal 15 feet (±3 inches) records storage height.</P>
              <P>b. All records storage and adjoining areas must be protected by automatic wet-pipe sprinklers. Automatic sprinklers are specified herein because they provide the most effective fire protection for high piled storage of paper records on open type shelving.</P>
              <P>c. The sprinkler system must be rated at no higher than 285 degrees Fahrenheit utilizing quick response (QR) fire sprinkler heads and designed by a licensed fire protection engineer to provide the specified density for the most remote 1,500 square feet of floor area at the most remote sprinkler head in accordance with NFPA 13 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3). For facilities with roofs rated at 15 minutes or greater, provide <FR>1/2</FR>″ QR sprinklers rated at no higher than 285 degrees Fahrenheit designed to deliver a density of 0.30 gpm per square foot. For unrated roofs, provide 0.64″ QR “large drop” sprinklers rated at no higher than 285 degrees Fahrenheit. For facilities using 7 or 8 shelf track files, use QR sprinklers rated at no higher than 285 degrees Fahrenheit. For new construction and replacement sprinklers, NARA recommends that the sprinklers be rated at 165 degrees Fahrenheit. Installation of the sprinkler system must be in accordance with NFPA 13 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3).</P>
              <P>d. Maximum spacing of the sprinkler heads must be on a 10-foot grid and the positioning of the heads must provide complete, unobstructed coverage, with a clearance of not less than 18 inches from the top of the highest stored materials.</P>
              <P>e. The sprinkler system must be equipped with a water-flow alarm connected to an audible alarm within the facility and to a continuously staffed fire department or an Underwriters Laboratory approved central monitoring station (see UL 827 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3)) with responsibility for immediate response.</P>
              <P>f. A manual fire alarm system must be provided with a Underwriters Laboratory approved (grade A) central monitoring station service or other automatic means of notifying the municipal fire department. A manual alarm pull station must be located adjacent to each exit. Supplemental manual alarm stations are permitted within the records storage areas.</P>

              <P>g. All water cutoff valves in the sprinkler system must be equipped with automatic closure alarm (tamper alarm) connected to a continuously staffed station, with responsibility for immediate response. If the sprinkler water cutoff valve is located in an area used by the public, in addition to the tamper alarm, the valves must be provided with frangible (easily broken) padlocks.<PRTPAGE P="624"/>
              </P>
              <P>h. A dependable water supply free of interruption must be provided including a continuous site fire loop connected to the water main and sized to support the facility with only one portion of the fire loop operational. This normally requires a backup supply system having sufficient pressure and capacity to meet both fire hose and sprinkler requirements for 2-hours. A fire pump connected to an emergency power source must be provided in accordance with NFPA 20 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3), when adequate water pressure is not assured. In the event that public water mains are not able to supply adequate volumes of water to the site, on-site water storage must be provided.</P>
              <P>i. Interior fire hose stations equipped with a 1<FR>1/2</FR> inch diameter hose may be provided in the records storage areas if required by the local fire department, enabling any point in the records storage area to be reached by a 50-foot hose stream from a 100-foot hose lay. If provided, these cabinets must be marked “For Fire Department Use Only.”</P>
              <P>j. Where fire hose cabinets are not required, fire department hose outlets must be provided at each floor landing in the building core or stair shaft. Hose outlets must have an easily removable adapter and cap. Threads and valves must be compatible with the local fire department's equipment. Spacing must be so that any point in the record storage area can be reached with a 50-foot hose stream from a 100-foot hose lay.</P>
              <P>k. In addition to the designed sprinkler flow demand, 500 gpm must be provided for hose stream demand. The hose stream demand must be calculated into the system at the base of the main sprinkler riser.</P>
              <P>l. Fire hydrants must be located within 250 feet of each exterior entrance or other access to the records storage facility that could be used by firefighters. Each required hydrant must provide a minimum flow capacity of 500 gpm at 20 psi. All hydrants must be at least 50 feet away from the building walls and adjacent to a roadway usable by fire apparatus. Fire hydrants must have at least two, 2<FR>1/2</FR> inch hose outlets and a pumper connection. All threads must be compatible with local standards.</P>
              <P>m. Portable water-type fire extinguishers (2<FR>1/2</FR> gallon stored pressure type) must be provided at each fire alarm striking station. The minimum number and locations of fire extinguishers must be as required by NFPA 10 (incorporated by reference, see § 1234.3).</P>
              <P>n. Single level catwalks without automatic sprinklers installed underneath may be provided in the service aisles if the edges of all files in the front boxes above the catwalks are stored perpendicular to the aisle (to minimize files exfoliation in a fire). Where provided, the walking surface of the catwalks must be of expanded metal at least .09-inch thickness with a 2-inch mesh length. The surface opening ratio must be equal or greater than 0.75. The sprinkler water demand for protection over bays with catwalks where records above the catwalks are not perpendicular to the aisles must be calculated hydraulically to give .30 gpm per square foot for the most remote 2,000 square feet.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> This section specifies the media or method used to transfer permanent records to the National Archives of the United States. (See 36 CFR 1236.28 for the requirements governing the selection of electronic records storage media for current agency use.) The agency must use only media that is are sound and free from defects for transfers to the National Archives of the United States. When permanent electronic records may be disseminated through multiple electronic media (e.g., magnetic tape, CD-ROM) or mechanisms (e.g., FTP), the agency and NARA must agree on the most appropriate medium or method for transfer of the records into the National Archives of the United States.<PRTPAGE P="630"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Magnetic tape.</E> Agencies may transfer electronic records to the National Archives of the United States on magnetic tape as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Open-reel magnetic tape must be on <FR>1/2</FR>-inch 9-track tape reels recorded at 1600 or 6250 bpi that meet ANSI X3.39 or ANSI X3.54 (both incorporated by reference, see § 1235.4), respectively.</P>
              <P>(2) 18-track 3480-class cartridges must be recorded at 37,871 bpi that meet ANSI X3.180 (incorporated by reference see, § 1235.4). The data must be blocked at no more than 32,760 bytes per block.</P>
              <P>(3) For DLT tape IV cartridges, the data must be blocked at no more than 32,760 bytes per block and must conform to the standards cited in the table as follows:</P>

              <P>(1) CD-ROMs used for this purpose must conform to ANSI/NISO/ISO 9660 (incorporated by reference, see § 1235.4).</P>
              <P>(2) Permanent electronic records must be stored in discrete files. Transferred CD-ROMs and DVDs may contain other files, such as software or temporary records, but all permanent records must be in files that contain only permanent records. Agencies must indicate at the time of transfer if a CD-ROM or DVD contains temporary records and where those records are located on the CD-ROM or DVD. The agency must also specify whether NARA should return the CD-ROM or DVD to the agency or dispose of it after copying the permanent records to an archival medium.</P>
              <P>(3) If permanent electronic records are stored on both CD-ROM (or DVD) and other media, such as magnetic tape, the agency and NARA must agree on the medium that will be used to transfer the records into the National Archives of the United States.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">File Transfer Protocol.</E> Agencies may use File Transfer Protocol (FTP) to transfer permanent electronic records to the National Archives of the United States only with NARA's approval. Several important factors may limit the use of FTP as a transfer method, including the number of records, record file size, and available bandwidth. Agencies must contact NARA, by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Special Media Records Division (RDS); 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001, or by email at <E T="03">stillpix.accessions@nara.gov</E> (for digital photographs) or <E T="03">mopix.accessions@nara.gov</E> (for electronic audiovisual records). For all other electronic records formats, contact NARA to initiate the transfer discussions, by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Electronic Records Division (RDE); 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001, or by email at <E T="03">etransfers@nara.gov.</E> Each transfer of electronic records via FTP must be preceded with a signed SF 258 sent to RDE.</P>
              <P>(1) FTP file structure may use the 64-character Joliet extension naming convention only when letters, numbers, dashes (-), and underscores (___) are used in the file and/or directory names, with a slash (/) used to indicate directory structures. Otherwise, FTP file structure must conform to an 8.3 file naming convention and file directory structure as cited in ANSI/NISO/ISO 9660 (incorporated by reference, see § 1235.4).</P>
              <P>(2) Permanent electronic records must be transferred in discrete files, separate from temporary files. All permanent records must be transferred in files that contain only permanent records.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What specifications and standards for transfer apply to electronic records?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) Agencies must transfer electronic records in a format that is independent of specific hardware or software. Except as specified in paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section, the records must be written in American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) or Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code (EBCDIC) with all control characters and other non-data characters removed. Consult NARA about electronic records in other formats, by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Electronic Records Division (RDE); 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001, or by email at <E T="03">etransfers@nara.gov.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(2) Agencies must have advance approval from NARA for compression of the records, and agencies must comply with a request from NARA to provide the software to decompress the records.</P>

              <P>(3) Agencies interested in transferring scheduled electronic records using a Tape Archive (TAR) utility must contact NARA to initiate transfer discussions, by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Electronic Records Division (RDE); 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001, or by email at <E T="03">etransfers@nara.gov.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Data files and databases.</E> Data files and databases must be transferred to the National Archives of the United States as flat files or as rectangular tables; <E T="03">i.e.</E>, as two-dimensional arrays, lists, or tables. All “records” (within the context of the computer program, as opposed to a Federal record) or “tuples,” <E T="03">i.e.</E>, ordered collections of data items, within a file or table must have the same logical format. Each <PRTPAGE P="632"/>data element within a record must contain only one data value. A record must not contain nested repeating groups of data items. The file must not contain extraneous control characters, except record length indicators for variable length records, or marks delimiting a data element, field, record, or file. If records or data elements in different files need to be linked or combined, then each record must contain one or more data elements that constitute primary and/or foreign keys enabling valid linkages between the related records in separate files.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Digital geospatial data files.</E> Digital spatial data files must be transferred to the National Archives of the United States in a format that complies with a non-proprietary, published open standard maintained by or for a Federal, national, or international standards organization. Acceptable transfer formats include the Geography Markup Language (GML) as defined by the Open GIS Consortium.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Textual documents.</E> Electronic textual documents must be transferred as plain ASCII files; however, such files may contain standard markup language such as Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) or XML tags.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Electronic mail, scanned images of textual records, portable document format records, digital photographic records, and web content records.</E> For guidance on transferring these records to NARA, agencies should consult the transfer requirements available online at <E T="03">https://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/policy/transfer-guidance.html</E> or upon request from NARA, by mail at National Archives and Records Administration; Electronic Records Division (RDE); 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001, or by email at <E T="03">etransfers@nara.gov.</E>

              <P>Agencies must design and implement migration strategies to counteract hardware and software dependencies of electronic records whenever the records must be maintained and used beyond the life of the information system in which the records are originally created or captured. To successfully protect records against technological obsolescence, agencies must:</P>
              <P>(a) Determine if the NARA-approved retention period for the records will be longer than the life of the system where they are currently stored. If so, plan for the migration of the records to a new system before the current system is retired.</P>
              <P>(b) Carry out upgrades of hardware and software in such a way as to retain the functionality and integrity of the electronic records created in them. Retention of record functionality and integrity requires:</P>
              <P>(1) Retaining the records in a usable format until their authorized disposition date. Where migration includes conversion of records, ensure that the authorized disposition of the records can be implemented after conversion;</P>
              <P>(2) Any necessary conversion of storage media to provide compatibility with current hardware and software; and</P>
              <P>(3) Maintaining a link between records and their metadata through conversion or migration, including capture of all relevant associated metadata at the point of migration (for both the records and the migration process).</P>
              <P>(c) Ensure that migration strategies address non-active electronic records that are stored off-line.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What are appropriate recordkeeping systems for electronic records?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Agencies must use electronic or paper recordkeeping systems or a combination of those systems, depending on their business needs, for managing their records. Transitory e-mail may be managed as specified in § 1236.22(c).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Electronic recordkeeping.</E> Recordkeeping functionality may be built into the electronic information system or records can be transferred to an electronic recordkeeping repository, such as a DoD-5015.2 STD-certified product. The following functionalities are necessary for electronic recordkeeping:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Declare records.</E> Assign unique identifiers to records.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Capture records.</E> Import records from other sources, manually enter records into the system, or link records to other systems.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Organize records.</E> Associate with an approved records schedule and disposition instruction.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Maintain records security.</E> Prevent the unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of declared records, and ensure that appropriate audit trails are in place to track use of the records.<PRTPAGE P="635"/>
              </P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Manage access and retrieval.</E> Establish the appropriate rights for users to access the records and facilitate the search and retrieval of records.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Preserve records.</E> Ensure that all records in the system are retrievable and usable for as long as needed to conduct agency business and to meet NARA-approved dispositions. Agencies must develop procedures to enable the migration of records and their associated metadata to new storage media or formats in order to avoid loss due to media decay or technology obsolescence.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Execute disposition.</E> Identify and effect the transfer of permanent records to NARA based on approved records schedules. Identify and delete temporary records that are eligible for disposal. Apply records hold or freeze on disposition when required.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Backup systems.</E> System and file backup processes and media do not provide the appropriate recordkeeping functionalities and must not be used as the agency electronic recordkeeping system.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What are the additional requirements for managing electronic mail records?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Agencies must issue instructions to staff on the following retention and management requirements for electronic mail records:</P>
              <P>(1) The names of sender and all addressee(s) and date the message was sent must be preserved for each electronic mail record in order for the context of the message to be understood. The agency may determine that other metadata is needed to meet agency business needs, e.g., receipt information.</P>
              <P>(2) Attachments to electronic mail messages that are an integral part of the record must be preserved as part of the electronic mail record or linked to the electronic mail record with other related records.</P>
              <P>(3) If the electronic mail system identifies users by codes or nicknames or identifies addressees only by the name of a distribution list, retain the intelligent or full names on directories or distributions lists to ensure identification of the sender and addressee(s) of messages that are records.</P>
              <P>(4) Some e-mail systems provide calendars and task lists for users. These may meet the definition of Federal record. Calendars that meet the definition of Federal records are to be managed in accordance with the provisions of GRS 23, Item 5.</P>
              <P>(5) Draft documents that are circulated on electronic mail systems may be records if they meet the criteria specified in 36 CFR 1222.10(b) of this subchapter.</P>
              <P>(b) Agencies that allow employees to send and receive official electronic mail messages using a system not operated by the agency must ensure that Federal records sent or received on such systems are preserved in the appropriate agency recordkeeping system.</P>
              <P>(c) Agencies may elect to manage electronic mail records with very short-term NARA-approved retention periods (transitory records with a very short-term retention period of 180 days or less as provided by GRS 23, Item 7, or by a NARA-approved agency records schedule) on the electronic mail system itself, without the need to copy the record to a paper or electronic recordkeeping system, provided that:</P>
              <P>(1) Users do not delete the messages before the expiration of the NARA-approved retention period, and</P>
              <P>(2) The system's automatic deletion rules ensure preservation of the records until the expiration of the NARA-approved retention period.</P>
              <P>(d) Except for those electronic mail records within the scope of paragraph (c) of this section:</P>
              <P>(1) Agencies must not use an electronic mail system to store the recordkeeping copy of electronic mail messages identified as Federal records unless that system has all of the features specified in § 1236.20(b) of this part.</P>
              <P>(2) If the electronic mail system is not designed to be a recordkeeping system, agencies must instruct staff on how to copy Federal records from the electronic mail system to a recordkeeping system.</P>

              <P>(e) Agencies that retain permanent electronic mail records scheduled for transfer to the National Archives must either store them in a format and on a medium that conforms to the requirements concerning transfer at 36 CFR <PRTPAGE P="636"/>part 1235 or maintain the ability to convert the records to the required format and medium at the time transfer is scheduled.</P>
              <P>(f) Agencies that maintain paper recordkeeping systems must print and file their electronic mail records with the related transmission and receipt data specified by the agency's electronic mail instructions.</P>

              <P>(a) Agencies must maintain inventories of electronic information systems and review the systems periodically for conformance to established agency procedures, standards, and policies as part of the periodic reviews required by 44 U.S.C. 3506. The review should determine if the records have been properly identified and described, and if the schedule descriptions and retention periods reflect the current informational content and use. If not, agencies must submit an SF 115, Request for Records Disposition Authority, to NARA.</P>
              <P>(b) Agencies must maintain up-to-date documentation about electronic information systems that is adequate to:</P>
              <P>(1) Specify all technical characteristics necessary for reading and processing the records contained in the system;</P>
              <P>(2) Identify all inputs and outputs;</P>
              <P>(3) Define the contents of the files and records;</P>

              <SUBJECT>What additional requirements apply to the selection and maintenance of electronic records storage media for permanent records?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Agencies must maintain the storage and test areas for electronic records storage media containing permanent and unscheduled records within the following temperature and relative humidity ranges:</P>
              <P>(1) Temperature—62° to 68 °F.</P>
              <P>(2) Relative humidity—35% to 45%.</P>
              <P>(b) Electronic media storage libraries and test or evaluation areas that contain permanent or unscheduled records must be smoke-free.</P>

              <P>(c) For additional guidance on the maintenance and storage of CDs and DVDS, agencies may consult the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 500-252, Care and Handling of CDs and DVDs at <E T="03">http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/894.05/papers/CDandDVDCareandHandlingGuide.pdf,</E> contact phone number (301) 975-6478.</P>
              <P>(d) Agencies must test magnetic computer tape media no more than 6 months prior to using them to store electronic records that are unscheduled or scheduled for permanent retention. This test should verify that the magnetic computer tape media are free of permanent errors and in compliance with NIST or industry standards.</P>

              <P>(e) Agencies must annually read a statistical sample of all magnetic computer tape media containing permanent and unscheduled records to identify any loss of data and to discover and correct the causes of data loss. In magnetic computer tape libraries with 1800 or fewer tape media, a 20% sample <PRTPAGE P="637"/>or a sample size of 50 media, whichever is larger, should be read. In magnetic computer tape libraries with more than 1800 media, a sample of 384 media should be read. Magnetic computer tape media with 10 or more errors should be replaced and, when possible, lost data must be restored. All other magnetic computer tape media which might have been affected by the same cause (i.e., poor quality tape, high usage, poor environment, improper handling) must be read and corrected as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(f) Before the media are 10 years old, agencies must copy permanent or unscheduled data on magnetic records storage media onto tested and verified new electronic media.</P>

              <P>The following formats must be used when microfilming records:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Roll film</E>—(1) <E T="03">Source documents.</E> The formats described in ANSI/AIIM MS14 (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5) must be used for microfilming source documents on 16mm and 35mm roll film. A reduction ratio no greater than 1:24 is recommended for correspondence or similar typewritten documents. Use ANSI/AIIM MS23 (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5) for the appropriate reduction ratio and format for meeting image quality requirements. When microfilming on 35mm film for aperture card applications, the format dimensions in ANSI/AIIM MS32 (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5), Table 1 must be used, and the aperture card format “D Aperture” shown in ANSI/AIIM MS41 (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5), Figure 1, must be used. The components of the aperture card, including the paper and adhesive, must conform to the requirements of ANSI/PIMA IT9.2 (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5). The 35mm film used in the aperture card application must conform to film designated as LE 500 in ISO 18901 (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">COM.</E> Microfilm created using computer output microfilm (COM) technology must use the simplex mode described in ANSI/AIIM MS14 (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5) at an effective ratio of 1:24 or 1:48 depending upon the application.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Microfiche.</E> When creating microfiche, either by microfilming source documents or using COM technology, the formats and reduction ratios prescribed in ANSI/AIIM MS5 (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5) must be used as specified for the size and quality of the documents being filmed. Use ANSI/AIIM MS23 (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5) for determining the appropriate reduction ratio and format for meeting the image quality requirements.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Index placement</E>—(1) <E T="03">Source documents.</E> When microfilming source documents, place indexes, registers, or other finding aids, if microfilmed, either in the first frames of the first roll of film or in the last frames of the last roll of film of a series. For microfiche, place the indexes in the last frames of the last microfiche or microfilm jacket of a series.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">COM.</E> Place indexes on COM following the data on a roll of film, in the last frames of a single microfiche, or in the last frames of the last fiche in a series. Other locations for indexes may be used only if dictated by special system constraints.</P>

              <P>Agencies must ensure that the microforms capture all information contained on the source documents and that they can be used for the purposes the source documents served. Microform records must be labeled and organized to support easy retrieval and use. Agencies must:</P>
              <P>(a) Arrange, describe, and index the filmed records to permit retrieval of any particular document or component of the records.</P>
              <P>(b) Title each microform roll or fiche with a titling target or header. For fiche, place the titling information in the first frame if the information will not fit on the header. At a minimum, titling information must include:</P>
              <P>(1) The title of the records;</P>
              <P>(2) The number or identifier for each unit of microform;</P>

              <P>(4) The name of the agency and sub-organization, the inclusive dates, names, or other data identifying the records to be included on a unit of microform.</P>
              <P>(c) Add an identification target showing the date of microfilming. When necessary to give the microform copy legal standing, the target must also identify the person who authorized the microfilming. Use ANSI/AIIM MS19 (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5) for standards for identification targets.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What are the microfilming requirements for permanent and unscheduled records?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Agencies must apply the standards in this section when microfilming:</P>
              <P>(1) Permanent paper records where the original paper record will be destroyed (only after authorization from NARA);</P>
              <P>(2) Unscheduled paper records where the original paper record will be destroyed (only after authorization from NARA); and</P>
              <P>(3) Permanent and unscheduled original microform records (no paper originals) produced by automation, such as COM.</P>
              <P>(b) Agencies must use polyester-based silver gelatin type film that conforms to ISO 18901 (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5) for LE 500 film in all applications.</P>
              <P>(c) Agencies must process microforms so that the residual thiosulfate ion concentration will not exceed 0.014 grams per square meter in accordance with ISO 18901 (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5) and use the processing procedures in ANSI/AIIM MS1 and ANSI/AIIM MS23 (both incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5).</P>
              <P>(d) Agencies must use the following standards for quality:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Resolution</E>—(i) <E T="03">Source documents.</E> Agencies must determine minimum resolution on microforms of source documents using the method in the Quality Index Method for determining resolution and anticipated losses when duplicating, as described in ANSI/AIIM MS23 and ANSI/AIIM MS43 (both incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5). Agencies must perform resolution tests using an ANSI/ISO 3334 Resolution Test Chart (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5) or a commercially available certifiable target manufactured to comply with this standard, and read the patterns following the instructions of ANSI/ISO 3334. Agencies must use the smallest character used to display information to determine the height used in the Quality Index formula. Agencies must use a Quality Index of five at the third generation level.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">COM.</E> COM must meet the requirements of ANSI/AIIM MS1 (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Background density of images.</E> Agencies must use the background ISO standard visual diffuse transmission density on microforms appropriate to the type of documents being filmed. Agencies must use the procedure for density measurement described in ANSI/AIIM MS23 (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5). The densitometer must meet with ANSI/NAPM IT2.18 (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5) for spectral conditions and ANSI/NAPM IT2.19 (incorporated by reference, see § 1238.5) for geometric conditions for transmission density.</P>

              <SUBJECT>When will NARA undertake an inspection?</SUBJECT>

              <P>NARA may undertake an inspection when an agency fails to address specific records management problems involving high risk to significant records. Problems may be identified through a risk assessment or through other means, such as reports in the media, Congressional inquiries, allegations of unauthorized destruction, reports issued by the GAO or an agency's Inspector General, or observations by NARA staff members. Inspections will be undertaken when other NARA program assistance efforts (see § 1239.10) have failed to mitigate situations <PRTPAGE P="653"/>where there is a high risk of loss of significant records, or when NARA agrees to a request from the agency head that NARA conduct an inspection to address specific significant records management issues in the agency. NARA reports to Congress and the Office of Management and Budget on inspections in accordance with 44 U.S.C. 2904.</P>

              <SUBJECT>How does NARA notify the agency of the inspection?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Once NARA identifies the need to conduct an agency inspection, the Archivist of the United States sends a letter to the head of the agency. If the agency being inspected is a component of a cabinet department, the letter will be addressed to the head of the component, with a copy sent to the head of the department. NARA will also send copies to the agency's records officer. The letter will include:</P>
              <P>(1) Notification that NARA intends to conduct an inspection, the records that will be inspected, and the issues to be addressed;</P>
              <P>(2) A beginning date for the inspection that is no more than 30 days after the date of the letter; and</P>
              <P>(3) A request that the agency appoint a point of contact who will assist NARA in conducting the inspection.</P>
              <P>(b) If the agency does not respond to NARA's notification letter, NARA will use its statutory authority under 44 U.S.C. 2904(c)(8) to report the matter to the agency's congressional oversight committee and to the Office of Management and Budget.</P>

              <SUBJECT>How does NARA conduct an inspection?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The NARA inspection team leader will coordinate with the agency point of contact to arrange an initial meeting with the agency. The initial meeting will address such matters as the parameters of the inspection, any surveys or other inspection instruments, the offices to be visited, and the timing of site visits.</P>
              <P>(b) After the inspection is complete, NARA will prepare a draft inspection report and transmit it to the agency within 45 calendar days of the last site visit. The report will include:</P>
              <P>(1) An executive summary;</P>
              <P>(2) Background and purpose of inspection;</P>
              <P>(3) Inspection methodology, including offices visited;</P>
              <P>(4) Findings;</P>
              <P>(5) Corrective actions needed and other recommendations; and</P>
              <P>(6) Any necessary appendixes, such as summaries of each site visit or the inspection instrument.</P>
              <P>(c) The draft report is sent to the agency for review, with a response deadline of 45 days.</P>
              <P>(d) NARA will incorporate any necessary corrections or revisions in the final report and issue the report to the head of the agency within 45 days.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What are an agency's follow up obligations for an inspection report?</SUBJECT>
              <P>The agency must submit a plan of corrective action that specifies how the agency will address each inspection report recommendation, including a timeline for completion, and proposed progress reporting dates. The agency must submit the plan of corrective action to NARA within 60 days of transmission of the final report. NARA may take up to 60 days to review and comment on the plan. Once the plan is agreed upon by both sides, agencies must submit progress reports to NARA until all actions are completed.</P>

              <P>This part implements the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, for NARA operational records and archival records that are subject to FOIA. This part contains the rules that we follow to process FOIA requests, such as the amount of time we have to make a determination regarding the release of records and what fees we may charge. Other NARA regulations in 36 CFR parts 1254 through 1275 provide detailed guidance for conducting research at NARA.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Presumption of Openness and Proactive Disclosures.</SUBJECT>

              <P>NARA, consistent with its core mission, has always been committed to providing public access to as many of our records as possible. We therefore continue to affirmatively release and post records, or descriptions of such records, on our Web site at <E T="03">www.archives.gov</E> in the absence of any FOIA request. We proactively identify and make discretionary disclosures of additional records of interest to the public whenever possible.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The following definitions apply to this part:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Archival records</E> means permanently valuable records of the United States Government that have been transferred to the legal custody of the Archivist of the United States. These are historical documents and do not include NARA operational records as defined in paragraph (l) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Commercial use request</E> means a request that asks for information for a use or purpose that furthers a commercial, trade, or profit interest of the requester or the person or entity on whose behalf the request is made.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Confidential commercial information</E> means records provided by a submitter that may contain trade secrets or confidential business or financial information that is exempt from release under the FOIA because disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause the submitter substantial competitive harm.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Educational institution request</E> means a request made by a school, university, or other educational institution that operates a program of scholarly research. To qualify for this category, a requester must show that the request is authorized by, and is made under the auspices of, a qualifying institution and that the records are sought to further scholarly research, not for a commercial use.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Expedited processing</E> means the process set forth in the FOIA that allows requesters to ask for faster processing of their FOIA request if they can demonstrate a specific compelling need.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Fee category</E> means one of the four categories set forth in the FOIA to determine whether a requester will be charged fees for search, review, and duplication. The categories are: Commercial requesters; non-commercial scientific or educational institutions; news media requesters; and all other requesters.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Fee waiver</E> means the waiver or reduction of fees if a requester is able to demonstrate that certain standards set forth in the FOIA are satisfied, including that the information is in the public interest and is not requested for a commercial interest.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">FOIA Public Liaison</E> means an agency official who is responsible for assisting in reducing delays, increasing transparency and understanding of the status of requests, and assisting in the resolution of disputes.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">FOIA request</E> means a written request, that cites the Freedom of Information Act, for access to NARA operational records, records of the executive branch of the Federal Government held by NARA, or Presidential or Vice Presidential records in NARA's custody that were created after January 19, 1981.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)</E> means the law codified at 5 U.S.C. 552 that provides the public with the right to request Government records from Federal executive branch agencies.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Non-commercial scientific institution request</E> means a request submitted by an institution that is not operated on a basis that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of any person or organization, and which is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research.</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Operational records</E> means records that NARA creates or receives in carrying out our mission and responsibilities as an executive branch agency. This does not include archival records as defined in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(m) <E T="03">Original Classification Authority</E> means the authority to classify information as National Security Information at creation, as granted by the President of the United States in Executive Order 13526, section 1.3, and defined in 32 CFR part 2001.</P>
              <P>(n) <E T="03">Other request</E> means a request submitted by any individual whose request does not qualify as a commercial-use request, representative of the news media request (including a request made by a freelance journalist), or an educational or non-commercial scientific institution request.</P>
              <P>(o) <E T="03">Presidential records</E> means the official Presidential and Vice Presidential records created or received by the President, the Vice President, or the White House staff since January 20, 1981, and covered under the Presidential Records Act, 44 U.S.C. 2201-2207. Presidential Executive orders also apply to these records.<PRTPAGE P="656"/>
              </P>
              <P>(p) <E T="03">Presidential Records Act</E> (PRA) means the law that, in part, governs access to Presidential and Vice Presidential records and is codified at 44 U.S.C. 2201-2207 and Part 1270 of these regulations. The PRA contains six restrictions that authorize NARA to withhold information, which apply for 12 years after a President leaves office. Four of the PRA restrictions are identical to FOIA Exemptions 1, 3, 4, and 6. Two relate to appointments to Federal office and confidential communications requesting or submitting advice between the President and his advisers, or between and among such advisers. The PRA also excludes application of FOIA Exemption 5.</P>
              <P>(q) <E T="03">Representative of the news media</E> means a person or entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public, and that actively gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations that broadcast news to the public at large and publishers of periodicals, including print and online publications that disseminate news and make their products available through a variety of means to the general public. We consider requests for records that support the news-dissemination function of the requester to be a non-commercial use. We consider “freelance” journalists who demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through a news media entity as working for that entity. A publishing contract provides the clearest evidence that a journalist expects publication; however, we also consider a requester's past publication record. We decide whether to grant a requester media status on a case-by-case basis, based on the requester's intended use.</P>
              <P>(r) <E T="03">Review</E> means examining documents responsive to a request to determine whether any portions of them are exempt from disclosure. Review time includes processing any record for disclosure (i.e., doing all that is necessary to prepare the record for disclosure), including redacting the record and marking the appropriate FOIA exemptions.</P>
              <P>(s) <E T="03">Search</E> means the process of looking for and retrieving records or information responsive to a request. It also includes reasonable efforts to locate and retrieve information from records maintained in electronic form or format.</P>
              <P>(t) <E T="03">Submitter</E> means any person or entity providing potentially confidential commercial information to an agency, which information may be subject to a FOIA request. The term submitter includes, but is not limited to, individuals, corporations, state governments, and foreign governments.</P>

              <P>Any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or public or private organization other than a Federal agency, regardless of nationality, may file a FOIA request with NARA. The Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 551(2), excludes Federal agencies from filing FOIA requests. However, state and local governments may file FOIA requests.</P>

              <P>(a) NARA provides access under FOIA to the records NARA creates (<E T="03">operational</E> records) and records originating in the executive branch that have been transferred to the legal custody of the Archivist of the United States (<E T="03">archival</E> records). The NARA Office of Inspector General (OIG) is an independent unit within NARA that controls access under FOIA to the operational records that OIG creates. NARA OIG handles FOIA requests it receives separately and independently from FOIA requests to NARA.</P>
              <P>(b) NARA's National Personnel Records Center (NPRC), located in St. Louis, Missouri, is the repository for twentieth- and twenty-first-century personnel and medical records of former members of the military and personnel records of former civilian employees of the Federal Government.</P>
              <P>(1) Those official personnel and medical files that have been transferred to NARA's legal custody are processed by NARA according to this part, at §§ 1250.20 through 1250.32.</P>

              <P>(2) Those personnel and medical records that remain in the legal custody of the agencies that created them are governed by the FOIA and other access regulations of the originating agencies, which the NPRC processes under authority delegated by the originating agencies, not under the provisions of this part. Because of the intricacies of other agencies' FOIA regulations, further explanation here is not feasible. More information about the NPRC processes, including access to NPRC records, is available on NARA's Web site at <E T="03">http://www.archives.gov/st-louis/military-personnel/</E> and at <E T="03">http://www.archives.gov/st-louis/civilian-personnel.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(c) NARA's Federal records centers store records that agencies no longer need for day-to-day business. These records remain in the legal custody of the agencies that created them. Requests for access to another agency's records in a NARA Federal records center should be made directly to the originating agency. We do not process FOIA requests for these records.</P>
              <P>(d) If your FOIA request includes a record in the legal custody of an originating agency, we forward that request to the originating agency for processing. We also provide you with notification that we have done so and with contact information for the originating agency. (See 36 CFR 1256.2 for more information about how to access records that are stored in Federal records centers.)</P>

              <SUBJECT>Do I need to use FOIA to gain access to records at NARA?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Most <E T="03">archival</E> records held by NARA have no restrictions to access and are available to the public for research without filing a FOIA request. You may either visit a NARA facility as a researcher to view and copy records or you may write to request copies of specific records. (See subpart B of 36 CFR part 1256 for more information about how to access archival records).</P>
              <P>(b) If you are seeking access to <E T="03">archival</E> records that are not yet available to the public, you need to file a FOIA request. (See 36 CFR 1256.22 for information on how to request access to restricted archival records. See paragraph (d) of this section, and part 1260, for additional procedures on access to classified records.)</P>

              <P>(c) You must also file a FOIA request when you request access to NARA <E T="03">operational</E> records (records NARA creates) that are not already available to the public.</P>

              <P>(d) If you are requesting records that you know are classified to protect national security interests, you may wish to use the Mandatory Declassification <PRTPAGE P="658"/>Review process, which is set forth at 36 CFR 1260.70. (Please see NARA's FOIA Guide, available online at <E T="03">http://www.archives.gov/foia/foia-guide.html,</E> for the differences between the FOIA and Mandatory Declassification Review access processes.)</P>

              <SUBJECT>What do I include in my FOIA request?</SUBJECT>
              <P>In your FOIA request, which must be submitted in writing:</P>
              <P>(a) Describe the records you seek in sufficient detail to enable NARA staff to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. The more information you provide, the better possibility NARA has of finding the records you are seeking. Information that will help NARA find the records includes:</P>
              <P>(1) The agencies, offices, or individuals involved;</P>
              <P>(2) The approximate date(s) when the records were created;</P>
              <P>(3) The subject, title, or description of the records sought; and</P>
              <P>(4) Author, recipient, case number, file designation, or reference number.</P>
              <P>(b) Include your name and full mailing address as well as phone number and email address. This information allows us to reach you faster if we have any questions about your request. It is your responsibility to keep your current mailing address up to date with the office where you have filed the FOIA request.</P>

              <P>(c) If you request records about yourself, you must do so in accordance with the Privacy Act and our implementing regulations at 36 CFR part 1202. This includes requirements to verify your identity (see 36 CFR 1202.40). If you request records about someone other than yourself, you may receive greater access if you submit either a notarized document signed by the other person <PRTPAGE P="659"/>that certifies their identity and gives their permission for you to have access, or proof that the other person is deceased (e.g., a copy of a death certificate or an obituary). NARA may, at its discretion, require you to supply additional information if necessary to verify that a particular individual has consented to disclosure of records about them.</P>
              <P>(d) Mark both your letter and envelope, or the subject line of your email, with the words “FOIA Request.”</P>

              <P>(e) Before filing your request, you may find it helpful to consult NARA's “Freedom of Information Act Reference Guide”—which is available electronically at <E T="03">http://www.archives.gov/foia/foia-guide.html,</E> and in paper form. For a paper copy of NARA's FOIA Guide, write to: NARA FOIA Officer (NGC); Room 3110; National Archives and Records Administration; 8601 Adelphi Road; College Park, MD 20740-6001.

              <SUBJECT>How does NARA process my FOIA request?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Acknowledgement.</E> NARA acknowledges all FOIA requests in writing within 20 working days after receipt by the appropriate office (see 36 CFR 1250.22). The acknowledgement letter or email informs you of your request tracking number, and any complexity in processing that may lengthen the time NARA requires to reach a final decision on the release of the records. The acknowledgement letter or email may also seek additional information to clarify your request or to ask you to narrow the scope of a very large or broad request.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Clarification of requests.</E> Requests must reasonably describe the records sought. If we determine that a request does not reasonably describe the records sought, or if we are uncertain about another aspect of the request, we contact you to ask for clarification.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Search cut-off date.</E> As the end or cut-off date for a records search, NARA uses the date on which we first begin our search for documents responsive to your request, unless you specify an earlier cut-off date. This includes those cases when you request records “through the present,” “through today,” or similar language. If NARA uses any other search end date, we inform you of that date.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Stops in processing time, clarification requests, and administrative closure.</E> NARA may stop the clock for processing a request one time in order to seek your clarification. In such a case, the processing time resumes upon our receipt of your response. We provide at least 60 calendar days for you to respond to a request for clarification. If you do not clarify the request within 60 calendar days, we deny the request for not reasonably describing the records sought and provide you with the opportunity to appeal under the procedures in Subpart D. Should you not answer any correspondence, or should the correspondence be returned as undeliverable, NARA reserves the right to administratively close the FOIA request 60 calendar days after the date of the last correspondence we send.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Confidential commercial information.</E> If you have requested records containing confidential commercial information, refer to 36 CFR 1250.82 for information on how we process that request.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Processing queues.</E> NARA places FOIA requests in simple or complex processing queues to be processed in the order received, on a first-in, first-out basis. In most cases, we make a determination about release of the records you requested within 20 working days from when the appropriate office receives your request (simple queue processing). However, if complexity or unusual circumstances prevent NARA from making a decision within 20 working days, we place your request into a complex processing queue. This way, such cases do not hold up the processing of other requests that do not include such time-consuming factors. We notify you of complicating factors in our acknowledgement letter or email, and you may choose to limit the scope of your request to convert the complex processing queue request to a simple processing queue request. For more detailed information on NARA's multi-track processing queues, see our FOIA Guide at <E T="03">http://www.archives.gov/foia-guide.html</E> (for a paper copy, see 36 CFR 1250.20(d)).</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Complex processing queue factors.</E> We place into a complex processing queue any request that cannot be completed within 20 working days due to complexity, volume, because it contains national security information, because it involves Presidential or Vice Presidential records, or involves unusual circumstances. Unusual circumstances include the need to:</P>
              <P>(1) Search for and collect the records from one or more field facilities;</P>
              <P>(2) Search for, collect, and review a voluminous amount of records that are part of a single request;</P>
              <P>(3) Consult with another Federal agency before releasing records; or</P>
              <P>(4) Refer records to another Federal agency for declassification.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Complex processing schedule.</E> If NARA needs to extend the deadline for more than an additional 10 working days due to the complexity of a request <PRTPAGE P="661"/>or as a result of unusual circumstances, we ask if you wish to modify your request so that we can answer the request sooner. If you do not wish to modify your request, we work with you to arrange an alternative schedule for review and release. We will also notify you that the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) is available to provide dispute resolution services, and how to contact them.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Complex processing: National security declassification and release.</E> NARA does not have the authority to declassify and release records containing national security information without the approval of the agencies that have Original Classification Authority for the information contained in the records. We send copies of the documents to the appropriate originating Federal agencies for declassification review. We also send you an initial response to your FOIA request within 20 working days, informing you of this consultation with, or referral to, another Federal agency, except to the extent that the association with the other agency may itself be classified. Upon your request, we provide you an estimated date of completion.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Complex processing: Presidential or Vice Presidential records.</E> If you request Presidential or Vice Presidential records and we determine that the records are not subject to any applicable FOIA or Presidential Records Act (PRA) exemption (and can therefore be released), we must notify the current and former President(s) or Vice President(s) of our intention to disclose information from those records. After receiving the notice, the current and former President(s) and Vice President(s) have a period of time (as set out in the applicable Executive order on implementation of the PRA) in which to choose whether to invoke Executive Privilege to deny access to the requested information. Although we send you an initial status response to your FOIA request within 20 working days in these cases, the final response to your FOIA request will take longer. We can provide the final response only at the end of the Presidential notification period set forth in the Executive order.</P>

              <P>(a) When you ask for an estimated completion date for records that do not require consultation with another agency, we estimate the completion date on the basis of our reasonable judgment at that point as to how long it will take to complete the request. Given the uncertainty inherent in establishing any estimate, the estimated completion date may be subject to change at any time.</P>
              <P>(b) When you ask for an estimated completion date for records that must be reviewed by another agency, our estimate is also based on information from the other agency:</P>
              <P>(1) When we send documents for consultation to another agency, we ask the agency to provide an estimated completion date for its portion of the processing.</P>
              <P>(2) We keep the consulting agency's estimated completion date for its portion of the processing in the request file and use it in addition to our own processing time estimate to provide you with an overall estimated completion date.</P>
              <P>(3) If the consulted agency or agencies do not provide us with an estimated completion date, we provide you with an estimate based on our general experience working with the agency or agencies and the types and volumes of records at issue.</P>

              <SUBJECT>How do I request expedited processing?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) NARA processes requests and appeals on an expedited basis whenever we determine that one or more of the following criteria exist:</P>
              <P>(1) A reasonable expectation of an imminent threat to an individual's life or physical safety;</P>
              <P>(2) A reasonable expectation of an imminent loss of a substantial due process right;</P>
              <P>(3) An urgent need to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity (this criterion applies only to those requests made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information to the public); or</P>

              <P>(4) A matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there <PRTPAGE P="662"/>exist possible questions that affect public confidence in the Government's integrity.</P>
              <P>(b) NARA can expedite requests, or segments of requests, only for records over which we have control. If NARA must refer a request to another agency, we will inform you and suggest that you seek expedited review from that agency. NARA cannot expedite the review of classified records nor can we shorten the Presidential notification period described in 36 CFR 1250.26(j).</P>
              <P>(c) To request expedited processing, you must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct, explaining the basis for your need for expedited processing. You must send the request to the appropriate official at the address listed in § 1250.22 of this subpart. You may request expedited processing when you first request records or at any time during NARA's processing of your request or appeal.</P>
              <P>(d) We will respond to your request for expedited processing within 10 calendar days of our receipt of your request to expedite. If we grant your request, the NARA office responsible for the review of the requested records will process your request as a priority, and it will be processed as soon as practicable. We will inform you if we deny your request for expedited processing. If you decide to appeal that denial, we will expedite our review of your appeal.</P>

              <SUBJECT>How does NARA respond to my request?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) NARA sends you a response informing you of our release determination, including whether any responsive records were located, how much responsive material was located, whether the records have been released in full or withheld in full or in part, where you may review the records, and any fees you must pay for the request. We will use plain language in all written communications with requesters.</P>
              <P>(b) If we deny any part of your request, our response will explain the reasons for the denial, which FOIA exemptions apply to withhold records, your right to appeal that determination, and your right to seek dispute resolution services from the FOIA Public Liaison or OGIS.</P>
              <P>(c) NARA may withhold records in full or in part if any of the nine FOIA exemptions apply. NARA withholds information only where disclosure is prohibited by law (such as information that remains classified, or information that is specifically exempt by statute) or where we reasonably foresee that disclosure would cause harm to an interest protected by one of the FOIA exemptions. If we must withhold part of a record, we provide access to the rest of the information in the record. On the released portion of the record, we indicate the amount of information we redacted and the exemption(s) we applied, unless including that indication would harm an interest the exemption protects. NARA may also determine that a request does not reasonably describe the records sought; the information requested is not a record subject to FOIA; the requested record does not exist, cannot be located, or has been destroyed; or the requested record is not readily reproducible in the form or format you sought. Information that may be exempt from disclosure under the FOIA is:</P>

              <P>(a) If you have failed to pay FOIA fees in the past, we will require you to pay your past-due bill and we may also require that you pay the anticipated fee before we begin processing your current request. If we estimate that your fees may be greater than $250, we may also require advance payment or a deposit before we begin processing your <PRTPAGE P="664"/>request. If you fail to make an advance payment within 60 calendar days after the date of NARA's fee letter, we will close the request.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What fee policies apply to archival records?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) NARA is specifically authorized to charge fees for copying archival records under a separate fee statute, 44 U.S.C. 2116(c). As a result, archival records are exempt from the FOIA fee waiver provisions, per 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A)(vi), and we do not grant fee waivers for archival records requested under the FOIA. However, we make most of our archival records available for examination at the NARA facility where the records are located. Whenever this is possible, you may review the records in a NARA research room at that facility free of charge and may also use your own equipment to make copies.</P>
              <P>(b) We do not charge search fees for FOIA requests for archival records, but we do limit the search to two hours.</P>
              <P>(c) If you would like us to make copies of archival records, we typically require you to pay all applicable fees (in accordance with the fee schedule) before we provide the copies.</P>

              <P>(a) For operational records, we may charge search fees even if the records are not releasable or we do not find any responsive records during our search.</P>
              <P>(b) If you are a noncommercial FOIA requester entitled to receive 100 free pages, but the records cannot be copied onto standard-sized (8.5″ by 11″) photocopy paper, we copy them on larger paper and reduce the copy fee by the normal charge for 100 standard-sized photocopies. If the records are not on textual media (e.g., they are photographs or electronic files), we provide the equivalent of 100 pages of standard-sized paper copies for free.</P>
              <P>(c) We do not charge you any fee if the total cost for processing your request is $25 or less.</P>
              <P>(d) If estimated search or review fees exceed $50, we will contact you. If you have specified a different limit that you are willing to spend, we will contact you only if we estimate the fees will exceed that specified amount.</P>

              <P>In responding to FOIA requests for operational records, NARA charges the following fees, where applicable, unless we have given you a reduction or waiver of fees under § 1250.56.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Search fees</E>—(1) <E T="03">Manual searching.</E> When the search is relatively straightforward and can be performed by a clerical or administrative employee, the search rate is $16 per hour (or fraction thereof). When the request is more complicated and must be done by a NARA professional employee, the rate is $33 per hour (or fraction thereof).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Computer searching.</E> NARA bases the fees for computer searches on the actual cost to NARA of operating the computer and the salary of the operator. When the search is relatively straightforward and a clerical or administrative employee can conduct it, the search rate is $16 per hour (or fraction thereof). When the request is more complicated and a NARA professional employee must perform it, the rate is $33 per hour (or fraction thereof).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Review fees.</E> (1) NARA charges review fees for time we spend examining documents that are responsive to a request to determine whether we must apply any FOIA exemptions to withhold information. NARA charges review fees even if we ultimately are unable to disclose a record.<PRTPAGE P="665"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) The review fee is $33 per hour (or fraction thereof).</P>
              <P>(3) NARA does not charge review fees for time we spend resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions. However, NARA does charge review fees for time we spend obtaining and considering any formal objection to disclosure made by a confidential commercial information submitter.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Reproduction fees</E>—(1) <E T="03">Self-service photocopying.</E> At NARA facilities with self-service photocopiers, you may make reproductions of released paper records for $0.25 per page.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Photocopying standard-sized pages.</E> When we make the photocopies for operational records, the charge is $0.30 per page.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Reproductions of electronic records.</E> NARA charges you for our direct costs for staff time for programming, computer operations, and printouts or electromagnetic media to reproduce the requested electronic information. When the work is relatively straightforward and a clerical or administrative employee can perform it, the rate is $16 per hour (or fraction thereof). When the request is more complicated and a NARA professional employee must do it, the rate is $33 per hour (or fraction thereof).</P>

              <P>(a) If you are a commercial use requester, NARA charges you fees for searching, reviewing, and copying responsive records.</P>
              <P>(b) If you are an educational or scientific institution requester, or a member of the news media, you are entitled to search time, review time, and up to 100 pages of copying without charge. NARA charges copying fees only beyond the first 100 pages.</P>
              <P>(c) If you do not fall into either of the categories in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, and are an “other requester,” you are entitled to two hours of search and review time, and up to 100 pages of copying without charge. NARA may charge for search time beyond the first two hours and for copying beyond the first 100 pages.</P>
              <P>(d) NARA does not charge a fee for processing a FOIA request if it exceeds any time limit under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6) in processing that request, unless unusual or exceptional circumstances (defined under the FOIA statute) are relevant.</P>

              <SUBJECT>How may I request a fee waiver for operational records?</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) We waive or reduce your fees for NARA operational records only if your request meets <E T="03">both</E> of the following criteria:</P>
              <P>(1) The request is in the public interest (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Government); and</P>
              <P>(2) The request is not primarily in your commercial interest.</P>
              <P>(b) To be eligible for a fee waiver or reduction you must explain:</P>
              <P>(1) How the records you are requesting pertain to the operations and activities of the Federal Government. There must be a clear connection between the identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government and the subject of your request;</P>
              <P>(2) How the release will reveal meaningful information that the public does not already know about Federal Government activities. Disclosing information that is already in the public domain, in either the same or a substantially-identical form, does not add anything new to the public's understanding of Government activities;</P>
              <P>(3) How disclosure to you will advance public understanding of the issue;</P>
              <P>(4) Your expertise or understanding of the requested records as well as your ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public. NARA ordinarily presumes that a representative of the news media satisfies this consideration;</P>
              <P>(5) How you intend to disseminate the requested information to a broad spectrum of the public; and</P>
              <P>(6) How disclosure will lead to a significantly greater understanding of the Government by the public.</P>

              <P>(c) After reviewing your request and determining that there is a substantial <PRTPAGE P="666"/>public interest in release, we also determine if the request primarily furthers your commercial interests. If it does, you are not eligible for a fee waiver.</P>
              <P>(d) You should ask for waiver or reduction of fees when you first submit your request to NARA, and should address the criteria referenced above. You may also ask for a fee waiver at a later time while the underlying record request is still pending or during an administrative appeal.</P>
              <P>(e) We may also waive (either partially or in full) or reduce fees for operational records in additional circumstances as a matter of administrative discretion.</P>

              <P>(2) For all appeals submitted electronically, except those regarding Presidential records, send an email to <E T="03">FOIA@nara.gov.</E> For Presidential records, electronic appeals must contain all the information listed in § 1250.72 and be sent to the email address of the appropriate Presidential library.

Please explain why you believe our response does not meet the requirements of the FOIA, including why we should release the records, grant your fee waiver request, or expedite the processing of your request. If we were not able to find the records you wanted, explain why you believe NARA's search was inadequate. If we denied you access to records and told you that those records were not subject to FOIA, please explain why you believe the records are subject to FOIA.</P>

              <P>(a) We respond to your appeal within 20 working days after the appeal official designated in 36 CFR 1250.72(a)(1)(i) and (ii) receives it. NARA has adopted the practice of generally handling backlogged appeals on a first-in, first-out basis.</P>
              <P>(1) An adverse determination by the Archivist or Deputy Archivist will be the final action by NARA; and</P>
              <P>(2) In the event you decide to file a FOIA lawsuit, NARA will administratively close your request.</P>

              <P>(b) We notify you of your right to seek judicial review of an adverse determination as set forth in the FOIA at 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(B). If you wish to seek <PRTPAGE P="667"/>judicial review of any adverse determination, you must first appeal it administratively under this section.</P>
              <P>(c) We also inform you that OGIS offers dispute resolution services to resolve disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. Dispute resolution is a voluntary process. If we agree to participate in the dispute resolution services provided by OGIS, we will actively engage as a partner to the process in an attempt to resolve the dispute. You may contact OGIS in any of the following ways:</P>

              <SUBJECT>How does a submitter identify records containing confidential commercial information?</SUBJECT>
              <P>At the time of submission, a submitter of business information is expected to designate, by appropriate markings, any portions of its submission that it considers to be protected from disclosure under FOIA Exemption 4. Although these portions may be designated, this does not preclude NARA from conducting a full FOIA review of all such documents if a FOIA request for those records has been received. These designations will expire 10 years after the date of the submission unless the submitter requests, and provides justification for, a longer designation period, or NARA extends the designation period at its discretion.</P>
            </SECTION>

              <SECTNO>§ 1250.82</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>How does NARA process FOIA requests for confidential commercial information?</SUBJECT>
              <P>If NARA receives a FOIA request for records containing confidential commercial information or for records that we believe may contain confidential commercial information, we follow these procedures:</P>
              <P>(a) If the records are less than 10 years old or are still covered under an extended FOIA Exemption 4 designation period, we review the records in response to a FOIA request. If we then believe that we should release the records under FOIA, we make reasonable efforts to inform the submitter. The notice to the submitter describes the business information requested or includes copies of the requested records. NARA does not notify the submitter when we determine that:</P>
              <P>(1) We must withhold the information under FOIA's exemptions;</P>
              <P>(2) The information has been lawfully published or made available to the public; or</P>
              <P>(3) We are required by a statute (other than the FOIA), or by a regulation issued in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12600, to disclose the information.</P>
              <P>(b) If the records are 10 or more years old, we review the records in response to a FOIA request as we would any other records, and at our discretion, inform the submitter. NARA releases the records if we determine that neither Exemption 4 nor any other exemption applies.</P>
              <P>(c) When the request is for information from a single or small number of submitters, we send a notice via registered mail to the submitter's last known address. NARA's notice to the submitter includes a copy of the FOIA request and tells the submitter the time limits and procedures for objecting to the release of the requested material.</P>
              <P>(d) When the request involves information from a voluminous number of submitters, we may post or publish the notice in a place or manner reasonably likely to inform the submitters of the proposed disclosure, instead of sending letters.</P>
              <P>(e) We provide the submitter with 20 working days from the date of NARA's notice to object to the release and to explain a basis for the objection, including justification and support for the claim. The NARA FOIA Officer may extend this period as appropriate.</P>

              <P>(f) We review and consider all objections to release that we receive within <PRTPAGE P="668"/>the time limit. Any information provided by a submitter under this provision may itself be subject to disclosure under FOIA. NARA considers a submitter who fails to respond within the time period specified in the notice to have no objection to disclosure of the information. If we decide to release the records, we inform the submitter in writing, along with NARA's reasons for the decision to release. We include with the notice copies of the records as we intend to release them. We also inform the submitter that we intend to release the records within a reasonable time after the date of the notice unless a U.S. District Court forbids disclosure. NARA will not consider any information we receive after the date of a disclosure decision.</P>
              <P>(g) If the requester files a lawsuit under the FOIA for access to any withheld records, we promptly notify the submitter.</P>
              <P>(h) NARA notifies the requester in three circumstances:</P>
              <P>(1) When we notify the submitter of the opportunity to object to disclosure, or to extend the time for objecting;</P>
              <P>(2) When we notify the submitter of our intent to disclose the requested information; and</P>
              <P>(3) When a submitter files a lawsuit to prevent the disclosure of the information.</P>

            <P>(i) The records or testimony can be obtained from the publicly available records of NARA or from other sources;</P>
            <P>(j) The demand is unduly burdensome or otherwise inappropriate under the applicable rules of discovery or the rules of procedure governing the case or matter in which the demand arose;</P>

            <P>(d) NARA reserves the right to require additional information to process your demand.</P>
            <P>(e) Your demand (other than a demand pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in a case in which NARA is a party, in which case you must comply with the requirements of that rule) should be submitted at least 45 days before the date that records or testimony is required. Demands submitted in less than 45 days before records or testimony is required must be accompanied by a written explanation stating the reasons for the late request and the reasons for expedited processing.</P>

            <SUBJECT>How does NARA process your demand?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) After service of a demand for production of records or for testimony, an appropriate NARA official reviews the demand and, in accordance with the provisions of this, determines whether, or under what conditions, to produce records or authorize the employee to testify on matters relating to agency information.</P>
            <P>(b) NARA processes demands in the order in which we receive them. NARA will not complete and return certifications, affidavits, or similar documents submitted with a demand for records, but if requested will certify records in accordance with NARA's published fee schedule at 36 CFR part 1258. Absent exigent or unusual circumstances, NARA responds within 45 days from the date of receipt. The time for response depends upon the scope of the demand.</P>
            <P>(c) The General Counsel may grant a waiver of any procedure described by this part where a waiver is considered necessary to promote a significant interest of NARA or the United States or for other good cause.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Who makes the final determination on compliance with demands for records or testimony?</SUBJECT>
            <P>The General Counsel makes the final determination on demands to employees for testimony. The appropriate NARA official authorized to accept service, as described in § 1251.8, makes the final determination on demands for the production of records. The NARA official notifies the requester and, as necessary, the court or other authority of the final determination and any conditions that may be imposed on the release of records or information, or on the testimony of a NARA employee. If the NARA official deems it appropriate not to comply with the demand, the official communicates the reasons for the noncompliance as appropriate.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1251.16</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Are there any restrictions that apply to testimony?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The General Counsel may impose conditions or restrictions on the testimony of NARA employees including, for example, limiting the areas of testimony or requiring the requester and other parties to the legal proceeding to agree that the transcript of the testimony will be kept under seal or will only be used or made available in the particular legal proceeding for which testimony was requested. The General Counsel may also require a copy of the transcript of testimony at the requester's expense.</P>
            <P>(b) NARA may offer the employee's written declaration instead of testimony.</P>
            <P>(c) If authorized to testify pursuant to this part, an employee may testify as to facts within his or her personal knowledge, but, unless specifically authorized to do so by the General Counsel, the employee must not:</P>
            <P>(1) Disclose confidential or privileged information; or</P>

            <P>(2) For a current NARA employee, testify as an expert or opinion witness with regard to any matter arising out of the employee's official duties or the <PRTPAGE P="673"/>functions of NARA unless testimony is being given on behalf of the United States.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1251.18</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Are there any restrictions that apply to the production of records?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The General Counsel may impose conditions or restrictions on the release of records and agency information, including the requirement that parties to the proceeding obtain a protective order or execute a confidentiality agreement to limit access and any further disclosure. The terms of the protective order or of a confidentiality agreement must be acceptable to the General Counsel. In cases where protective orders or confidentiality agreements have already been executed, NARA may condition the release of records and agency information on an amendment to the existing protective order or confidentiality agreement.</P>
            <P>(b) Typically, original NARA records will not be produced in response to a demand. Instead of the original records, NARA provides certified copies for evidentiary purposes (see 28 U.S.C. 1733; 44 U.S.C. 2116). Such copies must be given judicial notice and must be admitted into evidence equally with the originals from which they were made (see 44 U.S.C. 2116). If the General Counsel so determines, under exceptional circumstances, original NARA records may be made available for examination in response to a demand, but they are not to be presented as evidence.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1251.20</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Are there any fees associated with producing records or providing testimony?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Generally.</E> The General Counsel may condition the production of records or appearance for testimony upon advance payment of a reasonable estimate of the costs to NARA.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Fees for records.</E> Fees for producing records include fees for searching, reviewing, and duplicating records, costs of attorney time spent in reviewing the demand or request, and expenses generated by materials and equipment used to search for, produce, and copy the responsive information. Costs for employee time are calculated on the basis of the hourly pay of the employee (including all pay, allowance, and benefits). Fees for duplication are the same as those charged by NARA in part 1258 of this title.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Witness fees.</E> Fees for attendance by a witness include fees, expenses, and allowances prescribed by the court's rules. If no such fees are prescribed, witness fees are determined based upon the rule of the Federal district court closest to the location where the witness appears.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Payment of fees.</E> (1) Witness fees for current NARA employees must be submitted to the General Counsel and made payable to the Treasury of the United States.</P>
            <P>(2) Fees for the production of records, including records certification fees, must be submitted to the official who makes the final determination on demands for the production of records, as described in § 1251.14, and made payable to the National Archives Trust Fund (NATF).</P>
            <P>(3) Applicable fees paid to former NARA employees providing testimony should be paid directly to the former employee in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 1821 or other applicable statutes.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Certification (authentication) of copies of records.</E> NARA may certify that records are true copies in order to facilitate their use as evidence. Request certified copies from NARA at least 45 days before the date they are needed. We charge a certification fee for each document certified.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Waiver or reduction of fees.</E> The General Counsel, in his or her sole discretion, may, upon a showing of good cause, waive or reduce any fees in connection with the testimony, production, or certification of records.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">De minimis fees.</E> Fees are not assessed if the total charge is $10.00 or less, or as otherwise stated in NARA policy.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Are there any penalties for providing records or testimony in violation of this part?</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) An employee who discloses official records or information or gives testimony relating to official information, except as expressly authorized by NARA or as ordered by a Federal court after NARA has had the opportunity to <PRTPAGE P="674"/>be heard, may face the penalties provided in 18 U.S.C. 641 and other applicable laws. Additionally, former NARA employees are subject to the restrictions and penalties of 18 U.S.C. 207 and 216.</P>
            <P>(b) A current NARA employee who testifies or produces official records and information in violation of this part is subject to disciplinary action.</P>

            <P>(4) These notices will provide written determination justifying the change in hours.</P>

            <P>(d) In the event that emergency changes to hours of operations for research rooms, exhibit areas and museums are necessary, including but not limited to inclement weather, NARA units will give as much advance notice to the public as possible.

              <SUBJECT>What kinds of archival materials may I use for research?</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) preserves records of all three branches (Executive, Legislative, and Judicial) of the Federal Government in record groups that reflect how government agencies created and maintained them. Most of these records are of Executive Branch agencies. We also have individual documents and collections of donated historical materials that significantly supplement existing records in our custody or provide information not available elsewhere in our holdings. Descriptions of many of our records are available through our Web site, <E T="03">http://www.archives.gov.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(b) We provide information about records and we make them available to the public for research unless they have access restrictions. Some records may be exempt from release by law. Donors may apply restrictions on access to historical materials that they donate to NARA. Access restrictions are further explained in part 1256 of this chapter. We explain procedures for obtaining information about records in § 1254.2.</P>
              <P>(c) In addition to traditional paper (textual) materials, our holdings also include special media materials such as microfilm, still pictures, motion pictures, sound and video recordings, cartographic and architectural records, and electronic records. The majority of these materials are housed at the National Archives at College Park, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001. Many of these types of materials also are represented in the holdings of our Presidential libraries and our regional archives facilities listed in part 1253 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(d) The majority of our archival materials are 30 years old or older.</P>
              <P>(e) Records creating agencies hold the legal title and control access to records housed in NARA records centers. Our procedures to obtain access to these records are in § 1256.2.</P>

              <P>(a) You must apply in person and show identification containing your picture or physical description, such as a driver's license or school identification card. You also must provide proof of your current address, such as a bank statement, utility bill, or department of motor vehicles change of address card, if the address on your driver's license or other identification is not current. Students who consider the home of their parents as their permanent address, but who do not live there during the academic session, must provide their current student address. If you travel long distance to conduct research in original archival materials at a NARA facility, we may ask you how we can contact you locally. In special circumstances, the director of a facility or unit has the authority to grant exceptions to these requirements.</P>

              <P>(b) If you apply for access to large quantities of documents or to documents that are especially fragile or valuable, we may require you to furnish additional information about reasons why you require access. Some materials are too fragile or valuable for direct handling or viewing. Preservation concerns (<E T="03">see</E> §§ 1254.20(b) and 1254.36(e)) and availability of resources (<E T="03">see</E> § 1254.20(c)) may limit our ability to accommodate certain requests.</P>
              <P>(c) If you are younger than 14, you must follow the procedures in § 1254.24 to seek permission to conduct research.</P>
              <P>(d) We do not issue you a researcher identification card if the appropriate supervisor or director of the NARA facility determines that the documents that you wish to use are not in the legal custody of NARA and you do not present appropriate written authorization from the legal title holder to examine the documents.</P>
              <P>(e) The collection of information contained in this section has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget with the control number 3095-0016.</P>

                <P>(b) We do not admit children under the age of 14 to these research rooms unless we grant them research privileges (<E T="03">see</E> paragraph (d) of this section).</P>

                <P>(c) The appropriate supervisor may make exceptions for a child who is able <PRTPAGE P="682"/>to read and who will be closely supervised by an adult while in the research room. The adult must agree in writing to be present when the child uses documents and to be responsible for compliance with the research room and copying rules in subparts B and C of this part.</P>

                <P>(d) Students under the age of 14 who wish to perform research on original documents must apply in person at the facility where the documents are located. At the National Archives Building, apply to the chief of the Research Support Branch (NWCC1). At the National Archives at College Park, apply to the chief of the Research Support Branch (NWCC2). For regional archives and Presidential libraries, apply to the appropriate supervisor or archivist in charge. We may require either that the student must present a letter of reference from a teacher or that an adult accompany the student while doing research. Students may contact NARA by phone, e-mail, fax, or letter in advance of their visit to discuss their eligibility for research privileges. Current contact information for our facilities is available on our Web site, <E T="03">http://www.archives.gov.</E>

                <P>(a) Self-service copiers are available in some of our facilities. Contact the appropriate facility to ask about availability before you visit.</P>
                <P>(b) In the Washington, DC, area, self-service card-operated copiers are located in research rooms. Other copiers we set aside for use by reservation are located in designated research areas. Procedures for use are outlined in §§ 1254.80 through 1254.84 of this subpart.</P>
                <P>(c) You may use NARA self-service copiers where available after the research room attendant reviews the documents to determine their suitability for copying. The appropriate supervisor or the senior archivist on duty in the research room reviews the determination of suitability if you request.</P>
                <P>(d) We may impose time limits on using self-service copiers if others are waiting to use them.</P>
                <P>(e) In some of our facilities, you may use your own scanner or personal paper-to-paper copier to copy textual materials if the equipment meets our standards cited in §§ 1254.80 and 1254.86. Contact the appropriate facility for additional details before you visit.</P>
                <P>(f) You must follow our document handling instructions in §§ 1254.36 and 1254.72. You also must follow our microfilm handling instructions in § 1254.42.</P>
                <P>(g) You may use a hand-held camera with no flash or a cell phone camera to take pictures of documents only if you have the permission of the research room attendant.</P>

                <P>(h) You may not use a self-service copier or personal scanner to copy some special media records. If you wish to copy motion pictures, maps and architectural drawings, or aerial photographic film, the appropriate staff can <PRTPAGE P="687"/>advise you on how to order copies. If you wish to obtain copies of electronic records files, the appropriate staff will assist you.</P>

                <P>(a) We must properly cancel security classification markings (Confidential, Secret, Top Secret) and other restricted markings on declassified records before documents are copied. Only a NARA staff member can cancel security markings. Properly declassified documents bear the declassification authority as required by 32 CFR 2001.24.</P>
                <P>(b) You may not remove from the research room copies of documents bearing uncancelled classification markings. We confiscate copies of documents with uncancelled markings.</P>
                <P>(c) When you copy individual documents, the research room staff cancels the classification markings on each page of the copy and places the declassification authority on the first page of each document. If you copy only selected pages from a document, you must make a copy of the first page bearing the declassification authority and attach that page to any subsequent page(s) you copy from the document. You must show this declassification authority to the guard or research room attendant when you remove copies of documents from the research room or the building.</P>
                <P>(d) Before you copy formerly-classified materials, we provide you with a declassification strip, which you attach to the copier. The strip reproduces on each page copied and cancels the security markings. We may also provide a declassification strip to attach to your personal copier or scanner.</P>
                <P>(e) Staff at Presidential libraries cancel security markings before documents are provided to researchers in research rooms.</P>

                <P>(a) Subject to §§ 1254.26(d) and 1254.86, you may use scanners and other copying equipment if the equipment meets certain conditions or minimum standards described in paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section. Exceptions <PRTPAGE P="688"/>are noted in paragraph (h). The supervisor administering the research room or the senior staff member on duty in the research room reviews the research room attendant's determination if you request.</P>
                <P>(b) Equipment platens or copy boards must be the same size or larger than the records. No part of a record may overhang the platen or copy board.</P>
                <P>(c) No part of the equipment may come in contact with records in a manner that causes friction, abrasion, or that otherwise crushes or damages records.</P>
                <P>(d) We prohibit drum scanners.</P>
                <P>(e) We prohibit automatic feeder devices on flatbed scanners. When using a slide scanner, we must check slides after scanning to ensure that no damage occurs while the slide is inside the scanner.</P>
                <P>(f) Light sources must not raise the surface temperature of the record you copy. You must filter light sources that generate ultraviolet light.</P>
                <P>(g) All equipment surfaces must be clean and dry before you use records. You may not clean or maintain equipment, such as replacing toner cartridges, when records are present. We do not permit aerosols or ammonia-containing cleaning solutions. We permit a 50 percent water and 50 percent isopropyl alcohol solution for cleaning.</P>
                <P>(h) If you wish to use a scanner or other personal copier in a regional archives or Presidential library, contact the facility first for approval. Not all facilities permit the use of scanners or personal copying equipment because of space, electrical load concerns, and other reasons. Your request must state the space and power consumption requirements and the intended period of use.</P>
                <P>(i) In facilities that provide a self-service copier or permit the use of personal paper-to-paper copiers or scanners, you must show documents you wish to copy to the research room attendant for approval.</P>

                <P>(j) If you have any question about what is permissible at any given facility, consult with the facility before your visit. Contact information for our facilities is found in part 1253 of this chapter and at the NARA Web site, <E T="03">http://www.archives.gov.</E>

                <P>(a) There is a 5-minute time limit on copiers in research rooms when others are waiting to use the copier. If you use a microfilm reader-printer, we may limit you to three copies when others are waiting to use the machine. If you wish to copy large quantities of documents, you should see a staff member in the research room to reserve a copier for an extended time period.</P>

                <P>Your research identification card can be used as a debit card if you arrange with the Cashier's Office to set up an account using cash, check, money order, debit card, or credit card. Your researcher identification card number as encoded on the card forms the basis of your account in the debit system. You may also purchase generic debit cards of values up to $20 each from the Cashier's Office using any of the above payment methods. When the Cashier's Office is closed or at any other time during the hours research rooms are open as cited in part 1253 of this chapter, you may use cash or credit card to purchase a debit card from the vending machines located in the research rooms. Inserting the debit card into a card reader connected to the copier enables you to make copies for the appropriate fee, which are found in § 1258.12 of this chapter. You can add value to your card using the vending machine in the research room or at the Cashier's Office. We do not make refunds.</P>

                <P>(g) When you bring audio or video recording tapes or cassettes into the unrestricted area of the research room, the research room attendant marks the recording media “NARA-approved personal property” for identification purposes. We inspect this media before you leave the research room and when you leave the research complex at the National Archives at College Park.</P>
                <P>(h) You may reserve a NARA-furnished video copying station and 120-minute blank video cassette, for a fee, on a first-come-first-served basis for 90 minutes. If no one else is waiting to use the station, you may reserve an additional 90 minutes. You may not connect personal recording devices to NARA equipment at the video copying station. You may use only NARA-provided tapes at the video copying station. Fees for use of the station and blank cassette are specified in § 1258.12 of this chapter.</P>
                <P>(i) You may not take any personal recording device or media in the restricted viewing area in the research room.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What credits must I give NARA?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) You must agree to credit NARA as having custody of the original documents. The credit must appear at the beginning of a microfilm publication and in any publicity material or descriptions of the publication.</P>
              <P>(b) If the original documents are Federal records, you must agree to include on the film this statement: “The documents reproduced in this publication are among the records of the (name of agency) in the custody of the National Archives of the United States. (Name of microfilm publication producer) does not claim any copyright interest in these official U.S. Government records.”</P>
              <P>(c) If the original documents are donated historical materials, you must agree to include on the film this statement: “The documents reproduced in this publication are donated historical materials from (name of donor) in the custody of the (name of Presidential library or National Archives of the United States). The National Archives and Records Administration administers them in accordance with the requirements of the donor's deed of gift and the U.S. Copyright Law, Title 17, U.S.C. (Name of microfilm publication producer) does not claim any copyright interest in these donated historical materials.”</P>

              <P>(d) If the original documents are Presidential or Vice-Presidential records as specified in 44 U.S.C. 2201, you must agree to include on the film this statement: “The documents reproduced in this publication are Presidential records in the custody of the (name of Presidential library or National Archives of the United States). The National Archives and Records Administration administers them in accordance with the requirements of Title 44, U.S.C. (Name of microfilm <PRTPAGE P="692"/>publication producer) does not claim any copyright interest in these official Presidential records.”</P>
              <P>(e) If the original documents are records of Congress, you must agree to include on the film this statement: “The documents reproduced in this publication are among the records of the (House of Representatives/Senate) in the physical custody of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). NARA administers them in accordance with the requirements of the (House/Senate). (Name of microfilm publication producer) does not claim any copyright interest in these official congressional records.”</P>

              <SUBJECT>May NARA make subsequent use of my publication?</SUBJECT>
              <P>You must give NARA a royalty-free worldwide license, to take effect seven years after you complete filming at the NARA facility, to publish, display, reproduce, distribute, and sell the publication, and to create derivative works based on the publication, and to use the publication in collective works, all without limitation. The license required by this section must be written to take effect upon publication if there is no commercial distributor, or once commercial distribution ends if less than seven years from the date you complete filming at the NARA facility.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 1254.100</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>How does NARA evaluate requests?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) NARA evaluates requests by estimating how well completion of a proposed project would further our efforts to preserve and to make available to the public the historically valuable records of the Government.</P>
              <P>(b) In considering multiple requests to film at the same time, we give priority to microfilming records that have research value for a variety of studies or that contain basic information for fields of research in which researchers have demonstrated substantial interest.</P>
              <P>(c) The records to be filmed should be reasonably complete and not subject to future additions, especially of appreciable volumes, within the original body of records. Records with pending or future end-of-series additions are appropriate for filming.</P>
              <P>(d) The records to be filmed should not have substantial numbers of documents withdrawn because of continuing national security classification, privacy, or other restrictions.</P>
              <P>(e) We approve only requests to microfilm a complete body of documents, such as an entire series or a major continuous segment of a very large series that is reasonably divisible. Microfilming a complete body of documents means that you must consecutively copy all documents within the file unit(s), from the first to the last page, not skipping any pages in between except for pages that are exact duplicates or blank pages that are not included in a pagination scheme.</P>
              <P>(f) We normally approve only requests that include assurances that the project will adhere to the specifications in part 1230 of this chapter concerning microfilm stock standards, index placement, and microfilm processing for permanent records.</P>
              <P>(g) We approve only requests that specify that NARA will receive a first generation silver halide duplicate negative containing no splices made from the original camera negative of the microform record created in accordance with part 1230 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(1) We may use this duplicate negative microform to make duplicate preservation and reference copies. The copies may be made available for NARA and public use in NARA facilities and programs immediately upon receipt.</P>
              <P>(2) We may also make additional use of the microform, as indicated in § 1254.98, seven years after you complete filming at the NARA facility, or upon delivery of the publication if there is no commercial distributor, or when the commercial distributor is no longer available, whichever occurs first. We may choose to add our own editorial material to the microform copies.</P>

              <P>(3) You must deliver detailed roll lists with the microfilm. The lists must give the full range of file titles and a complete list of all file numbers on each roll of microfilm. We prefer that the list be provided in a fielded, electronic format to facilitate its use by staff and researchers. If the electronic format is a data file with defined or delimited fields, you should transfer with <PRTPAGE P="693"/>the file the records layout identifying the fields, any coded values for fields, and explanations of any delimiters.</P>
              <P>(4) Microfilm projects may donate to us additional indexes and finding aids. NARA and the microfilm project execute a deed of gift that specifies restrictions on NARA's use and dissemination of these products under mutually acceptable terms.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What requests does NARA not approve?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) We do not approve any request that does not include all of the information we require in §§ 1254.94 and 1254.96.</P>
              <P>(b) We do not normally approve requests to microfilm documents that:</P>
              <P>(1) Have previously been microfilmed and made available to the public;</P>
              <P>(2) We have approved for microfilming by another party; or</P>
              <P>(3) We plan to film as a NARA microfilm publication or which relate closely to other documents previously microfilmed or approved for microfilming by NARA. We may grant exceptions to this provision at our discretion.</P>
              <P>(c) We normally do not approve requests to microfilm documents:</P>
              <P>(1) Having restrictions on access that preclude their reproduction;</P>
              <P>(2) Known to be protected by copyright;</P>
              <P>(3) Having high intrinsic value that only authorized NARA personnel may handle;</P>
              <P>(4) In vulnerable physical condition;</P>
              <P>(5) Having a high research demand and which we would have to deny to others for an extended period of time during the microfilming process. Where possible, we assist you in developing filming schedules that avoid the need to close documents for a lengthy period of time; and</P>
              <P>(6) In formats, such as oversize documents, bound volumes, and others, that would be subject to excessive stress and possible damage from special equipment you plan to use, as well as documents fastened with grommets, heavy duty staples, miscellaneous fasteners, or wafers and other adhesives that cannot be removed without tearing or breaking documents.</P>
              <P>(d) We normally do not approve requests from persons or organizations that failed to produce usable microfilm or to honor commitments they made in previous requests, or for whom we have had to rescind previous permission to microfilm documents because of their conduct.</P>
              <P>(e) We do not approve requests to microfilm records in NARA facilities in which there is insufficient space available for private microfilming. We do not permit private microfilming in our records storage (stack) areas.</P>
              <P>(1) Federal agencies microfilming records in support of the agency's mission may use the space set aside for private microfilming. Agency microfilming takes priority over private microfilming when there is insufficient space to accommodate both at the same time.</P>
              <P>(2) When a NARA facility does not have enough space to accommodate all requests, we may schedule separate projects by limiting the time allowed for each particular project or by requiring projects to alternate their use of the space.</P>
              <P>(3) We also do not approve requests where the only space available for filming is in the facility's research room, and such work would disturb researchers. We do not move records from a facility lacking space for private microfilming to another NARA facility for that purpose.</P>
              <P>(f) We do not approve requests to microfilm records when there is not enough staff to provide the necessary support services, including document preparation, training of private microfilmers, and monitoring the filming.</P>
              <P>(g) We do not approve the start of a project to microfilm records until you have agreed in writing to the amount and schedule of fees for any training, microfilm preparation, and monitoring we must conduct that is necessary to support your project. Our letter of tentative approval for the project includes an agreement detailing the records in the project and the detailed schedule of fees for NARA services for the project. We give final approval when we receive your signed copy of the agreement.</P>

              <SUBJECT>How does NARA determine fees to prepare documents for microfilming?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) As part of our evaluation of a request to microfilm documents, we determine the amount of microfilm preparation that we must do before you can microfilm the documents and the estimated cost of such preparation. We base fees for microfilm preparation on direct salary costs (including benefits) and supply costs when we perform the work. When a NARA contractor performs the work, the fees are the cost to NARA. Microfilm preparation includes:</P>
              <P>(1) Removing document fasteners from documents when the fasteners can be removed without damage to the documents; and</P>
              <P>(2) Taking any document conservation actions that must be accomplished in order to film the documents, such as document flattening or mending.</P>
              <P>(b) We provide you detailed information on the fees for microfilm preparation in the letter of approval. You must pay fees in accordance with § 1258.14 of this chapter. When a body of documents requires extensive microfilm preparation, we may establish a different payment schedule at our discretion.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What are NARA's equipment standards?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Because we have limited space in many NARA facilities, microfilm/fiche equipment should be operable from a table top unless we have given written permission to use free standing/floor model cameras. You may only use planetary type camera equipment. You may not use automatic rotary cameras and other equipment with automatic feed devices. We may approve your use of book cradles or other specialized equipment designed for use with bound volumes, oversized documents, or other formats, as well as other camera types not specified here, on a case-by-case basis.</P>
              <P>(b) The power consumption of the equipment normally must not exceed 1.2 kilowatts. Power normally available is 115 volts, 60 hz. You must make requests for electricity exceeding that normally available at least 90 days in advance.</P>
              <P>(c) You may not use equipment having clamps or other devices to exert pressure upon or to attach the document to any surface in a way that might damage the document.</P>
              <P>(d) The equipment must not use a heat generating light source in close enough proximity to the documents to result in their physical distortion or degradation. All sources of ultraviolet light must be filtered.</P>
            </SECTION>
            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 1254.108</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>What are NARA's requirements for the microfilming process?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Your equipment must conform to the equipment standards in § 1254.106.</P>
              <P>(b) You must handle documents according to the training and instructions provided by our staff so that documents are not damaged during copying and so that their original order is maintained. Only persons who have attended NARA training will be permitted to handle the documents or supervise microfilming operations. We charge you fees for training services and these fees will be based on direct salary costs (including benefits) and any related supply costs. We specify these fees in the written agreement we require for project approval in § 1254.102(h).</P>
              <P>(c) You may microfilm documents from only one file unit at a time. After you complete microfilming, you must return documents you removed from files for microfilming to their original position in the file container, refasten any fasteners you removed to facilitate copying, and remove any tabs you placed on the documents to identify items to copy. We will provide fasteners for replacement as necessary.</P>
              <P>(d) You may not leave documents unattended on the copying equipment or elsewhere.</P>
              <P>(e) Under normal microfilming conditions, actual copying time per sheet must not exceed 30 seconds.</P>
              <P>(f) You must turn off any lights used with the camera when the camera is not in actual operation.</P>

              <P>(g) You may operate microfilm equipment only in the presence of the research room attendant or a designated NARA employee. If NARA places microfilm projects in a common research area with other researchers, the project will not be required to pay for <PRTPAGE P="695"/>monitoring that is ordinarily provided. If the microfilm project is performed in a research room set aside for copying and filming, we charge the project fees for these monitoring services and these fees will be based on direct salary costs (including benefits). When more than one project share the same space, monitoring costs will be divided equally among the projects. We specify the monitoring service fees in the written agreement required for project approval in § 1254.102(h).</P>
              <P>(h) The equipment normally should be in use each working day that it is in a NARA facility. The director of the NARA facility (as defined in § 1252.2 of this chapter) decides when you must remove equipment because of lack of regular use. You must promptly remove equipment upon request of the facility director.</P>
              <P>(i) We assume no responsibility for loss or damage to microfilm equipment or supplies you leave unattended.</P>

              <P>(j) We inspect the microform output at scheduled intervals during the project to verify that the processed film meets the microfilm preparation and filming standards required by part 1230 of this chapter. To enable us to properly inspect the film, we must receive the film within 5 days after it has been processed. You must provide NARA with a silver halide duplicate negative of the filmed records (<E T="03">see</E> § 1254.100(g)) according to the schedule shown in paragraph (k). If the processed film does not meet the standards, we may require that you refilm the records.</P>
              <P>(k) When you film 10,000 or fewer images, you must provide NARA with a silver halide duplicate negative upon completion of the project. When the project involves more than 10,000 images, you must provide a silver halide duplicate negative of the first completed roll or segment of the project reproducing this image count to NARA for evaluation. You also must provide subsequent completed segments of the project, in quantities approximating 100,000 or fewer images, to NARA within 30 days after filming unless we approve other arrangements.</P>
              <P>(l) If the microfilming process is causing visible damage to the documents, such as flaking, ripping, separation, fading, or other damage, filming must stop immediately and until the problems can be addressed.</P>

              <P>We may, at any time, rescind permission to microfilm records if:</P>
              <P>(a) You fail to comply with the microfilming procedures in § 1254.108;</P>
              <P>(b) Inspection of the processed microfilm reveals persistent problems with the quality of the filming or processing;</P>
              <P>(c) You fail to proceed with the microfilming or project as indicated in the request, or</P>
              <P>(d) The microfilming project has an unanticipated adverse effect on the condition of the documents or the space set aside in the NARA facility for microfilming.</P>
              <P>(e) You fail to pay NARA fees in the agreed to amount or on the agreed to payment schedule.</P>

              <P>This part describes NARA's policies on access to archival records of the Executive Branch and donated historical materials in the National Archives of the United States and to records in the physical custody of the Federal records centers. This part applies to records and materials covered by the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. 2108 and chs. 29, 31, 33) and donated historical materials. This part does not apply to Presidential, Supreme Court, Senate, House of Representatives, and Architect of the Capitol records except for the purpose of directing mandatory review requests in subpart E.</P>

              <SUBJECT>How do I obtain access to records stored in Federal Records Centers?</SUBJECT>
              <P>Agencies that retire their records to a Federal records center (FRC) set rules for access to those records. Address requests for access to records stored in Federal records centers directly to the appropriate agency or to the appropriate FRC director at the address shown in part 1253. When the agency's rules permit, NARA makes FRC records available to requesters. When the agency's rules and restrictions do not permit access FRCs receive requests that should have been sent to the agency, the FRC director refers the requests and any appeals for access, including those made under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552, as amended), to the responsible agency.</P>

              <SUBJECT>May I obtain access to Federal archival records?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Most Federal archival records are open for research without submitting a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. Part 1254 specifies procedures for using unrestricted records in a NARA research room, submitting reference requests, and ordering copies of records.</P>
              <P>(b) Some records are subject to restrictions prescribed by statute, Executive Order, or by restrictions specified in writing in accordance with 44 U.S.C. 2108 by the agency that transferred the records to the National Archives of the United States. All agency-specified restrictions must comply with the FOIA. Even if the records are not national-security classified, we must screen some records for other information exempt from release under the FOIA.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 1256.22</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>How do I request access to restricted information in Federal archival records?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) You may file a FOIA request. To request access under the provisions of the FOIA, see part 1250 of this chapter, Public Availability and Use of Federal Records.</P>
              <P>(b) For classified information in Federal records, you may file a FOIA request or a mandatory review request under Executive Order 12958, as amended, as described in § 1256.74.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 1256.24</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>How long may access to some records be denied?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Although many records are open for research, some records are closed for long periods, either under our general restrictions, described in subpart D of this part, or another governing authority. For example, in accordance with 44 U.S.C. 2108(b), we do not grant access to restricted census and survey records of the Bureau of the Census less than 72 years old containing data identifying individuals enumerated in population censuses.</P>
              <P>(b) Screening records takes time. We screen records as soon as possible and can often make most of the records in which you are interested available. In the case of electronic structured databases, NARA can make a copy of records with restricted information masked. In response to FOIA requests for records in other media, we make a copy of the record available if we can mask or “redact” restricted information.</P>

              <P>(a) For information on filing appeals for requests made under the FOIA, see 36 CFR part 1250, subpart D, Appeals.</P>
              <P>(b) For information on filing appeals for requests made under mandatory review, see § 1260.54 of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">NARA policy.</E> Access to archival records containing information access to which would invade the privacy of an individual is restricted by § 1256.56.</P>

              <P>(1) NARA may authorize access to such records for the purpose of research to qualified persons doing biomedical or social science research under the conditions outlined in this section as long as the records do not also contain information restricted by statute or national security-classified information.<PRTPAGE P="698"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) If NARA is able to make a copy of such records with all personal identifiers masked or deleted, NARA will make such a “sanitized” copy of the record available to all researchers in accordance with § 1256.24.</P>
              <P>(3) NARA will not grant access to restricted census and survey records of the Bureau of the Census less than 72 years old containing data identifying individuals enumerated in population censuses in accordance with 44 U.S.C. 2108(b).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Request for access.</E> Researchers who wish to have access to records restricted by § 1256.56 to conduct biomedical or social science research must submit a written request to the NARA FOIA/Privacy Act Officer (NGC), National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001. OMB control number 3095-0002 has been assigned to this collection of information requirement. Researchers are encouraged to consult informally with NARA before submitting the formal request. The request must include the following information:</P>
              <P>(1) Name and mailing address;</P>

              <P>(6) A listing of all sources of grant funds supporting the research project or its publication;</P>
              <P>(7) A statement of the methodology to be used;</P>
              <P>(8) A statement of the administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to be employed by the researcher to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of the records;</P>
              <P>(9) A listing of the record groups and series titles to be used; and</P>
              <P>(10) A statement that the researcher will abide by the conditions of access to be prescribed by NARA and that the researcher will assume responsibility for the action of all persons working with the researcher on the project.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Access Review Committee.</E> Requests made under paragraph (b) of this section will be reviewed by NARA's Access Review Committee, which is composed of the Deputy Archivist of the United States, the Assistant Archivist for the Office of Records Services—Washington, DC, the Assistant Archivist for the Official of Regional Records Services, and the director(s) of the NARA division(s) that has custody of the requested records. The Committee may consult other persons within and outside the Federal Government who are knowledgeable in the research field for assistance in evaluating a request.</P>
              <P>(1) The Committee will examine the request to determine whether:</P>
              <P>(i) The requested information is of such a highly sensitive personal nature that disclosure must not be permitted even for biomedical or social science research;</P>
              <P>(ii) The methodology proposed by the requester will permit the researcher to obtain the projected research results without revealing personally identifying information;</P>
              <P>(iii) The research results are intended to be published or presented at an academic or research conference;</P>
              <P>(iv) The requester is a biomedical or social science researcher who has previous research experience and has submitted or intends to submit articles or books on such research for publication;</P>
              <P>(v) The safeguards proposed by the requester will adequately protect the personal information; and</P>
              <P>(vi) NARA has sufficient staff and space available to safeguard privacy interests necessary to accommodate the research project.</P>
              <P>(2) The decision of the Committee will be made in writing to the requester within 15 workdays after receipt of a completed request. At the discretion of the Committee, the researcher may meet with the Committee to discuss the project or to discuss revising the research proposal to meet possible objections of the Committee.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Conditions of access.</E> Researchers who are granted access to restricted records, all others associated with the research project who will have access <PRTPAGE P="699"/>to personally identifiable information from the records, and the manager of any facility handling the records containing personal identifiers must agree in writing to maintain the confidentiality of the information and to adhere to the conditions of access imposed by NARA. NARA will impose the following conditions of access on any project; additional conditions may be imposed on the use of specific records or on specific projects:</P>
              <P>(1) The records may be used only for the purpose of the research and for the reporting of research findings as described in the approved research project. The records may not be used for any other purpose;</P>
              <P>(2) The records and any authorized copies of records may not be transferred to any person or institution not directly involved with the approved research project and subject to a written agreement to maintain confidentiality specified in § 1256.28(d);</P>
              <P>(3) Reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards, as approved by NARA, to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of the records must be established by the researcher and followed by all persons associated with the project;</P>
              <P>(4) When required by NARA, the records must be consulted at the NARA facility where the records are located;</P>
              <P>(5) The researcher's notes must not contain any individually identifiable information. The researcher must use an alternate code system to render personally identifiable information as anonymous in all research notes;</P>
              <P>(6) Persons who are identified in the records may not be contacted by or on behalf of the researcher;</P>
              <P>(7) Before publication or public presentation of the data, the final research product(s) must be provided to the Deputy Archivist of the United States for review. NARA's review is limited to ensuring that there is no possible identification of individuals in the research findings. NARA will not evaluate the validity of the research findings.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Noncompliance with conditions of access.</E> If we discover that a researcher has violated any of the conditions of access, we will take steps to revoke the NARA research privileges of that person and will consult with NARA's General Counsel or his or her designee to determine any other steps to be taken to prevent any further disclosure of the personal information concerned. NARA may also inform the following persons and organizations of the researcher's failure to follow the conditions of use:</P>
              <P>(1) The institution with which the researcher is affiliated, if applicable;</P>
              <P>(2) Persons who served as references in the application for access;</P>
              <P>(3) Organizations that provided grant funds for the project;</P>
              <P>(4) The sponsor of the publication or public presentation; and</P>
              <P>(5) Appropriate professional organizations.</P>

              <P>NARA encourages researchers to confer about donated historical materials with the appropriate director or reference staff member at the facilities listed in part 1253 of this chapter. Some donated historical materials have restrictions on their use and availability as stated in writing by the donors in the Donor's Deed of Gift. Some may have other restrictions imposed by statute or Executive Order. If warranted, the Archivist may apply general restrictions to donated materials even when not specified in the donor's deed of gift. NARA staff can assist you with questions about restrictions or copyright protection that may apply to donated materials. See § 1256.36 for information on appealing closure of donated materials and subpart D of this part for information about general restrictions.</P>

              <P>(a) At Presidential libraries and regional archives, you may write to the appropriate director at the facilities in part 1253 of this chapter. In the Washington, DC, area, you may write to the Director of Access Programs (NWC) for donated textual materials or the Director of Modern Records Programs (NWM) for donated electronic records. The mailing address for NWC and NWM <PRTPAGE P="700"/>is Office of Records Services—Washington, DC, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001.</P>
              <P>(b) You may request a review of documents restricted under terms of a donor's deed of gift or other legal instrument to determine whether the conditions originally requiring the closure still exist. Your request must describe each document requested so that the staff can locate it with a reasonable amount of effort. For files that NARA previously screened, you may cite the reference to the withheld document as it appears on the withdrawal sheet.</P>

              <P>(c) In many instances, the director or his or her designated representative will determine whether entire documents or portions of them can be opened. However, a donor or his or her representative reserves the right to determine whether the donor's materials, a series, or a document or portions of it should remain closed (<E T="03">see</E> § 1256.36).</P>
              <P>(d) For classified information in donated historical materials, you may file a mandatory review request under Executive Order 12958, as amended, as described in § 1256.74.</P>

              <P>(a) If you wish to appeal a denial of access from the director or his designated representative in implementing the provisions of a donor's deed of gift, you may write a letter addressed to the Deputy Archivist of the United States, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001. The Deputy Archivist, the Assistant Archivist for Presidential Libraries, and the Assistant Archivist for Records Services—Washington, DC, or their designated representatives, compose the Board of Review for appeals relating to donated historical materials.</P>
              <P>(b) The board's decision is final. If the board cannot make a determination on your request within 30 working days of receipt, NARA informs you of the reason for the delay. If the board determines that a document should remain closed, you may not file a new appeal for two years. Similarly, you may not file an appeal on documents in collections that have been open for research for less than 2 years.</P>
              <P>(c) In some cases, the donor or his representative may reserve the right to determine whether the donor's materials, a series, or a document or portions of it should remain closed; you cannot appeal such decisions.</P>
              <P>(d) For information on filing appeals for requests made under mandatory review of White House originated information, see § 1260.62 of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(a) In accordance with the requirements of section 4.4 of E.O. 12958, as amended, we may grant access to classified information to certain eligible persons. These persons are engaged in historical research projects or previously occupied policy-making positions to which they were appointed by the President. If you seek permission to examine materials under this special historical researcher/Presidential appointees access program, you must contact NARA in advance. We need at least 4 months before you wish to have access to the materials to permit time for the responsible agencies to process your request for access. If you seek access to classified Presidential records under section 4.4 of E.O. 12958, you must first qualify under special access provisions of 44 U.S.C. 2205. NARA informs you of the agencies to which you have to apply for permission to examine classified information, including classified information originated by the White House or classified information in the custody of the National Archives which was originated by a defunct agency.</P>
              <P>(b) You may examine records under this program only after the originating or responsible agency:</P>
              <P>(1) Determines in writing that access is consistent with the interest of national security; and</P>
              <P>(2) Takes appropriate steps to protect classified information from unauthorized disclosure or compromise, and ensures that the information is safeguarded in a manner consistent with Executive Order 12958, as amended.</P>
              <P>(c) The originating or responsible agency limits the access granted to former Presidential and Vice Presidential appointees to items that the person originated, reviewed, signed, or received while serving as an appointee.</P>
              <P>(d) To protect against the possibility of unauthorized access to restricted documents, a director may issue instructions supplementing the research room rules provided in 36 CFR part 1254.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Can I get access to and obtain copies of USIA audiovisual records transferred to the National Archives of the United States?</SUBJECT>
              <P>NARA provides access to USIA audiovisual records after the appropriate time period of restriction has passed.</P>
              <P>(a) No USIA audiovisual records in the National Archives of the United States that were prepared for dissemination abroad are available for copying until at least 12 years after USIA first disseminated these materials abroad, or, in the case of materials prepared for foreign dissemination but not disseminated abroad, until at least 12 years after the preparation of the materials.</P>
              <P>(b) If the appropriate time has passed, you may have access to USIA audiovisual records that do not have copyright protection and do not contain copyright material. USIA audiovisual records prepared for dissemination abroad that NARA determines do not have copyright protection nor contain copyrighted material are available for examination and copying as described in the regulations in parts 1252, 1253, 1254, 1256, and 1258 of this chapter. To determine whether materials have copyright protection or contain copyrighted material, NARA relies on information contained within or fastened to individual records (for example, copyright notices); information contained within relevant USIA production, title, or other files that USIA transferred to NARA; information provided by requesters under § 1256.100(b) (for example, evidence from the Copyright Office that copyright has lapsed or expired); and information provided by copyright or license holders.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What costs make up the NARA fees?</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) 44 U.S.C. 2116(c) allows the NATF to recover all of its costs for providing records reproduction services to the <PRTPAGE P="707"/>public. The vast majority of materials that are reproduced are from the holdings of NARA, which require special handling, due to the age, condition and historical significance. Examples of special handling include the following:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">The placement of each record by hand on the reproduction equipment.</E> Many of the records are fragile and have historical uniqueness; reproduction equipment operators must take great care in handling these records. For example, each page of a document must be carefully placed by hand on the reproduction equipment, a copy made, the page removed, and the process re-started.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Clarity and legibility of the reproduced records.</E> Older records may be handwritten and darkened from age, which requires extra time to make sure we produce copies that are as clear and legible as possible.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Inability to use automatic document feeders.</E> Because of the requirements in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, automatic document feeders cannot be used for the duplication of paper materials. This adds time and cost to the price of copying these irreplaceable documents.</P>
            <P>(b) The NATF costs, at a minimum, include:</P>
            <P>(1) Salaries and benefits of the NATF staff involved in all aspects of the records reproduction process (includes, but is not limited to, compensation for full- and part-time employees, temporary appointments, overtime, awards, Civil Service Retirement Service and Federal Employees' Retirement System contributions, health benefits, life insurance benefits and Thrift Savings Plan contributions).</P>
            <P>(2) Travel and transportation (includes, but is not limited to, travel and transportation of persons, transportation of things, and contract mail service).</P>
            <P>(3) Rent, communications and utilities (includes, but is not limited to, telecommunications, equipment rental, and postage).</P>
            <P>(4) Printing and reproductions (includes, but is not limited to, commercial printing, advertising, and printing of forms).</P>
            <P>(5) Consulting and other services (includes, but is not limited to, management and professional services, contract labor, work performed in support of reproduction orders, and maintenance of equipment).</P>
            <P>(6) Payments to other agencies/funds (includes, but is not limited to, reimbursements and payments to other agencies and other funds within NARA). Specifically, the NATF “hires” the NARA custodial units to do reproduction work. In return, the NATF reimburses the custodial units for the cost of salaries and benefits.</P>
            <P>(7) Supplies and materials (includes, but is not limited to, general supplies, and materials and parts).</P>
            <P>(8) Depreciation (spreading the cost of an asset over the span of several years).</P>
            <P>(9) System upgrades/replacement (includes, but is not limited to, installation of operating equipment, software upgrades, and system changes).</P>

            <SUBJECT>How does NARA calculate fees for individual products?</SUBJECT>
            <P>NARA calculates the fees for individual products using the following:</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Cost summary.</E> A summary of all costs incurred by the NATF in providing records reproduction services.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Percent of revenue.</E> The percentage of the total NATF revenue represented by sales of a product. This is determined and used where a more accurate percentage based upon actual usage is not available. To calculate this percentage, an analysis is made to determine the current percent of NATF sales revenue represented by each product line. The sales volume is then reviewed with the custodial units to determine if this represents anticipated sales.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Actual cost percent calculation.</E> Using the information calculated in the Cost Summary, the actual revenue cost percentage is determined. In some cases, the actual percentage of cost can be calculated from available data or known constraints of the product line. For example, if the contractor responsible for providing copy support does not support the reproduction of a given product line then zero (0) percent of the contractor's costs would be allocated to that product line.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Forecasted volume.</E> The prediction of a product's sales volume in future year(s). These estimates are made by <PRTPAGE P="708"/>working with the custodial units and taking into account historical sales volume. An annual percent change is then estimated</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Reimbursements to the custodial units.</E> The amount paid to the custodial units for records reproductive services in support of NATF customer orders. The NATF reimburses the custodial units for services rendered to the NATF for the reproduction of NARA holdings. To determine the reimbursement per copy for an item, past reimbursement fees are changed by the compounded annual Government salary changes as issued by the Office of Personnel Management for the fiscal years being projected. The new rates are reviewed with custodial unit personnel and adjustments are made as required.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Additional cost allocation.</E> The costs unique to a given product line. Each product line is evaluated to determine the costs that are unique to that product line, such as purchase and installation costs of specialty equipment, replacement costs for aging equipment, copier leases and maintenance costs, etc. These costs are then allocated against those product lines that use the equipment. Where costs cross product lines, the allocations are apportioned based upon the percent of the estimated copy volume for each product line.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Fee calculation.</E> The product fee is calculated by the following formula: {[(Percent of Revenue * NATF Overhead Costs) + Reimbursement + Additional Costs]/Projected Sales Volume}</P>
            <FP>This calculation is completed for each product.</FP>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Final review.</E> After the suggested new fees are calculated, NATF reviews them to establish the final fees. Fees may be adjusted across product lines to ensure that the NATF can succeed in total cost recovery.</P>

            <SUBJECT>How does NARA change fees for existing records reproductions?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The NATF conducts periodic reviews of its fees to ensure that the costs of providing services to the public are properly recovered.</P>
            <P>(b) Existing records reproduction fees may be adjusted annually based on the following factors:</P>
            <P>(1) Inflation.</P>
            <P>(2) The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) salary changes.</P>
            <P>(3) Reallocation of shared costs across product lines using the methodology described in § 1258.6.</P>
            <P>(4) The projected sales volume for the product.</P>
            <P>(5) The actual sales volume for the product.</P>
            <P>(6) The approval of the Archivist of the United States.</P>
            <P>(d) NARA will place a notice on our Web site (<E T="03">http://www.archives.gov</E>) annually when announcing that records reproduction fees will be adjusted in accordance with this regulation.</P>

            <SUBJECT>How does NARA develop and publicize new records reproduction fees?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Custodial units prepare a justification proposal for a proposed records reproduction service and send the justification to the custodial unit office head, through appropriate channels, for concurrence and forwarding to NATF. The justification proposal includes, at a minimum, the following information:</P>
            <P>(1) Estimated monthly volume of product orders based on available historical data;</P>
            <P>(2) Identification of the equipment and supplies required to provide the product and service;</P>
            <P>(3) Brief description of the process required to provide the product and service, including the amount of time for each number and grade level of staff.</P>
            <P>(4) Identification of any services or products that will be replaced by the proposed products and services;</P>
            <P>(5) Identification of other NARA units that may have a demand for the proposed services; and</P>
            <P>(6) Any other relevant information.</P>
            <P>(b) After receiving the proposal, NATF staff:</P>
            <P>(1) Assesses the potential customer base for the proposed products and services, consulting other NARA offices.</P>

            <P>(2) If the potential demand does not warrant establishing fees for new records reproduction products and services, NATF notifies the proposing office that the new product and service are not approved and the reasons why.<PRTPAGE P="709"/>
            </P>
            <P>(3) If the potential demand warrants, NATF prepares a cost analysis following the methodology in § 1258.6 and develops a proposed recommended fee for review by NARA's Financial Resources Division and approval by the Archivist of the United States.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Notification of new records reproduction services and trial periods:</E> (1) The public will be notified of new records reproduction services, including the business case for determining initial fee, on-line at <E T="03">http://www.archives.gov,</E> by press releases, and through NARA's social media outlets.</P>
            <P>(2) New records reproduction services fees have an initial trial period of one year. During this time, the public is encouraged to provide feedback to NARA about the new records reproduction services and their fees as directed in the notification of the new services.</P>
            <P>(3) Prior to the expiration of a trial period, NATF will assess the validity of the fees for the new records reproduction products and services, and make one of three determinations:</P>
            <P>(i) Retain products, services and fees;</P>
            <P>(ii) Retain products or services but adjust fees up or down; or</P>
            <P>(iii) Discontinue products or services.</P>

            <P>(d) The public will be notified of NATF determination, including business case for determination, in NARA research rooms nationwide, on-line at <E T="03">http://www.archives.gov,</E> press releases, and through NARA's social media outlets.</P>

            <P>At the discretion of the Secretary of the NATF, customers are not charged a fee for records reproductions or certifications in the instances described in this section.</P>
            <P>(a) When NARA furnishes copies of records to other elements of the Federal Government. However, a fee may be charged if the appropriate director determines that the service cannot be performed without reimbursement;</P>

            <P>(e) When the reproduction is for a foreign, State, or local government or an international agency and furnishing it without charge is an appropriate courtesy; and</P>
            <P>(f) For records of other Federal agencies in NARA Federal records centers only:</P>
            <P>(1) When furnishing the service free conforms to generally established business custom, such as furnishing personal reference data to prospective employers of former Government employees;</P>

            <P>(2) When the reproduction of not more than one copy of the document is required to obtain from the Government financial benefits to which the requesting person may be entitled (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> veterans or their dependents, employees with workmen's compensation claims, or persons insured by the Government);</P>
            <P>(3) When the reproduction of not more than one copy of a hearing or other formal proceeding involving security requirements for Federal employment is requested by a person directly concerned in the hearing or proceeding; and</P>

            <P>(4) When the reproduction of not more than one copy of a document is for a person who has been required to furnish a personal document to the Government (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> a birth certificate required to be given to an agency where the original cannot be returned to the individual).</P>

            <SUBJECT>What is NARA's refund policy?</SUBJECT>

            <P>Due to various factors, it is occasionally difficult for NARA to make a legible reproduction. NARA will notify customers and ask for approval to proceed if we anticipate a reproduction of questionable legibility. As a result, NARA does not provide refunds except in special cases. If a customer requests a refund, we review the order to determine if we properly notified the customer of the questionable nature of the <PRTPAGE P="710"/>original and if the product is a true representation of the original. If the product is a true representation of the original, we will not issue a refund. If you feel we processed your order incorrectly or it contains errors, please contact us within 30 days of your delivery date to have your issue verified. Once we verify the issue, we will correct the error and resend the documents. If we cannot correct the error, you will receive a refund.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What are NARA considerations when implementing automatic declassification?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Integral File Blocks.</E> Classified records within an integral file block that have not been reviewed and properly exempted from declassification, or referred to an equity holder, will be automatically declassified on December 31 of the year that is 25 years from the date of the most recent record within the file block, except as specified in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section. For the purposes of automatic declassification, integral file blocks shall contain only records dated within 10 years of the oldest record in the block. The records of each Presidential Administration will be treated as an integral file block and will be scanned for declassification review through the RAC Project.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Special media records.</E> After consultation with the Director of the National Declassification Center and before the records are subject to automatic declassification, an agency head or senior agency official may delay automatic declassification for up to five additional years for classified information contained in media that make a review for possible declassification exemptions more difficult or costly. NARA, through the NDC, will coordinate processing of referrals made in these special media records as part of its overall prioritization strategy.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Referrals.</E> The IRC at the NDC will provide official notification for Federal records, while the RAC Project will provide formal notification for Presidential records. For agencies which fail to act on their referrals after formal notification by the IRC or the RAC Project, NARA will automatically declassify their information in accordance with section 3.3(d)(3)(B) of the Order.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Additional referrals.</E> Agencies will identify referrals in accordance with section 3.3(d)(3) of the Order. NARA will delay automatic declassification for up to 1 year for classified records that have been identified by the originating agency or by NARA as having classified information that requires referral that were not identified by the primary reviewing agency.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Other circumstances.</E> Information from another agency that has not been properly identified and referred is not subject to automatic declassification. When NARA identifies information, in accordance with section 3.3 of the Order, that agency will have up to 1 year from the date of formal notification to review its information for declassification.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Discovery of information inadvertently not reviewed.</E> When NARA identifies a file series or collection in its physical and legal custody that contains classified information over 25 <PRTPAGE P="718"/>years old and that was inadvertently not reviewed before the effective date of automatic declassification, NARA must report the discovery to the Information Security Oversight Office (ISOO) and to the responsible agency head or senior agency official within 90 days of discovery. ISOO, the responsible agency, and NARA will consult on a delay of up to three years to review the records.</P>

              <P>(a) NARA will review the requested records and determine if they have already been released. If not, NARA will refer copies of the records to the originating agency and to agencies that may have an interest or activity with respect to the classified information for declassification review. Agencies may also send personnel to a NARA facility where the records are located to conduct a declassification review, or may delegate declassification authority to NARA.</P>
              <P>(b) When the records were originated by a defunct agency that has no successor agency, NARA is responsible for making the declassification determinations, but will consult with agencies having interest in or activity with respect to the classified information.</P>
              <P>(c) If the document or information has been reviewed for declassification within the past 2 years, NARA may opt not to conduct a second review and may instead inform the requester of this fact and of the prior review decision and advise the requester of appeal rights in accordance with 32 CFR 2001.33.</P>

              <P>(d) If NARA determines that a requester has submitted a request for the same information under both MDR and the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), as amended, NARA will notify <PRTPAGE P="719"/>the requester that he/she is required to elect one process or the other. If the requester fails to elect one or the other, the request will be treated under the FOIA, unless the requested information or materials are subject only to mandatory review.</P>
              <P>(e) In every case, NARA will acknowledge receipt of the request and inform the requester of the action taken. If additional time is necessary to make a declassification determination on material for which NARA has delegated authority, NARA will tell the requester how long it will take to process the request and advise the requester of available appeal rights. NARA may also inform the requester if part or all of the requested information is referred to other agencies for declassification review in accordance with section 3.6(a) and (b) of the Executive Order.</P>
              <P>(f) If NARA fails to provide the requester with a final decision on the mandatory review request within one year of the original date of the request, the requester may appeal to the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel (ISCAP).</P>

However, the President remains exclusively responsible for control and access to their records until their term of office concludes. During the President's terms of office, the Archivist does not disclose any of these records, except under the President's direction, until the President's term of office concludes. If a President serves consecutive terms, the Archivist does not disclose records without the President's direction until the end of the last term, or the end of <PRTPAGE P="722"/>another period if specified in 44 U.S.C. 2204 and subpart E of this part.</P>

              <P>(a) Title 44 U.S.C. chapter 22 grants the President certain discretion and authority over Presidential records. An incumbent or former President may designate one or more representatives to exercise this discretion and authority, including in the event of the President's death or disability.</P>
              <P>(b) The designation under paragraph (a) of this section is effective only if the Archivist receives written notice of it, including the names of the representatives, before the President dies or is disabled.</P>

              <P>An incumbent President may dispose of any Presidential records of their administration that, in the President's opinion, lack administrative, historical, informational, or evidentiary value, if the President obtains the Archivist's written views about the proposed disposal and either—</P>
              <P>(a) Those views state that the Archivist does not intend to request Congress's advice on the matter because the Archivist either does not consider the records proposed for disposal to be of special interest to Congress or does not consider it to be in the public interest to consult with Congress about the proposed disposal; or</P>
              <P>(b)(1) Those views state that the Archivist considers either that the records proposed for disposal may be of special interest to Congress or that consulting with Congress about the proposed disposal is in the public interest; and</P>

              <P>(2) The President submits copies of the proposed disposal schedule to the Senate and the House of Representatives at least 60 calendar days of continuous congressional session before the proposed disposal date. For the purpose of this section, a continuous congressional session breaks only when Congress adjourns <E T="03">sine die</E> (with no date set to resume). If either House of Congress adjourns with a date set to resume, and breaks for more than three days, the adjourned days do not count when computing the 60-day timeline. The President submits copies of the proposed disposal schedule to the Senate Committees on Rules and Administration and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, and to the House Committees on House Administration and Oversight and Government Reform.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Disposing of Presidential records in the Archivist's custody.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Archivist may dispose of Presidential records in the Archivist's legal custody that the Archivist appraises and determines to have insufficient administrative, historical, informational, or evidentiary value to warrant continuing to preserve them.</P>

              <P>(b) If the Archivist determines that Presidential records have insufficient value under paragraph (a) of this section, the Archivist publishes a proposed disposal notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> with a public comment period of at least 45 days. The notice describes the records the Archivist proposes to dispose of, the reason for disposing of them, and the projected earliest disposal date.</P>

              <P>(c) After the public comment period in paragraph (b) of this section, the Archivist publishes a final disposal notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> at least 60 calendar days before the earliest disposal date. The notice includes:</P>
              <P>(1) A reasonably specific description of the records scheduled for disposal;</P>
              <P>(2) The earliest disposal date; and</P>
              <P>(3) A concise statement of the reason for disposing of the records.</P>

              <P>(d) Publishing the notice required by paragraph (c) of this section in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> constitutes a final <PRTPAGE P="723"/>agency action for purposes of review under 5 U.S.C. 701-706.</P>

              <P>(a) An incumbent President may, prior to the end of the President's term of office or last consecutive term of office, restrict access to certain information within Presidential records created during their administration, for a period not to exceed 12 years after the President leaves office (in accordance with 44 U.S.C. 2204).</P>

              <P>(1) The restricting President waives the restriction, in whole or in part;</P>
              <P>(2) The restriction period in paragraph (a) of this section expires for the category of information; or</P>
              <P>(3) The Archivist determines that the restricting President or an agent of that President has published the restricted record, a reasonably segregable portion of the record, or any significant element or aspect of the information contained in the record, in the public domain.</P>

              <P>(a) If the Archivist denies a person access to a Presidential record or a reasonably segregable portion of it due to a restriction made under § 1270.40, that person may file an administrative appeal. To file an administrative appeal requesting access to Presidential records, send it to the director of the Presidential Library of the President during whose term of office the record was created, at the address listed in 36 CFR 1253.3. To file an administrative appeal requesting access to Vice Presidential records, send it to the director of the Presidential Materials Division at the address listed in 36 CFR 1253.1.</P>
              <P>(b) An appeal must arrive to the director within 90 calendar days from the date on the access denial letter.</P>
              <P>(c) Appeals must be in writing and must identify:</P>
              <P>(1) The specific records the requester is seeking; and</P>
              <P>(2) The reasons why the requester believes they should have access to the records.</P>
              <P>(d) The director responds to the requester in writing and within 30 working days from the date they receive the appeal. The director's response states whether or not the director is granting access to the Presidential records and the basis for that decision. The director's decision to withhold release of Presidential records is final and is not subject to judicial review.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Exceptions to restricted access.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Even when a President imposes restrictions on access under § 1270.40, NARA still makes Presidential records of former Presidents available in the following instances, subject to any rights, defenses, or privileges which the United States or any agency or person may invoke:</P>
              <P>(1) To a court of competent jurisdiction in response to a properly issued subpoena or other judicial process, for the purposes of any civil or criminal investigation or proceeding;</P>
              <P>(2) To an incumbent President if the President seeks records that contain information they need to conduct current Presidential business and the information is not otherwise available;</P>

              <P>(3) To either House of Congress, or to a congressional committee or subcommittee, if the congressional entity seeks records that contain information it needs to conduct business within its jurisdiction and the information is not otherwise available; or<PRTPAGE P="724"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) To a former President or their designated representative for access to the Presidential records of that President's administration, except that the Archivist does not make any original Presidential records available to a designated representative that has been convicted of a crime that involves reviewing, retaining, removing, or destroying NARA records.</P>
              <P>(b) The President, either House of Congress, or a congressional committee or subcommittee must request the records they seek under paragraph (a) of this section from the Archivist in writing and, where practicable, identify the records with reasonable specificity.</P>
              <P>(c) The Archivist promptly notifies the President (or their representative) during whose term of office the record was created, and the incumbent President (or their representative) of a request for records under paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) Once the Archivist notifies the former and incumbent Presidents of the Archivist's intent to disclose records under this section, either President may assert a claim of constitutionally based privilege against disclosing the record or a reasonably segregable portion of it within 30 calendar days after the date of the Archivist's notice. The incumbent or former President must personally make any decision to assert a claim of constitutionally based privilege against disclosing a Presidential record or a reasonably segregable portion of it.</P>
              <P>(e) The Archivist does not disclose a Presidential record or reasonably segregable part of a record if it is subject to a privilege claim asserted by the incumbent President unless:</P>
              <P>(1) The incumbent President withdraws the privilege claim; or</P>
              <P>(2) A court of competent jurisdiction directs the Archivist to release the record through a final court order that is not subject to appeal.</P>
              <P>(f)(1) If a former President asserts the claim, the Archivist consults with the incumbent President, as soon as practicable and within 30 calendar days from the date that the Archivist receives notice of the claim, to determine whether the incumbent President will uphold the claim.</P>
              <P>(2) If the incumbent President upholds the claim asserted by the former President, the Archivist does not disclose the Presidential record or a reasonably segregable portion of the record unless:</P>
              <P>(i) The incumbent President withdraws the decision upholding the claim; or</P>

              <P>When the Archivist determines it is in the public interest to make a Presidential record available to the public for the first time, the Archivist will:</P>
              <P>(a) Promptly notify, in writing, the former President during whose term of office the record was created and the incumbent President, or their representatives, of the intended disclosure. This notice informs the Presidents of the 60-day period in which either President may make a claim of constitutionally based privilege under § 1270.48; and</P>
              <P>(b) Notify the public. The notice includes the following information about the intended disclosure:</P>
              <P>(1) The number of pages;</P>
              <P>(2) A brief description of the records;</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 1270.48</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Releasing records to the public and claiming privilege against disclosure.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Once the Archivist notifies the former and incumbent Presidents of the Archivist's intent to disclose records under § 1270.46, either President may assert a claim of constitutionally based privilege against disclosing the record or a reasonably segregable portion of it. A President must assert their claim within 60 working days after the date of the Archivist's notice, and make the claim in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) If neither President asserts a claim within the 60-working-day period, the Archivist discloses the Presidential record covered by the notice. If either President asserts a claim on a reasonably segregable part of the record, the Archivist may disclose only the portion of the record not subject to the claim.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) The incumbent or former President may extend the period under paragraph (a) of this section once, for not more than 30 additional working days, by sending the Archivist a written statement asserting that the President needs the extension to adequately review the record.</P>
              <P>(2) However, if the 60-day period under paragraph (a) of this section, or any extension of that period under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, would end during the first six months of the incumbent President's first term of office, then the 60-day period or extension automatically extends to the end of that six-month period.</P>
              <P>(d)(1) The incumbent or former President must personally make any decision to assert a claim of constitutionally based privilege against disclosing a Presidential record or a reasonably segregable portion of it.</P>
              <P>(2) The President must notify the Archivist, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the House of Representatives, and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate, of a privilege claim under paragraph (a) of this section on the same day that the President asserts such a claim.</P>
              <P>(e)(1) If a former President asserts the claim, the Archivist consults with the incumbent President, as soon as practicable and within 30 calendar days from the date that the Archivist receives notice of the claim, to determine whether the incumbent President will uphold the claim.</P>
              <P>(2) The Archivist notifies the former President and the public of the incumbent President's decision on the former President's claim no later than 30 calendar days after the Archivist receives notice of the claim.</P>
              <P>(3) If the incumbent President upholds the claim asserted by the former President, the Archivist does not disclose the Presidential record or a reasonably segregable portion of the record unless:</P>
              <P>(i) The incumbent President withdraws the decision upholding the claim; or</P>
              <P>(ii) A court of competent jurisdiction directs the Archivist to disclose the record through a final court order that is not subject to appeal.</P>
              <P>(4) If the incumbent President does not uphold the claim asserted by the former President, fails to decide before the end of the 30-day period detailed in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, or withdraws a decision upholding the claim, the Archivist discloses the Presidential record 90 calendar days after the Archivist received notification of the claim (or 90 days after the withdrawal) unless a court order in an action in any Federal court directs the Archivist to withhold the record, including an action initiated by the former President under 44 U.S.C. 2204(e).</P>
              <P>(f) The Archivist does not disclose a Presidential record or reasonably segregable part of a record if it is subject to a privilege claim asserted by the incumbent President unless:</P>
              <P>(1) The incumbent President withdraws the privilege claim; or</P>
              <P>(2) A court of competent jurisdiction directs the Archivist to release the record through a final court order that is not subject to appeal.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Consulting with law enforcement agencies.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Archivist requests specific guidance from the appropriate law enforcement agency when the Archivist is determining whether to release Presidential records compiled for law enforcement purposes that may be subject to 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7). The Archivist requests guidance if:</P>
              <P>(1) No general guidance applies;</P>
              <P>(2) The record is particularly sensitive; or</P>
              <P>(3) The type of record or information is widespread throughout the files.</P>
              <P>(b) When the Archivist decides to release Presidential records compiled for law enforcement purposes, the Archivist notifies any agency that has provided guidance on those records under this section. The notice includes the following:</P>
              <P>(1) A description of the records in question;</P>
              <P>(2) A statement that the records described contain information compiled for law enforcement purposes and may be subject to the exemption provided by 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7) for records of this type; and</P>
              <P>(3) The name of a contact person at NARA.</P>
              <P>(c) Any guidance an agency provides under paragraph (a) of this section is not binding on the Archivist. The Archivist decides whether Presidential records are subject to the exemption in 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7).</P>

              <P>The Nixon Presidential Library controls the Nixon Presidential historical materials. Upon petition of any researcher who claims in writing to the library director that the restriction of specified materials is inappropriate and should be removed, the archivists will submit the pertinent materials, or representative examples of them, to the library director. The library director reviews the restricted materials, and consults with interested Federal agencies as necessary. To the extent these consultations require the transfer of copies of materials to Federal officials outside NARA, the library director will comply with the requirements of § 1275.32. As necessary and practicable, the library director will also seek the views of any person whose rights or privileges might be adversely affected by a decision to open the materials. The library director prepares a final written decision as to the continued restriction of all or part of the pertinent materials. The library director's decision constitutes the final administrative determination. The library director will notify the petitioner and other interested people of the final administrative determination within 60 calendar days following receipt of such petition.</P>

The Archivist will process these requests in accordance with the FOIA regulations set forth in 36 CFR part 1250, NARA Records Subject to FOIA.</P>
              <P>(b) In order to allow NARA archivists to devote as much time and effort as possible to the processing of materials for general public access, the Archivist will not process those FOIA requests where the requester can reasonably obtain the same materials through a request directed to an agency (as defined in § 1275.16(f)), unless the requester demonstrates that he or she has unsuccessfully sought access from that agency or its successor in law or function.</P>

                <P>(a) The primary use of NARA property in the Washington, DC, area (the National Archives Building and the National Archives at College Park), including those areas open to the public, is the conduct of official NARA business, including public programs and other activities conducted in conjunction with government and non-government organizations and the Foundation for the National Archives (“Foundation”). In conducting official business, NARA and its partners use all of the public areas of the Washington, DC, area facilities. There are no public areas in the Washington National Records Center in Suitland, MD.</P>
                <P>(b) NARA may permit, under the conditions described in this subpart, the occasional use of certain public areas by other Federal agencies, quasi-Federal agencies, and state, local, and tribal government organizations for official activities. NARA also permits the occasional, non-official use of its public areas by organizations when the activity relates to or furthers NARA's archival, records, or other programs.</P>

                <P>(a) All use must relate to or further the archival, records, or other activities of NARA. Examples of use that meet this standard include programs that promote research in or the dissemination and use of NARA holdings, including educational programs and materials, the preservation of NARA holdings or the historical records and documentary materials of other institutions, and the use and enjoyment of NARA exhibits.</P>
                <P>(b) All use must be consistent with the public perception of NARA as an archival and research institution.</P>
                <P>(c) When NARA cohosts an activity with the Foundation or other organizations, NARA must be identified as the cohost in all materials and publicity relating to the activity.</P>
                <P>(d) When NARA has authorized your organization to use NARA property, you may not characterize your use of NARA property as an endorsement by NARA of your organization or its activities, or otherwise suggest an official relationship between NARA and your organization.</P>
                <P>(e) You are not allowed to charge an admission fee or make any indirect assessment for admission, and you may not otherwise collect money at the event.</P>
                <P>(f) You may not use NARA property or permission to use that property to advertise, promote, or sell commercial enterprises, products, or services, or for partisan political, sectarian, or similar purposes.</P>
                <P>(g) You may not use NARA property if you or your organization or group engages in discriminatory practices proscribed by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended.</P>
                <P>(h) You must not misrepresent your identity to the public nor conduct any activities in a misleading or fraudulent manner.</P>
                <P>(i) You must ensure that no Government property is destroyed, displaced, or damaged during your use of NARA public areas. You must take prompt action to replace, return, restore, repair or repay NARA for any damage caused to Government property during the use of NARA facilities.</P>

            <P>(a) This part implements provisions of the Presidential Libraries Act, codified at 44 U.S.C. 2112(a) and (g). The Act requires the Archivist of the United States to promulgate architectural and design standards for new and existing Presidential libraries in order to ensure that such depositories preserve Presidential records subject to Chapter 22 of this title and papers and other historical materials accepted for deposit under section 2111 of this title and contain adequate research facilities. In addition the Archivist must submit a written report to the Congress before accepting new libraries or certain proposed physical or material changes or additions to an existing library; and to ensure, for existing libraries subject to the mandatory endowment requirement, that the endowment specified by 44 U.S.C. 2112(g) has <PRTPAGE P="745"/>been transferred to the National Archives Trust Fund before acceptance by the Archivist.</P>
            <P>(b) This part applies to design and construction of new libraries that are offered to NARA on or after July 17, 2008 and to material changes or additions to new and existing libraries funded wholly by gift on or after that date.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1281.8</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>What information must be provided to NARA for its report to Congress on a new Presidential library facility?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) NARA must submit a report to Congress on a proposed new library pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 2112(a)(3). The foundation that is building the library must help NARA as necessary in compiling the information needed for this report. If a State, political subdivision, university, institution of higher learning, or institute participates in the construction of the new library (e.g., by making land available for the facility), that party is subject to the same requirement. Requested information must be sent to the Office of Presidential Libraries (NL), Room 2200, 8601 Adelphi Rd., College Park, MD 20740-6001 far enough in advance of the anticipated date of transfer of the Library for NARA to compile and submit the report so that it may lie before Congress for the minimum time period specified in 44 U.S.C. 2112(a)(5). The normal lead time for submitting the required information is a least six months in advance of the anticipated date of transfer, but the submission date is subject to negotiation between NARA and the foundation in specific cases. The collection of information by NARA for these purposes has been approved under the Paperwork Reduction Act by the Office of Management and Budget with the control number 3095-0036.</P>
            <P>(b) Paragraph (a)(3) of 44 U.S.C. 2112 lists the information that NARA must include in its report to Congress. The foundation and NARA will agree as part of the planning process for a new library on what information the foundation will provide and when. The same requirement applies to other entities involved in the construction of a new library (e.g., a local government or university). Foundations will normally be responsible, at a minimum, for providing the following information to NARA:</P>

            <P>(1) A description of the land, facility, and equipment offered as a gift or to be made available without transfer of title, which must include:<PRTPAGE P="747"/>
            </P>
            <P>(i) The legal description of the land, including plat, and evidence of clear title to the land upon which the library is constructed;</P>
            <P>(ii) Site plan, floor plans, building sections and elevations, artist's representation of building and grounds;</P>
            <P>(iii) Description of building contents, including furniture, equipment, and museum installations; and</P>
            <P>(iv) Measurement of the facility in accordance with § 1281.16.</P>
            <P>(2) A statement specifying the estimated total cost of the library and the amount of the endowment required pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 2112(g);</P>
            <P>(3) An offer or other statement setting forth the terms of the proposed agreement for transfer or use of the facility, if any;</P>
            <P>(4) Copies of any proposed agreements between the state, other political subdivision, the donating group, other institutions, and the United States which may affect ownership or operation of the library facility;</P>
            <P>(5) A statement of and copies of any proposed agreements concerning the proposed support of library programs by non-federal sources; and</P>
            <P>(6) A statement on cost-saving design features of the building.</P>
            <P>(7) A written certification that the library and the equipment therein will comply with NARA standards.</P>

NARA will furnish the interested foundation the current architectural and design standards as specified in § 1281.4. Others may request a single copy by writing the Office of Presidential Libraries (NL), Room 2200, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What information must be provided to NARA for its report to Congress on a change or addition to a Presidential library facility?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) NARA must submit a report to Congress on a proposed physical or material change or addition to an existing library that is being funded wholly by gift. The foundation or other party offering the gift to NARA must help NARA as necessary in compiling the information needed for the report. Required information must be sent to the Office of Presidential Libraries (NL), Room 2200, 8601 Adelphi Rd., College Park, MD 20740-6001, far enough in advance of the Archivist's acceptance of the gift for NARA to compile and submit the report to Congress in accordance with 44 U.S.C. 2112(a)(5). The normal lead time for submitting the required information on physical or material changes or additions is at least nine (9) months in advance of the anticipated date that work will begin on the physical or material change or addition to the library. The collection of information contained in this section has been approved under the Paperwork Reduction Act by the Office of Management and Budget with the control number 3095-0036.</P>
            <P>(b) Paragraph (a)(4) of 44 U.S.C. 2112 lists the information that NARA must include in its report to Congress. The donor and NARA will agree as part of the planning process what information the donor will provide and when, but donors will normally be responsible, at a minimum, for providing the following information to NARA:</P>
            <P>(1) A description of the gift, which must include as appropriate:</P>
            <P>(i) The legal description of the land, including plat;</P>
            <P>(ii) Site plan, floor plans, building sections and elevations, artist's representation of building and grounds as they will be affected by the gift;</P>
            <P>(iii) Description of building contents that are part of the gift, including furniture, equipment, and museum installations;</P>
            <P>(iv) For endowment libraries, a measurement of the addition or change to the facility in accordance with § 1281.16; and</P>

            <P>(v) A review of all critical spaces where NARA holdings will be stored, <PRTPAGE P="748"/>used, or exhibited, including information on life-safety, environmental, holdings storage, and other systems against NARA standards.</P>
            <P>(2) A statement of the estimated total cost of the proposed physical or material change or addition to the library, and, for endowment libraries, an estimate of the amount of the additional endowment required pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 2112(g).</P>
            <P>(3) A statement of the purpose of the proposed change or addition.</P>
            <P>(4) A written certification that the library and the equipment therein will comply with NARA standards after the change or addition is made.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1281.14</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>What type of endowment is required for a Presidential library?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Endowment requirement—new libraries.</E> The foundation or organization that is offering NARA a new Presidential library must establish an endowment for the library, by gift or bequest, in the National Archives Trust Fund before the Archivist may accept the transfer of the library. The purpose of the endowment is to help NARA defray the cost of facility operations. The endowment requirement for the prospective new library of President George W. Bush is set forth in paragraphs 2 and 3 of 44 U.S.C. 2112(g). The endowment requirements for the new libraries of presidents taking the oath of office from the first time on or after July 1, 2002, are set forth in paragraphs 2, 3, and 5 of 44 U.S.C. 2112(g).</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Endowment requirement—change or addition to an endowment library.</E> For a proposed physical or material change or addition to an endowment library that is being funded wholly by gift, the foundation or other organization that is offering the gift must agree, as a condition of the gift, to transfer monies by gift or bequest to the library's existing endowment in the National Archives Trust Fund in an amount sufficient to satisfy the requirements of paragraphs 2, 3, and 5 of 44 U.S.C. 2112(g). The Archivist must determine that the additional endowment monies have been transferred to the Trust Fund before he accepts the gift of the physical or material change or addition.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Use of endowment income.</E> The income from a library's endowment is available to cover the cost of facility operations, but is not available for the performance of archival functions.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Calculating a library's endowment.</E> The formulas for calculating the required endowment are set forth in 44 U.S.C. 2112(g)(3)-(5).</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Equipment costs that must be included in the endowment calculation.</E> The cost of all operating equipment provided with a new library must be included in the endowment calculation pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 2112(g)(3). The Archivist will provide in the architectural and design standards, a list of equipment guidelines, recommendations, and minimum requirements for a foundation's use in designing and building a new library. The list is not exhaustive and requirements may change with evolving technology, program requirements, and the final library design.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Formula for a shared use library building.</E> For endowment purposes, the construction cost of a shared use library building containing both NARA and Foundation-controlled areas will be determined using the following formula: The percentage of the usable square footage of the NARA-controlled areas to the usable square footage of the entire building multiplied by the cost of the entire building. That figure is then used in calculating a library's endowment as specified by subsection (d) of this section and 44 U.S.C. 2112(g)(3)-(5).</P>

            <SUBJECT>What standard does NARA use for measuring building size?</SUBJECT>
            <P>For purposes of 44 U.S.C. 2112(g)(3) and (4), and this part, NARA has adopted the BOMA Standard (incorporated by reference in § 1281.2) as the standard for measuring the size of the facility and the value for calculating the endowment. The architectural and design standards contain the description of the area to be measured as to obtain the useable square footage and the exclusions to the measurement.</P>

            <P>(3) NARA has resources (such as exhibit and security staff) available to produce the special exhibit.</P>
            <P>(c) The Director of Museum Programs (NWE), in conjunction with the NARA General Counsel when appropriate, reviews all offers to display privately-owned material in the Washington, DC, area, and negotiates the terms of exhibition for offers that NARA can accept. Directors of Presidential libraries perform these tasks for their respective libraries. The lender must provide in writing evidence of title to and authenticity of the item(s) to be displayed before NARA makes a loan agreement.</P>
            <P>(d) The Director of Museum Programs or director of the pertinent Presidential library will inform the offering private individual or organization of NARA's decision in writing within 60 days.</P>

In such cases that records included in the JFK Assassination Records Collection, whether originals or copies, contain illegible portions, such records shall have attached thereto a certified transcription of the illegible language to the extent practicable.</P>
            <P>(d) For purposes of implementing the JFK Act, the term <E T="03">copy</E> means a true and accurate photocopy duplication by a means appropriate to the medium of the original record that preserves and displays the integrity of the record and the information contained in it.</P>
            <P>(e) Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to suggest that additional copies of any assassination records contained in the JFK Assassination Records Collection are not also assassination records that, at the Review Board's discretion, may also be placed in the JFK Assassination Records Collection.</P>

            <SUBJECT>General provisions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) This subpart contains the rules that the Morris K. Udall Scholarship and Excellence in National Environmental Policy Foundation (the Foundation) follows in processing requests for records under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552. These rules should be read together with the FOIA, which provides additional information about access to records. Requests made by individuals for records about themselves under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, which are processed under subpart B of this part, are processed under this subpart also. Information routinely provided to the public as part of a regular Foundation activity (for example, press releases, annual reports, informational brochures and the like) may be provided to the public without following this subpart. As a matter of policy, the Foundation makes discretionary disclosures of records or information exempt from disclosure under the FOIA whenever disclosure would not foreseeably harm an interest protected by a FOIA exemption, but this policy does not create any right enforceable in court.</P>
            <P>(b) This subpart applies to all Foundation programs, including the U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution (USIECR).</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1600.2</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Public reading room.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The Foundation maintains a public reading room that contains the records that the FOIA requires to be made regularly available for public inspection and copying. An index of reading room records shall be available for inspection and copying and shall be updated at least quarterly.</P>
            <P>(b) The public reading room is located at the offices of the Foundation, 110 S. Church Avenue, Suite 3350, Tucson, Arizona.</P>

            <P>(c) The Foundation also makes reading room records created on or after November 1, 1996, available electronically, if possible, at the Foundation's web site (which can be found at <E T="03">www.udall.gov</E>). This includes the index of the reading room records, which will indicate which records are available electronically.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1600.3</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Requests for records.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">How made and addressed.</E> You may make a request for records of the Foundation by writing to the General Counsel, Morris K. Udall Foundation, 110 South Church Avenue, Suite 3350, Tucson, Arizona 85701-1650. If you are making a request for records about yourself, see § 1600.21 for additional requirements. If you are making a request for records about another individual, either a written authorization signed by <PRTPAGE P="762"/>that individual permitting disclosure of those records to you or proof that that individual is deceased (for example, a copy of a death certificate or an obituary) will help the processing of your request. For the quickest possible handling, you should mark both your request letter and the envelope “Freedom of Information Act Request.”</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Description of records sought.</E> You must describe the records that you seek in enough detail to enable Foundation personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. Whenever possible, your request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, and subject matter of the record. If the Foundation determines that your request does not reasonably describe records, it will tell you either what additional information is needed or why your request is otherwise insufficient. If your request does not reasonably describe the records you seek, the response to your request may be delayed.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Types of records not available.</E> The FOIA does not require the Foundation to:</P>
            <P>(1) Compile or create records solely for the purpose of satisfying a request for records;</P>
            <P>(2) Provide records not yet in existence, even if such records may be expected to come into existence at some future time; or</P>
            <P>(3) Restore records destroyed or otherwise disposed of, except that the Foundation must notify the requester that the requested records have been destroyed or disposed of.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Agreement to pay fees.</E> If you make a FOIA request, your request shall be considered an agreement by you to pay all applicable fees charged under § 1600.10, up to $25.00, unless you seek a waiver of fees. The Foundation ordinarily will confirm this agreement in an acknowledgment letter. When making a request, you may specify a willingness to pay a greater or lesser amount.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1600.4</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Timing of responses to requests.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> The Foundation ordinarily shall respond to requests according to their order of receipt.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Multitrack processing.</E> (1) The Foundation may use two or more processing tracks by distinguishing between simple and more complex requests based on the amount of work and/or time needed to process the request. The anticipated number of pages involved may be considered by the Foundation in establishing processing tracks. If the Foundation sets a page limit for its faster track, it will advise those whose request is placed in its slower track(s) of the page limits of its faster track(s).</P>
            <P>(2) If the Foundation uses multitrack processing, it may provide requesters in its slower track(s) with an opportunity to limit the scope of their requests in order to qualify for faster processing within the specified limits of its faster track(s).</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Unusual circumstances.</E> (1) Where the statutory time limits for processing a request cannot be met because of “unusual circumstances,” as defined in the FOIA, and the Foundation decides to extend the time limits on that basis, the Foundation shall as soon as practicable notify the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances and of the date by which processing of the request can be expected to be completed. Where the extension is for more than 10 working days, the Foundation shall provide the requester with an opportunity either to modify the request so that it may be processed within the time limits or to arrange an alternative time period for processing the request or a modified request.</P>
            <P>(2) Where the Foundation reasonably believes that multiple requests submitted by a requester, or by a group of requesters acting in concert, constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances, and the requests involve clearly related matters, they may be aggregated. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters will not be aggregated.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Expedited processing.</E> (1) Requests and appeals will be taken out of order and given expedited treatment whenever it is determined that they involve:</P>

            <P>(i) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or<PRTPAGE P="763"/>
            </P>
            <P>(ii) An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information;</P>
            <P>(2) You may ask for expedited processing of a request for records at any time.</P>
            <P>(3) In order to request expedited processing, you must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct to the best of your knowledge and belief, explaining in detail the basis for requesting expedited processing. For example, if you are a requester within the category in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, and you are not a full-time member of the news media, you must establish that you are a person whose main professional activity or occupation is information dissemination, though it need not be your sole occupation; you also must establish a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request, beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally. The formality of certification may be waived as a matter of administrative discretion.</P>
            <P>(4) Within 10 calendar days of receipt of a request for expedited processing, the Foundation will decide whether to grant it and will notify you of the decision. If a request for expedited treatment is granted, the request will be given priority and processed as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited processing is denied, any appeal of that decision will be acted on expeditiously.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Responses to requests.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Acknowledgments of requests.</E> On receipt of your request, the Foundation ordinarily will send an acknowledgment letter to you, which will confirm your agreement to pay fees under § 1600.3(d) and provide an assigned request number for further reference.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Referral to another agency.</E> When a requester seeks records that originated in another Federal government agency, the Foundation will refer the request to the other agency for response. If the Foundation refers the request to another agency, it will notify the requester of the referral. A request for any records classified by some other agency will be referred to that agency for response.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Grants of requests.</E> Ordinarily, the Foundation will have 20 business days from when your request is received to determine whether to grant or deny your request. Once the Foundation determines to grant a request in whole or in part, it will notify you in writing. The Foundation will inform you in the notice of any fee charged under § 1600.10 and will disclose records to you promptly on payment of any applicable fee. Records disclosed in part will be marked or annotated to show the amount of information deleted, unless doing so would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption. The location of the information deleted also will be indicated on the record, if technically feasible.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Adverse determinations of requests.</E> If the Foundation denies your request in any respect, it will notify you of that determination in writing. Adverse determinations, or denials of requests, consist of: a determination to withhold any requested record in whole or in part; a determination that a requested record does not exist or cannot be located; a determination that a record is not readily reproducible in the form or format sought; a determination that what has been requested is not a record subject to the FOIA; a determination on any disputed fee matter, including a denial of a request for a fee waiver; and a denial of a request for expedited treatment. The denial letter shall be signed by the General Counsel or his/her designee, and shall include:</P>
            <P>(1) The name and title or position of the person responsible for the denial;</P>
            <P>(2) A brief statement of the reason(s) for the denial, including any FOIA exemption applied by the component in denying the request;</P>

            <P>(3) An estimate of the volume of records or information withheld, in number of pages or in some other reasonable form of estimation. This estimate does not need to be provided if the volume is otherwise indicated through deletions on records disclosed in part, or if providing an estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption; and<PRTPAGE P="764"/>
            </P>
            <P>(4) A statement that the denial may be appealed under § 1600.8(a) and a description of the requirements for appeal.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Disclosure of requested records.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The Foundation shall make requested records available to the public to the greatest extent possible in keeping with the FOIA, except that the following records are exempt from the disclosure requirements:</P>
            <P>(1) Records specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and which are, in fact, properly classified pursuant to such Executive order;</P>
            <P>(2) Records related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of the Foundation;</P>
            <P>(3) Records specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than 5 U.S.C. 552(b)), provided that such statute requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue or that the statute establishes particular criteria for withholding information or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld. An example that applies to the Foundation is the confidentiality protection for dispute resolution communications provided by the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act of 1996 (ADRA, 5 U.S.C. 571-574).</P>
            <P>(4) Records containing trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential;</P>
            <P>(5) Interagency or intra-agency memoranda or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the Foundation;</P>
            <P>(6) Personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;</P>
            <P>(7) Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records or information:</P>
            <P>(i) could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings;</P>
            <P>(ii) would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication;</P>
            <P>(iii) could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;</P>
            <P>(iv) could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source, including a State, local or foreign agency or authority or any private institution which furnished information on a confidential basis, and in the case of a recorded or information compiled by criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, information furnished by a confidential source;</P>
            <P>(v) would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law; or</P>
            <P>(vi) could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual.</P>
            <P>(8) Records contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, or on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions;</P>
            <P>(9) Geological or geophysical information and data, including maps, concerning wells.</P>
            <P>(b) If a requested record contains exempted material along with nonexempted material, all reasonable segregable nonexempt material shall be disclosed.</P>

            <P>(c) Even if an exemption described in paragraph (a) of this section may be reasonably applicable to a requested record, or portion thereof, the Foundation may elect under the circumstances of any particular request not to apply the exemption to such requested record, or portion thereof, subject to the provisions in § 1600.7 for confidential commercial information. The fact that the exemption is not applied by the Foundation to any requested <PRTPAGE P="765"/>record, or portion thereof, has no precedential significance as to the application or non-application of the exemption to any other requested record, or portion thereof, no matter when the request is received.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Special procedures for confidential commercial information.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For purposes of this section:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Business submitter</E> means any person or entity which provides confidential commercial information, directly or indirectly, to the Foundation and who has a proprietary interest in the information.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Commercial-use requester</E> means requesters seeking information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made. In determining whether a requester properly belongs in this category, the Foundation shall determine, whenever reasonably possible, the use to which a requester will put the documents requested. Where the Foundation has reasonable cause to doubt the use to which a requester will put the records sought, or where that use is not clear from the request itself, the Foundation shall seek additional clarification before assigning the request to a specific category.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Confidential commercial information</E> means records provided to the government by a submitter that arguably contain material exempt from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA, because disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">In general.</E> Confidential commercial information provided to the Foundation by a business submitter shall not be disclosed pursuant to an FOIA request except in accordance with this section.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Designation of business information.</E> Business submitters should use good-faith efforts to designate, by appropriate markings, either at the time of submission or at a reasonable time thereafter, those portions of their submissions which they deem to be protected under Exemption 4 of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4). Any such designation will expire 10 years after the records were submitted to the government, unless the submitter requests, and provides reasonable justification for, a designation period of longer duration.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Predisclosure notification.</E> (1) Except as is provided for in paragraph (i) of this section, the Foundation shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide a submitter with prompt written notice of an FOIA request or administrative appeal encompassing its confidential business information whenever required under paragraph (e) of this section. Such notice shall either describe the exact nature of the business information requested or provide copies of the records or portions thereof containing the business information.</P>
            <P>(2) Whenever the Foundation provides a business submitter with the notice set forth in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the Foundation shall notify the requester that the request includes information that may arguably be exempt from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA and that the person or entity who submitted the information to the Foundation has been given the opportunity to comment on the proposed disclosure of information.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">When notice is required.</E> The Foundation shall provide a business submitter with notice of a request whenever—</P>
            <P>(1) The business submitter has in good faith designated the information as business information deemed protected from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4); or</P>
            <P>(2) The Foundation has reason to believe that the request seeks business information the disclosure of which may result in substantial commercial or financial injury to the business submitter.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Opportunity to object to disclosure.</E> Through the notice described in paragraph (d) of this section, the Foundation shall, to the extent permitted by law, afford a business submitter at least 10 working days within which it can provide the Foundation with a detailed written statement of any objection to disclosure. Such statement shall demonstrate why the information is contended to be a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential and <PRTPAGE P="766"/>why disclosure would cause competitive harm. Whenever possible, the business submitter's claim of confidentiality should be supported by a statement or certification by an officer or authorized representative of the business submitter. Information provided by a submitter pursuant to this paragraph may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Notice of intent to disclose.</E> (1) The Foundation shall consider carefully a business submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure prior to determining whether to disclose confidential commercial business information. Whenever the Foundation decides to disclose such information over the objection of a business submitter, the Foundation shall forward to the business submitter a written notice at least 10 working days before the date of disclosure containing—</P>
            <P>(i) A statement of the reasons for which the business submitter's disclosure objections were not sustained,</P>
            <P>(ii) A description of the confidential commercial information to be disclosed, and</P>
            <P>(iii) A specified disclosure date.</P>
            <P>(2) Such notice of intent to disclose likewise shall be forwarded to the requester at least 10 working days prior to the specified disclosure date.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Notice of FOIA lawsuit.</E> Whenever a requester brings suit seeking to compel disclosure of confidential commercial information, the Foundation shall promptly notify the business submitter of such action.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Exceptions to predisclosure notification.</E> The requirements of this section shall not apply if—</P>
            <P>(1) The Foundation determines that the information should not be disclosed;</P>
            <P>(2) The information lawfully has been published or has been officially made available to the public;</P>
            <P>(3) Disclosure of the information is required by law (other than 5 U.S.C. 552); or</P>
            <P>(4) The designation made by the submitter in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section appears obviously frivolous; except that, in such a case, the Foundation will provide the submitter with written notice of any final decision to disclose confidential commercial information within a reasonable number of days prior to a specified disclosure date.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Appeals.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Appeals of adverse determinations.</E> If you are dissatisfied with the Foundation's response to your request, you may appeal an adverse determination denying your request, in any respect, to the Executive Director of the Foundation, 110 S. Church Avenue, Suite 3350, Tucson, AZ 85701-1650. You must make your appeal in writing, and it must be received by the Executive Director within 60 days of the date of the letter denying your request. Your appeal letter may include as much or as little related information as you wish, as long as it clearly identifies the determination (including the assigned request number, if known) that you are appealing. For the quickest possible handling, you should mark your appeal letter and the envelope “Freedom of Information Act Appeal.”</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Responses to appeals.</E> The decision on your appeal will be made in writing. A decision affirming an adverse determination in whole or in part shall contain a statement of the reason(s) for the affirmance, including any FOIA exemption(s) applied, and will inform you of the FOIA provisions for court review of the decision. If the adverse determination is reversed or modified on appeal, in whole or in part, you will be notified in a written decision and your request will be reprocessed in accordance with that appeal decision.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">When appeal is required.</E> If you wish to seek review by a court of any adverse determination, you must first appeal it under this section.</P>

            <P>The Foundation will preserve all correspondence pertaining to the requests that it receives under this subpart, as well as copies of all requested records, until disposition or destruction is authorized by title 44 of the United States Code or the National Archives and Records Administration's General Records Schedule 14. Records will not be disposed of while they are the subject of a pending request, appeal, or lawsuit under the FOIA.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Fees.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> The Foundation will charge you for processing requests under the FOIA in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, except where fees are limited under paragraph (d) of this section or where a waiver or reduction of fees is granted under paragraph (i) of this section. The Foundation ordinarily will collect all applicable fees before sending copies of requested records to you. You must pay fees by check or money order made payable to the United States Treasury.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For purposes of this section:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Commercial use request</E> means a request from or on behalf of a person seeking information for a use or purpose that furthers his or her commercial, trade, or profit interests, which can include furthering those interests through litigation. If the Foundation determines that you will put the records to a commercial use, either because of the nature of your request itself or because the Foundation has reasonable cause to doubt your stated use, the Foundation will provide you a reasonable opportunity to submit further clarification.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Direct costs</E> means those expenses that the Foundation actually incurs in searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of commercial use requests, reviewing) records to respond to a FOIA request. Direct costs include, for example, the salary of the employee performing the work and the cost of operating duplication machinery.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Duplication</E> means the process of making a copy of a record, or the information contained in it, available in response to a FOIA request. Copies can take the form of paper, microfilm, audiovisual materials, or electronic records (for example, magnetic tape or disk), among others. The Foundation will honor your specified preference of form or format of disclosure if the record is readily reproducible with reasonable efforts in the requested form or format.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Educational institution</E> means a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of undergraduate or graduate higher education, an institution of professional education, and an institution of vocational education, which operates a program or programs of scholarly research.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Noncommercial scientific institution</E> means an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis, as that term is defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. To be in this category, a requester must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use but are sought to further scientific research.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Representative of the news media,</E> or <E T="03">news media requester,</E> means any person actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public. The term <E T="03">news</E> means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large and publishers of periodicals (but only in those instances where they can qualify as disseminators of <E T="03">news</E>) who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the general public. For <E T="03">freelance</E> journalists to be regarded as working for a news organization, they must demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that organization. A publication contract would be the clearest proof, but the Foundation shall also look to the past publication record of a requester in making this determination. To be in this category, a requester must not be seeking the requested records for a commercial use. However, a request for records supporting the news-dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered to be for a commercial use.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Review</E> means the examination of a record located in response to a request in order to determine whether any portion of it is exempt from disclosure. It also includes processing any record for disclosure—for example, doing all that is necessary to redact it and prepare it for disclosure. Review costs are recoverable even if a record ultimately is not disclosed. Review <PRTPAGE P="768"/>time does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Search</E> means the process of looking for and retrieving records or information responsive to a request. It includes page-by-page or line-by-line identification of information within records and also includes reasonable efforts to locate and retrieve information from records maintained in electronic form or format.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Fees.</E> In responding to FOIA requests, the Foundation will charge the following fees unless a waiver or reduction of fees has been granted under paragraph (i) of this section:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Search.</E> Search fees will be charged for all requests, except for those by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media (subject to the limitations of paragraph (d) of this section). Charges may be made for time spent searching even if no responsive record is located or if the record(s) are withheld as entirely exempt from disclosure.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Duplication.</E> Duplication fees will be charged for all requests, subject to the limitations of paragraph (d) of this section. For a paper photocopy of a record, the fee will be ten cents per page. For other forms of duplication (including copies produced by computer, such as tapes or printouts), the Foundation will charge the direct costs, including operator time, of producing the copy.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Review.</E> Review fees will be charged only for commercial use requests. Review fees will be charged only for the initial record review—in other words, the review done when the Foundation determines whether an exemption applies to a particular record or record portion at the initial request level. No charge will be made for review at the administrative appeal level for an exemption already applied. However, records or record portions withheld under an exemption that is subsequently determined not to apply may be reviewed again to determine whether any other exemption not previously considered applies; the costs of that review are chargeable where it is made necessary by such a change of circumstances.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Searches and reviews—amounts of fees.</E> (i) For each quarter hour spent in searching for and/or reviewing a requested record, the fees will be: $4.00 for clerical personnel; $7.00 for professional personnel; and $10.25 for managerial personnel.</P>
            <P>(ii) For computer searches of records, you will be charged the direct costs of conducting the search, although certain requesters (as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section) will be charged no search fee and certain other requesters (as provided in paragraph (d)(4) of this section) will be entitled to the cost equivalent of two hours of manual search time without charge. These direct costs will include the cost of operating a central processing unit for that portion of operating time that is directly attributable to searching for responsive records, as well as the costs of operator/programmer salary apportionable to the search.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Limitations on charging fees.</E> (1) No search fee will be charged for requests by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media.</P>
            <P>(2) Review fees will be charged only for commercial use requests.</P>
            <P>(3) No search fee or review fee will be charged for a quarter-hour period unless more than half of that period is required for search or review.</P>
            <P>(4) Except for commercial use requests, the Foundation will provide the first 100 pages of duplication and the first two hours of search time to requesters without charge. These provisions work together, so that the Foundation will not begin to assess fees until after providing the free search and reproduction. For example, if a request involves three hours of search time and duplication of 105 pages of documents, the Foundation will charge only for the cost of one hour of search time and five pages of reproduction.</P>
            <P>(5) Whenever a total fee calculated under paragraph (d) of this section is $14.00 or less for any request, no fee will be charged.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Notice of anticipated fees in excess of $25.00.</E> When the Foundation determines or estimates that the fees will be more than $25.00, it will notify you of <PRTPAGE P="769"/>the actual or estimated amount of the fees, unless you have indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. If only a portion of the fee can be estimated readily, the Foundation will advise you that the estimated fee may be only a portion of the total fee. In cases in which you have been notified that actual or estimated fees amount to more than $25.00, the request will not be considered received and further work will not be done on it until you agree in writing to pay the anticipated total fee. A notice under this paragraph will offer you an opportunity to discuss the matter with Foundation personnel in order to reformulate the request to meet your needs at a lower cost.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Charging interest.</E> The Foundation may charge interest on any unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the date of billing. Interest charges will be assessed at the rate provided in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the date of the billing until payment is received by the Foundation.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Aggregating requests.</E> Where the Foundation reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requesters acting together is attempting to divide a request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding fees, it may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly. The Foundation may presume that multiple requests of this type made within a 30-day period have been made in order to avoid fees. Where requests are separated by a longer period, they will be aggregated only if there exists a solid basis for determining that aggregation is warranted under all the circumstances involved. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters will not be aggregated.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Advance payments.</E> (1) No advance payment (that is, payment before work is begun on a request) will ordinarily be required, except as described in paragraphs (h)(2) and (3) of this section. Payment owed for work already completed (that is, a prepayment before copies are sent to you) is not considered an advance payment.</P>
            <P>(2) Where the Foundation determines or estimates that a total fee to be charged under this section will be more than $250.00, it may require you to make an advance payment of an amount up to the amount of the entire anticipated fee before beginning to process the request, except where it receives satisfactory assurance of full payment from you and you have a history of prompt payment.</P>
            <P>(3) If you have previously failed to pay a properly charged FOIA fee within 30 days of the date of billing, the Foundation may require you to pay the full amount due, plus any applicable interest, and to make an advance payment of the full amount of any anticipated fee, before it begins to process a new request or continues to process a pending request from you.</P>
            <P>(4) In cases in which the Foundation requires advance payment or payment due under paragraph (h)(2) or (3) of this section, the request shall not be considered received and further work will not be done on it until the required payment is received.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Requirements for waiver or reduction of fees.</E> (1) Records responsive to a request will be furnished without charge or at a charge reduced below that established under paragraph (c) of this section where the Foundation determines, based on all available information, that the requester has demonstrated that:</P>
            <P>(i) Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government, and</P>
            <P>(ii) Disclosure of the information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.</P>
            <P>(2) Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the requirements for a waiver of fees, a waiver will be granted for those records.</P>
            <P>(3) If you request a waiver or reduction of fees, your request should address the factors listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this section.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 1600.21</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>General provisions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose and scope.</E> This subpart contains the rules that the Morris K. Udall Scholarship and Excellence in <PRTPAGE P="770"/>National Environmental Policy Foundation (the “Foundation”) follows under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a. These rules should be read together with the Privacy Act, which provides additional information about records maintained on individuals. The rules in this subpart apply to all records in systems of records maintained by the Foundation that are retrieved by an individual's name or personal identifier. They describe the procedures by which individuals may request access to records about themselves, request amendment or correction of those records, and request an accounting of disclosures of those records by the Foundation. In addition, the Foundation processes all Privacy Act requests for access to records under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552, following the rules contained in subpart A of this part, which gives requests the benefit of both statutes.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> This subpart applies to all Foundation programs, including the U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution (USIECR).</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> As used in this subpart:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Request for access to a record means a request</E> made under Privacy Act subsection (d)(1).</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Request for amendment or correction of a record</E> means a request made under Privacy Act subsection (d)(2).</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Request for an accounting</E> means a request made under Privacy Act subsection (c)(3).</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Requester</E> means an individual who makes a request for access, a request for amendment or correction, or a request for an accounting under the Privacy Act.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 1600.22</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Requests for access to records.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">How made and addressed.</E> You may make a request for access to a Foundation record about yourself by appearing in person or by writing to the Foundation. Your request should be sent or delivered to the Foundation's General Counsel, at 110 S. Church Avenue, Suite 3350, Tucson, AZ 85701-1650. For the quickest possible handling, you should mark both your request letter and the envelope “Privacy Act Request.”</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Description of records sought.</E> You must describe the records that you want in enough detail to enable Foundation personnel to locate the system of records containing them with a reasonable amount of effort. Whenever possible, your request should describe the records sought, the time periods in which you believe they were compiled, and the name or identifying number of each system of records in which you believe they are kept. The Foundation publishes notices in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> that describe its systems of records. A description of the Foundation's systems of records also may be found as part of the “Privacy Act Compilation” published by the National Archives and Records Administration's Office of the Federal Register. This compilation is available in most large reference and university libraries. This compilation also can be accessed electronically at the Government Printing Office's World Wide Web site (which can be found at <E T="03">http://www.access.gpo.gov/su_docs</E>).</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Agreement to pay fees.</E> If you make a Privacy Act request for access to records, it shall be considered an agreement by you to pay all applicable fees charged under § 1600.29 up to $25.00. The Foundation ordinarily will confirm this agreement in an acknowledgment letter. When making a request, you may specify a willingness to pay a greater or lesser amount.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Verification of identity.</E> When you make a request for access to records about yourself, you must verify your identity. You must state your full name, current address, and date and place of birth. You must sign your request and your signature must either be notarized or submitted by you under 28 U.S.C. 1746, a law that permits statements to be made under penalty of perjury as a substitute for notarization. In order to help the identification and location of requested records, you may also, at your option, include your social security number.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Verification of guardianship.</E> When making a request as the parent or guardian of a minor or as the guardian of someone determined by a court to be incompetent, for access to records <PRTPAGE P="771"/>about that individual, you must establish:</P>
            <P>(1) The identity of the individual who is the subject of the record, by stating the name, current address, date and place of birth, and, at your option, the social security number of the individual;</P>
            <P>(2) Your own identity, as required in paragraph (d) of this section;</P>
            <P>(3) That you are the parent or guardian of that individual, which you may prove by providing a copy of the individual's birth certificate showing your parentage or by providing a court order establishing your guardianship; and (4) That you are acting on behalf of that individual in making the request.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1600.23</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Responsibility for responding to requests for access to records.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> In determining which records are responsive to a request, the Foundation ordinarily will include only those records in its possession as of the date the Foundation begins its search for them. If any other date is used, the Foundation will inform the requester of that date.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Authority to grant or deny requests.</E> The Foundation's General Counsel, or his/her designee, is authorized to grant or deny any request for access to a record of the Foundation.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Consultations and referrals.</E> When the Foundation receives a request for access to a record in its possession, it will determine whether another agency of the Federal Government is better able to determine whether the record is exempt from access under the Privacy Act. If the Foundation determines that it is best able to process the record in response to the request, then it will do so. If the Foundation determines that it is not best able to process the record, then it will either:</P>
            <P>(1) Respond to the request regarding that record, after consulting with the agency best able to determine whether the record is exempt from access and with any other agency that has a substantial interest in it; or (2) Refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that record to another agency that originated the record (but only if that agency is subject to the Privacy Act). Ordinarily, the agency that originated a record will be presumed to be best able to determine whether it is exempt from access.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Notice of referral.</E> Whenever the Foundation refers all or any part of the responsibility for responding to your request to another agency, it ordinarily will notify you of the referral and inform you of the name of each agency to which the request has been referred and of the part of the request that has been referred.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Timing of responses to consultations and referrals.</E> All consultations and referrals shall be handled according to the date the Privacy Act access request was initially received by the Foundation, not any later date.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1600.24</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Responses to requests for access to records.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Acknowledgments of requests.</E> On receipt of your request, the Foundation ordinarily will send an acknowledgment letter, which shall confirm your agreement to pay fees under § 1600.22(c) and may provide an assigned request number for further reference.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Grants of requests for access.</E> Once the Foundation makes a determination to grant your request for access in whole or in part, it will notify you in writing. The Foundation will inform you in the notice of any fee charged under § 1600.29 and will disclose records to you promptly on payment of any applicable fee. If your request is made in person, the Foundation may disclose records to you directly, in a manner not unreasonably disruptive of its operations, on payment of any applicable fee and with a written record made of the grant of the request. If you are accompanied by another person when you make a request in person, you shall be required to authorize in writing any discussion of the records in the presence of the other person.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Adverse determinations of requests for access.</E> If the Foundation makes an adverse determination denying your request for access in any respect, it will notify you of that determination in writing. Adverse determinations, or denials of requests, consist of: a determination to withhold any requested record in whole or in part; a determination that a requested record does not exist or cannot be located; a determination that what has been requested <PRTPAGE P="772"/>is not a record subject to the Privacy Act; a determination on any disputed fee matter; and a denial of a request for expedited treatment. The notification letter shall be signed by the General Counsel, or his/her designee, and shall include:</P>
            <P>(1) The name and title or position of the person responsible for the denial;</P>
            <P>(2) A brief statement of the reason(s) for the denial, including any Privacy Act exemption(s) applied by the Foundation in denying the request; and</P>
            <P>(3) A statement that the denial may be appealed under § 1600.25(a) and a description of the requirements of § 1600.25(a).</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1600.25</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Appeals from denials of requests for access to records.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Appeals.</E> If you are dissatisfied with the Foundation's response to your request for access to records, you may appeal an adverse determination denying your request in any respect to the Executive Director of the Foundation, 110 S. Church Avenue, Suite 3350, Tucson, AZ 85701-1650. You must make your appeal in writing, and it must be received within 60 days of the date of the letter denying your request. Your appeal letter may include as much or as little related information as you wish, as long as it clearly identifies the determination (including the assigned request number, if any) that you are appealing. For the quickest possible handling, you should mark both your appeal letter and the envelope “Privacy Act Appeal.”</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Responses to appeals.</E> The decision on your appeal will be made in writing. A decision affirming an adverse determination in whole or in part will include a brief statement of the reason(s) for the affirmance, including any Privacy Act exemption applied, and will inform you of the Privacy Act provisions for court review of the decision. If the adverse determination is reversed or modified on appeal in whole or in part, you will be notified in a written decision and your request will be reprocessed in accordance with that appeal decision.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">When appeal is required.</E> If you wish to seek review by a court of any adverse determination or denial of a request, you must first appeal it under this section.</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 1600.26</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Requests for amendment or correction of records.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">How made and addressed.</E> You may make a request for amendment or correction of a Foundation record about yourself by following the procedures in § 1600.22. Your request should identify each particular record in question, state the amendment or correction that you want, and state why you believe that the record is not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete. You may submit any documentation that you think would be helpful.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Foundation responses.</E> Within 10 working days of receiving your request for amendment or correction of records, the Foundation will send you a written acknowledgment of its receipt of your request, and it will promptly notify you whether your request is granted or denied. If the Foundation grants your request in whole or in part, it will describe the amendment or correction made and advise you of your right to obtain a copy of the corrected or amended record. If the Foundation denies your request in whole or in part, it will send you a letter stating:</P>
            <P>(1) The reason(s) for the denial; and</P>
            <P>(2) The procedure for appeal of the denial under paragraph (c) of this section, including the name and business address of the official who will act on your appeal.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Appeals.</E> You may appeal a denial of a request for amendment or correction to the Executive Director in the same manner as a denial of a request for access to records (see § 1600.25), and the same procedures will be followed. If your appeal is denied, you will be advised of your right to file a Statement of Disagreement as described in paragraph (d) of this section and of your right under the Privacy Act for court review of the decision.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Statements of Disagreement.</E> If your appeal under this section is denied in whole or in part, you have the right to file a Statement of Disagreement that states your reason(s) for disagreeing with the Foundation's denial of your request for amendment or correction. Statements of Disagreement must be concise, must clearly identify each <PRTPAGE P="773"/>part of any record that is disputed, and should be no longer than one typed page for each fact disputed. Your Statement of Disagreement must be sent to the Foundation, which will place it in the system of records in which the disputed record is maintained and will mark the disputed record to indicate that a Statement of Disagreement has been filed and where in the system of records it may be found.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Notification of amendment/correction or disagreement.</E> Within 30 working days of the amendment or correction of a record, the Foundation shall notify all persons, organizations, or agencies to which it previously disclosed the record, if an accounting of that disclosure was made, that the record has been amended or corrected. If an individual has filed a Statement of Disagreement, the Foundation will attach a copy of it to the disputed record whenever the record is disclosed and may also attach a concise statement of its reason(s) for denying the request to amend or correct the record.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Requests for an accounting of record disclosures.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">How made and addressed.</E> Except where accountings of disclosures are not required to be kept (as stated in paragraph (b) of this section), you may make a request for an accounting of any disclosure that has been made by the Foundation to another person, organization, or agency of any record about you. This accounting contains the date, nature, and purpose of each disclosure, as well as the name and address of the person, organization, or agency to which the disclosure was made. Your request for an accounting should identify each particular record in question and should be made by writing to the Foundation, following the procedures in § 1600.22.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Where accountings are not required.</E> The Foundation is not required to provide accountings to you where they relate to disclosures for which accountings are not required to be kept—in other words, disclosures that are made to employees within the agency and disclosures that are made under the FOIA.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Appeals.</E> You may appeal a denial of a request for an accounting to the Foundation Executive Director in the same manner as a denial of a request for access to records (see § 1600.25) and the same procedures will be followed.</P>

Notice will be given within a reasonable time after the Foundation's receipt of the order—except that in a case in which the order is not a matter of public record, the notice will be given only after the order becomes public. This notice will be mailed to the individual's last known address and will contain a copy of the order and a description of the information disclosed.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Emergency disclosures.</E> Upon disclosing a record pertaining to an individual made under compelling circumstances affecting health or safety, the Foundation will notify that individual of the disclosure. This notice will be mailed to the individual's last known address and will state the nature of the information disclosed; the person, organization, or agency to <PRTPAGE P="774"/>which it was disclosed; the date of disclosure; and the compelling circumstances justifying the disclosure.</P>
