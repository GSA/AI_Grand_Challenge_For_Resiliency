      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Field organization.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The field organization of the Forest Service consists of regions, stations, and areas as described below:</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Regions of the National Forest System.</E> For the purpose of managing the lands administered by the Forest Service, the United States is divided into nine geographic regions of the National Forest System. Each region has a headquarters office and is supervised by a Regional Forester who is responsible to the Chief for the activities assigned to that region. Within each region are located national forests and other lands of the Forest Service.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">National Forests.</E> Each Forest has a headquarters office and is supervised by a Forest Supervisor who is responsible to the Regional Forester. Two or more proclaimed or designated National Forests, or all of the Forests in a State, may be combined into one Forest Service Administrative Unit headed by one Forest Supervisor. Each Forest is divided into Ranger Districts. The Alaska Region is composed of two National Forests without Ranger Districts; with one Forest divided into three areas, each administered by a Forest Supervisor.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Ranger districts.</E> Each district may include a portion of a national forest, a national grassland or portion thereof, a national recreation area, a wilderness or primitive area, and other lands administered by the Forest Service. Each district has a headquarters office and is supervised by a District Ranger (or Area Ranger in some cases) who is responsible to the Forest Supervisor.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Forest and rangeland research coordination.</E> The field research program is coordinated by six research stations, the national Forest Products Laboratory, and the International Institute of Tropical Forestry. Each has a headquarters office and a Director who is responsible to the Chief for all research activities within a geographical area of the United States or its territories. Scientists are based at Research Work Units with laboratories located in 36 lower States, Hawaii, Alaska, and Puerto Rico. Scientists primarily conduct their work within a given geographical area, but due to the integrated and cooperative nature of the research program, they make work nationwide and internationally.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">State and private forestry cooperation.</E> Field level cooperation between the Forest Service, States, and the private sector on forestry activities is accomplished by the Northeastern Area State and Private Forestry for the Northeastern States; and by the National Forest Regional Offices in the Southeastern and Western States. The Northeastern Area is supervised by an Area Director who is responsible to the Chief for State and private forestry activities within the Area. Regional Foresters in Regions 1 through 8 and Region 10 are responsible for State and private forestry activities within those regions.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">International Institute of Tropical Forestry.</E> The Institute is managed by a Director who is the senior Forest Service official in Puerto Rico. The Director is responsible to the Chief for planning and directing research, science and technology exchange, technical assistance to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and international cooperation on natural resources concerning tropical forestry.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Field addresses.</E> The addresses of Regional Foresters, Station Directors, and Area Directors are given below. Under each Regional Office address is a list of National Forest Administrative Units by States with locations of Forest Supervisor headquarters. Headquarters locations for Ranger Districts, National Grasslands, and National <PRTPAGE P="7"/>Recreation Areas are not listed but may be obtained from Forest Supervisors or Regional Foresters.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Forest Service functions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Legislative authority.</E> The basic laws authorizing activities of the Forest Service are set forth in the U.S.C. in title 7 (Agriculture), chapters 14, 17, 33, 55, 59, and 61; title 16 (Conservation), chapters 2, 3, 4, 5C, 6, 23, 27, 28, 30, 36, and 37; title 29 (Labor), chapter 17; and title 43 (Public Lands), chapters 22 and 35.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Work of the Forest Service.</E> Under delegated authority from the Secretary of Agriculture, the broad responsibilities of the Forest Service are:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Leadership in forestry.</E> The Forest Service provides overall leadership in forest and forest-range conservation, development, and use. This involves determination of forestry conditions and requirements, and recommendations of policies and programs needed to keep the Nation's private and public lands fully productive.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">National Forest System administration.</E> (i) The Forest Service administers and manages the National Forest System lands in accordance with the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of June 12, 1960 (16 U.S.C. 528-531); the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of August 17, 1974 (16 U.S.C. 1600-1614); and the National Forest Management Act of October 22, 1976 (16 U.S.C. 472a, 476, 500, 513-516, 521b; 576b, 1600-1602, 1604, 1606, 1608-1614).<PRTPAGE P="10"/>
            </P>
            <P>(ii) The National Forest System comprises about 188 million acres of land in the National Forests, National Grasslands, and other areas which have been transferred to the Forest Service for administration. On these public lands:</P>
            <P>(A) Forestry methods are applied in growing and harvesting timber,</P>
            <P>(B) Forage is scientifically managed for the use of domestic livestock whose numbers are kept in balance with the carrying capacity of the range,</P>
            <P>(C) Wildlife habitat and species are managed,</P>
            <P>(D) Watersheds are managed to safeguard the water supply and stabilize streamflow,</P>
            <P>(E) Recreation resources are managed for public enjoyment and benefit,</P>
            <P>(F) Many forms of land and resource use are granted under permit or lease, and</P>
            <P>(G) Physical and resource improvements needed to develop, protect, and use all resources are built and maintained.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Cooperative forestry.</E> The Forest Service carries out cooperative forestry programs for public benefit through programs initiated by State, county, and other Federal agencies in accordance with the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of July 1, 1978 (16 U.S.C. 2101-2111). These programs are directed at the protection, development, and sustained production of all forestry resources, both public and private.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Forest research.</E> The Forest Service conducts research on problems involving protection, development, management, renewal, and continuous use of all resources, products, values, and services of forest lands in accordance with the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Research Act of June 30, 1978 (16 U.S.C. 1641-1647). Research is conducted on:</P>
            <P>(i) Forest and range management, including the five basic resources of timber, forest soil and water, range forage, wildlife and fish habitat, and forest recreation,</P>
            <P>(ii) Forest protection from fire, insects, and disease,</P>
            <P>(iii) Forest products and engineering, and</P>
            <P>(iv) Forest resource economics including forest survey, forest economics, and forest products marketing.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Administrative issuances.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The regulations of the Secretary of Agriculture governing the protection and administration of National Forest System lands and other programs of the Forest Service are set forth in Chapter 2 of Title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations.</P>
            <P>(b) Administrative policy, procedure, and guidance to Forest Service employees for the conduct of Forest Service activities are issued as directives, or through correspondence, by the office of the Chief of the Forest Service and by the field officers listed in § 200.2.</P>
            <P>(1) Directives are issued through the Forest Service Directive System, which is comprised of the Forest Service Manual and related Forest Service Handbooks. The Directive System codifies the agency's policy, practice, and procedure affecting more than one unit and the delegations of continuing authority and assignment of continuing responsibilities; serves as the primary administrative basis for the internal management and control of all programs; and is the primary source of administrative direction to Forest Service employees.</P>
            <P>(2) In contrast to direction issued through the Directive System, guidance issued to one or more organizational units through letters and memoranda relate to decisions or interpretations on specific activities, cases, or incidents or to other matters of agency business, especially those matters of short-term duration or immediate interest.</P>
            <P>(c) Forest Service Directive System issuances are published under delegated authority as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) The Forest Service Manual and Forest Service Handbook issuances to all Forest Service units are published by the Office of the Chief.</P>

            <P>(2) Forest Service Manual and Forest Service Handbook issuances may be supplemented as needed for field office use by a Regional Forester, a Regional <PRTPAGE P="11"/>Special Agent in Charge of Law Enforcement and Investigations, a Research Station Director, the International Institute for Tropical Forestry Director, the Area Director, or a Forest Supervisor.</P>
            <P>(d) Guidance issued through letters and memoranda must be issued in accordance with signing authorities delegated through issuances to the Forest Service Directive System.</P>
            <P>(e) An alphabetical index of the contents of the Forest Service Manual and related Forest Service Handbooks is published in Forest Service Handbook 1109.12, Directive System Handbook. The index contains a listing of all Series, Titles, and Chapters in the Forest Service Manual and a listing of all Forest Service Handbooks in the Directive System.</P>
            <P>(f) Forest Service Handbook 6209.11, Records Management Handbook, outlines and indexes the filing system for all correspondence and other records.</P>
            <P>(g) Forms and reports used by the agency are listed in, and instructions for their use are issued throughout, the Forest Service Directive System and are collated in Forest Service Handbook 1309.14, Information Requirements Handbook.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Indexes.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Publication of the indexes described in § 200.4 is deemed both unnecessary and impractical because of the large volume of material involved. However, copies of the indexes are available for public review in the Forest Service headquarters office in Washington, DC, and at field offices listed under § 200.2(d). The Forest Service will provide copies of any index upon request at a cost not to exceed the direct cost of duplication.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Information available; inspection, copying, and charges.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 7 CFR 1.2, the Forest Service shall make available for public inspection and copying all published or unpublished directives, forms, records, and final opinions, including concurring or dissenting opinions and orders made in the adjudication of cases. Charges for information requested from the Forest Service are set out in paragraph (d) of this section and vary according to the type of information requested.</P>
            <P>(b) Information made available pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section may be obtained at the Office of the Chief, or the office of any Regional Forester, Research Station Director, Area Director, Institute Director, Forest Supervisor, or District Ranger. The addresses of these offices are set forth in §§ 200.1 and 200.2. Forest Service personnel at these offices will assist members of the public seeking Forest Service records. However, Research Station and Institute Directors and District Rangers may not have all volumes of the Forest Service Manual and Handbooks. When the information requested is not available at a given location, the personnel where the request is received will direct the requester to another office where the information may be obtained.</P>
            <P>(c) Inspection and copying availability is as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) Facilities for inspection and copying are available at the offices listed in §§ 200.1 and 200.2, during established office hours for the particular location, usually 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday. Copying facilities may not be available at all Forest Service offices.</P>
            <P>(2) Requesters for information may make copies of available information without charge if they elect to bring their own copy equipment to the appropriate offices listed in §§ 200.1 and 200.2.</P>
            <P>(3) Requesters should make prior arrangements for using agency copying facilities or for bringing in copying equipment and, in the later case, should get advance approval from the office.</P>

            <P>(d) Any request for information pursuant to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act must be submitted in accordance with §§ 200.7 and 200.8. The Forest Service charges a fee for copies of records not generally made available to the public but released pursuant to a FOIA request in accordance with a schedule of fees established by the Department of Agriculture at 7 <PRTPAGE P="12"/>CFR Part 1, Subpart A, Appendix A. These fees do not apply to information that is generally and routinely made available to the public upon request, such as recreational brochures, pamphlets, maps, and technical guides as well as agency directive issuances. Separate charges for such general information are established in the agency's Directive System (§ 200.4). For example, some pamphlets and small segments of the Forest Service Manual and Handbook may be provided at no cost, but maps of the National Forest System and larger sections of the Manual and Handbook are available for a charge. Current charges are explained at the time the request is made.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For the purpose of this subpart these definitions apply:</P>

            <P>(1) Prescribed fire means a fire burning under a set of specified conditions <PRTPAGE P="14"/>which will accomplish certain planned resource management objectives.</P>
            <P>(2) Escaped prescribed fire means a prescribed fire which has either exceeded the prescription or has rekindled after it has been declared to be out.</P>
            <P>(b) In the absence of a written reciprocal agreement with any fire organization or in situations outside the scope of an agreement, the Forest Service is authorized to render emergency assistance in suppressing fires and in preserving life and property from the threat of fire within the vicinity of Forest Service fire protection facilities under the following conditions:</P>
            <P>(1) If a prescribed fire initiated on lands administered by the Forest Service escapes onto lands not administered by the Forest Service, the Forest Service may commit personnel, materials, and equipment without reimbursement or consideration of the fire's continuing threat to National Forest System lands or resources.</P>
            <P>(2) When requested, the Forest Service may commit personnel, materials, and equipment on a reimbursable basis on lands not administered by the Forest Service without regard to the fire's threat to National Forest System lands or resources.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 211.6</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Cooperation in forest investigations or the protection, management, and improvement of the National Forest System.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose and scope.</E> Forest Service officers, when engaged in cooperative activities otherwise authorized, may receive monies from cooperators only for cooperative work in forest investigations or for the protection, management, and improvement of the National Forest System and only in accordance with written cooperative agreements. Management of the National Forest System may include such work as planning, analysis, and related studies, as well as resource activities.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Reimbursements.</E> Agency expenditures for work undertaken in accordance with this section may be made from Forest Service appropriations available for such work, with subsequent reimbursement from the cooperator, in accordance with established written agreements. Forest Service officers shall issue written bills for collection for cooperator reimbursement payments within the same fiscal year as Forest Service expenditures.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Bonding.</E> Each written agreement involving a non-Government cooperator's total contribution of $25,000 or more to the Forest Service on a reimbursable basis, must include a provision requiring a payment bond to guarantee the cooperator's reimbursement payment. Acceptable security for a payment bond includes Department of the Treasury approved corporate sureties, Federal Government obligations, and irrevocable letters of credit. For the purposes of this section, a non-Government cooperator is an entity that is not a member, division, or affiliate of a Federal, State, local government, a federally recognized Indian Tribe (as defined by the Federally Recognized Indian Tribe List Act of 1994 [25 U.S.C. 479a]), or other organizations funding a Forest Service agreement with pass through funding from an entity that is a member, division, or affiliate of a Federal, State, local government, or federally recognized Indian Tribe.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Avoiding conflict of interest.</E> Forest Service officers shall avoid acceptance of contributions from cooperators when such contributions would reflect unfavorably upon the ability of the Forest Service to carry out its responsibilities and duties. Forest Service officers shall be guided by the provisions of 18 U.S.C. parts 201-209, 5 CFR part 2635, and applicable Department of Agriculture regulations, in determining if a conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest exists in a proposed cooperative effort. Forest Service ethics officials or the designated Department of Agriculture ethics official should be consulted on conflict of interest issues.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Traffic rules.</E> Rules set forth under 36 CFR part 261 and this section shall <PRTPAGE P="18"/>apply to all National Forest System roads under the jurisdiction of the Forest Service except when in conflict with written agreement.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">General.</E> Traffic on roads is subject to State traffic laws where applicable except when in conflict with designations established under subpart B of this part or with the rules at 36 CFR part 261.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Specific.</E> The following specific traffic rules shall apply unless different rules are established in 36 CFR part 261.</P>
            <P>(i) The load, weight, length, height, and width limitations of vehicles shall be in accordance with the laws of the States wherein the road is located. Greater or lesser limits may be imposed and these greater or lesser limits shall be established as provided in 36 CFR part 261.</P>
            <P>(ii) Roads, or segments thereof, may be restricted to use by certain classes of vehicles or types of traffic as provided in 36 CFR part 261. Classes of vehicles may include but are not limited to distinguishable groupings such as passenger cars, buses, trucks, motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles, 4-wheel drive vehicles, off-highway vehicles, and trailers. Types of traffic may include but are not limited to groupings such as commercial hauling, recreation, and administrative.</P>
            <P>(iii) Roads, or segments thereof, may be closed to all vehicle use as provided in 36 CFR part 261.</P>
            <P>(iv) Additional rules may be imposed as provided in 36 CFR part 261.</P>
            <P>(b) Road system—(1) <E T="03">Identification of road system.</E> For each national forest, national grassland, experimental forest, and any other units of the National Forest System (§ 212.1), the responsible official must identify the minimum road system needed for safe and efficient travel and for administration, utilization, and protection of National Forest System lands. In determining the minimum road system, the responsible official must incorporate a science-based roads analysis at the appropriate scale and, to the degree practicable, involve a broad spectrum of interested and affected citizens, other state and federal agencies, and tribal governments. The minimum system is the road system determined to be needed to meet resource and other management objectives adopted in the relevant land and resource management plan (36 CFR part 219), to meet applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, to reflect long-term funding expectations, to ensure that the identified system minimizes adverse environmental impacts associated with road construction, reconstruction, decommissioning, and maintenance.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Identification of unneeded roads.</E> Responsible officials must review the road system on each National Forest and Grassland and identify the roads on lands under Forest Service jurisdiction that are no longer needed to meet forest resource management objectives and that, therefore, should be decommissioned or considered for other uses, such as for trails. Decommissioning roads involves restoring roads to a more natural state. Activities used to decommission a road include, but are not limited to, the following: reestablishing former drainage patterns, stabilizing slopes, restoring vegetation, blocking the entrance to the road, installing water bars, removing culverts, reestablishing drainage-ways, removing unstable fills, pulling back road shoulders, scattering slash on the roadbed, completely eliminating the roadbed by restoring natural contours and slopes, or other methods designed to meet the specific conditions associated with the unneeded road. Forest officials should give priority to decommissioning those unneeded roads that pose the greatest risk to public safety or to environmental degradation.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Cost recovery on National Forest System roads.</E> The Chief may determine that a share of the cost of acquisition, construction, reconstruction, improvement, or maintenance of a road, or segment thereof, used or to be used for commercial hauling of non-Federal forests products and other non-Federal products, commodities and materials, should be borne by the owners or haulers thereof. The Chief may condition the permission to use a road, or segment thereof, upon payment to the United States of the proportionate share of the cost and bearing proportionate maintenance as determined to be attributable to the owner's or hauler's use in accordance with § 212.9. This <PRTPAGE P="19"/>condition to use roads would apply where the owners or haulers:</P>
            <P>(1) Have not shared in the cost of acquisition, construction, reconstruction, or improvements, and</P>
            <P>(2) Have not made contributions to pay their proportionate share of the costs.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Maintenance and reconstruction of National Forest System roads by users</E>—(1) <E T="03">Maintenance.</E> The Chief may require, but not in conflict with an existing permit, easement, contract, or other agreement, the user or users of a road, including purchasers of Government timber and other products, to maintain the roads in a satisfactory condition commensurate with the particular use requirements of each. The maintenance to be borne by each user shall be proportionate to total use and no individual user shall be required to perform or bear the costs of maintenance other than that commensurate with his use.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Reconstruction.</E> The Chief may require, but not in conflict with an existing permit, easement, contract, or other agreement, the user or users of a road to reconstruct it when, at the time the use is requested, reconstruction is determined to be necessary to accommodate his use.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Deposits in lieu of performance.</E> If the maintenance or reconstruction cannot be so provided or if the Chief determines that maintenance or reconstruction by a user would not be practical, the Chief may require that sufficient funds be deposited by the user to provide his portion of the total maintenance or reconstruction costs. Deposits made to cover maintenance or reconstruction of roads shall be used for the purposes deposited, except that:</P>
            <P>(i) Deposits received for work on adjacent and overlapping areas may be combined when it is the most practicable and efficient manner of performing the work, and cost thereof may be determined by estimates, and</P>
            <P>(ii) Unexpended balances upon accomplishment of the purposes for which deposited shall be transferred to miscellaneous receipts or refunded.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Deposits for making delayed payments to cooperator.</E> Any fees or other collections received by the Chief under the terms of an agreement or other document providing for delayed payments to the Government's cooperator for use of a road shall be placed in a fund available for making these payments.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Road improvement.</E> Use of a road for commercial hauling, except occasional or minor amounts, will be conditioned upon improvement or supplemental construction of the road to safety and economically serve the contemplated use, unless the Chief determines that the safety and economy of the established and foreseeable use by the United States, its users and cooperators will not be impaired by the use for which application is being made. With the consent of the Chief the applicant may deposit funds in the estimated amount required for the improvements or supplemental construction in lieu of performance.

            <P>(d) <E T="03">Cost recovery by the United States from others.</E> When roads are used under permit for commercial hauling instead of under cooperative agreement, any cost to be recovered by the United States will be calculated in proportion to the planned use of the road. The road cost used in such calculation will be the amount or estimated amount expended in the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, and improvement of that capacity of the road required to serve the use needs of all parties that are or reasonably can be expected to use the road. The road costs shall not exceed the replacement value of the road. Such road share-cost payments will be through deposits in advance of use unless the user provides a payment bond satisfactory to the Chief guaranteeing that payments will be made promptly upon billing by the Forest Service.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Cost sharing with a cooperator.</E> The costs to achieve the agreed upon road or road system may be met by:</P>

            <P>(4) Agreement with cooperator pursuant to which cooperator does more than his agreed share of constructing, reconstructing, or improving a road and recovers costs incurred in excess of his agreed share by charging purchasers of products from lands administered by the Forest Service an equitable amount within the limits and to the total amount specified in the agreement; or</P>
            <P>(5) A combination of the aforementioned methods.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Road maintenance and resurfacing.</E> Cooperators will share the road maintenance and resurfacing costs under suitable agreements to perform, arrange for performance by others, or by making deposits with the Forest Service which will be used to pay the cost of work necessary to keep such roads in satisfactory condition commensurate with use requirements of each cooperator. No cooperator shall be required to perform or bear such costs other than those occasioned by its individual use. Other users will bear costs in accordance with § 212.5(d).</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">Initiation.</E> (1) One day after issuance of an appeal decision, the Appeal Deciding Officer shall send a copy of the appeal decision, appeal, and appealable decision to the Discretionary <PRTPAGE P="38"/>Reviewing Officer to determine whether discretionary review of the appeal decision should be conducted.</P>
          <P>(2) One day after issuance of a Chief's decision that is eligible for discretionary review under § 214.7(b)(2), the Chief shall send the decision to the Discretionary Reviewing Officer to determine whether discretionary review should be conducted.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Criteria for determining whether to conduct discretionary review.</E> In deciding whether to conduct discretionary review, the Discretionary Reviewing Officer should, at a minimum, consider the degree of controversy surrounding the decision, the potential for litigation, and the extent to which the decision establishes precedent or new policy.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Time period.</E> Upon receipt of the appeal decision, appeal, and appealable decision or Chief's decision, the Discretionary Reviewing Officer shall have 30 days to determine whether to conduct discretionary review and may request the appeal record or the record related to the Chief's decision during that time to assist in making that determination. If a request for the record is made, it must be transmitted to the Discretionary Reviewing Officer within 5 days.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Notification.</E> The Discretionary Reviewing Officer shall notify the parties and the Appeal Deciding Officer in writing of a decision to conduct discretionary review. The Discretionary Reviewing Officer may notify the parties and the Appeal Deciding Officer of a decision not to conduct discretionary review within 30 days. If the Discretionary Reviewing Officer takes no action within 30 days of receipt of the appeal decision, appeal, and appealable decision or Chief's decision, the appeal decision or Chief's decision shall constitute USDA's final administrative decision.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Scope of discretionary review and issuance of a discretionary review decision.</E> Discretionary review shall be limited to the record. No additional information shall be considered by the Discretionary Reviewing Officer. The Discretionary Reviewing Officer shall have 30 days to issue a discretionary review decision after notification of the parties and Appeal Deciding Officer has occurred pursuant to § 214.19(d). The Discretionary Reviewing Officer's decision shall constitute USDA's final administrative decision. If a discretionary review decision is not issued within 30 days following the notification of the decision to conduct discretionary review, the appeal decision or Chief's decision shall constitute USDA's final administrative decision.</P>

            <P>(a) Individuals and entities as defined in § 218.2 who have submitted timely, specific written comments regarding a proposed project or activity that is subject to these regulations during any designated opportunity for public comment may file an objection. Opportunity for public comment on a draft EIS includes request for comments during scoping, the 40 CFR 1506.10 comment period, or other public involvement opportunity where written comments are requested by the responsible official. Opportunity for public comment on an EA includes during scoping or any other instance where the responsible official seeks written comments.</P>

            <P>(c) Comments received from an authorized representative(s) of an entity are considered those of the entity only. Individual members of that entity do not meet objection eligibility requirements solely on the basis of membership in an entity. A member or an individual must submit timely, specific written comments independently in order to be eligible to file an objection in an individual capacity.</P>
            <P>(d) When an objection lists multiple individuals or entities, each individual or entity must meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. If the objection does not identify a lead objector as required at § 218.8(d)(3), the reviewing officer will delegate the first eligible objector on the list as the lead objector. Individuals or entities listed on an objection that do not meet eligibility requirements will not be considered objectors. Objections from individuals or entities that do not meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section will not be accepted and will be documented as such in the objection record.</P>
            <P>(e) Federal agencies may not file objections.</P>
            <P>(f) Federal employees who otherwise meet the requirements of this subpart for filing objections in a non-official capacity must comply with Federal conflict of interest statutes at 18 U.S.C. 202-209 and with employee ethics requirements at 5 CFR part 2635. Specifically, employees must not be on official duty nor use Government property or equipment in the preparation or filing of an objection. Further, employees must not use or otherwise incorporate information unavailable to the public, such as Federal agency documents that are exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552(b)).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose and applicability.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) This subpart sets out the planning requirements for developing, amending, and revising land management plans (also referred to as plans) for units of the National Forest System (NFS), as required by the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974, as amended by the National Forest Management Act of 1976 (16 U.S.C. 1600 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) (NFMA). This subpart also sets out the requirements for plan components and other content in land management plans. This part is applicable to all units of the NFS as defined by 16 U.S.C. 1609 or subsequent statute.</P>

            <P>(b) Consistent with the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960 (16 U.S.C. 528-531) (MUSYA), the Forest Service manages the NFS to sustain the multiple use of its renewable resources in perpetuity while maintaining the long-term health and productivity of the land. Resources are managed through a <PRTPAGE P="52"/>combination of approaches and concepts for the benefit of human communities and natural resources. Land management plans guide sustainable, integrated resource management of the resources within the plan area in the context of the broader landscape, giving due consideration to the relative values of the various resources in particular areas.</P>
            <P>(c) The purpose of this part is to guide the collaborative and science-based development, amendment, and revision of land management plans that promote the ecological integrity of national forests and grasslands and other administrative units of the NFS. Plans will guide management of NFS lands so that they are ecologically sustainable and contribute to social and economic sustainability; consist of ecosystems and watersheds with ecological integrity and diverse plant and animal communities; and have the capacity to provide people and communities with ecosystem services and multiple uses that provide a range of social, economic, and ecological benefits for the present and into the future. These benefits include clean air and water; habitat for fish, wildlife, and plant communities; and opportunities for recreational, spiritual, educational, and cultural benefits.</P>
            <P>(d) This part does not affect treaty rights or valid existing rights established by statute or legal instruments.</P>
            <P>(e) During the planning process, the responsible official shall comply with Section 8106 of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (25 U.S.C. 3056), Executive Order 13007 of May 24, 1996, Executive Order 13175 of November 6, 2000, laws, and other requirements with respect to disclosing or withholding under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) certain information regarding reburial sites or other information that is culturally sensitive to an Indian Tribe or Tribes.</P>
            <P>(f) Plans must comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including NFMA, MUSYA, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Wilderness Act, and the Endangered Species Act.</P>
            <P>(g) The responsible official shall ensure that the planning process, plan components, and other plan content are within Forest Service authority, the inherent capability of the plan area, and the fiscal capability of the unit.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Levels of planning and responsible officials.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Forest Service planning occurs at different organizational levels and geographic scales. Planning occurs at three levels—national strategic planning, NFS unit planning, and project or activity planning.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">National strategic planning.</E> The Chief of the Forest Service is responsible for national planning, such as preparation of the Forest Service strategic plan required under the Government Performance and Results Modernization Act of 2010 (5 U.S.C. 306; 31 U.S.C. 1115-1125; 31 U.S.C. 9703-9704), which is integrated with the requirements of the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974, as amended by the NFMA. The strategic plan establishes goals, objectives, performance measures, and strategies for management of the NFS, as well as the other Forest Service mission areas: Research and Development, State and Private Forestry, and International Programs.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">National Forest System unit planning.</E> (1) NFS unit planning results in the development, amendment, or revision of a land management plan. A land management plan provides a framework for integrated resource management and for guiding project and activity decisionmaking on a national forest, grassland, prairie, or other administrative unit. A plan reflects the unit's expected distinctive roles and contributions to the local area, region, and Nation, and the roles for which the plan area is best suited, considering the Agency's mission, the unit's unique capabilities, and the resources and management of other lands in the vicinity. Through the adaptive planning cycle set forth in this subpart, a plan can be changed to reflect new information and changing conditions.</P>

            <P>(2) A plan does not authorize projects or activities or commit the Forest Service to take action. A plan may constrain the Agency from authorizing or carrying out projects and activities, or the manner in which they may occur. Projects and activities must be <PRTPAGE P="53"/>consistent with the plan (§ 219.15). A plan does not regulate uses by the public, but a project or activity decision that regulates a use by the public under 36 CFR Part 261, Subpart B, may be made contemporaneously with the approval of a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision. Plans should not repeat laws, regulations, or program management policies, practices, and procedures that are in the Forest Service Directive System.</P>
            <P>(3) The supervisor of the national forest, grassland, prairie, or other comparable administrative unit is the responsible official for development and approval of a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision for lands under the responsibility of the supervisor, unless a regional forester; the Chief; the Under Secretary, Natural Resources and Environment; or the Secretary acts as the responsible official. Two or more responsible officials may undertake joint planning over lands under their respective jurisdictions.</P>
            <P>(4) A plan for a unit that contains an experimental area may not be approved without the concurrence of the appropriate research station director with respect to the direction applicable to that area, and a plan amendment applicable to an experimental area may not be approved without the concurrence of the appropriate research station director.</P>
            <P>(5) The Chief is responsible for leadership and direction for carrying out the NFS land management planning program under this part. The Chief shall:</P>
            <P>(i) Establish planning procedures for this part in the Forest Service Directive System in Forest Service Manual 1920—Land Management Planning and in Forest Service Handbook 1909.12—Land Management Planning Handbook.</P>
            <P>(ii) Establish and administer a national oversight process for accountability and consistency of NFS land management planning under this part.</P>
            <P>(iii) Establish procedures in the Forest Service Directive System for obtaining inventory data on the various renewable resources, and soil and water.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Project and activity planning.</E> The supervisor or district ranger is the responsible official for project and activity decisions, unless a higher-level official acts as the responsible official. Requirements for project or activity planning are established in the Forest Service Directive System. Except as provided in the plan consistency requirements in § 219.15, none of the requirements of this part apply to projects or activities.</P>

            <P>The responsible official shall use the best available scientific information to inform the planning process required by this subpart for assessment; developing, amending, or revising a plan; and monitoring. In doing so, the responsible official shall determine what information is the most accurate, reliable, and relevant to the issues being considered. The responsible official shall document how the best available scientific information was used to inform the assessment, the plan or amendment decision, and the monitoring program as required in §§ 219.6(a)(3) and 219.14(a)(3). Such documentation must: Identify what information was determined to be the best available scientific information, explain the basis for that determination, and explain how the information was applied to the issues considered.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Planning framework.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Planning for a national forest, grassland, prairie, or other comparable administrative unit of the NFS is an iterative process that includes assessment (§ 219.6); developing, amending, or revising a plan (§§ 219.7 and 219.13); and monitoring (§ 219.12). These three phases of the framework are complementary and may overlap. The intent of this framework is to create a responsive planning process that informs integrated resource management and allows the Forest Service to adapt to changing conditions, including climate change, and improve management based on new information and monitoring.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Assessment.</E> Assessments rapidly evaluate existing information about relevant ecological, economic, and social conditions, trends, and sustainability and their relationship to the land management plan within the context of the broader landscape. The responsible official shall consider and evaluate existing and possible future conditions and trends of the plan area, and assess the sustainability of social, economic, and ecological systems within the plan area, in the context of the broader landscape (§ 219.6).</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Plan development, plan amendment, or plan revision.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(i) The process for developing or revising a plan includes: Assessment, preliminary identification of the need to change the plan based on the assessment, development of a proposed plan, consideration of the environmental effects of the proposal, providing an opportunity to comment on the proposed plan, providing an opportunity to object before the proposal is approved, and, finally, approval of the plan or plan revision. A new plan or plan revision requires preparation of an environmental impact statement.</P>
            <P>(ii) The process for amending a plan includes: Preliminary identification of the need to change the plan, development of a proposed amendment, consideration of the environmental effects of the proposal, providing an opportunity to comment on the proposed amendment, providing an opportunity to object before the proposal is approved, and, finally, approval of the plan amendment. The appropriate NEPA documentation for an amendment may be an environmental impact statement, an environmental assessment, or a categorical exclusion, depending upon the scope and scale of the amendment and its likely effects.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Monitoring.</E> Monitoring is continuous and provides feedback for the planning cycle by testing relevant assumptions, tracking relevant conditions over time, and measuring management effectiveness (§ 219.12). The monitoring program includes plan-level and broader-scale monitoring. The plan-level monitoring program is informed by the assessment phase; developed during plan development, plan amendment, or plan revision; and implemented after plan decision. The regional forester develops broader-scale monitoring strategies. Biennial monitoring evaluation reports document whether a change to the plan or change to the monitoring program is warranted based on new information, whether a new assessment may be needed, or whether there is no need for change at that time.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Interdisciplinary team(s).</E> The responsible official shall establish an interdisciplinary team or teams to prepare assessments; new plans, plan amendments, and plan revisions; and plan monitoring programs.</P>

            <P>The responsible official has the discretion to determine the scope, scale, and timing of an assessment described in § 219.5(a)(1), subject to the requirements of this section.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Process for plan development or revision assessments.</E> An assessment must be completed for the development of a <PRTPAGE P="56"/>new plan or for a plan revision. The responsible official shall:</P>
            <P>(1) Identify and consider relevant existing information in governmental or non-governmental assessments, plans, monitoring reports, studies, and other sources of relevant information. Such sources of information may include State forest assessments and strategies, the Resources Planning Act assessment, ecoregional assessments, non-governmental reports, State comprehensive outdoor recreation plans, community wildfire protection plans, public transportation plans, State wildlife data and action plans, and relevant Agency or interagency reports, resource plans or assessments. Relevant private information, including relevant land management plans and local knowledge, will be considered if publicly available or voluntarily provided.</P>
            <P>(2) Coordinate with or provide opportunities for the regional forester, agency staff from State and Private Forestry and Research and Development, federally recognized Indian Tribes and Alaska Native Corporations, other governmental and non-governmental parties, and the public to provide existing information for the assessment.</P>
            <P>(3) Document the assessment in a report available to the public. The report should document information needs relevant to the topics of paragraph (b) of this section. Document in the report how the best available scientific information was used to inform the assessment (§ 219.3). Include the report in the planning record (§ 219.14).</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Content of the assessment for plan development or revision.</E> In the assessment for plan development or revision, the responsible official shall identify and evaluate existing information relevant to the plan area for the following:</P>
            <P>(1) Terrestrial ecosystems, aquatic ecosystems, and watersheds;</P>
            <P>(2) Air, soil, and water resources and quality;</P>
            <P>(3) System drivers, including dominant ecological processes, disturbance regimes, and stressors, such as natural succession, wildland fire, invasive species, and climate change; and the ability of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems on the plan area to adapt to change;</P>
            <P>(4) Baseline assessment of carbon stocks;</P>
            <P>(5) Threatened, endangered, proposed and candidate species, and potential species of conservation concern present in the plan area;</P>
            <P>(6) Social, cultural, and economic conditions;</P>
            <P>(7) Benefits people obtain from the NFS planning area (ecosystem services);</P>
            <P>(8) Multiple uses and their contributions to local, regional, and national economies;</P>
            <P>(9) Recreation settings, opportunities and access, and scenic character;</P>
            <P>(10) Renewable and nonrenewable energy and mineral resources;</P>
            <P>(11) Infrastructure, such as recreational facilities and transportation and utility corridors;</P>
            <P>(12) Areas of tribal importance;</P>
            <P>(13) Cultural and historic resources and uses;</P>
            <P>(14) Land status and ownership, use, and access patterns; and</P>
            <P>(15) Existing designated areas located in the plan area including wilderness and wild and scenic rivers and potential need and opportunity for additional designated areas.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Plan amendment assessments.</E> Where the responsible official determines that a new assessment is needed to inform an amendment, the responsible official has the discretion to determine the scope, scale, process, and content for the assessment depending on the topic or topics to be addressed.</P>

            <SUBJECT>New plan development or plan revision.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Plan revisions.</E> A plan revision creates a new plan for the entire plan area, whether the plan revision differs from the prior plan to a small or large extent. A plan must be revised at least every 15 years. But, the responsible official has the discretion to determine at any time that conditions on a plan area have changed significantly such that a plan must be revised (16 U.S.C. 1604(f)(5)).</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">New plan development.</E> New plan development is required for new NFS <PRTPAGE P="57"/>units. The process for developing a new plan is the same as the process for plan revision.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Process for plan development or revision.</E> (1) The process for developing or revising a plan includes: Public notification and participation (§§ 219.4 and 219.16), assessment (§§ 219.5 and 219.6), developing a proposed plan, considering the environmental effects of the proposal, providing an opportunity to comment on the proposed plan, providing an opportunity to object before the proposal is approved (subpart B), and, finally, approving the plan or plan revision. A new plan or plan revision requires preparation of an environmental impact statement.</P>
            <P>(2) In developing a proposed new plan or proposed plan revision, the responsible official shall:</P>
            <P>(i) Review relevant information from the assessment and monitoring to identify a preliminary need to change the existing plan and to inform the development of plan components and other plan content.</P>
            <P>(ii) Consider the goals and objectives of the Forest Service strategic plan (§ 219.2(a)).</P>
            <P>(iii) Identify the presence and consider the importance of various physical, biological, social, cultural, and historic resources on the plan area (§ 219.6), with respect to the requirements for plan components of §§ 219.8 through 219.11.</P>
            <P>(iv) Consider conditions, trends, and stressors (§ 219.6), with respect to the requirements for plan components of §§ 219.8 through 219.11.</P>
            <P>(v) Identify and evaluate lands that may be suitable for inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation System and determine whether to recommend any such lands for wilderness designation.</P>
            <P>(vi) Identify the eligibility of rivers for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, unless a systematic inventory has been previously completed and documented and there are no changed circumstances that warrant additional review.</P>
            <P>(vii) Identify existing designated areas other than the areas identified in paragraphs (c)(2)(v) and (c)(2)(vi) of this section, and determine whether to recommend any additional areas for designation. If the responsible official has the delegated authority to designate a new area or modify an existing area, then the responsible official may designate such area when approving the plan, plan amendment, or plan revision.</P>
            <P>(viii) Identify the suitability of areas for the appropriate integration of resource management and uses, with respect to the requirements for plan components of §§ 219.8 through 219.11, including identifying lands that are not suitable for timber production (§ 219.11).</P>
            <P>(ix) Identify the maximum quantity of timber that may be removed from the plan area (§ 219.11(d)(6)).</P>
            <P>(x) Identify questions and indicators for the plan monitoring program (§ 219.12).</P>
            <P>(xi) Identify potential other content in the plan (paragraph (f) of this section).</P>
            <P>(3) The regional forester shall identify the species of conservation concern for the plan area in coordination with the responsible official.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Management areas or geographic areas.</E> Every plan must have management areas or geographic areas or both. The plan may identify designated or recommended designated areas as management areas or geographic areas.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Plan components.</E> Plan components guide future project and activity decisionmaking.

            <P>(1) <E T="03">Required plan components.</E> Every plan must include the following plan components:</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Desired conditions.</E> A desired condition is a description of specific social, economic, and/or ecological characteristics of the plan area, or a portion of the plan area, toward which management of the land and resources should be directed. Desired conditions must be described in terms that are specific enough to allow progress toward their achievement to be determined, but do not include completion dates.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Objectives.</E> An objective is a concise, measurable, and time-specific statement of a desired rate of progress <PRTPAGE P="58"/>toward a desired condition or conditions. Objectives should be based on reasonably foreseeable budgets.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Standards.</E> A standard is a mandatory constraint on project and activity decisionmaking, established to help achieve or maintain the desired condition or conditions, to avoid or mitigate undesirable effects, or to meet applicable legal requirements.</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Guidelines.</E> A guideline is a constraint on project and activity decisionmaking that allows for departure from its terms, so long as the purpose of the guideline is met. (§ 219.15(d)(3)). Guidelines are established to help achieve or maintain a desired condition or conditions, to avoid or mitigate undesirable effects, or to meet applicable legal requirements.</P>
            <P>(v) <E T="03">Suitability of lands.</E> Specific lands within a plan area will be identified as suitable for various multiple uses or activities based on the desired conditions applicable to those lands. The plan will also identify lands within the plan area as not suitable for uses that are not compatible with desired conditions for those lands. The suitability of lands need not be identified for every use or activity. Suitability identifications may be made after consideration of historic uses and of issues that have arisen in the planning process. Every plan must identify those lands that are not suitable for timber production (§ 219.11).</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Optional plan component: goals.</E> A plan may include goals as plan components. Goals are broad statements of intent, other than desired conditions, usually related to process or interaction with the public.

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Additional, species-specific plan components.</E> (1) The responsible official shall determine whether or not the plan components required by paragraph (a) of this section provide the ecological conditions necessary to: contribute to the recovery of federally listed threatened and endangered species, conserve proposed and candidate species, and maintain a viable population of each species of conservation concern within the plan area. If the responsible official determines that the plan components required in paragraph (a) are insufficient to provide such ecological conditions, then additional, species-specific plan components, including standards or guidelines, must be included in the plan to provide such ecological conditions in the plan area.</P>
            <P>(2) If the responsible official determines that it is beyond the authority of the Forest Service or not within the inherent capability of the plan area to maintain or restore the ecological conditions to maintain a viable population of a species of conservation concern in the plan area, then the responsible official shall:</P>
            <P>(i) Document the basis for that determination (§ 219.14(a)); and</P>
            <P>(ii) Include plan components, including standards or guidelines, to maintain or restore ecological conditions within the plan area to contribute to maintaining a viable population of the species within its range. In providing such plan components, the responsible official shall coordinate to the extent practicable with other Federal, State, Tribal, and private land managers having management authority over lands relevant to that population.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Species of conservation concern.</E> For purposes of this subpart, a species of conservation concern is a species, other than federally recognized threatened, endangered, proposed, or candidate species, that is known to occur in the plan area and for which the regional forester has determined that the best available scientific information indicates substantial concern about the species' capability to persist over the long-term in the plan area.</P>

            <P>While meeting the requirements of §§ 219.8 through 219.10, a plan developed or revised under this part must include plan components, including standards or guidelines, and other plan content regarding timber management within Forest Service authority and the inherent capability of the plan area, as follows:</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Lands not suited for timber production.</E> (1) The responsible official shall identify lands within the plan area as not suited for timber production if any one of the following factors applies:</P>
            <P>(i) Statute, Executive order, or regulation prohibits timber production on the land;</P>

            <P>(ii) The Secretary of Agriculture or the Chief has withdrawn the land from timber production;<PRTPAGE P="62"/>
            </P>
            <P>(iii) Timber production would not be compatible with the achievement of desired conditions and objectives established by the plan for those lands;</P>
            <P>(iv) The technology is not currently available for conducting timber harvest without causing irreversible damage to soil, slope, or other watershed conditions;</P>
            <P>(v) There is no reasonable assurance that such lands can be adequately restocked within 5 years after final regeneration harvest; or</P>
            <P>(vi) The land is not forest land.</P>
            <P>(2) The responsible official shall review lands identified in the plan as not suited for timber production at least once every 10 years, or as otherwise prescribed by law, to determine whether conditions have changed so that they have become suitable for timber production. As a result of this 10-year review, the plan may be amended to identify any such lands as suitable for timber production, if warranted by changed conditions.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Timber harvest for purposes of timber production.</E> A plan that identifies lands as suitable for timber production must include plan components, including standards or guidelines, to guide timber harvest for timber production or for other multiple use purposes on such lands.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Timber harvest for purposes other than timber production.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the plan may include plan components to allow for timber harvest for purposes other than timber production throughout the plan area, or portions of the plan area, as a tool to assist in achieving or maintaining one or more applicable desired conditions or objectives of the plan in order to protect other multiple-use values, and for salvage, sanitation, or public health or safety. Examples of using timber harvest to protect other multiple use values may include improving wildlife or fish habitat, thinning to reduce fire risk, or restoring meadow or savanna ecosystems where trees have invaded.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Limitations on timber harvest.</E> Whether timber harvest would be for the purposes of timber production or other purposes, plan components, including standards or guidelines, must ensure the following:</P>
            <P>(1) No timber harvest for the purposes of timber production may occur on lands not suited for timber production.</P>
            <P>(2) Timber harvest would occur only where soil, slope, or other watershed conditions would not be irreversibly damaged;</P>
            <P>(3) Timber harvest would be carried out in a manner consistent with the protection of soil, watershed, fish, wildlife, recreation, and aesthetic resources.</P>
            <P>(4) Where plan components will allow clearcutting, seed tree cutting, shelterwood cutting, or other cuts designed to regenerate an even-aged stand of timber, the plan must include standards limiting the maximum size for openings that may be cut in one harvest operation, according to geographic areas, forest types, or other suitable classifications. Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section, this limit may not exceed 60 acres for the Douglas-fir forest type of California, Oregon, and Washington; 80 acres for the southern yellow pine types of Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Oklahoma, and Texas; 100 acres for the hemlock-Sitka spruce forest type of coastal Alaska; and 40 acres for all other forest types.</P>
            <P>(5) Timber will be harvested from NFS lands only where such harvest would comply with the resource protections set out in sections 6(g)(3)(E) and (F) of the NFMA (16 U.S.C. 1604(g)(3)(E) and (F)). Some of these requirements are listed in paragraphs (d)(2) to (d)(4) of this section.</P>
            <P>(6) The quantity of timber that may be sold from the national forest is limited to an amount equal to or less than that which can be removed from such forest annually in perpetuity on a sustained yield basis. This limit may be measured on a decadal basis.</P>

            <P>(i) The plan may provide for departures from this limit as provided by the NFMA when departure would be consistent with the plan's desired conditions and objectives. Exceptions for departure from this limit on the quantity sold may be made only after a public review and comment period of at least 90 days.<PRTPAGE P="63"/>
            </P>
            <P>(ii) This limit may be based upon increases in harvest levels based on intensified management practices, such as reforestation, thinning, and tree improvement if such practices justify increasing the harvests in accordance with the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960. The plan must require that such harvest levels be decreased at the end of each planning period if such practices cannot be successfully implemented or funds are not received to permit such practices to continue substantially as planned.</P>
            <P>(iii) The Chief must include in the Forest Service Directive System procedures for estimating the quantity of timber that can be removed annually in perpetuity on a sustained-yield basis, and exceptions, consistent with 16 U.S.C. 1611.</P>
            <P>(7) The regeneration harvest of even-aged stands of trees is limited to stands that generally have reached the culmination of mean annual increment of growth. This requirement would apply only to regeneration harvest of even-aged stands on lands identified as suitable for timber production and where timber production is the primary purpose for the harvest. Plan components may allow for exceptions, set out in 16 U.S.C. 1604(m), only if such harvest is consistent with the other plan components of the land management plan.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Monitoring.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Plan monitoring program.</E> (1) The responsible official shall develop a monitoring program for the plan area and include it in the plan. Monitoring information should enable the responsible official to determine if a change in plan components or other plan content that guide management of resources on the plan area may be needed. The development of the plan monitoring program must be coordinated with the regional forester and Forest Service State and Private Forestry and Research and Development. Responsible officials for two or more administrative units may jointly develop their plan monitoring programs.</P>
            <P>(2) The plan monitoring program sets out the plan monitoring questions and associated indicators. Monitoring questions and associated indicators must be designed to inform the management of resources on the plan area, including by testing relevant assumptions, tracking relevant changes, and measuring management effectiveness and progress toward achieving or maintaining the plan's desired conditions or objectives. Questions and indicators should be based on one or more desired conditions, objectives, or other plan components in the plan, but not every plan component needs to have a corresponding monitoring question.</P>
            <P>(3) The plan monitoring program should be coordinated and integrated with relevant broader-scale monitoring strategies (paragraph (b) of this section) to ensure that monitoring is complementary and efficient, and that information is gathered at scales appropriate to the monitoring questions.</P>
            <P>(4) Subject to the requirements of paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the responsible official has the discretion to set the scope and scale of the plan monitoring program, after considering:</P>
            <P>(i) Information needs identified through the planning process as most critical for informed management of resources on the plan area; and</P>
            <P>(ii) The financial and technical capabilities of the Agency.</P>
            <P>(5) Each plan monitoring program must contain one or more monitoring questions and associated indicators addressing each of the following:</P>
            <P>(i) The status of select watershed conditions.</P>
            <P>(ii) The status of select ecological conditions including key characteristics of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.</P>
            <P>(iii) The status of focal species to assess the ecological conditions required under § 219.9.</P>

            <P>(iv) The status of a select set of the ecological conditions required under § 219.9 to contribute to the recovery of federally listed threatened and endangered species, conserve proposed and candidate species, and maintain a viable population of each species of conservation concern.<PRTPAGE P="64"/>
            </P>
            <P>(v) The status of visitor use, visitor satisfaction, and progress toward meeting recreation objectives.</P>
            <P>(vi) Measurable changes on the plan area related to climate change and other stressors that may be affecting the plan area.</P>
            <P>(vii) Progress toward meeting the desired conditions and objectives in the plan, including for providing multiple use opportunities.</P>
            <P>(viii) The effects of each management system to determine that they do not substantially and permanently impair the productivity of the land (16 U.S.C. 1604(g)(3)(C)).</P>
            <P>(6) A range of monitoring techniques may be used to carry out the monitoring requirements in paragraph (a)(5) of this section.</P>
            <P>(7) This section does not apply to projects or activities. Project and activity monitoring may be used to gather information for the plan monitoring program, and information gathered through plan monitoring may be used to inform development of projects or activities. But, the monitoring requirements of this section are not a prerequisite for making a decision to carry out a project or activity.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Broader-scale monitoring strategies.</E> (1) The regional forester shall develop a broader-scale monitoring strategy for plan monitoring questions that can best be answered at a geographic scale broader than one plan area.</P>
            <P>(2) When developing a monitoring strategy, the regional forester shall coordinate with the relevant responsible officials, Forest Service State and Private Forestry and Research and Development, partners, and the public. Two or more regional foresters may jointly develop broader-scale monitoring strategies.</P>
            <P>(3) Each regional forester shall ensure that the broader-scale monitoring strategy is within the financial and technical capabilities of the region and complements other ongoing monitoring efforts.</P>
            <P>(4) Projects and activities may be carried out under plans developed, amended, or revised under this part before the regional forester has developed a broader-scale monitoring strategy.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Timing and process for developing the plan monitoring program and broader-scale strategies.</E> (1) The responsible official shall develop the plan monitoring program as part of the planning process for a new plan development or plan revision. Where a plan's monitoring program has been developed under the provisions of a prior planning regulation and the unit has not initiated plan revision under this part, the responsible official shall modify the plan monitoring program within 4 years of the effective date of this part, or as soon as practicable, to meet the requirements of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) The regional forester shall develop a broader-scale monitoring strategy as soon as practicable.</P>
            <P>(3) To the extent practicable, appropriate, and relevant to the monitoring questions in the plan monitoring program, plan monitoring programs and broader-scale strategies must be designed to take into account:</P>
            <P>(i) Existing national and regional inventory, monitoring, and research programs of the Agency, including from the NFS, State and Private Forestry, and Research and Development, and of other governmental and non-governmental entities;</P>
            <P>(ii) Opportunities to design and carry out multi-party monitoring with other Forest Service units, Federal, State or local government agencies, scientists, partners, and members of the public; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Opportunities to design and carry out monitoring with federally recognized Indian Tribes and Alaska Native Corporations.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Biennial evaluation of the monitoring information.</E> (1) The responsible official shall conduct a biennial evaluation of new information gathered through the plan monitoring program and relevant information from the broader-scale strategy, and shall issue a written report of the evaluation and make it available to the public.</P>
            <P>(i) The first monitoring evaluation for a plan or plan revision developed in accordance with this subpart must be completed no later than 2 years from the effective date of plan decision.</P>

            <P>(ii) Where the monitoring program developed under the provisions of a prior planning regulation has been modified to meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the <PRTPAGE P="65"/>first monitoring evaluation must be completed no later than 2 years from the date the change takes effect.</P>
            <P>(iii) The monitoring evaluation report may be postponed for 1 year in case of exigencies, but notice of the postponement must be provided to the public prior to the date the report is due for that year (§ 219.16(c)(6)).</P>
            <P>(2) The monitoring evaluation report must indicate whether or not a change to the plan, management activities, or the monitoring program, or a new assessment, may be warranted based on the new information. The monitoring evaluation report must be used to inform adaptive management of the plan area.</P>
            <P>(3) The monitoring evaluation report may be incorporated into other planning documents if the responsible official has initiated a plan revision or relevant amendment.</P>
            <P>(4) The monitoring evaluation report is not a decision document representing final Agency action, and is not subject to the objection provisions of subpart B.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Plan amendment and administrative changes.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Plan amendment.</E> A plan may be amended at any time. Plan amendments may be broad or narrow, depending on the need for change, and should be used to keep plans current and help units adapt to new information or changing conditions. The responsible official has the discretion to determine whether and how to amend the plan and to determine the scope and scale of any amendment. Except as provided by paragraph (c) of this section, a plan amendment is required to add, modify, or remove one or more plan components, or to change how or where one or more plan components apply to all or part of the plan area (including management areas or geographic areas).</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Amendment requirements.</E> For every plan amendment, the responsible official shall:</P>
            <P>(1) Base an amendment on a preliminary identification of the need to change the plan. The preliminary identification of the need to change the plan may be based on a new assessment; a monitoring report; or other documentation of new information, changed conditions, or changed circumstances. When a plan amendment is made together with, and only applies to, a project or activity decision, the analysis prepared for the project or activity may serve as the documentation for the preliminary identification of the need to change the plan.</P>
            <P>(2) Provide opportunities for public participation as required in § 219.4 and public notification as required in § 219.16. The responsible official may combine processes and associated public notifications where appropriate, considering the scope and scale of the need to change the plan. The responsible official must include information in the initial notice for the amendment (§ 219.16(a)(1)) about which substantive requirements of §§ 219.8 through 219.11 are likely to be directly related to the amendment (§ 219.13(b)(5)).</P>
            <P>(3) Amend the plan consistent with Forest Service NEPA procedures. The appropriate NEPA documentation for an amendment may be an environmental impact statement, an environmental assessment, or a categorical exclusion, depending upon the scope and scale of the amendment and its likely effects. Except for an amendment that applies only to one project or activity, a proposed amendment that may create a significant environmental effect and thus requires preparation of an environmental impact statement is considered a significant change in the plan for the purposes of the NFMA and therefore requires a 90-day comment period for the proposed plan and draft environmental impact statement (§ 219.16(a)(2)), in addition to meeting the requirements of this section.</P>
            <P>(4) Follow the applicable format for plan components set out at § 219.7(e) for the plan direction added or modified by the amendment, except that where an amendment to a plan developed or revised under a prior planning regulation would simply modify the area to which existing direction applies, the responsible official may retain the existing formatting for that direction.</P>

            <P>(5) Determine which specific substantive requirement(s) within §§ 219.8 through 219.11 are directly related to the plan direction being added, modified, or removed by the amendment and <PRTPAGE P="66"/>apply such requirement(s) within the scope and scale of the amendment. The responsible official is not required to apply any substantive requirements within §§ 219.8 through 219.11 that are not directly related to the amendment.</P>
            <P>(i) The responsible official's determination must be based on the purpose for the amendment and the effects (beneficial or adverse) of the amendment, and informed by the best available scientific information, scoping, effects analysis, monitoring data or other rationale.</P>
            <P>(ii) When basing the determination on adverse effects:</P>
            <P>(A) The responsible official must determine that a specific substantive requirement is directly related to the amendment when scoping or NEPA effects analysis for the proposed amendment reveals substantial adverse effects associated with that requirement, or when the proposed amendment would substantially lessen protections for a specific resource or use.</P>
            <P>(B) If the appropriate NEPA documentation for an amendment is a categorical exclusion or an environmental assessment accompanied by a finding of no significant impact (§ 219.13(b)(3)), there is a rebuttable presumption that the amendment will not have substantial adverse effects.</P>
            <P>(6) For an amendment to a plan developed or revised under a prior planning regulation, if species of conservation concern (SCC) have not been identified for the plan area and if scoping or NEPA effects analysis for the proposed amendment reveals substantial adverse impacts to a specific species, or if the proposed amendment would substantially lessen protections for a specific species, the responsible official must determine whether such species is a potential SCC, and if so, apply section § 219.9(b) with respect to that species as if it were an SCC.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Administrative changes.</E> An administrative change is any change to a plan that is not a plan amendment or plan revision. Administrative changes include corrections of clerical errors to any part of the plan, conformance of the plan to new statutory or regulatory requirements, or changes to other content in the plan (§ 219.7(f)).</P>
            <P>(1) A substantive change to the monitoring program made outside of the process for plan revision or amendment may be made only after notice to the public of the intended change and consideration of public comment (§ 219.16(c)(6)).</P>
            <P>(2) All other administrative changes may be made following public notice (§ 219.16(c)(6)).</P>

            <P>(2) <E T="03">Initiating plan amendments.</E> All plan amendments initiated after May 9, 2012, are subject to the objection process in subpart B of this part. With respect to plans approved or revised under a prior planning regulation, including the transition provisions of the reinstated 2000 rule (36 CFR part 219, published at 36 CFR parts 200 to 299, revised as of July 1, 2010), plan amendments may be initiated under the provisions of the prior planning regulation for 3 years after May 9, 2012, and may be completed and approved under those provisions (except for the optional appeal procedures of the prior planning regulation); or may be initiated, completed, and approved under the requirements of this part. After the 3-year transition period, all plan amendments must be initiated, completed, and approved under the requirements of this part.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Plan development, plan amendments, or plan revisions initiated before this part.</E> For plan development, plan amendments, or plan revisions that were initiated before May 9, 2012, the responsible official may complete and approve the plan, plan amendment, or plan revision in conformance with the provisions of the prior planning regulation, including its transition provisions (36 CFR part 219, published at 36 CFR parts 200 to 299, revised as of July 1, 2010), or may conform the plan, plan amendment, or plan revision to the requirements of this part. If the responsible official chooses to complete an ongoing planning process under the provisions of the prior planning regulation, but chooses to allow for an objection rather than an administrative appeal, the objection process in subpart B of this part shall apply. When the responsible official chooses to conform an ongoing planning process to this part, public notice must be made (§ 219.16(a)(5)). An objection process may be chosen only if the public is provided the opportunity to comment on a proposed plan, plan amendment, or plan revision, and associated environmental analysis.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Plans developed, amended, or revised under a prior planning regulation.</E> This part supersedes any prior planning regulation. No obligations remain from any prior planning regulation, except those that are specifically included in a unit's existing plan. Existing plans will remain in effect until revised. This part does not compel a change to any existing plan, except as required in § 219.12(c)(1). None of the requirements of this part apply to projects or activities on units with plans developed or revised under a prior planning rule until the plan is revised under this part, except that projects or activities on such units must comply with the consistency requirement of § 219.15 with respect to any amendments that are developed and approved pursuant to this part.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose and scope.</SUBJECT>
            <P>This subpart establishes a pre-decisional administrative review (hereinafter referred to as objection) process for plans, plan amendments, or plan revisions. This process gives an individual or entity an opportunity for an independent Forest Service review and resolution of issues before the approval of a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision. This subpart identifies who may file objections to a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision; the responsibilities of the participants in an objection; and the procedures that apply to the review of the objection.</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 219.51</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Plans, plan amendments, or plan revisions not subject to objection.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) A plan, plan amendment, or plan revision is not subject to objection when the responsible official receives no substantive formal comments (§ 219.62) on that proposal during the <PRTPAGE P="75"/>opportunities for public comment (§ 219.53(a)).</P>
            <P>(b) Plans, plan amendments, or plan revisions proposed by the Secretary of Agriculture or the Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment are not subject to the procedures set forth in this section. A decision by the Secretary or Under Secretary constitutes the final administrative determination of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</P>
            <P>(c) A plan, plan amendment, or plan revision is not subject to objection under this subpart if another administrative review process is used consistent with § 219.59.</P>
            <P>(d) When a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision is not subject to objection under this subpart, the responsible official shall include an explanation with the signed decision document.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Giving notice of a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision subject to objection before approval.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The responsible official shall disclose during the NEPA scoping process and in the appropriate NEPA documents that the proposed plan, plan amendment, or plan revision is subject to the objection procedures in this subpart. This disclosure is in addition to the public notice that begins the objection filing period, as required at § 219.16. When a responsible official chooses to use the objection process of this subpart for a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision process initiated before the effective date of this rule, notice that the objection process will be used must be given prior to an opportunity to provide substantive formal comment on a proposed plan, plan amendment, or revision and associated environmental analysis.</P>
            <P>(b) The responsible official shall make available the public notice for the beginning of the objection period for a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision (§ 219.16(a)(3)) to those who have requested the environmental documents or are eligible to file an objection consistent with § 219.53.</P>
            <P>(c) The content of the public notice for the beginning of the objection period for a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision before approval (§ 219.16(a)(3)) must:</P>
            <P>(1) Inform the public of the availability of the plan, plan amendment, or plan revision, the appropriate final environmental documents, the draft plan decision document, and any relevant assessment or monitoring evaluation report; the commencement of the objection filing period under 36 CFR part 219 Subpart B; and the process for objecting. The documents in this paragraph will be made available online at the time of public notice.</P>
            <P>(2) Include the name of the plan, plan amendment, or plan revision, the name and title of the responsible official, and instructions on how to obtain a copy of the appropriate final environmental documents; the draft plan decision document; and the plan, plan amendment, or plan revision.</P>
            <P>(3) Include the name and address of the reviewing officer with whom an objection is to be filed. The notice must specify a street, postal, fax, and email address; the acceptable format(s) for objections filed electronically; and the reviewing officer's office business hours for those filing hand-delivered objections.</P>
            <P>(4) Include a statement that objections will be accepted only from those who have previously submitted substantive formal comments specific to the proposed plan, plan amendment, or plan revision during any opportunity for public comment as provided in subpart A.</P>

            <P>(5) Include a statement that the publication date of the public notice in the applicable newspaper of record (or the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> if the responsible official is the Chief) is the exclusive means for calculating the time to file an objection (§ 219.56).</P>
            <P>(6) Include a statement that an objection, including attachments, must be filed with the appropriate reviewing officer (§ 219.62) within 60 days, if an environmental impact statement has been prepared, otherwise within 45 days of the date of publication of the public notice for the objection process.</P>
            <P>(7) Include a statement describing the minimum content requirements of an objection (§ 219.54(c)).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Who may file an objection.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Individuals and entities who have submitted substantive formal comments related to a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision during the opportunities for public comment as provided in subpart A during the planning process for that decision may file an objection. Objections must be based on previously submitted substantive formal comments attributed to the objector unless the objection concerns an issue that arose after the opportunities for formal comment. The burden is on the objector to demonstrate compliance with requirements for objection. Objections that do not meet the requirements of this paragraph may not be accepted; however, objections not accepted must be documented in the planning record.</P>
            <P>(b) Formal comments received from an authorized representative(s) of an entity are considered those of the entity only. Individual members of that entity do not meet objection eligibility requirements solely based on membership in an entity. A member or an individual must submit substantive formal comments independently to be eligible to file an objection in an individual capacity.</P>
            <P>(c) When an objection lists multiple individuals or entities, each individual or entity must meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. Individuals or entities listed on an objection that do not meet eligibility requirements may not be considered objectors, although an objection must be accepted (if not otherwise set aside for review under § 219.55) if at least one listed individual or entity meets the eligibility requirements.</P>
            <P>(d) Federal agencies may not file objections.</P>
            <P>(e) Federal employees who otherwise meet the requirements of this subpart for filing objections in a non-official capacity must comply with Federal conflict of interest statutes at 18 U.S.C. 202-209 and with employee ethics requirements at 5 CFR part 2635. Specifically, employees may not be on official duty nor use government property or equipment in the preparation or filing of an objection. Further, employees may not include information unavailable to the public, such as Federal agency documents that are exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552(b)).</P>

            <P>(5) A statement of the issues and/or the parts of the plan, plan amendment, or plan revision to which the objection applies;</P>

            <P>(6) A concise statement explaining the objection and suggesting how the <PRTPAGE P="77"/>proposed plan decision may be improved. If applicable, the objector should identify how the objector believes that the plan, plan amendment, or plan revision is inconsistent with law, regulation, or policy; and</P>
            <P>(7) A statement that demonstrates the link between prior substantive formal comments attributed to the objector and the content of the objection, unless the objection concerns an issue that arose after the opportunities for formal comment (§ 219.53(a)).</P>

            <P>(3) The individual or entity did not submit substantive formal comments (§ 219.53) during opportunities for public comment on the proposed decision (§ 219.16(a)(1) and (a)(2));</P>
            <P>(4) None of the issues included in the objection is based on previously submitted substantive formal comments unless one or more of those issues arose after the opportunities for formal comment;</P>
            <P>(5) The objection does not provide sufficient information as required by § 219.54(c);</P>
            <P>(6) The objector withdraws the objection in writing;</P>
            <P>(7) The objector's identity is not provided or cannot be determined from the signature (written or electronically scanned), and a reasonable means of contact is not provided (§ 219.54(c)); or</P>

            <SUBJECT>Objection time periods and process.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Time to file an objection.</E> For a new plan, plan amendment, or plan revision for which an environmental impact statement (EIS) is prepared, written objections, including any attachments, must be filed within 60 days following the publication date of the public notice for a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision before approval (§§ 219.16 and 219.52). For an amendment for which an EIS is not prepared, the time to file an objection is within 45 days. It is the responsibility of the objector to ensure that the reviewing officer receives the objection in a timely manner.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Computation of time periods.</E> (1) All time periods are computed using calendar days, including Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays in the time zone of the reviewing officer. However, when the time period expires on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the time is extended to the end of the next Federal working day (11:59 p.m. for objections filed by electronic means such as email or facsimile machine).</P>
            <P>(2) The day after publication of the public notice for a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision before approval (§§ 219.16 and 219.52), is the first day of the objection filing period.</P>

            <P>(1) For a plan amendment, that next higher-level line officer may delegate the reviewing officer authority and responsibility to a line officer at the same administrative level as the responsible official. Any plan amendment delegation of reviewing officer responsibilities must be made prior to the public notification of an objection filing period (§ 219.52).</P>
            <P>(2) For an objection or part of an objection specific to the identification of species of conservation concern, the regional forester who identified the species of conservation concern for the plan area may not be the reviewing officer. The Chief may choose to act as the reviewing officer or may delegate the reviewing officer authority to a line officer at the same administrative level as the regional forester. The reviewing officer for the plan will convey any such objections or parts thereof to the appropriate line officer.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Notice of objections filed.</E> Within 10 days after the close of the objection period, the responsible official shall publish a notice of all objections in the applicable newspaper of record and post the notice online.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Resolution of objections.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Meetings.</E> Prior to the issuance of the reviewing officer's written response, either the reviewing officer or the objector may request to meet to discuss issues raised in the objection and potential resolution. The reviewing officer must allow other interested persons to participate in such meetings. An interested person must file a request to participate in an objection within 10 days after publication of the notice of objection by the responsible official (§ 219.56(f)). The responsible official shall be a participant in all meetings involving the reviewing officer, objectors, and interested persons. During meetings with objectors and interested persons, the reviewing officer may choose to use alternative dispute resolution methods to resolve objections. All meetings are open to observation by the public.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Response to objections.</E> (1) The reviewing officer must render a written response to the objection(s) within 90 days of the close of the objection-filing period, unless the allowable time is extended as provided at § 219.56(g). A written response must set forth the reasons for the response but need not be a point-by-point response, and may contain instructions to the responsible official. In cases involving more than one objection to a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision, the reviewing officer may consolidate objections and issue one or more responses. The response must be sent to the objecting party(ies) by certified mail, return receipt requested, and posted online.</P>

            <P>(2) The reviewing officer's review of and response to the objection(s) is limited to only those issues and concerns submitted in the objection(s).<PRTPAGE P="79"/>
            </P>
            <P>(3) The response of the reviewing officer will be the final decision of the U.S. Department of Agriculture on the objection.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Timing of a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision decision.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The responsible official may not issue a decision document concerning a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision subject to the provisions of this subpart until the reviewing officer has responded in writing to all objections.</P>
            <P>(b) A decision by the responsible official approving a plan, plan amendment, or plan revision must be consistent with the reviewing officer's response to objections.</P>
            <P>(c) When no objection is filed within the allotted filing period, the reviewing officer must notify the responsible official. The responsible official's approval of the plan, plan amendment, or plan revision in a plan decision document consistent with § 219.14, may occur on, but not before, the fifth business day following the end of the objection-filing period.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 219.59</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Use of other administrative review processes.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Where the Forest Service is a participant in a multi-federal agency effort that would otherwise be subject to objection under this subpart, the responsible official may waive the objection procedures of this subpart and instead adopt the administrative review procedure of another participating Federal agency. As a condition of such a waiver, the responsible official for the Forest Service must have agreement with the responsible official of the other agency or agencies that a joint agency response will be provided to those who file for administrative review of the multi-agency effort. When such an agreement is reached, the responsible official for the Forest Service shall ensure public notice required in § 219.52 sets forth which administrative review procedure is to be used.</P>
            <P>(b) When a plan amendment is approved in a decision document approving a project or activity and the amendment applies only to the project or activity, the administrative review process of 36 CFR part 215 or part 218, subpart A, applies instead of the objection process established in this subpart. When a plan amendment applies to all future projects or activities, the objection process established in this subpart applies only to the plan amendment decision; the review process of 36 CFR part 215 or part 218 would apply to the project or activity part of the decision.</P>

          <P>The following definitions supplement, by adding to, the terms defined at 40 CFR parts 1500-1508.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Adaptive management.</E> A system of management practices based on clearly identified intended outcomes and monitoring to determine if management actions are meeting those outcomes; and, if not, to facilitate management changes that will best ensure that those outcomes are met or re-evaluated. Adaptive management stems from the recognition that knowledge about natural resource systems is sometimes uncertain.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Decision document.</E> A record of decision, decision notice or decision memo.</P>
          <P>

          <P>
            <E T="03">Environmentally preferable alternative.</E> The environmentally preferable alternative is the alternative that will best promote the national environmental policy as expressed in NEPA's section 101 (42 U.S.C. 4321). Ordinarily, the environmentally preferable alternative is that which causes the least harm to the biological and physical environment; it also is the alternative which best protects and preserves historic, cultural, and natural resources. In some situations, there may be more than one environmentally preferable alternative.</P>
          <P>
            <E T="03">Reasonably foreseeable future actions.</E> Those Federal or non-Federal activities not yet undertaken, for which there are existing decisions, funding, or identified proposals. Identified proposals for Forest Service actions are described in § 220.4(a)(1).</P>

          <P>
            <E T="03">Schedule of proposed actions (SOPA).</E> A Forest Service document that informs the public about those proposed and ongoing Forest Service actions for which a record of decision, decision notice or decision memo would be or has been prepared. The SOPA also identifies a contact for additional information on any proposed actions.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 220.4</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>General requirements.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Proposed actions subject to the NEPA requirements.</E> As required by 42 U.S.C. 4321 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> a Forest Service proposal is subject to the NEPA requirements when all of the following apply:</P>

          <P>(1) The Forest Service has a goal and is actively preparing to make a decision on one or more alternative means of accomplishing that goal and the effects can be meaningfully evaluated (<E T="03">see</E> 40 CFR 1508.23);</P>

          <P>(2) The proposed action is subject to Forest Service control and responsibility (<E T="03">see</E> 40 CFR 1508.18);</P>

          <P>(3) The proposed action would cause effects on the natural and physical environment and the relationship of people with that environment (<E T="03">see</E> 40 CFR 1508.14); and</P>
          <P>(4) The proposed action is not statutorily exempt from the requirements of section 102(2)(C) of the NEPA (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Emergency responses.</E> When the responsible official determines that an emergency exists that makes it necessary to take urgently needed actions before preparing a NEPA analysis and any required documentation in accordance with the provisions in §§ 220.5, 220.6, and 220.7 of this part, then the following provisions apply.<PRTPAGE P="82"/>
          </P>
          <P>(1) The responsible official may take actions necessary to control the immediate impacts of the emergency and are urgently needed to mitigate harm to life, property, or important natural or cultural resources. When taking such actions, the responsible official shall take into account the probable environmental consequences of the emergency action and mitigate foreseeable adverse environmental effects to the extent practical.</P>
          <P>(2) If the responsible official proposes emergency actions other than those actions described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and such actions are not likely to have significant environmental impacts, the responsible official shall document that determination in an EA and FONSI prepared in accord with these regulations. If the responsible official finds that the nature and scope of proposed emergency actions are such that they must be undertaken prior to preparing any NEPA analysis and documentation associated with a CE or an EA and FONSI, the responsible official shall consult with the Washington Office about alternative arrangements for NEPA compliance. The Chief or Associate Chief of the Forest Service may grant emergency alternative arrangements under NEPA for environmental assessments, findings of no significant impact and categorical exclusions (FSM 1950.41a). Consultation with the Washington Office shall be coordinated through the appropriate regional office.</P>
          <P>(3) If the responsible official proposes emergency actions other than those actions described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and such actions are likely to have significant environmental impacts, then the responsible official shall consult with CEQ, through the appropriate regional office and the Washington Office, about alternative arrangements in accordance with CEQ regulations at 40 CFR 1506.11 as soon as possible.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Agency decisionmaking.</E> For each Forest Service proposal (§ 220.4(a)), the responsible official shall coordinate and integrate NEPA review and relevant environmental documents with agency decisionmaking by:</P>
          <P>(1) Completing the environmental document review before making a decision on the proposal;</P>
          <P>(2) Considering environmental documents, public and agency comments (if any) on those documents, and agency responses to those comments;</P>
          <P>(3) Including environmental documents, comments, and responses in the administrative record;</P>
          <P>(4) Considering the alternatives analyzed in environmental document(s) before rendering a decision on the proposal; and</P>
          <P>(5) Making a decision encompassed within the range of alternatives analyzed in the environmental documents.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Schedule of proposed actions (SOPA).</E> The responsible official shall ensure the SOPA is updated and notify the public of the availability of the SOPA.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Scoping (40 CFR 1501.7).</E> (1) Scoping is required for all Forest Service proposed actions, including those that would appear to be categorically excluded from further analysis and documentation in an EA or an EIS (§ 220.6).</P>
          <P>(2) Scoping shall be carried out in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 1501.7. Because the nature and complexity of a proposed action determine the scope and intensity of analysis, no single scoping technique is required or prescribed.</P>
          <P>(3) The SOPA shall not to be used as the sole scoping mechanism for a proposed action.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Cumulative effects considerations of past actions.</E> Cumulative effects analysis shall be carried out in accordance with 40 CFR 1508.7 and in accordance with “The Council on Environmental Quality Guidance Memorandum on Consideration of Past Actions in Cumulative Effects Analysis” dated June 24, 2005. The analysis of cumulative effects begins with consideration of the direct and indirect effects on the environment that are expected or likely to result from the alternative proposals for agency action. Agencies then look for present effects of past actions that are, in the judgment of the agency, relevant and useful because they have a significant cause-and-effect relationship with the direct and indirect effects of the proposal for agency action and its alternatives. CEQ regulations do <PRTPAGE P="83"/>not require the consideration of the individual effects of all past actions to determine the present effects of past actions. Once the agency has identified those present effects of past actions that warrant consideration, the agency assesses the extent that the effects of the proposal for agency action or its alternatives will add to, modify, or mitigate those effects. The final analysis documents an agency assessment of the cumulative effects of the actions considered (including past, present, and reasonable foreseeable future actions) on the affected environment. With respect to past actions, during the scoping process and subsequent preparation of the analysis, the agency must determine what information regarding past actions is useful and relevant to the required analysis of cumulative effects. Cataloging past actions and specific information about the direct and indirect effects of their design and implementation could in some contexts be useful to predict the cumulative effects of the proposal. The CEQ regulations, however, do not require agencies to catalogue or exhaustively list and analyze all individual past actions. Simply because information about past actions may be available or obtained with reasonable effort does not mean that it is relevant and necessary to inform decisionmaking. (40 CFR 1508.7)</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Classified information.</E> To the extent practicable, the responsible official shall segregate any information that has been classified pursuant to Executive order or statute. The responsible official shall maintain the confidentiality of such information in a manner required for the information involved. Such information may not be included in any publicly disclosed documents. If such material cannot be reasonably segregated, or if segregation would leave essentially meaningless material, the responsible official must withhold the entire analysis document from the public; however, the responsible official shall otherwise prepare the analysis documentation in accord with applicable regulations. (40 CFR 1507.3(c))</P>
          <P>(h) <E T="03">Incorporation by reference.</E> Material may be incorporated by reference into any environmental or decision document. This material must be reasonably available to the public and its contents briefly described in the environmental or decision document. (40 CFR 1502.21)</P>
          <P>(i) <E T="03">Applicants.</E> The responsible official shall make policies or staff available to advise potential applicants of studies or other information foreseeably required for acceptance of their applications. Upon acceptance of an application as provided by 36 CFR 251.54(g) the responsible official shall initiate the NEPA process.</P>

Where there is a lengthy period between the agency's decision to prepare an environmental <PRTPAGE P="84"/>impact statement and the time of actual preparation, the notice of intent may be published at a reasonable time in advance of preparation of the draft statement. A notice must meet the requirements of 40 CFR 1508.22, and in addition, include the following:</P>
          <P>(1) Title of the responsible official(s);</P>
          <P>(2) Any permits or licenses required to implement the proposed action and the issuing authority;</P>

A withdrawal notice must refer to the date and <E T="04">Federal Register</E> page number of the previously published notice(s).</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Environmental impact statement format and content.</E> The responsible official may use any EIS format and design as long as the statement is in accord with 40 CFR 1502.10.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Alternative(s).</E> The EIS shall document the examination of reasonable alternatives to the proposed action. An alternative should meet the purpose and need and address one or more significant issues related to the proposed action. Since an alternative may be developed to address more than one significant issue, no specific number of alternatives is required or prescribed. The following procedures are available to the responsible official to develop and analyze alternatives:</P>
          <P>(1) The responsible official may modify the proposed action and alternative(s) under consideration prior to issuing a draft EIS. In such cases, the responsible official may consider the incremental changes as alternatives considered. The documentation of these incremental changes to a proposed action or alternatives shall be included or incorporated by reference in accord with 40 CFR 1502.21.</P>
          <P>(2) The proposed action and one or more alternatives to the proposed action may include adaptive management. An adaptive management proposal or alternative must clearly identify the adjustment(s) that may be made when monitoring during project implementation indicates that the action is not having its intended effect, or is causing unintended and undesirable effects. The EIS must disclose not only the effect of the proposed action or alternative but also the effect of the adjustment. Such proposal or alternative must also describe the monitoring that would take place to inform the responsible official during implementation whether the action is having its intended effect.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Circulating and filing draft and final environmental impact statements.</E> (1) The draft and final EISs shall be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Federal Activities in Washington, DC (<E T="03">see</E> 40 CFR 1506.9).</P>
          <P>(2) Requirements at 40 CFR 1506.9 “Filing requirements,” 40 CFR 1506.10 “Timing of agency action,” and 40 CFR 1502.19 “Circulation of the environmental impact statement” shall only apply to the last draft and final EIS and not apply to material produced prior to the draft EIS or between the draft and final EIS which are filed with EPA.</P>
          <P>(3) When the responsible official determines that an extension of the review period on a draft EIS is appropriate, notice shall be given in the same manner used for inviting comments on the draft.</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Distribution of the record of decision.</E> The responsible official shall notify interested or affected parties of the availability of the record of decision as soon as practical after signing.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Categorical exclusions.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> A proposed action may be categorically excluded from further analysis and documentation in an EIS or EA only if there are no extraordinary circumstances related to the proposed action and if:</P>
          <P>(1) The proposed action is within one of the categories established by the Secretary at 7 CFR part 1b.3; or</P>
          <P>(2) The proposed action is within a category listed in § 220.6(d) and (e).</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Resource conditions.</E> (1) Resource conditions that should be considered in determining whether extraordinary circumstances related to a proposed action warrant further analysis and documentation in an EA or an EIS are:<PRTPAGE P="85"/>

          <P>(vii) Archaeological sites, or historic properties or areas.</P>
          <P>(2) The mere presence of one or more of these resource conditions does not preclude use of a categorical exclusion (CE). It is the existence of a cause-effect relationship between a proposed action and the potential effect on these resource conditions, and if such a relationship exists, the degree of the potential effect of a proposed action on these resource conditions that determines whether extraordinary circumstances exist.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Scoping.</E> If the responsible official determines, based on scoping, that it is uncertain whether the proposed action may have a significant effect on the environment, prepare an EA.

          <SUBJECT>Environmental assessment and decision notice.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Environmental assessment.</E> An environmental assessment (EA) shall be prepared for proposals as described in § 220.4(a) that are not categorically excluded from documentation (§ 220.6) and for which the need of an EIS has not been determined (§ 220.5). An EA may be prepared in any format useful to facilitate planning, decisionmaking, and <PRTPAGE P="91"/>public disclosure as long as the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section are met. The EA may incorporate by reference information that is reasonably available to the public.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">An EA must include the following:</E>
          </P>
          <P>(1) Need for the proposal. The EA must briefly describe the need for the project.</P>
          <P>(2) Proposed action and alternative(s). The EA shall briefly describe the proposed action and alternative(s) that meet the need for action. No specific number of alternatives is required or prescribed.</P>
          <P>(i) When there are no unresolved conflicts concerning alternative uses of available resources (NEPA, section 102(2)(E)), the EA need only analyze the proposed action and proceed without consideration of additional alternatives.</P>
          <P>(ii) The EA may document consideration of a no-action alternative through the effects analysis by contrasting the impacts of the proposed action and any alternative(s) with the current condition and expected future condition if the proposed action were not implemented.</P>
          <P>(iii) The description of the proposal and alternative(s) may include a brief description of modifications and incremental design features developed through the analysis process to develop the alternatives considered. The documentation of these incremental changes to a proposed action or alternatives may be incorporated by reference in accord with 40 CFR 1502.21.</P>
          <P>(iv) The proposed action and one or more alternatives to the proposed action may include adaptive management. An adaptive management proposal or alternative must clearly identify the adjustment(s) that may be made when monitoring during project implementation indicates that the action is not having its intended effect, or is causing unintended and undesirable effects. The EA must disclose not only the effect of the proposed action or alternative but also the effect of the adjustment. Such proposal or alternative must also describe the monitoring that would take place to inform the responsible official whether the action is having its intended effect.</P>
          <P>(3) Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action and Alternative(s). The EA:</P>
          <P>(i) Shall briefly provide sufficient evidence and analysis, including the environmental impacts of the proposed action and alternative(s), to determine whether to prepare either an EIS or a FONSI (40 CFR 1508.9);</P>
          <P>(ii) Shall disclose the environmental effects of any adaptive management adjustments;</P>
          <P>(iii) Shall describe the impacts of the proposed action and any alternatives in terms of context and intensity as described in the definition of “significantly” at 40 CFR 1508.27;</P>
          <P>(iv) May discuss the direct, indirect, and cumulative impact(s) of the proposed action and any alternatives together in a comparative description or describe the impacts of each alternative separately; and</P>
          <P>(v) May incorporate by reference data, inventories, other information and analyses.</P>
          <P>(4) Agencies and Persons Consulted.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Decision notice.</E> If an EA and FONSI have been prepared, the responsible official must document a decision to proceed with an action in a decision notice unless law or regulation requires another form of decision documentation (40 CFR 1508.13). A decision notice must document the conclusions drawn and the decision(s) made based on the supporting record, including the EA and FONSI. A decision notice must include:</P>
          <P>(1) A heading, which identifies the:</P>
          <P>(i) Title of document;</P>
          <P>(ii) Agency and administrative unit;</P>
          <P>(iii) Title of the project; and</P>
          <P>(iv) Location of the action, including county and State.</P>
          <P>(2) Decision and rationale;</P>
          <P>(3) Brief summary of public involvement;</P>
          <P>(4) A statement incorporating by reference the EA and FONSI if not combined with the decision notice;</P>
          <P>(5) Findings required by other laws and regulations applicable to the decision at the time of decision;</P>
          <P>(6) Expected implementation date;</P>

          <P>(7) Administrative review or appeal opportunities and, when such opportunities exist, a citation to the applicable regulations and directions on when <PRTPAGE P="92"/>and where to file a request for review or an appeal;</P>
          <P>(8) Contact information, including the name, address, and phone number of a contact person who can supply additional information; and</P>
          <P>(9) Responsible Official's signature, and the date the notice is signed.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Notification.</E> The responsible official shall notify interested and affected parties of the availability of the EA, FONSI and decision notice, as soon as practicable after the decision notice is signed.</P>

            <P>(a) Unless otherwise specified by the Chief, Forest Service, all grazing and livestock use on National Forest System lands and on other lands under Forest Service control must be authorized by a grazing or livestock use permit.</P>
            <P>(b) Grazing permits and livestock use permits convey no right, title, or interest held by the United States in any lands or resources.</P>
            <P>(c) The Chief, Forest Service, is authorized to issue permits for livestock grazing and other use by livestock of the National Forest System and on other lands under Forest Service control as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) Grazing permits with priority for renewal may be issued as follows: On National Forests in the 16 contiguous western States 10-year term permits will be issued unless the land is pending disposal, or will be devoted to other uses prior to the end of ten years, or it will be in the best interest of sound land management to specify a shorter term. On National Forest System lands other than National Forests in the 16 contiguous western States, the permit term shall be for periods of 10 years or less. Term grazing permits for periods of 10 years or less in the form of grazing agreements may be issued to cooperative grazing associations or similar organizations incorporated or otherwise established pursuant to State law. Such an agreement will make National Forest System lands and improvements available to the association for grazing in accordance with provisions of the grazing agreement and Forest Service policies. Term permits authorized in this paragraph may be in the form of private land or on-and-off grazing permits where the person is qualified to hold such permits under provisions the Chief may require. Permits issued under this paragraph are subject to the following:</P>
            <P>(i) Except as provided for by the Chief, Forest Service, paid term permits will be issued to persons who own livestock to be grazed and such base property as may be required, provided the land is determined to be available for grazing purposes by the Chief, Forest Service, and the capacity exists to graze specified numbers of animals.</P>
            <P>(ii) A term permit holder has first priority for receipt of a new permit at the end of the term period provided he has fully complied with the terms and conditions of the expiring permit.</P>
            <P>(iii) In order to update terms and conditions, term permits may be cancelled at the end of the calendar year of the midyear of the decade (1985, 1995, etc.), provided they are reissued to the existing permit holder for a new term of 10 years.</P>
            <P>(iv) New term permits may be issued to the purchaser of a permittee's permitted livestock and/or base property, provided the permittee waives his term permit to the United States and provided the purchaser is otherwise eligible and qualified.</P>
            <P>(v) If the permittee chooses to dispose of all or part of his base property or permitted livestock (not under approved nonuse) but does not choose to waive his term permit, the Forest Supervisor will give written notice that he no longer is qualified to hold a permit, provided he is given up to one year to reestablish his qualifications before cancellation action is final.</P>
            <P>(vi) The Chief, Forest Service, shall prescribe provisions and requirements under which term permits will be issued, renewed, and administered, including:</P>
            <P>(A) The amount and character of base property and livestock the permit holder shall be required to own.</P>

            <P>(i) Temporary grazing permits for periods not to exceed one year, and on a charge basis, may be issued:</P>
            <P>(A) To allow for use of range while a term grazing permit is held in suspension.</P>
            <P>(B) To use forage created by unusually favorable climatic conditions.</P>
            <P>(C) To use the forage available when the permit of the normal user's livestock is in nonuse status for reasons of personal convenience.</P>
            <P>(D) To allow a person to continue to graze livestock for the remainder of the grazing season where base property has been sold, the permit waived, and a new term permit issued.</P>
            <P>(E) To allow grazing use in the event of drought or other emergency of National or Regional scope where such use would not result in permanent resource damage.</P>

            <P>(a) Fees shall be charged for all livestock grazing or livestock use of National Forest system lands, or other lands under Forest Service control. An exception is livestock authorized free of charge under provisions of § 222.3(c)(2)(ii) (B) through (G).</P>
            <P>(b) Guiding establishment of fees are the law and general governmental policy as established by Bureau of the Budget (now, Office of Management and Budget) Circular A-25 of September 23, 1959, which directs that a fair market value be obtained for all services and resources provided the public through establishment of a system of reasonable fee charges, and that the users be afford equitable treatment. This policy precludes a monetary consideration in the fee structure for any permit value that may be capitalized into the permit holder's private ranching operation.</P>

            <P>(c) A grazing fee shall be charged for each head month of livestock grazing or use. A head month is a month's use and occupancy of range by one animal, except for sheep or goats. A full head month's fee is charged for a month of grazing by adult animals; if the grazing animal is weaned or 6 months of age or older at the time of entering National Forest System lands; or will become 12 months of age during the permitted period of use. For fee purposes 5 sheep or goats, weaned or adult, are equivalent <PRTPAGE P="102"/>to one cow, bull, steer, heifer, horse, or mule.</P>
            <P>(d) No additional charge will be made for the privilege of lambing upon National Forest System lands, or other lands under Forest Service control.</P>
            <P>(e) Transportation livestock may be charged for at a special rate, and at a minimum established for such use. Fees for horses, mules, or burros associated with management of permitted livestock on an allotment, or for research purposes and administrative studies, and authorized on a charge basis, are determined under provisions of paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
            <P>(f) The fees for trailing livestock across National Forest System lands will conform with the rates established for other livestock. Where practicable, fees for trailing permitted livestock will be covered in the regular grazing fee and the crossing period covered in the regular grazing period.</P>
            <P>(g) All fees for livestock grazing or livestock use of National Forest System lands or other lands under Forest Service control are payable in advance of the opening date of the grazing period, entry, or livestock use unless otherwise authorized by the Chief, Forest Service.</P>
            <P>(h) Unauthorized grazing use rate will be determined by establishing a base value without giving consideration for those contributions normally made by the permittee under terms of the grazing permit. The base will be adjusted annually by the same indexes used to adjust the regular fee. This rate will also apply to excess number of livestock grazing by permittees; to livestock grazed outside the permitted grazing season; or to livestock grazed under an unvalidated permit.</P>
            <P>(i) Refunds or credits may be allowed under justifiable conditions and circumstances as the Chief, Forest Service, may specify.</P>
            <P>(j) The fee year for the purpose of charging grazing fees will be March 1 through the following February.</P>
            <P>(k) The data year for the purpose of collecting beef cattle price data for computing indexes will be November 1 through the following October and apply to the following fee year.</P>

            <SUBJECT>National Forests in 16 Western States.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Grazing fees are established on lands designated National Forests and Land Utilization Projects in the 16 contiguous Western States of Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. (National Grasslands are excluded, see § 222.52.)</P>
            <P>(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of § 222.50, paragraph (b), the calculated grazing fee for 1988 and subsequent grazing fee years represents the economic value of the use of the land to the user and is the product of multiplying the base fair market value of $1.23 by the result of the annual Forage Value Index, added to the sum of the Beef Cattle Price Index minus the Prices Paid Index and divided by 100; provided, that the annual increase or decrease in such fee for any given year shall be limited to not more than plus or minus 25 percent of the previous year's fee, and provided further, that the fee shall not be less than $1.35 per head per month. The indexes used in this formula are as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) Forage Value Index means the weighted average estimate of the annual rental charge per head per month for pasturing cattle on private rangelands in the 11 Western States (Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming) (computed by the National Agricultural Statistics Service) from the June Enumerative Survey) divided by $3.65 per head month and multiplied by 100;</P>

            <P>(2) Beef Cattle Price Index means the weighted average annual selling price for beef cattle (excluding calves) in the 11 Western States (Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming) (computed by the National Agricultural Statistics Service) for November through October (computed by the National Agricultural <PRTPAGE P="103"/>Statistics Service) divided by $22.04 per hundred weight and multiplied by 100; and</P>

            <P>(3) Prices Paid Index means the following selected components from the National Agricultural Statistics Service “Annual National Index of Prices Paid by Farmers for Goods and Services” adjusted by the weights indicated in parentheses to reflect livestock production costs in the Western States:

            <SUBJECT>Grazing fees in the East—noncompetitive procedures.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Scope.</E> Except as provided in § 222.54 of this subpart, the fee charged for commercial livestock grazing use and occupancy on National Forest System (NFS) lands in the States of New York, Missouri, Vermont, West Virginia, and in the Southern Region shall be determined through noncompetitive, fair market value procedures. These rules do not apply to grazing fees on National Forest System lands in Oklahoma or National Grasslands in Texas. Grazing permits under the noncompetitive fee method in the East are subject to the rules governing grazing permit administration in Subpart A of this part.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> The rules of this section apply to the establishment of grazing fees for existing permittees in the Eastern and Southern Regions on National Forest System lands, including grazing associations in New York and Missouri as of March 1, 1990, to any livestock on-and-off permits defined in Subpart A of this part; and to any allotments advertised for competitive bidding which were not bid on (§ 222.54(h)). Noncompetitive permits vacated or terminated by an existing permittee and any new allotments created after the effective date of this rule shall be offered on a competitive bid basis as specified in § 222.54 of this subpart. As provided in subpart A of this part, holders of term permits have first priority for receipt of a new permit.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Fee System.</E> The grazing fee charged under this section shall be based on fair market value, as determined by: Using comparable private grazing lease rates, adjusted for the difference in the costs of grazing comparable private leased lands and National Forest System lands, or by reference to prevailing prices in competitive markets for other Federal or State leased grazing lands that are the same or substantially similar to grazing lands offered or administered by the Forest Service in the East with comparability adjustments as appropriate. Comparable grazing lease rates shall be adjusted for the difference between the total costs of operating on leased grazing lands and the total costs (other than grazing fee costs) of operating on National Forest System lands.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Establishing Base Grazing Value.</E> (i) The Chief of the Forest Service, or an authorized officer to whom such authority has been delegated, shall determine an estimated base market value of grazing use and occupancy on National Forest System lands in the Eastern States for the following designated subregions:</P>
            <P>(A) Corn Belt (Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, and Ohio);</P>
            <P>(B) Lake States (Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin);</P>
            <P>(C) Northeast (Maine, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, and Vermont);</P>
            <P>(D) Appalachia (Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia);</P>
            <P>(E) Southeast/Delta (Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Texas); and</P>
            <P>(F) Florida.<PRTPAGE P="104"/>
            </P>
            <P>(ii) The Chief or authorized officer shall revise or update estimated market values of grazing use and occupancy, as necessary to respond to significant changes in the agricultural economy in the East, and to ensure that fees represent fair market value.</P>
            <P>(iii) The Chief, or an authorized officer to whom authority has been delegated, where sufficient market data exist, may establish the base grazing value for grazing allotments using comparable, local lease rates for private grazing lands.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Annual Adjustment of Base Grazing Value.</E> To maintain currency with the private grazing lease market, the respective base grazing value(s) established for grazing permits under this section shall be annually adjusted through a hay price index, by respective subregion. The hay price index means the weighted average selling price of “other baled hay,” computed by the National Agricultural Statistics Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, by designated State and subregion. This index shall be based on 3-year average hay prices and annually reflect the percentage change in the cost of alternative livestock feed.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Computation of Annual Grazing Fee</E>—(i) <E T="03">Annual Fee Basis.</E> The annual grazing fee shall equal the base grazing value, adjusted by the current period's hay price index, less the value of any agency required range improvements.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Grazing Fee Credits for Range Improvements.</E> Any requirements for permittee construction or development of range improvements shall be identified through an agreement and incorporated into the grazing permit, with credits for such improvements to be allowed toward the annual grazing fee. Fee credits shall be allowed only for range improvements which the Forest Service requires an individual permittee to construct or develop on a specific allotment to meet the management direction and prescriptions in the relevant forest land and resource management plan and allotment management plan. These improvements must involve costs which the permittee would not ordinarily incur under the grazing permit, must be of tangible public benefit, and must enhance management of vegetation for resource protection, soil productivity, riparian, watershed, and wetland values, wildlife and fishery habitat, or outdoor recreation values. Maintenance of range improvements specified in allotment management planning documents or the grazing permit, and other costs incurred by the permittee in the ordinary course of permitted livestock grazing, do not qualify for grazing fee credits.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Implementation.</E> The grazing fee formula provided by this section shall be used to calculate fees for the 1990 grazing fee year. Where implementation would raise fees, the increase shall be phased in over a 5-year period. Full fair market value will be reached in 5 years, beginning in 1990.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">General Procedures</E>—(1) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> The rules of this section apply to grazing fees for any allotment established or vacated on National Forest System lands in the Eastern or Southern Regions, as of February 26, 1990 as well as to grazing fees for existing allotments for such lands that have already been established under competitive procedures as of the date of this rule. Permits offered for competitive bidding in the East are subject to the rules governing grazing permit administration in subpart A of this part. The rules of this section do not apply to negotiated livestock use permits or permits with on-and-off grazing provisions as authorized in subpart A of this part. Holders of term permits have first priority for receipt of a new term grazing permit in accordance with subpart A of this part. These rules also do not apply to grazing fees on National Forest System lands in Oklahoma or National Grasslands in Texas.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Allowable Bidders.</E> Bids for grazing permits shall be accepted from individuals, partnerships, grazing associations (formed after February 26, 1990), joint ventures, corporations, and organizations.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Establishment of Minimum Bid Price.</E> Authorized officers shall establish a minimum bid price for each available allotment as described in § 222.53 of this subpart.<PRTPAGE P="105"/>
            </P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Prospectus.</E> (1) At such time as allotments are vacated, as new allotments are established, or as existing competitively bid permits expire, the authorized officer shall prepare and advertise a prospectus for those allotments on which grazing will be permitted.</P>
            <P>(2) The prospectus shall include the terms and conditions of occupancy and use under the grazing permit to be issued, as well as document existing improvements and their condition. The prospectus shall also disclose the following:</P>
            <P>(i) Estimated market value of the forage per head month of grazing use;</P>
            <P>(ii) The minimum bid price the agency will accept;</P>
            <P>(iii) Any required range improvements; and</P>
            <P>(iv) The minimum qualifications that applicants must meet to be eligible for a permit.</P>
            <P>(3) Copies of the applicable grazing permit, allotment management planning documents and allotment maintenance requirements, and the latest annual permittee instructions shall be made available to all prospective bidders upon request.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Submission of bid.</E> Each applicant shall submit an application for the grazing permit, along with a sealed bid for the grazing fee, and a bid deposit of 10 percent of the total amount of the bid.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Qualifications and Deposit Refunds.</E> Upon opening applicants bids, the authorized officer shall determine whether each bidder meets the qualifications to hold a permit as set forth in Subpart A of this part; and shall refund the deposit to any applicant who is not qualified or who does not offer the high bid.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Permit Issuance.</E> The authorized officer shall issue the grazing permit to the qualified high bidder, except as provided in paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section. The successful bidder receives the privilege of obtaining or renewing a grazing permit and is billed for the occupancy offered and forage sold.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Priority for Reissuance.</E> On allotments where a current permit is expiring and competition has been held on a new grazing permit, the current grazing permittee shall have priority for retaining the permit. Accordingly, an applicant who holds the permit on the allotment under bid, who has a satisfactory record of performance under that permit, and who is not the higher bidder for the future grazing privileges in the specified allotment shall be offered the opportunity to match the high bid and thereby retain the permit. Should there be more than one existing permittee in the allotment under bid, each shall be offered the option of meeting the high bid; if only one current permittee opts to meet the high bid, the remaining allowable grazing use, if any, shall be awarded to the initial high bidder.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Identical Bids.</E> In cases of identical bids, the selection of the successful applicant shall be made through a drawing.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Computation of Successful Bidder's Annual Fee</E>—(1) <E T="03">Annual Fee Basis.</E> The highest bid received shall establish the base grazing value in the initial year of the grazing permit for each allotment offered. The annual grazing fee shall equal the base grazing value, adjusted by the current period's hay price index for the relevant subregion as described in § 222.53(c)(1), and (c)(3), less the value of any agency required range improvements. This hay price index shall be based on 3-year average hay prices and annually reflect the percent change in the cost of alternative livestock feed.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Grazing Fee Credits for Range Improvements.</E> Any requirements for permittee construction or development of range improvements shall be identified through an agreement and incorporated into the grazing permit, with credits for such improvements to be allowed toward the annual grazing fee. Fee credits shall be allowed only for range improvements which the Forest Service requires an individual permittee to construct or develop on a specific allotment to meet the management direction and prescriptions in the relevant forest land and resource management plan and allotment management plan. These improvements must involve costs which the permittee would not ordinarily incur under the grazing permit, must be of tangible <PRTPAGE P="106"/>public benefit, and must enhance management of vegetation for resource protection, soil productivity, riparian, watershed, and wetland values, wildlife and fishery habitat, or outdoor recreation values. Maintenance of range improvements specified in allotment management planning documents or the grazing permit, and other costs incurred by the permittee in the ordinary course of permitted livestock grazing, do not qualify for grazing fee credits.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">No Bids Received.</E> If qualified sealed bids are not received, the authorized officer reserves the right to conduct an oral auction using the minimum bid price established under paragraph (b) of this section or to establish grazing fees through noncompetitive grazing fee procedures specified in § 222.53 of this subpart.</P>

            <P>(a) The Chief, Forest Service, shall:</P>
            <P>(1) Administer wild free-roaming horses and burros and their progeny on the National Forest System in the areas where they now occur (wild horse and burro territory) to maintain a thriving ecological balance considering them an integral component of the multiple use resources, and regulating their population and accompanying need for forage and habitat in correlation with uses recognized under the Multiple-Use Sustained Yield Act of 1960 (70 Stat. 215; 16 U.S.C. 528-531);</P>
            <P>(2) Provide direct administration for the welfare of wild free-roaming horses and burros that are located on the National Forest System by use of the Forest Service organization rather than by the granting of leases and permits for maintenance of these animals to individuals and organizations;</P>
            <P>(3) Establish wild horse and burro territories in accordance with the Act and continue recognition of such territories where it is determined that horses and/or burros will be recognized as part of the natural system, and designate areas within these territories as a specific wild horse and burro range in those situations where he determines such designation as especially fitting to meet the purposes of the Act and the Multiple Use Sustained-Yield Act, after consultation with the appropriate State agencies where such range is proposed and with the National Advisory Board;</P>
            <P>(4) Analyze each wild horse or burro territory and, based on the analysis, develop and implement a management plan, which analysis and plans will be updated, whenever needed, as determined by conditions on each territory;</P>
            <P>(5) Maintain a current inventory of wild free-roaming horses and burros on each territory to determine whether and where excess animals exists;</P>

            <P>(a) Any person claiming ownership under State branding and estray laws of branded or unbranded horses or burros within a wild horse or burro territory or range on the National Forest System where such animals are not authorized must present evidence of ownership to justify a roundup before permission will be granted to gather such animals. Claims of ownership with supporting evidence were required to be filed during a claiming period which expired November 15, 1973. Unauthorized privately owned horses or burros entering the National Forest System after November 15, 1973, which become intermingled with wild horses or burros, may be claimed by filing an application with the District Ranger. All authorizations to gather claimed animals shall be in writing in accordance with instructions as the Chief, Forest Service, may prescribe. After such public notice as an authorized officer deems appropriate to inform interested parties, gathering operations may be authorized. The authorization shall provide that the gathering or roundup be consistent with regulations, and will (1) establish a specific reasonable period of time to allow the gathering of claimed animals and (2) stipulate other conditions, including visual observation by Forest Service personnel deemed necessary to ensure humane treatment of associated wild free-roaming horses and burros and to protect other resources involved.</P>
            <P>(b) Prior to removal of claimed animals which have been captured from the National Forest System, claimants shall substantiate their claim of ownership in accordance with whatever criteria are cooperatively agreed to between the Forest Service and the State agency administering the State estray laws. In the absence of an agreement, ownership claims shall be substantiated in accordance with State law and subject to approval of the Forest Service.</P>

Fixed-wing aircraft shall not be used in connection with capture operations except as support vehicles.</P>
            <P>(d) Motor vehicles may be used in the administration of the Act except that such vehicles shall not be used for driving or chasing wild horses or burros in capture operations. Motor vehicles may also be used for the purpose of transporting captured animals subject to the following humane procedures.</P>
            <P>(1) Such transportation shall comply with appropriate State and Federal laws and regulations applicable to humane transportation of horses and burros.</P>
            <P>(2) Vehicles shall be inspected by an authorized officer prior to use to ensure vehicles are in good repair and of adequate rate capacity.</P>
            <P>(3) Vehicles shall be carefully operated to ensure that captured animals are transported without undue risk or injury.</P>
            <P>(4) Where necessary and practical, animals shall be sorted as to age, temperament, sex, size, and condition so as to limit, to the extent possible, injury due to fighting and trampling.</P>
            <P>(5) The authorizing officer shall consider the condition of the animals, weather conditions, type of vehicle, and distance to be traveled when planning for transportation of captured animals.</P>
            <P>(6) Unless otherwise approved by the authorized officer, the transportation of wild free-roaming horses and burros shall be limited in sequence, to a maximum of 24 hours in transit followed by a minimum of 5 hours of on-the-ground rest with adequate feed and water.</P>

              </P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Lump sum timber sales</E> are premeasured sales where the entire value of the sale is paid in one payment at time of release for cutting.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Affiliate.</E> Concerns or individuals are affiliates if directly or indirectly, either one controls or has the power to control the other, or a third party controls or has the power to control both. In determining whether or not affiliation exists, the Forest Service shall consider all appropriate factors, including, but not limited to, common ownership, common management, and contractual relationships.</P>
              <P>(b) Timber sale contracts shall include provisions that require purchasers to make a downpayment in cash at the time a timber sale contract is executed, except that a downpayment is not required for stewardship contracts unless the contracting officer determines that a downpayment is needed to ensure the government's financial security.</P>
              <P>(c) The minimum downpayment shall be equivalent to 10 percent of the total advertised value of each sale, plus 20 percent of the bid premium, except in those geographic areas where the Chief of the Forest Service determines that it is necessary to increase the amount of the downpayment in order to deter speculation. The amount of the downpayment shall be redetermined when contract rates for timber are redetermined under the terms of the contract for environmental modification; catastrophic damage; market change; or an emergency rate redetermination. For the purpose of recalculating the minimum downpayment, total advertised value shall be replaced with total redetermined value.</P>
              <P>(d) A purchaser cannot apply the amount deposited as a downpayment to cover other obligations due on that sale until:</P>
              <P>(1) On scaled sales, stumpage value representing 25 percent of the total bid value of the sale has been charged and paid for, or the estimated value of unscaled timber is equal to or less than the amount of the downpayment; or</P>
              <P>(2) On tree measurement sales, stumpage value representing 25 percent of the total bid value of the sale is shown on the timber sale statement of account to have been cut, removed, and paid for, or the estimated value of timber remaining to be cut, removed and paid for as shown on the timber sale statement of account is equal to or less than the amount of the downpayment. On lump sum sales, the downpayment amount may be applied to payment for release of the single payment unit.</P>
              <P>(e) A purchaser or any affiliate of that purchaser awarded a Forest Service timber sale contract must meet the additional downpayment requirements of paragraph (g) of this section under the following circumstances:</P>
              <P>(1) The purchaser or its affiliate after September 29, 1988, has failed to perform in accordance with the terms of a Forest Service or Bureau of Land Management timber sale contract and is notified by a Contracting Officer that a contract has expired uncompleted or is terminated for cause; and</P>
              <P>(2) The estimated value of the unscaled timber on scaled sales, or the estimated value of the timber outstanding on tree measurement sales, included in those terminated or expired contracts exceeds $100,000; and</P>
              <P>(3) Unpaid damages claimed by the Government remain outstanding prior to award of the new sale at issue and corrective action has not been taken to avoid future deficient performance.</P>
              <P>(f) A subsequent final determination by the Contracting Officer or by a court of competent jurisdiction that a contract was improperly classified under the criteria in paragraph (e) of this section will result in the refund or credit of any unobligated portion of the amount of downpayment exceeding that required by paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section and the limitations of paragraph (h) of this section on application of downpayment shall no longer apply.</P>

              <P>(g) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, a purchaser meeting the criteria of paragraph (e) of this section must make a minimum downpayment equal to 20 percent of the total advertised value of that sale, plus 40 percent of the total bid premium. This higher downpayment requirement applies throughout the National Forest System, except in those areas where the Chief of the Forest Service determines, before advertisement of the sale, that another <PRTPAGE P="123"/>downpayment rate is necessary to achieve the management objectives of the National Forest System. The amount of the downpayment shall be redetermined in accordance with this paragraph when contract rates for timber are redetermined under the terms of the contract for environmental modification; catastrophic damage; market change; or an emergency rate redetermination. For the purpose of redetermining the downpayment, total advertised value shall be replaced with total redetermined value.</P>
              <P>(h) A purchaser subject to the additional downpayment requirements of paragraph (g) of this section cannot apply the amount deposited as a downpayment to other uses until:</P>
              <P>(1) On scaled sales, the estimated value of the unscaled timber is equal to or less than the amount of the downpayment; or</P>
              <P>(2) On tree measurement sales, the estimated value remaining to be cut and removed as shown on the timber sale statement of account is equal to or less than the amount of the downpayment.</P>
              <P>(i) For the purpose of releasing funds deposited as downpayment by a purchaser subject to paragraph (f) of this section, the Forest Service shall compute the estimated value of timber as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) On scaled sales, the estimated value of the unscaled timber is the sum of the products obtained by multiplying the current contract rate for each species by the difference between the advertised volume and the volume that has been scaled of that species.</P>

              <P>(2) On tree measurement sales, the estimated value of the timber outstanding (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> not shown on the timber sale statement of account as cut and removed) is the sum of the products obtained by multiplying the current contract rate for each species by the difference between the advertised volume and the volume that has been shown on the timber sale statement to have been cut and removed of the species. The current contract rate for each species is that specified in the Forest Service timber sale contract.</P>
              <P>(j) In order to deter speculation, the Chief of the Forest Service may increase the period for retention of the downpayment and/or preclude temporary reduction of the downpayment under paragraphs (k)(2) and (k)(3) of this section for future contracts subject to such criteria as the Chief may adopt after giving the public notice and opportunity to comment.</P>
              <P>(k) The Forest Service may temporarily reduce the downpayment when a purchaser's scheduled operations are delayed, interrupted, or extended for 30 or more consecutive days for any of the following reasons:</P>
              <P>(1) Forest Service requests or orders purchaser to delay or interrupt operations for reasons other than breach;</P>
              <P>(2) A contract term addition pursuant to purchaser shifting operations to a sale designated by the Forest Service as in urgent need of harvesting; or</P>
              <P>(3) An extension of the contract term authorized upon a determination of substantial overriding public interest, including a market-related contract term addition, or an urgent removal contract term extension under 36 CFR 223.53.</P>
              <P>(l) When purchaser is not cutting or removing timber under contract during a qualifying period of delay, interruption, or extension listed in paragraph (k) of this section, the downpayment may be reduced to $1000 or 2 percent of the downpayment amount stated in the contract, whichever is greater. The purchaser must restore the downpayment to the full amount stated in the contract within 15 days from receipt of the bill for collection and written notice from the contracting officer that the basis for temporarily reducing the downpayment no longer exists. Purchaser shall not cut or remove timber on a contract where the downpayment has been temporarily reduced until the downpayment amount stated in the contract is fully restored.</P>

              <P>(3) <E T="03">Normal operating season</E> is the period so specified in a timber sale contract.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Periodic payment(s)</E> is/are amount(s) specified in a timber sale contract that a purchaser must pay by the periodic payment determination date(s) unless reduced by amounts paid as stumpage for volume removed.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">A periodic payment determination date</E> is a date specified in a timber sale contract upon which the Forest Service will compare the payments made by the timber sale purchaser for timber charges (stumpage), exclusive of required deposits, with the periodic payment amount required as of that date in the contract.</P>
              <P>(b) Except for lump sum sales, each timber sale contract of more than one full normal operating season shall provide for periodic payments. The number of periodic payments required will be dependent upon the number of normal operating seasons within the contract, but shall not exceed two such payments during the course of the contract. Periodic payments must be made by the periodic payment determination date, except that the amount of the periodic payment shall be reduced to the extent that timber has been removed and paid for by the periodic payment determination date. Should the payment fall due on a date other than normal billing dates, the contract shall provide that the payment date will be extended to coincide with the next timber sale statement of account billing date.</P>
              <P>(1) At a minimum, each such contract shall require an initial periodic payment at the midpoint between the specified road completion date and the termination date. If there is no road construction requirement, payment shall be due at the midpoint between award date and the termination date.</P>
              <P>(2) Contracts exceeding 2 full operating seasons shall require an additional periodic payment to be due no later than the midpoint of the last normal operating season or 12 months from the initial periodic payment whichever date is first.</P>
              <P>(3) Notwithstanding this paragraph (b), periodic payments are not required for stewardship contracts unless the contracting officer determines that periodic payments are needed to ensure the Government's financial security.</P>
              <P>(c) Each timber sale contract shall require the initial periodic payment to equal 35 percent of the total contract value or 50 percent of the bid premium, whichever is greater. The amount of this periodic payment will be reduced if the payment would result in the purchaser's credit balance for timber charges exceeding the current contract value.</P>
              <P>(d) Where an additional periodic payment is required by the timber sale contract, this payment will equal 75 percent of the total contract value.

              <P>(2) The contract term addition provision of the contract must specify the index to be applied to each sale. The Forest Supervisor shall determine and select from paragraph (b) of this section, the index to be used for each sale based on the species and product characteristics, by volume, being harvested on the sale. The index specified shall represent more than one-half of the advertised volume. If none of the indices in paragraph (b) of this section represent more than one-half of the advertised volume, the index specified shall represent the species product combination representing the highest percentage of volume for which there is an index. When the Forest Supervisor determines that the species and potential product characteristics are such that more than one index could be used, the prospectus will state that the Contracting Officer may, upon the purchaser's written request, select an alternative index from paragraph (b) of this section, and may modify the contract by mutual agreement, at time of contract execution, to include an alternative index that the Contracting Officer has determined represents the highest percentage of products the purchaser intends to produce or have produced from the sale. Purchasers seeking a change of index at time of award must substantiate the need for an alternative index by providing the Contracting Officer with a written request that includes a list of products by volume the purchaser intends to produce or expects will be produced from the timber on that sale. In the event a mutual agreement to modify a contract to include an alternative index is not reached at time of contract execution, the index specified in the sample contract shall apply.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Urgent removal contract extensions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Finding.</E> There is substantial, overriding public interest in extending National Forest System timber sale contracts for undamaged (green) timber not requiring expeditious removal in order to facilitate the rapid harvest of catastrophically damaged timber requiring expeditious removal on private or other non-National Forest System lands. Such an extension may be granted when a specific catastrophic event beyond the control of the landowner occurs on non-National Forest System lands that poses a threat to general forest health, public safety, and property. Catastrophic events include, but are not limited to, severe wildfire, wind, floods, insects and disease infestation, and drought.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Regional Forester determination.</E> If the Regional Forester determines that adequate cause for urgent removal extensions exists, Contracting Officers may extend National Forest System timber sale contracts, up to a maximum of 1 year, for the estimated amount of time required to harvest and process the damaged timber on non-National Forest System lands. Contracting Officers may grant urgent removal extensions only when the Regional Forester verifies in writing that:</P>
              <P>(1) A specific catastrophe occurred for which urgent removal extensions should be granted;</P>
              <P>(2) The manufacturing facilities or logging equipment capacity available to purchasers are insufficient to provide for both the rapid harvest of damaged non-National Forest System timber in need of expeditious removal and the continued harvest of undamaged (green) timber under contract with the Forest Service; and</P>
              <P>(3) Failure to harvest the damaged non-National Forest System timber promptly could result in the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Pose a threat to public safety,</P>
              <P>(ii) Create a threat of an insect or disease epidemic to National Forest System or other lands or resources, or</P>
              <P>(iii) Significant private or other public resource loss.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Purchaser request.</E> To obtain an urgent removal extension on a National Forest System timber sale contract, a purchaser must make a written request to the Contracting Officer, which includes the following:</P>
              <P>(1) An explanation of why the harvest of undamaged (green) National Forest System timber within the term of the existing National Forest System contract(s) will prevent or otherwise impede the removal of damaged non-National Forest System timber in need of expeditious removal; and</P>
              <P>(2) Documentation that the manufacturing facilities or logging equipment capacity available to a purchaser would be insufficient to provide for both the rapid salvage of damaged non-National Forest System timber in need of expeditious removal and continued harvest of undamaged (green) National Forest System timber under contract with the Forest Service.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Contracting Officer determination.</E> To grant an urgent removal extension, the timber sale Contracting Officer must verify the following:</P>
              <P>(1) That it is likely that the undamaged (green) timber from National Forest System land would be delivered to the same manufacturing facilities as are needed to process the damaged non-National Forest System timber or the National Forest System timber sale contract would require the use of the same logging equipment as is needed to remove the damaged non-National Forest System timber from the area affected by the catastrophe;</P>
              <P>(2) That extension of the National Forest System contract will not be injurious to the United States and will protect, to the extent possible, the health of the National Forest System lands, including:</P>
              <P>(i) That urgent removal extension does not adversely affect other resource management objectives to be implemented by the National Forest System timber sale being extended; and</P>

              <P>(ii) That the National Forest System timber sale contract to be extended is not a sale containing damaged, dead, or dying timber subject to rapid deterioration.<PRTPAGE P="128"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) That the purchaser has not been granted a previous urgent removal extension on the same National Forest System timber sale contract based on the current catastrophic event. Subsequent urgent removal extensions may be granted if there are subsequent Regional Forester determinations on other catastrophic events.</P>
              <P>(4) That the revised National Forest System timber sale contract term will not exceed 10 years from the date the National Forest System contract was awarded; and</P>
              <P>(5) That the purchaser is not in breach of the National Forest System contract, and all work items, payments, and deposits are current.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Execution of contract extension.</E> An urgent removal extension of a National Forest System timber sale contract is executed through a mutual agreement contract modification pursuant to § 223.112, which must include specific contract provisions. An agreement to modify a contract must identify the specific provision(s) of the contract being modified and must include the requirement that purchasers make cash payment to cover the costs of remarking timber on the sale area or reestablishing cutting unit boundaries if the Contracting Officer determines such work is necessary.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Information collection.</E> The information required of a purchaser to request an extension of an National Forest System timber sale contract, as outlined in paragraph (c) of this section, to facilitate expeditious removal of timber from non-National Forest System lands constitutes an information collection requirement as defined in 5 CFR Part 1320 and has been assigned Office of Management and Budget control number 0596-0167.</P>

Fair market value is estimated by such methods as are authorized by the Chief, Forest Service, through issuance of agency directives (36 CFR 200.4). Valid methods to determine fair market value include, but are not limited to, transaction evidence appraisals, analytical appraisals, comparison appraisals, and independent estimates based on average investments. Pertinent factors affecting market value also considered include, but are not limited to, prices paid and valuations established for comparable timber, selling value of products produced, estimated operating costs, operating difficulties, and quality of timber. Considerations and valuations may recognize and adjust for factors which are not normal market influences.</P>

              <P>The Chief, Forest Service, shall establish minimum stumpage rates, i.e., “base rates,” for species and products on individual National Forests, or groups of National Forests. Timber shall be sold for appraised value or minimum stumpage rates, whichever is higher. No timber may be sold or cut under timber sale contracts for less than minimum stumpage rates except to provide for the removal of insect-infested, diseased, dead or distressed timber or in accordance with contract provisions specifically providing for catastrophically-affected timber and incidental amounts of material not meeting utilization standards of the timber sale contract. For any timber sale offering where deposits are to be required for reforestation under the Act of June 9, 1930, as amended (46 Stat. 527; 16 U.S.C. 576-576b) which exceed the value of the established minimum stumpage rates, the minimum rates may be increased by the approving officer as necessary to the amount of such required reforestation deposits and a minimum deposit to the Treasury. Minimum rates in timber sale contracts will not be set higher than established minimum rates for purposes other than assuring adequate funds for reforestation.</P>

When timber is appraised and sold on such basis, <E T="03">purchaser credit</E> for road construction, not to exceed the estimated construction cost of such roads or other developments specified in the timber sale contract, shall, when such construction is accomplished by purchaser, be deducted from stumpage payments made by or due from purchaser under the timber sale contract for other than minimum stumpage rates and required deposits for slash disposal and road maintenance. As used in this section <E T="03">estimated construction costs</E> means the total cost of constructing all permanent roads specified in the timber sale contract, estimated as if construction is to be accomplished by an independent contractor who is not the timber purchaser. In determining the purchaser credit amount applicable against timber payments, the estimated construction cost may be reduced for the effect of differences in applicable wage rates.</P>

              <P>(a) Forest officers may sell, within their authorization, without further advertisement, at not less than appraised value, any timber previously advertised for competitive bids but not sold because of lack of bids and any timber on uncut areas included in a contract which has been terminated by abandonment, cancellation, contract period expiration, or otherwise if such timber would have been cut under the contract. This authority shall not be utilized if there is evidence of competitive interest in the product.</P>
              <P>(b) Extraordinary conditions, as provided for in 16 U.S.C. 472a(d), are defined to include the potential harm to natural resources, including fish and wildlife, and related circumstances arising as a result of the award or release of timber sale contracts pursuant to section 2001(k) of Public Law 104-19 (109 Stat. 246). Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section or any other regulation in this part, for timber sale contracts that have been or will be awarded or released pursuant to section 2001(k) of Public Law 104-19 (109 Stat. 246), the Secretary of Agriculture may allow forest officers to, without advertisement, modify those timber sale contracts by substituting timber from outside the sale area specified in the contract for timber within the timber sale contract area.</P>

              <P>(c) Extraordinary conditions, as provided for in 16 U.S.C. 472a(d), includes those conditions under which contracts for the sale or exchange of timber or other forest products must be suspended, modified, or terminated under the terms of such contracts to prevent environmental degradation or resource damage, or as the result of administrative appeals, litigation, or court orders. <PRTPAGE P="132"/>Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section or any other regulation in this part, when such extraordinary conditions exist on sales not addressed in paragraph (b) of this section, the Secretary of Agriculture may allow forest officers to, without advertisement, modify those contracts by substituting timber or other forest products from outside the contract area specified in the contract for timber or forest products within the area specified in the contract. When such extraordinary conditions exist, the Forest Service and the purchaser shall make good faith efforts to identify replacement timber or forest products of similar volume, quality, value, access, and topography. When replacement timber or forest products agreeable to both parties is identified, the contract will be modified to reflect the changes associated with the substitution, including a rate redetermination. Concurrently, both parties will sign an agreement waiving any future claims for damages associated with the deleted timber or forest products, except those specifically provided for under the contract up to the time of the modification. If the Forest Service and the purchaser cannot reach agreement on satisfactory replacement timber or forest products, or the proper value of such material, either party may opt to end the search. Replacement timber or forest products must come from the same National Forest as the original contract. The term National Forest in this paragraph refers to an administrative unit headed by a single Forest Supervisor. Only timber or forest products for which a decision authorizing its harvest has been made and for which any applicable appeals or objection process has been completed may be considered for replacement pursuant to this paragraph. The value of replacement timber or forest products may not exceed the value of the material it is replacing by more than $10,000, as determined by standard Forest Service appraisal methods.</P>

In the absence of information clearly indicating that the prospective purchaser is responsible, the Contracting Officer shall conclude that the prospective purchaser does not qualify as a responsible purchaser.</P>
              <P>(b) To determine a purchaser to be responsible, a Contracting Officer must find that:</P>
              <P>(1) The purchaser has adequate financial resources to perform the contract or the ability to obtain them;</P>
              <P>(2) The purchaser is able to perform the contract within the contract term taking into consideration all existing commercial and governmental business commitments;</P>

A prospective purchaser that is or recently has been seriously deficient in contract performance shall be presumed not to be responsible, unless the Contracting Officer determines that the circumstances were beyond the purchaser's control and were not created through improper actions by the purchaser or affiliate, or that the purchaser has taken appropriate corrective action. Past failure to apply sufficient tenacity and perseverance to perform acceptably under a contract is strong evidence that a purchaser is not a responsible contractor. The Contracting Officer shall consider the number of contracts involved and extent of deficiency of each in making this evaluation;</P>
              <P>(4) The purchaser has a satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics;</P>
              <P>(5) The purchaser has or is able to obtain equipment and supplies suitable for logging the timber and for meeting the resource protection provisions of the contract;</P>
              <P>(6) The purchaser is otherwise qualified and eligible to receive an award under applicable laws and regulations.</P>
              <P>(c) If the prospective purchaser is a small business concern and the Contracting Officer determines that the purchaser does not qualify as a responsible purchaser on an otherwise acceptable bid, the Contracting Officer shall refer the matter to the Small Business Administration which will decide whether or not to issue a Certificate of Competency.</P>
              <P>(d) Affiliated concerns, as defined in § 223.49(a)(5) of this subpart are normally considered separate entities in determining whether the concern that is to perform the contract meets the applicable standards for responsibility. However, the Contracting Officer shall consider an affiliate's past performance and integrity when they may adversely affect the prospective purchaser's responsibility.</P>

              <P>With respect to sustained yield units established pursuant to the provisions of the Act of March 29, 1944 (58 Stat. 132; 16 U.S.C. 583-583l), the Chief, Forest Service, with authority to delegate to other officers and employees of the Forest Service:</P>
              <P>(a) Shall provide that National Forest timber in any sustained yield unit shall be available in sufficient amounts to meet the needs of bona fide farmers, settlers, miners, residents and prospectors for minerals for personal and domestic use as provided by law and by regulation.</P>
              <P>(b) May offer for sale to cooperators, without competition but at not less than appraised value, timber on National Forest lands within an approved cooperative sustained yield unit; or, if the approved sustained yield unit consists entirely of federally owned or administered forest land and if necessary for the maintenance of a stable community or communities, may offer National Forest timber for sale to responsible operators within such community or communities, at not less than appraised value but without competition or with competition restricted to responsible operators who will manufacture the timber to at least a stated degree within the community or communities to be maintained. Each such sale which involves more than $500 in stumpage value may be made only after notice has been given in advance by such means as may be deemed effective in informing the public of the proposed action, including in any event, publication, once weekly for four consecutive weeks and with additional insertions if needed, in one or more newspapers of general circulation in the vicinity of the place where the timber is located, of a notice of the proposed sale stating at least:</P>
              <P>(1) The location, estimated quantity and appraised value of the timber to be cut;</P>
              <P>(2) The name and address of the proposed purchaser or those of the operators among whom bidding is to be restricted;</P>

              <P>(4) The title and address of the officer of the Forest Service to whom any request for such hearing should be made.</P>

              <FP>Such requests need be considered only if received at the place designated in the notice not later than 15 days after the first publication of such notice. If a public advisory hearing is to be held, notice of it shall be published in the same newspaper or newspapers as the original notice, stating the place where it will be held and the time, which shall not be earlier than 10 days after the first publication of the said notice of hearing, and shall appear once each week, but not for more than four successive weeks in any event, until the date set for the hearing. Any such hearing shall be conducted by the Chief or by any officer designated by him as his representative, except that if the amount of the proposed sale is not in excess of that which the Regional Forester has been authorized to sell without prior approval of the Chief the hearing may be held by the Regional Forester concerned or by his representative and decision may be by the Regional Forester. At any such hearing, opportunity shall be given to those having a reasonable interest to make oral statements or to file written statements discussing the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed sale; and the officer holding the hearing <PRTPAGE P="138"/>may, in his discretion, permit the filing of such statements within a reasonable period after the close of the hearing to become part of the record for consideration before a decision is made.</FP>
              <P>(c) Shall keep available for public inspection,</P>
              <P>(1) During the life of any sustained yield unit, the minutes or other record of the hearing held on the establishment thereof, and the determination of action taken following the hearing including any modification of the proposals as submitted at the hearing; and</P>

Such records of any case may be kept in any office of the Forest Service designated by the Chief as being suitable and convenient of access for probably interested persons.</P>
              <P>(d) Shall make provision, in any contract for the purchase of timber without competition or with restricted competition, if that contract is of more than 7 years' duration and in his discretion in any case of shorter duration, for the redetermination of rates for stumpage and for required deposits to be paid by the purchasers, such redetermination to be effective at intervals or dates stated in the contract; but the sum of such redetermined rates for stumpage and sale area betterment shall not be less than the base rates in the published notice of the proposed sale.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Appeal process for small business timber sale set-aside program share recomputation decisions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Decisions subject to appeal.</E> The rules of this section govern appeal of recomputation decisions related to structural, special, or market changes or the scheduled 5-year recomputations of the small business share of National Forest System timber sales. Certain decisions related to recomputation of shares, such as structural change and carryover volume, may require two decisions, one to determine that a recomputation is needed and the other to recompute the shares. Decisions made both at the earlier stage as well as the later stage are appealable.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Manner of giving notice</E>—(1) <E T="03">Predecisional notice and comment.</E> The Responsible Official shall provide qualifying timber sale purchasers, as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, 30 days for predecisional review and comment on any draft decision to reallocate shares, including the data used in making the proposed recomputation decision.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Notice of decision.</E> Upon close of the 30-day predecisional review period, the Responsible Official shall consider any comments received. Within 15 days of the end of the comment period, the Responsible Official shall make a decision on the small business shares and shall give prompt written notice to all parties on the national forest timber sale bidders list for the affected area. The notice of decision must identify the name of the Appeal Deciding Officer, the address, the date by which an appeal must be filed, and a source for obtaining the appeal procedures information.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Who may appeal or file written comments as an interested party.</E> (1) Only timber sale purchasers, or their representatives, who are affected by recomputations of the small business share of timber sales as described in paragraph (a) of this section and who have submitted predecisional comments pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, may appeal recomputation decisions under this section or may file written comments as an interested party.</P>

              <P>(2) Interested parties are defined as the Small Business Administration and those timber sale purchasers, or their representatives, who are affected by recomputations of the small business share of timber sales as described in paragraph (a) of this section and who <PRTPAGE P="139"/>have individually, or through an association to which they belong, submitted predecisional comments pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) A timber sale purchaser may submit comments on an appeal as an interested party if an association to which the purchaser belongs filed predecisional comment but later decides not to appeal or not to file comments as an interested party.</P>
              <P>(ii) A timber sale purchaser, who is a member of an association that appeals a decision, may not file a separate appeal unless that purchaser filed separate predecisional comment under paragraph (b)(1).</P>
              <P>(3) Interested parties who submit written comments on an appeal filed by another party may not continue an appeal if the appellant withdraws the appeal.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Level of appeal.</E> Only one level of review is available for appeal of decisions pertaining to recomputations under the Small Business Timber Sale Set-aside Program. The Appeal Deciding Officer is the official one level above the level of the Responsible Official who made the recomputation of shares decision. The Responsible Official is normally the Forest Supervisor; thus, the Appeal Deciding Officer is normally the Regional Forester. However, when the Regional Forester makes recomputation decisions, the Appeal Deciding Officer is the Chief or such officer at the National headquarters level as the Chief may designate.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Filing procedures.</E> In order to file an appeal under this section, an appellant must file a notice of appeal, as specified in the notice of decision, with the Appeal Deciding Officer within 20 days of the date on the notice of the decision. This date must be specified in the notice of decision given pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Written comments filed by an interested party in response to an appeal must be filed within 15 days after the close of the appeal filing period.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Content of notice of appeal.</E> (1) It is the responsibility of the appellant to provide sufficient narrative evidence and argument to show why a recomputation decision by the Responsible Official should be reversed or changed.</P>
              <P>(2) An appellant must include the following information in a notice of appeal:</P>
              <P>(i) The appellant's name, mailing address, and daytime telephone number;</P>
              <P>(ii) The title or type of recomputation decision involved, the date of the decision, and the name of the Responsible Official;</P>
              <P>(iii) A brief description and date of the decision being appealed:</P>
              <P>(iv) A statement of how the appellant is adversely affected by the decision being appealed;</P>
              <P>(v) A statement of the facts in dispute regarding the issue(s) raised by the appeal;</P>
              <P>(vi) If relevant, any specific references to any law, regulation, or policy that the appellant believes to have been violated and the basis for such an allegation;</P>
              <P>(vii) A statement as to whether and how the appellant has tried to resolve with the Responsible Official the issue(s) being appealed, including evidence of submission of written comments at the predecisional stage as provided by paragraph (a) of this section, the date of any discussion, and the outcome of that meeting or contact; and</P>
              <P>(viii) A statement of the relief the appellant seeks.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Time periods and timeliness.</E> (1) All time periods applicable to this section will begin on the first day following a decision or action related to the appeal.</P>
              <P>(2) Time periods applicable to this section are computed using calendar days. Saturdays, Sundays, or Federal holidays are included in computing the time allowed for filing an appeal; however, when the filing period would expire on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the filing time is automatically extended to the end of the next Federal working day.</P>

              <P>(3) It is the responsibility of those filing an appeal to file the notice of appeal by the end of the filing period. In the event of questions, legible postmarks on a mailed appeal or the time and date imprint on a facsimile appeal will be considered evidence of timely filing. Where postmarks or facsimile <PRTPAGE P="140"/>imprints are illegible, the Appeal Deciding Officer shall rule on the timeliness of the notice of appeal.</P>
              <P>(4) The time period for filing a notice of appeal is not extendable.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Dismissal without decision.</E> The Appeal Deciding Officer shall dismiss an appeal and close the record without a decision in any of the following circumstances:</P>
              <P>(1) The appellant is not on the timber sale bidders list for the area affected by the recomputation decision;</P>
              <P>(2) The appellant's notice of appeal is not filed within the required time period;</P>
              <P>(3) The appellant's notice of appeal does not contain responses required by paragraphs (f)(2)(i) through (f)(2)(viii) of this section; or</P>
              <P>(4) The appellant did not submit written comments on the proposed decision of the new recomputed shares as described in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Appeal record.</E> The appeal record consists of the written decision being appealed, any predecisional comments received, any written comments submitted by interested parties, any other supporting data used to make the decision, the notice of appeal, and, if prepared, a responsive statement by the Responsible Official which addresses the issues raised in the notice of appeal. The Responsible Official must forward the record to the Appeal Deciding Officer within 7 days of the date the notice of appeal is received. A copy of the appeal record must be sent to the appellant at the same time.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Appeal decision</E>—(1) <E T="03">Responsive statement for appeal decision.</E> The Appeal Deciding Officer may request the Responsible Official to prepare a responsive statement. However, if the information in the files clearly demonstrates the rationale for the Responsible Official's decision, then a responsive statement addressing the points of the appeal is not necessary.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Appeal issue clarification.</E> For clarification of issues raised in the appeal, the Appeal Deciding Officer may request additional information from either the Responsible Official, the appellant, or an interested party who has submitted comments on the appeal. At the discretion of the Appeal Deciding Officer, an appellant or interested party may be invited to discuss data relevant to the appeal. Information provided to clarify issues or facts in the appeal must be based upon information previously documented in the file or appeal. Any information provided as a result of the Appeal Deciding Officer's request for more information must be made available to all parties, that is, to the Responsible Official, the appellant, and interested parties who have submitted comments on the appeal. All parties will have 5 days after the Appeal Deciding Officer receives the additional information to review and comment on the information, and the appeal decision period will be extended 5 additional days.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Issuance of final decision.</E> The Appeal Deciding Officer shall review the decision and appeal record and issue a written appeal decision to the parties within 30 days of the close of the appeal period except that this period must be extended to 35 days when additional information is requested by the Appeal Deciding Officer. The Appeal Officer may affirm or reverse the Responsible Official's decision, in whole or in part. There is no extension of the time period for rendering an appeal decision.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Implementation of decisions during pendency of appeal.</E> Recomputation of shares arising from a scheduled 5-year recomputation are effective on April 1 following the end of the 5-year period being considered. If an appeal that may affect the shares for the next 5-year period is not resolved by the April 1 date, the share decision announced by the Responsible Official must be implemented. If an appeal decision results in a change in the shares, the revised total share of the Small Business Timber Sale Set-aside Program must be accomplished during the remaining portion of the 5-year period.</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Timber sale set-aside policy changes.</E> Timber purchasers shall receive an opportunity, in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations, to review and comment on significant changes in the Small Business Timber Sale Set-aside Program or policy prior to adoption and implementation.</P>
              <P>(m) <E T="03">Information collection requirements.</E> The provisions of paragraph (f) of this section specify the information <PRTPAGE P="141"/>that appellants must provide when appealing decisions pertaining to recomputation of shares. As such, these rules contain information requirements as defined in 5 CFR Part 1320. These information requirements have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget and assigned control number 0596-0141.</P>

            <P>(a) The Forest Service shall solicit and consider timber sale bids from and award contracts only to responsible business concerns and individuals. Debarment and suspension by the Forest Service are discretionary actions that, taken in accordance with these regulations, are appropriate means to effectuate this policy.</P>

In assessing the adequacy of the evidence, consideration shall be given to how much information is available, how credible it is given the circumstances, whether or not important allegations are corroborated and what inferences can reasonably be drawn as a result. This assessment shall include an examination of basic documents such as contracts, bids, awards, inspection reports, and correspondence, as appropriate.</P>

An <E T="03">export yard or pond</E> is an area where sorting and/or bundling of logs for shipment outside the United States is accomplished. Unprocessed timber, whether from National Forest System or private lands, is exported directly when exported by the National Forest timber purchaser. Timber is exported indirectly when export occurs as a result of a sale to another person or as a consequence of any subsequent transaction.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Historic level</E> means the average annual volume of unprocessed timber purchased or exported in calendar years 1971, 1972, and 1973.</P>

            <P>(h) <E T="03">Person</E> means an individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity and includes any subsidiary, subcontractor, parent company, or other affiliate. Business entities are considered affiliates for the entire calendar year when one controls or has the power to control the other or when both are controlled directly or indirectly by a third person during any part of the calendar year.</P>

            <P>(a) Subject to the restrictions described in § 223.189 of this subpart and, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a person who owns or operates a manufacturing facility and who exports unprocessed timber originating from private lands may apply for a sourcing area in accordance with <PRTPAGE P="160"/>the procedures of this section. However, an owner/operator of a manufacturing facility who exports unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands may not possess or acquire unprocessed timber originating from Federal lands unless the acquisition is within an approved sourcing area. A person who intends to acquire or become affiliated with a manufacturing facility that processes Federal timber and who is an exporter may apply for a sourcing area. Written proof of the intent to acquire or affiliate must be included in the sourcing area application, signed by the applicant and the person or, in the case of a corporation, the Chief Executive Officer, whose company the applicant intends to acquire or affiliate with. This certification must be on letterhead and must be notarized. A sourcing area application that the Secretary determines would be approved will be granted tentative approval pending final notification by the applicant of acquisition of or affiliation with the manufacturing facility. The tentative approval of the sourcing area will lapse unless the acquisition or affiliation occurs within 30 days of the tentative approval of the sourcing area. A sourcing area is not valid until final approval of the sourcing area. The direct substitution prohibition did not apply to a person who applied for a sourcing area on or before December 20, 1990. A request for modification of an existing sourcing area shall trigger a review pursuant to the procedures and restrictions in § 223.191(e).</P>
            <P>(b) As provided in the Act, a person who has requested an exemption or waiver of the prohibition against export within the preceding 24-month period, pursuant to § 223.189 of this subpart, must have applied for the desired sourcing area on or before December 20, 1990.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Applications.</E> Sourcing area applications shall include:</P>
            <P>(1) A map of sufficient scale and detail to clearly show:</P>

            <P>(ii) The location of the timber manufacturing facilities owned or operated by the applicant within the proposed sourcing area where the person intends to process timber originating from Federal land;</P>
            <P>(iii) The location of private lands within and outside the desired sourcing area where the person has, within the 24 months immediately preceding the date of the application, acquired unprocessed timber originating from private land which was exported, sold, traded, exchanged, or otherwise conveyed to another person for the purpose of exporting such timber;</P>
            <P>(2) A list of other persons with timber manufacturing facilities located within the same general vicinity as the applicant's facilities;</P>
            <P>(3) Any other information the applicant may believe is appropriate to support approval of the requested sourcing area; and</P>

            <P>(4) A statement signed by the person certifying under the penalties provided in Section 492 of this Act (16 U.S.C. 620d) and the False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001) that the information provided in support of the application is true, complete, and accurate to the best of the applicant's knowledge.

            <P>(1) The Administrative Law Judge, or, on appeal, the Judicial Officer must find that the proposed sourcing area is geographically and economically separate from any area that the applicant harvests or expects to harvest for export any unprocessed timber originating from private lands. In making such a finding, the Administrative Law Judge, or, on appeal, the Judicial Officer shall consider the timber purchasing patterns of the applicant on private and Federal lands equally with those of other persons in the same local vicinity and the relative similarity of such purchasing patterns.</P>
            <P>(2) The “same local vicinity” will normally be manufacturing facilities located within 30 miles of the community where the applicant's manufacturing facility is located, but may include more distant communities if manufacturing facilities in those communities depend on the same source of timber and have similar purchasing patterns.</P>
            <P>(3) The relative similarity of purchasing patterns of other mills shall be determined by considering the location and similarity of unprocessed timber being acquired by those facilities.</P>
            <P>(4) Lines defining the geographic area shall be based on major natural and cultural features, including, but not limited to, prominent ridge systems, main roads or highways, rivers, political subdivisions, and not characterized by random lines.</P>

            <P>Unprocessed timber from National Forest System lands in Alaska may not be exported from the United States or shipped to other States without prior approval of the Regional Forester. This requirement is necessary to ensure the development and continued existence of adequate wood processing capacity in Alaska for the sustained utilization of timber from the National Forests which are geographically isolated from other processing facilities. In determining whether consent will be given for the export of timber, consideration will be given to, among other things, whether such export will:</P>
            <P>(a) Permit more complete utilization on areas being logged primarily for local manufacture,</P>
            <P>(b) Prevent loss or serious deterioration of logs unsalable locally because of an unforeseen loss of market,</P>
            <P>(c) Permit the salvage of timber damaged by wind, insects, fire or other catastrophe,</P>
            <P>(d) Bring into use a minor species of little importance to local industrial development, or</P>
            <P>(e) Provide material required to meet urgent and unusual needs of the Nation. (16 U.S.C. 472a; 16 U.S.C. 551; 16 U.S.C. 616)</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Sustainable harvest levels.</E> Prior to offering a special forest product for sale or free use, the responsible forest officer must determine the product's sustainable harvest level. A special forest product's sustainable harvest level is the total quantity of the product that can be harvested annually in perpetuity on a sustained yield basis. Responsible forest officers shall not authorize harvest or free use of special forest products in an amount exceeding known sustainable harvest levels. In determining a sustainable harvest level, the responsible forest officer may consider harvest levels of the product for the previous three years, if such information is available. Responsible forest officers may consider factors such as year-to-year and site-to-site variability, climate, weather change, geographic scale, and scientific data available prior to making their sustainability determination and establishing monitoring time frames consistent with paragraph (c) of this section. Responsible forest officers will consult with Tribes, to the extent appropriate, to determine sustainable harvest levels based on historical information. In addition, responsible forest officers may consult with other appropriate parties to determine sustainable harvest levels based on historical information.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Harvest of protected species.</E> The sale or free use of special forest products listed or proposed for listing as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act is prohibited, except as authorized by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Moreover, regional guidelines will identify when the sale or free use of any special forest product listed on the Regional Forester's sensitive plant list, species of concern list, species of interest list, or protected under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species may be authorized.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Monitoring of established harvest levels.</E> At least once every three fiscal years, or as otherwise established by the Regional Forester, the Forest Service shall monitor the effects of harvesting on the sustainability of special forest products. Such monitoring may include, but is not limited to, on-site examination of the product, including both harvested and non-harvested areas, and a review of past and projected harvest levels to the extent such information is available.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Revision of harvest levels.</E> The sustainable harvest level for a special forest product may be increased or decreased, as appropriate, based on monitoring.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Determination of responsibility.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A Contracting Officer shall not award a contract, permit, or other instrument authorizing the sale of special forest products to a declared high bidder unless that officer makes an affirmative determination that the person is responsible. In the absence of information clearly establishing that the declared high bidder is responsible, the Contracting Officer shall conclude that the declared high bidder is not responsible.</P>
              <P>(b) In order to make an affirmative determination of responsibility, the Contracting Officer must find that:</P>
              <P>(1) The declared high bidder has adequate financial resources to perform the contract, permit, or other authorizing instrument, or the ability to obtain such resources;</P>
              <P>(2) The declared high bidder is able to complete the contract, permit, or other authorizing instrument within the relevant term, taking into consideration the declared high bidder's other existing commercial and governmental obligations;</P>
              <P>(3) The declared high bidder has a satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics;</P>
              <P>(4) The declared high bidder has or is able to obtain equipment and supplies suitable for harvesting the special forest product(s) and for meeting applicable resource protection requirements;</P>
              <P>(5) The declared high bidder is otherwise qualified and eligible to receive an award of a contract, permit, or other authorizing instrument under all applicable laws and regulations;</P>
              <P>(6) The declared high bidder has a satisfactory performance record on contracts, permits, and other agreements with the U.S. Government. Failure to apply sufficient diligence and perseverance to perform a contract, permit, or other instrument is strong evidence that a declared high bidder is not responsible. A declared high bidder that is, or has been deficient in performance shall be deemed not responsible, unless the declared high bidder demonstrates that the deficiency arose from circumstances beyond their reasonable control.</P>
              <P>(c) Affiliated concerns, as defined in 36 CFR 223.49(a)(5), are normally considered separate entities in determining whether the declared high bidder that is to perform the contract meets the applicable standards for responsibility. However, the responsible Forest Officer shall consider an affiliate's past performance and integrity when they may adversely affect the responsibility of the declared high bidder.</P>

This section provides for the use of contracts and agreements to achieve land management goals for the national forests and the public lands that meet local and rural community needs. In the fulfillment of these activities, the Forest Service may apply the value of timber or other forest products removed from the project site as an offset against the cost of services received under such contracts or agreements.</P>
            <P>(b)(1) <E T="03">Procurement of service contracts.</E> If the Forest Service makes a determination as provided under section 223.301(b)(1) of this subpart that a stewardship contract is a contract for the procurement of services, the Forest Service will utilize the contracting procedures set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulations, Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations including the regulations issued by the Department of Agriculture set forth in Chapter 4 of Title 48 as well as requirements included in § 223.303.</P>

            <P>(2) <E T="03">Sale of property contracts.</E> When the value of timber or other forest products removed through the contract is equal to or exceeds the total value of the service work items received by the Forest Service, the activity shall be considered a sale of property and a contract, for a period not to exceed 10 years, will be utilized as provided in § 223.304.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Best interest of the government determination.</E> The Forest Service official who makes a determination under paragraph (b) of this section shall document in the contract file the basis for the determination that:</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 228.4</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Plan of operations—notice of intent—requirements.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a notice of intent to operate is required from any person proposing to conduct operations which might cause significant disturbance of surface resources. Such notice of intent to operate shall be submitted to the District Ranger having jurisdiction over the area in which the operations will be conducted. Each notice of intent to operate shall provide information sufficient to identify the area involved, the nature of the proposed operations, the route of access to the area of operations, and the method of transport.</P>
            <P>(1) A notice of intent to operate is not required for:</P>
            <P>(i) Operations which will be limited to the use of vehicles on existing public roads or roads used and maintained for National Forest System purposes;</P>
            <P>(ii) Prospecting and sampling which will not cause significant surface resource disturbance and will not involve removal of more than a reasonable amount of mineral deposit for analysis and study which generally might include searching for and occasionally removing small mineral samples or specimens, gold panning, metal detecting, non-motorized hand sluicing, using battery operated dry washers, and collecting of mineral specimens using hand tools;</P>
            <P>(iii) Marking and monumenting a mining claim;</P>
            <P>(iv) Underground operations which will not cause significant surface resource disturbance;</P>
            <P>(v) Operations, which in their totality, will not cause surface resource disturbance which is substantially different than that caused by other users of the National Forest System who are not required to obtain a Forest Service special use authorization, contract, or other written authorization;</P>
            <P>(vi) Operations which will not involve the use of mechanized earthmoving equipment, such as bulldozers or backhoes, or the cutting of trees, unless those operations otherwise might cause a significant disturbance of surface resources; or</P>
            <P>(vii) Operations for which a proposed plan of operations is submitted for approval;</P>

            <P>(2) The District Ranger will, within 15 days of receipt of a notice of intent <PRTPAGE P="187"/>to operate, notify the operator if approval of a plan of operations is required before the operations may begin.</P>
            <P>(3) An operator shall submit a proposed plan of operations to the District Ranger having jurisdiction over the area in which operations will be conducted in lieu of a notice of intent to operate if the proposed operations will likely cause a significant disturbance of surface resources. An operator also shall submit a proposed plan of operations, or a proposed supplemental plan of operations consistent with § 228.4(d), to the District Ranger having jurisdiction over the area in which operations are being conducted if those operations are causing a significant disturbance of surface resources but are not covered by a current approved plan of operations. The requirement to submit a plan of operations shall not apply to the operations listed in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (v). The requirement to submit a plan of operations also shall not apply to operations which will not involve the use of mechanized earthmoving equipment, such as bulldozers or backhoes, or the cutting of trees, unless those operations otherwise will likely cause a significant disturbance of surface resources.</P>
            <P>(4) If the District Ranger determines that any operation is causing or will likely cause significant disturbance of surface resources, the District Ranger shall notify the operator that the operator must submit a proposed plan of operations for approval and that the operations can not be conducted until a plan of operations is approved.</P>

            <P>(b) Any person conducting operations on the effective date of these regulations, who would have been required to submit a plan of operations under § 228.4(a), may continue operations but shall within 120 days thereafter submit a plan of operations to the District Ranger having jurisdiction over the area within which operations are being conducted: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That upon a showing of good cause the authorized officer will grant an extension of time for submission of a plan of operations, not to exceed an additional 6 months. Operations may continue according to the submitted plan during its review, unless the authorized officer determines that the operations are unnecessarily or unreasonably causing irreparable damage to surface resources and advises the operator of those measures needed to avoid such damage. Upon approval of a plan of operations, operations shall be conducted in accordance with the approved plan. The requirement to submit a plan of operations shall not apply: (1) To operations excepted in § 228.4(a) or (2) to operations concluded prior to the effective date of the regulations in this part.</P>
            <P>(c) The plan of operations shall include:</P>
            <P>(1) The name and legal mailing address of the operators (and claimants if they are not the operators) and their lessees, assigns, or designees.</P>
            <P>(2) A map or sketch showing information sufficient to locate the proposed area of operations on the ground, existing and/or proposed roads or access routes to be used in connection with the operations as set forth in § 228.12 and the approximate location and size of areas where surface resources will be disturbed.</P>
            <P>(3) Information sufficient to describe or identify the type of operations proposed and how they would be conducted, the type and standard of existing and proposed roads or access routes, the means of transportation used or to be used as set forth in § 228.12, the period during which the proposed activity will take place, and measures to be taken to meet the requirements for environmental protection in § 228.8.</P>

            <P>(d) The plan of operations shall cover the requirements set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, as foreseen for the entire operation for the full estimated period of activity: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That if the development of a plan for an entire operation is not possible at the time of preparation of a plan, the operator shall file an initial plan setting forth his proposed operation to the degree reasonably foreseeable at that time, and shall thereafter file a supplemental plan or plans whenever it is proposed to undertake any significant surface disturbance not covered by the initial plan.<PRTPAGE P="188"/>
            </P>
            <P>(e) At any time during operations under an approved plan of operations, the authorized officer may ask the operator to furnish a proposed modification of the plan detailing the means of minimizing unforeseen significant disturbance of surface resources. If the operator does not furnish a proposed modification within a time deemed reasonable by the authorized officer, the authorized officer may recommend to his immediate superior that the operator be required to submit a proposed modification of the plan. The recommendation of the authorized officer shall be accompanied by a statement setting forth in detail the supporting facts and reasons for his recommendations. In acting upon such recommendation, the immediate superior of the authorized officer shall determine:</P>
            <P>(1) Whether all reasonable measures were taken by the authorized officer to predict the environmental impacts of the proposed operations prior to approving the operating plan,</P>
            <P>(2) Whether the disturbance is or probably will become of such significance as to require modification of the operating plan in order to meet the requirements for environmental protection specified in § 228.8 and</P>
            <P>(3) Whether the disturbance can be minimized using reasonable means. Lacking such determination that unforeseen significant disturbance of surface resources is occurring or probable and that the disturbance can be minimized using reasonable means, no operator shall be required to submit a proposed modification of an approved plan of operations. Operations may continue in accordance with the approved plan until a modified plan is approved, unless the immediate superior of the authorized officer determines that the operations are unnecessarily or unreasonably causing irreparable injury, loss or damage to surface resources and advises the operator of those measures needed to avoid such damage.</P>
            <P>(f) Upon completion of an environmental analysis in connection with each proposed operating plan, the authorized officer will determine whether an environmental statement is required. Not every plan of operations, supplemental plan or modification will involve the preparation of an environmental statement. Environmental impacts will vary substantially depending on whether the nature of operations is prospecting, exploration, development, or processing, and on the scope of operations (such as size of operations, construction required, length of operations and equipment required), resulting in varying degrees of disturbance to vegetative resources, soil, water, air, or wildlife. The Forest Service will prepare any environmental statements that may be required.</P>
            <P>(g) The information required to be included in a notice of intent or a plan of operations, or supplement or modification thereto, has been assigned Office of Management and Budget Control #0596-0022. The public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to vary from a few minutes for an activity involving little or no surface disturbance to several months for activities involving heavy capital investments and significant surface disturbance, with an average of 2 hours per individual response. This includes time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to Chief (2800), Forest Service, USDA, P.O. Box 96090, Washington, DC 20090-6090 and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503.</P>

A proposed plan of operation shall be submitted to the District Ranger, who shall promptly acknowledge receipt thereof to the operator. The authorized officer shall, within thirty (30) days of such receipt, analyze the proposal, considering the economics of the operation along with the other factors in determining the reasonableness of the requirements for surface resource protection, and;</P>
            <P>(1) Notify the operator that he has approved the plan of operations; or</P>
            <P>(2) Notify the operator that the proposed operations are such as not to require an operating plan; or</P>
            <P>(3) Notify the operator of any changes in, or additions to, the plan of operations deemed necessary to meet the purpose of the regulations in this part; or</P>

            <P>(4) Notify the operator that the plan is being reviewed, but that more time, not to exceed an additional sixty (60) days, is necessary to complete such review, setting forth the reasons why additional time is needed: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That days during which the area of operations is inaccessible for inspection shall not be included when computing the sixty (60) day period; or</P>
            <P>(5) Notify the operator that the plan cannot be approved until a final environmental statement has been prepared and filed with the Council on Environmental Quality as provided in § 228.4(f).</P>
            <P>(b) Pending final approval of the plan of operations, the authorized officer will approve such operations as may be necessary for timely compliance with the requirements of Federal and State laws, so long as such operations are conducted so as to minimize environmental impacts as prescribed by the authorized officer in accordance with the standards contained in § 228.8.</P>

            <P>(c) A supplemental plan or plans of operations provided for in § 228.4(d) and a modification of an approved operating plan as provided for in § 228.4(e) shall be subject to approval by the authorized officer in the same manner as the initial plan of operations: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That a modification of an approved plan of operations under § 228.4(e) shall be subject to approval by the immediate superior of the authorized officer in cases where it has been determined that a modification is required.</P>
            <P>(d) In the provisions for review of operating plans, the Forest Service will arrange for consultation with appropriate agencies of the Department of the Interior with respect to significant technical questions concerning the character of unique geologic conditions and special exploration and development systems, techniques, and equipment, and with respect to mineral values, mineral resources, and mineral reserves. Further, the operator may request the Forest Service to arrange for similar consultations with appropriate agencies of the U.S. Department of the Interior for a review of operating plans.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Operations within National Forest Wilderness.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The United States mining laws shall extend to each National Forest Wilderness for the period specified in the Wilderness Act and subsequent establishing legislation to the same extent they were applicable prior to the date the Wilderness was designated by Congress as a part of the National Wilderness Preservation System. Subject to valid existing rights, no person shall have any right or interest in or to any mineral deposits which may be discovered through prospecting or other information-gathering activity after the legal date on which the United States mining laws cease to apply to the specific Wilderness.</P>
            <P>(b) Holders of unpatented mining claims validly established on any National Forest Wilderness prior to inclusion of such unit in the National Wilderness Preservation System shall be accorded the rights provided by the United States mining laws as then applicable to the National Forest land involved. Persons locating mining claims in any National Forest Wilderness on or after the date on which said Wilderness was included in the National Wilderness Preservation System shall be accorded the rights provided by the United States mining laws as applicable to the National Forest land involved and subject to provisions specified in the establishing legislation. Persons conducting operations as defined in § 228.3 in National Forest Wilderness shall comply with the regulations in this part. Operations shall be conducted so as to protect National Forest surface resources in accordance with the general purposes of maintaining the National Wilderness Preservation System unimpaired for future use and enjoyment as wilderness and to preserve its wilderness character, consistent with the use of the land for mineral location, exploration, development, drilling, and production and for transmission lines, water lines, telephone lines, and processing operations, including, where essential, the use of mechanized transport, aircraft or motorized equipment.</P>
            <P>(c) Persons with valid mining claims wholly within National Forest Wilderness shall be permitted access to such surrounded claims by means consistent with the preservation of National Forest Wilderness which have been or are being customarily used with respect to other such claims surrounded by National Forest Wilderness. No operator shall construct roads across National Forest Wilderness unless authorized in writing by the Forest Supervisor in accordance with § 228.12.</P>
            <P>(d) On all mining claims validly established on lands within the National Wilderness Preservation System, the operator shall take all reasonable measures to remove any structures, equipment and other facilities no longer needed for mining purposes in accordance with the provisions in § 228.10 and restore the surface in accordance with the requirements in § 228.8(g).</P>
            <P>(e) The title to timber on patented claims validly established after the land was included within the National Wilderness Preservation System remains in the United States, subject to a right to cut and use timber for mining purposes. So much of the mature timber may be cut and used as is needed in the extraction, removal, and beneficiation of the mineral deposits, if needed timber is not otherwise reasonably available. The cutting shall comply with the requirements for sound principles of forest management as defined by the National Forest rules and regulations and set forth in stipulations to be included in the plan of operations, which as a minimum incorporate the following basic principles of forest management:</P>
            <P>(1) Harvesting operations shall be so conducted as to minimize soil movement and damage from water runoff; and</P>
            <P>(2) Slash shall be disposed of and other precautions shall be taken to minimize damage from forest insects, disease, and fire.</P>

            <P>(f) The Chief, Forest Service, shall allow any activity, including <PRTPAGE P="193"/>prospecting, for the purpose of gathering information about minerals in National Forest Wilderness except that any such activity for gathering information shall be carried on in a manner compatible with the preservation of the wilderness environment as specified in the plan of operations.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Advertising</E>—(1) <E T="03">Sales over 25,000 cubic yards.</E> Mineral material sales offered by competitive bidding and which exceed 25,000 cubic yards must be advertised on the same day once a week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the area where the material is located, and in a trade or industrial newspaper when considered appropriate. Notice of the sale must be posted in a conspicuous place in the office where bids are to be submitted. In addition, the authorized officer may send the advertisement directly to known interested persons. Bids may be received but not evaluated before the end of the advertising period, which may be extended at the discretion of the authorized officer.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Content of advertising.</E> The advertisement of sale must specify the location by legal description of the tract or tracts or by any other means identify the location of the mineral material deposit being offered, the kind of material, estimated quantities, the unit of measurement, appraised price (which sets the minimum acceptable bid), time and place for receiving and opening of bids, minimum deposit required, major special constraints due to environmental considerations, available access, maintenance required over haul <PRTPAGE P="200"/>routes, traffic controls, required use permits, required qualifications of bidders, the method of bidding, bonding requirement, notice of the right to reject any or all bids, the office where a copy of the contract and additional information may be obtained, and additional information the authorized officer deems necessary.</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Conduct of sales.</E> (1) Bidding at competitive sales may be conducted by the submission of written sealed bids, oral bids, or a combination of both as directed by the authorized officer. In the event of a tie in high sealed bids, the highest bidder will be determined by oral auction among those tied bidders; when no oral bid is higher that the sealed bids, the selected bidder will be determined by lot, the purchase price being the amount of the tied bid. For all oral auctions, including those used to break sealed-bid ties, the high bidder must confirm the bid in writing immediately upon being declared the high bidder. The authorized officer must mail notification of the bidding results to all bidders within 10 days.</P>
              <P>(2) The authorized officer may require bidders to furnish evidence of qualification at the time of award or, if such evidence has already been furnished and is still valid, make appropriate reference to the record containing it.</P>
              <P>(3) When it is in the interest of the United States to do so, the authorized officer may reject any or all bids.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Bid deposits and award of contract.</E> Sealed bids must be accompanied by a deposit. For mineral materials offered at oral auction, bidders must make the deposit before opening of the bidding.</P>
              <P>(1) Bid deposits must be equal to 10 percent of the appraised value but not less than $100.00.</P>
              <P>(2) Bid deposits must be in the form of cash, money order, bank drafts, cashier's or certified checks made payable to the Forest Service, or bonds acceptable to the Forest Service (§ 228.51(b)).</P>
              <P>(3) Upon conclusion of the bidding, the authorized officer will return the deposits of all unsuccessful bidders. The successful bidder's deposit will be applied toward the purchase price. If the contract is not awarded to the high bidder due to an inability to perform the obligations of the contract, the deposit, less expenses and damages incurred by the United States, may be returned. The return of a deposit does not prejudice any other rights or remedies of the United States. The contract may be offered and awarded to the next successive qualified high bidder, or, at the discretion of the authorized officer, the sale may be either readvertised or negotiated if it is determined that a competitive sale is impracticable.</P>
              <P>(4) Within 30 days after receipt of the contract, the successful bidder must sign and return the contract, together with any required bond, unless the authorized officer has granted an extension for an additional 30 days. The bidder must apply for the extension in writing within the first 30-day period. If the successful bidder fails to return the contract within the first 30-day period or within an approved extension, the bid deposit, less the costs of readvertising and damages, may be returned without prejudice to any other rights or remedies of the United States.</P>
              <P>(5) All sales must be processed on Forest Service-approved contract forms. The authorized officer may add provisions to the contract to cover conditions peculiar to the sale area. Such additional provisions must be made available for inspection by prospective bidders during the advertising period.</P>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Suspension of operations.</E> When the noncompliance is likely to result in danger to public health or safety or in <PRTPAGE P="215"/>irreparable resource damage, the authorized Forest officer shall suspend the operations, in whole or in part.</P>
              <P>(i) A suspension of operations shall remain in effect until the authorized Forest officer determines that the operations are in compliance with the applicable requirement(s) or standard(s) identified in the notice of noncompliance.</P>
              <P>(ii) The authorized Forest officer shall serve decisions suspending operations upon the operator in person, by certified mail, or by telephone. If notice is initially provided in person or by telephone, the authorized Forest officer shall send the operator written confirmation of the decision by certified mail.</P>
              <P>(iii) The authorized Forest officer shall immediately notify the appropriate Bureau of Land Management office when an operator has been given notice to suspend operations.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Abatement of emergencies.</E> When the noncompliance is resulting in an emergency, the authorized Forest officer may take action as necessary to abate the emergency. The total cost to the Forest Service of taking actions to abate an emergency becomes an obligation of the operator.</P>
              <P>(i) Emergency situations include, but are not limited to, imminent dangers to public health or safety or irreparable resource damage.</P>
              <P>(ii) The authorized Forest officer shall promptly serve a bill for such costs upon the operator by certified mail.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Implementation of the program.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) The Urban and Community Forestry Assistance Program is implemented through the Forest Service <PRTPAGE P="226"/>Grants, Cooperative Agreements, and Other Agreements Program (FSM 1580) and the Grants, Cooperative Agreements, and Other Agreements Handbook (FSH 1509.11). The Forest Service Manual and Handbook are available from the Forest Service internet homepage or at National Forest offices.</P>
            <P>(b) The Forest Service, under the authority of the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978 and through the Urban and Community Forestry Assistance Program, coordinates financial, technical, and related assistance with the Natural Resources Conservation Service for the Urban Resources Partnership initiative. The Natural Resources Conservation Service provides similar assistance through the Urban Resources Partnership initiative under the authority of the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act (16 U.S.C. 590a-590f). The Urban Resources Partnership is an initiative in which Federal agencies, in cooperation with State and local agencies, community groups, and non-governmental organizations endeavor to be more effective, responsive, and efficient in working together to protect, improve, and rehabilitate the environment in urban areas of the Nation. The Forest Service and Natural Resources Conservation Service implement the Urban Resources Partnership initiative under the “Urban Resources Partnership National Guidance for U.S. Department of Agriculture Personnel” and applicable agency and departmental procedures for Federal grants and cooperative agreements. Copies of the Guidance may be obtained from the Cooperative Forestry Staff, Forest Service, USDA, P.O. Box 96090, Washington, DC 20090-6090.</P>

            <P>(a) You may take fish and wildlife on public lands for subsistence uses only if you are an Alaska resident of a rural area or rural community. The regulations in this part may further limit your qualifications to harvest fish or wildlife resources for subsistence uses. If you are not an Alaska resident or are a resident of a non-rural area or community listed in § 242.23, you may not take fish or wildlife on public lands for subsistence uses under the regulations in this part.</P>
            <P>(b) Where the Board has made a customary and traditional use determination regarding subsistence use of a specific fish stock or wildlife population, in accordance with, and as listed in, § 242.24, only those Alaskans who are residents of rural areas or communities designated by the Board are eligible for subsistence taking of that population or stock on public lands for subsistence uses under the regulations in this part. If you do not live in one of those areas or communities, you may not take fish or wildlife from that population or stock, on public lands under the regulations in this part.</P>
            <P>(c) Where customary and traditional use determinations for a fish stock or wildlife population within a specific area have not yet been made by the Board (e.g., “no determination”), all Alaskans who are residents of rural areas or communities may harvest for subsistence from that stock or population under the regulations in this part.</P>
            <P>(d) The National Park Service may regulate further the eligibility of those individuals qualified to engage in subsistence uses on National Park Service lands in accordance with specific authority in ANILCA, and National Park Service regulations at 36 CFR Part 13.</P>

            <P>(a) If you wish to take fish and wildlife on public lands for subsistence uses, you must be an eligible rural Alaska resident and:</P>
            <P>(1) Possess the pertinent valid Alaska resident hunting and trapping licenses (no license required to take fish or shellfish, but you must be an Alaska resident) unless Federal licenses are required or unless otherwise provided for in subpart D of this part;</P>

            <P>(3) Possess and comply with the provisions of any pertinent permits, harvest tickets, or tags required by the State unless any of these documents or individual provisions in them are superseded by the requirements in subpart D of this part.</P>
            <P>(b) In order to receive a Federal Subsistence Registration Permit or Federal Designated Harvester Permit or designate someone to harvest fish or wildlife for you under a Federal Designated Harvester Permit, you must be old enough to reasonably harvest that species yourself (or under the guidance of an adult).</P>
            <P>(c) If you have been awarded a permit to take fish and wildlife, you must have that permit in your possession during the taking and must comply with all requirements of the permit and the regulations in this section pertaining to validation and reporting and to regulations in subpart D of this part pertaining to methods and means, possession and transportation, and utilization. Upon the request of a State or Federal law enforcement agent, you must also produce any licenses, permits, harvest tickets, tags, or other documents required by this section. If you are engaged in taking fish and wildlife under the regulations in this part, you must allow State or Federal law enforcement agents to inspect any apparatus designed to be used, or capable of being used to take fish or wildlife, or any fish or wildlife in your possession.</P>

            <P>(d) You must validate the harvest tickets, tags, permits, or other required documents before removing your kill from the harvest site. You must also comply with all reporting provisions as set forth in subpart D of this part.<PRTPAGE P="238"/>
            </P>
            <P>(e) If you take fish and wildlife under a community harvest system, you must report the harvest activity in accordance with regulations specified for that community in subpart D of this part, and as required by any applicable permit conditions. Individuals may be responsible for particular reporting requirements in the conditions permitting a specific community's harvest. Failure to comply with these conditions is a violation of the regulations in this part. Community harvests are reviewed annually under the regulations in subpart D of this part.</P>
            <P>(f) You may not make a fraudulent application for Federal or State licenses, permits, harvest tickets or tags or intentionally file an incorrect harvest report.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Information collection requirements.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The rules in this part contain information collection requirements subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval under 44 U.S.C. 3501-3520. They apply to fish and wildlife harvest activities on public lands in Alaska. Subsistence users will not be required to respond to an information collection request unless a valid OMB number is displayed on the information collection form.</P>
            <P>(1) Section 242.6, Licenses, permits, harvest tickets, tags, and reports. The information collection requirements contained in § 242.6 (Federal Subsistence Registration Permit or Federal Designated Harvester Permit forms) provide for permit-specific subsistence activities not authorized through the general adoption of State regulations. Identity and location of residence are required to determine if you are eligible for a permit and a report of success is required after a harvest attempt. These requirements are not duplicative with the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The regulations in § 242.6 require this information before a rural Alaska resident may engage in subsistence uses on public lands. The Department estimates that the average time necessary to obtain and comply with this permit information collection requirement is 0.25 hours.</P>
            <P>(2) Section 242.20, Request for reconsideration. The information collection requirements contained in § 242.20 provide a standardized process to allow individuals the opportunity to appeal decisions of the Board. Submission of a request for reconsideration is voluntary but required to receive a final review by the Board. We estimate that a request for reconsideration will take 4 hours to prepare and submit.</P>
            <P>(3) The remaining information collection requirements contained in this part imposed upon subsistence users are those adopted from State regulations. These collection requirements would exist in the absence of Federal subsistence regulations and are not subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act. The burden in this situation is negligible, and information gained from these reports is systematically available to Federal managers by routine computer access requiring less than 1 hour.</P>

            <P>(b) You may direct comments on the burden estimate or any other aspect of the burden estimate to: Information Collection Officer, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 1849 C Street, N.W., MS 222 ARLSQ, Washington, D.C. 20240; and the Office of Management and Budget, <PRTPAGE P="239"/>Paperwork Reduction Project (Subsistence), Washington, D.C. 20503. Additional information requirements may be imposed if Local Advisory Committees or additional Regional Councils, subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), are established under subpart B of this part. Such requirements will be submitted to OMB for approval prior to their implementation.</P>

            <P>(1) If the timing of a regularly scheduled meeting of the affected Regional Council so permits without incurring undue delay, the Board may seek Council recommendations on the proposed emergency special action. Such a Council recommendation, if any, will be subject to the requirements of § 242.18(a)(4).</P>
            <P>(2) The emergency action will be effective when directed by the Board, may not exceed 60 days, and may not be extended unless the procedures for adoption of a temporary special action, as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, have been followed.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Temporary special actions.</E> After adequate notice and public hearing, the Board may temporarily close or open public lands for the taking of fish and wildlife for subsistence uses, or modify the requirements for subsistence take, or close public lands for the taking of fish and wildlife for nonsubsistence uses, or restrict take for nonsubsistence uses.</P>
            <P>(1) The Board may make such temporary changes only after it determines that the proposed temporary change will not interfere with the conservation of healthy fish and wildlife populations, will not be detrimental to the long-term subsistence use of fish or wildlife resources, and is not an unnecessary restriction on nonsubsistence users. The Board may also reopen public lands to nonsubsistence uses if new information or changed conditions indicate that the closure is no longer warranted.</P>
            <P>(i) Prior to implementing a temporary special action, the Board will consult with the State of Alaska and the Chairs of the Regional Councils of the affected regions.</P>
            <P>(ii) If the timing of a regularly scheduled meeting of the affected Regional Council so permits without incurring undue delay, the Board will seek Council recommendations on the proposed temporary special action. Such Council recommendations, if any, will be subject to the requirements of § 242.18(a)(4).</P>
            <P>(2) The length of any temporary action will be confined to the minimum time period or harvest limit determined by the Board to be necessary under the circumstances. In any event, a temporary opening or closure will not extend longer than the end of the current regulatory cycle.</P>
            <P>(c) The Board may reject a request for either an emergency or a temporary special action if the Board concludes that there are no time-sensitive circumstances necessitating a regulatory change before the next regular proposal cycle. However, a special action request that has been rejected for this reason may be deferred, if appropriate and after consultation with the proponent, for consideration during the next regular proposal cycle. The Board will consider changes to customary and traditional use determinations in subpart C of this part only during the regular proposal cycle.</P>

            <P>(d) The Board will provide notice of all regulatory changes adopted via special action by posting the change on <PRTPAGE P="246"/>the Office of Subsistence Management Web site (<E T="03">http://alaska.fws.gov/asm/index.cfml</E>). When appropriate, notice may also include distribution of press releases to newspapers, local radio stations, and local contacts, as well as direct notification to the proponent and interested parties. The Board will publish notice and reasons justifying the special action in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> as soon as practicable.</P>
            <P>(e) The decision of the Board on any proposed special action will constitute its final administrative action.</P>
            <P>(f) Regulations authorizing any individual agency to implement closures or restrictions on public lands managed by the agency remain unaffected by the regulations in this part.</P>
            <P>(g) Fish and wildlife may not be taken in violation of any restriction, closure, or change authorized by the Board.</P>

            <P>(f) <E T="03">Harvest limits.</E> (1) The harvest limit specified for a trapping season for a species and the harvest limit set for a hunting season for the same species are separate and distinct. This means that if you have taken a harvest limit for a particular species under a trapping season, you may take additional animals under the harvest limit specified for a hunting season or vice versa.</P>
            <P>(2) A brown/grizzly bear taken in a Unit or portion of a Unit having a harvest limit of “one brown/grizzly bear per year” counts against a “one brown/grizzly bear every four regulatory years” harvest limit in other Units. You may not take more than one brown/grizzly bear in a regulatory year.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Evidence of sex and identity.</E> (1) If subsistence take of Dall sheep is restricted to a ram, you may not possess or transport a harvested sheep unless both horns accompany the animal.</P>
            <P>(2) If the subsistence taking of an ungulate, except sheep, is restricted to one sex in the local area, you may not possess or transport the carcass of an animal taken in that area unless sufficient portions of the external sex organs remain attached to indicate conclusively the sex of the animal, except that in Units 1-5 antlers are also considered proof of sex for deer if the antlers are naturally attached to an entire carcass, with or without the viscera; and except in Units 11, 13, 19, 21, and 24, where you may possess either sufficient portions of the external sex organs (still attached to a portion of the carcass) or the head (with or without antlers attached; however, the antler stumps must remain attached) to indicate the sex of the harvested moose. However, this paragraph (g)(2) does not apply to the carcass of an ungulate that has been butchered and placed in storage or otherwise prepared for consumption upon arrival at the location where it is to be consumed.</P>
            <P>(3) If a moose harvest limit requires an antlered bull, an antler size, or configuration restriction, you may not possess or transport the moose carcass or its parts unless both antlers accompany the carcass or its parts. If you possess a set of antlers with less than the required number of brow tines on one antler, you must leave the antlers naturally attached to the unbroken, uncut skull plate; however, this paragraph (g)(3) does not apply to a moose carcass or its parts that have been butchered and placed in storage or otherwise prepared for consumption after arrival at the place where it is to be stored or consumed.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Removing harvest from the field.</E> You must leave all edible meat on the bones of the front quarters and hind quarters of caribou and moose harvested in Units 9, 17, 18, and 19B prior to October 1 until you remove the meat from the field or process it for human consumption. You must leave all edible <PRTPAGE P="270"/>meat on the bones of the front quarters, hind quarters, and ribs of moose harvested in Unit 21 prior to October 1 until you remove the meat from the field or process it for human consumption. You must leave all edible meat on the bones of the front quarters, hind quarters, and ribs of caribou and moose harvested in Unit 24 prior to October 1 until you remove the meat from the field or process it for human consumption. Meat of the front quarters, hind quarters, or ribs from a harvested moose or caribou may be processed for human consumption and consumed in the field; however, meat may not be removed from the bones for purposes of transport out of the field. You must leave all edible meat on the bones of the front quarters, hind quarters, and ribs of caribou and moose harvested in Unit 25 until you remove the meat from the field or process it for human consumption.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Returning of tags, marks, or collars.</E> If you take an animal that has been marked or tagged for scientific studies, you must, within a reasonable time, notify the ADF&amp;G or the agency identified on the collar or marker when and where the animal was taken. You also must retain any ear tag, collar, radio, tattoo, or other identification with the hide until it is sealed, if sealing is required; in all cases, you must return any identification equipment to the ADF&amp;G or to an agency identified on such equipment.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Sealing of bear skins and skulls.</E> (1) Sealing requirements for bear apply to brown bears taken in all Units, except as specified in this paragraph (j), and black bears of all color phases taken in Units 1-7, 11-17, and 20.</P>
            <P>(2) You may not possess or transport from Alaska the untanned skin or skull of a bear unless the skin and skull have been sealed by an authorized representative of ADF&amp;G in accordance with State or Federal regulations, except that the skin and skull of a brown bear taken under a registration permit in Units 5, 9B, 9E, 17, 18, 19A and 19B downstream of and including the Aniak River drainage, Units 21D, 22, 23, 24, and 26A need not be sealed unless removed from the area.</P>
            <P>(3) You must keep a bear skin and skull together until a representative of the ADF&amp;G has removed a rudimentary premolar tooth from the skull and sealed both the skull and the skin; however, this provision does not apply to brown bears taken within Units 5, 9B, 9E, 17, 18, 19A and 19B downstream of and including the Aniak River drainage, Units 21D, 22, 23, 24, and 26A and which are not removed from the Unit.</P>
            <P>(i) In areas where sealing is required by Federal regulations, you may not possess or transport the hide of a bear that does not have the penis sheath or vaginal orifice naturally attached to indicate conclusively the sex of the bear.</P>
            <P>(ii) If the skin or skull of a bear taken in Units 9B, 17, 18, and 19A and 19B downstream of and including the Aniak River drainage is removed from the area, you must first have it sealed by an ADF&amp;G representative in Bethel, Dillingham, or McGrath; at the time of sealing, the ADF&amp;G representative must remove and retain the skin of the skull and front claws of the bear.</P>
            <P>(iii) If you remove the skin or skull of a bear taken in Units 21D, 22, 23, 24, and 26A from the area or present it for commercial tanning within the area, you must first have it sealed by an ADF&amp;G representative in Barrow, Galena, Nome, or Kotzebue; at the time of sealing, the ADF&amp;G representative must remove and retain the skin of the skull and front claws of the bear.</P>
            <P>(iv) If you remove the skin or skull of a bear taken in Unit 5 from the area, you must first have it sealed by an ADF&amp;G representative in Yakutat.</P>
            <P>(v) If you remove the skin or skull of a bear taken in Unit 9E from Unit 9, you must first have it sealed by an authorized sealing representative. At the time of sealing, the representative must remove and retain the skin of the skull and front claws of the bear.</P>
            <P>(4) You may not falsify any information required on the sealing certificate or temporary sealing form provided by the ADF&amp;G in accordance with State regulations.</P>
            <P>(k) <E T="03">Sealing of beaver, lynx, marten, otter, wolf, and wolverine.</E> You may not possess or transport from Alaska the untanned skin of a marten taken in Unit 1-5, 7, 13E, or 14-16 or the untanned skin of a beaver, lynx, otter, <PRTPAGE P="271"/>wolf, or wolverine, whether taken inside or outside the State, unless the skin has been sealed by an authorized representative in accordance with State or Federal regulations.</P>
            <P>(1) In Unit 18, you must obtain an ADF&amp;G seal for beaver skins only if they are to be sold or commercially tanned.</P>
            <P>(2) In Unit 2, you must seal any wolf taken on or before the 14th day after the date of taking.</P>
            <P>(l) <E T="03">Sealing form.</E> If you take a species listed in paragraph (k) of this section but are unable to present the skin in person, you must complete and sign a temporary sealing form and ensure that the completed temporary sealing form and skin are presented to an authorized representative of ADF&amp;G for sealing consistent with requirements listed in paragraph (k) of this section.</P>
            <P>(m) <E T="03">Traditional religious ceremonies.</E> You may take wildlife, outside of established season or harvest limits, for food in traditional religious ceremonies, which are part of a funerary or mortuary cycle, including memorial potlatches, under the following provisions:</P>
            <P>(1) The harvest does not violate recognized principles of wildlife conservation and uses the methods and means allowable for the particular species published in the applicable Federal regulations. The appropriate Federal land manager will establish the number, species, sex, or location of harvest, if necessary, for conservation purposes. Other regulations relating to ceremonial harvest may be found in the Unit-specific regulations in paragraph (n) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) No permit or harvest ticket is required for harvesting under this section; however, the harvester must be a federally qualified subsistence user with customary and traditional use in the area where the harvesting will occur.</P>
            <P>(3) In Units 1-26 (except for Koyukon/Gwich'in potlatch ceremonies in Unit 20F, 21, 24, or 25):</P>
            <P>(i) A tribal chief, village or tribal council president, or the chief's or president's designee for the village in which the religious/cultural ceremony will be held, or a federally qualified subsistence user outside of a village or tribal-organized ceremony, must notify the nearest Federal land manager that a wildlife harvest will take place. The notification must include the species, harvest location, and number of animals expected to be taken.</P>
            <P>(ii) Immediately after the wildlife is taken, the tribal chief, village or tribal council president or designee, or other federally qualified subsistence user must create a list of the successful hunters and maintain these records, including the name of the decedent for whom the ceremony will be held. If requested, this information must be available to an authorized representative of the Federal land manager.</P>
            <P>(iii) The tribal chief, village or tribal council president or designee, or other federally qualified subsistence user outside of the village in which the religious/cultural ceremony will be held must report to the Federal land manager the harvest location, species, sex, and number of animals taken as soon as practicable, but not more than 15 days after the wildlife is taken.</P>
            <P>(4) In Units 20F, 21, 24, and 25 (for Koyukon/Gwich'in potlatch ceremonies only):</P>
            <P>(i) Taking wildlife outside of established season and harvest limits is authorized if it is for food for the traditional Koyukon/Gwich'in Potlatch Funerary or Mortuary ceremony and if it is consistent with conservation of healthy populations.</P>
            <P>(ii) Immediately after the wildlife is taken, the tribal chief, village or tribal council president, or the chief's or president's designee for the village in which the religious ceremony will be held must create a list of the successful hunters and maintain these records. The list must be made available, after the harvest is completed, to a Federal land manager upon request.</P>
            <P>(iii) As soon as practical, but not more than 15 days after the harvest, the tribal chief, village council president, or designee must notify the Federal land manager about the harvest location, species, sex, and number of animals taken.</P>
            <P>(n) <E T="03">Unit regulations.</E> You may take for subsistence unclassified wildlife, all squirrel species and marmots in all Units, without harvest limits, for the period of July 1-June 30.

            <P>(A) Unit 22A consists of Norton Sound drainages from, but excluding, the Pastolik River drainage to, and including, the Ungalik River drainage, and Stuart and Besboro Islands.</P>
            <P>(B) Unit 22B consists of Norton Sound drainages from, but excluding, the Ungalik River drainage to, and including, the Topkok Creek drainage.</P>
            <P>(C) Unit 22C consists of Norton Sound and Bering Sea drainages from, but excluding, the Topkok Creek drainage to, and including, the Tisuk River drainage, and King and Sledge Islands.</P>

            <P>(ii) You may hunt brown bear by State registration permit in lieu of a resident tag if you have obtained a State registration permit prior to hunting. Aircraft may not be used in any manner for brown bear hunting under the authority of a brown bear State registration permit, including transportation of hunters, bears, or parts of bears; however, this does not apply to transportation of bear hunters or bear parts by regularly scheduled flights to and between communities by carriers that normally provide scheduled service to this area, nor does it apply to transportation of aircraft to or between publicly owned airports.</P>
            <P>(iii) Unit-specific regulations:</P>
            <P>(A) If you have a trapping license, you may use a firearm to take beaver in Unit 22 during the established seasons.</P>
            <P>(B) Coyote, incidentally taken with a trap or snare, may be used for subsistence purposes.</P>
            <P>(C) A snowmachine may be used to position a hunter to select individual caribou for harvest provided that the animals are not shot from a moving snowmachine.</P>
            <P>(D) The taking of one bull moose and up to three musk oxen by the community of Wales is allowed for the celebration of the Kingikmuit Dance Festival under the terms of a Federal registration permit. Permits will be issued to individuals only at the request of the Native Village of Wales. The harvest may occur only within regularly established seasons in Unit 22E. The harvest will count against any established quota for the area.</P>

            <P>(E) A federally qualified subsistence user (recipient) may designate another federally qualified subsistence user to take musk oxen on his or her behalf unless the recipient is a member of a community operating under a community harvest system. The designated hunter must get a designated hunter permit and must return a completed harvest report. The designated hunter may hunt for any number of recipients in the course of a season, but have no more than two harvest limits in his/her possession at any one time, except in <PRTPAGE P="304"/>Unit 22E where a resident of Wales or Shishmaref acting as a designated hunter may hunt for any number of recipients, but have no more than four harvest limits in his/her possession at any one time.</P>

            <P>(23) <E T="03">Unit 23.</E> (i) Unit 23 consists of Kotzebue Sound, Chukchi Sea, and Arctic Ocean drainages from and including <PRTPAGE P="306"/>the Goodhope River drainage to Cape Lisburne.</P>
            <P>(ii) In the following areas, the taking of wildlife for subsistence uses is prohibited or restricted on public land:</P>
            <P>(A) You may not use aircraft in any manner either for hunting of ungulates, bear, wolves, or wolverine, or for transportation of hunters or harvested species in the Noatak Controlled Use Area for the period August 15-September 30. The Area consists of that portion of Unit 23 in a corridor extending 5 miles on either side of the Noatak River beginning at the mouth of the Noatak River, and extending upstream to the mouth of Sapun Creek. This closure does not apply to the transportation of hunters or parts of ungulates, bear, wolves, or wolverine by regularly scheduled flights to communities by carriers that normally provide scheduled air service.</P>
            <P>(B) [Reserved]</P>
            <P>(iii) You may not use aircraft in any manner for brown bear hunting, including transportation of hunters, bears, or parts of bears; however, this does not apply to transportation of bear hunters or bear parts by regularly scheduled flights to and between communities by carriers that normally provide scheduled service to this area, nor does it apply to transportation of aircraft to or between publicly owned airports.</P>
            <P>(iv) Unit-specific regulations:</P>
            <P>(A) You may take caribou from a boat moving under power in Unit 23.</P>
            <P>(B) In addition to other restrictions on method of take found in this section, you may also take swimming caribou with a firearm using rimfire cartridges.</P>
            <P>(C) If you have a trapping license, you may take beaver with a firearm in all of Unit 23 from Nov. 1-June 10.</P>
            <P>(D) For the Baird and DeLong Mountain sheep hunts—A federally qualified subsistence user (recipient) may designate another federally qualified subsistence user to take sheep on his or her behalf unless the recipient is a member of a community operating under a community harvest system. The designated hunter must obtain a designated hunter permit and must return a completed harvest report. The designated hunter may hunt for only one recipient in the course of a season and may have both his and the recipients' harvest limits in his/her possession at the same time.</P>
            <P>(E) A snowmachine may be used to position a hunter to select individual caribou for harvest provided that the animals are not shot from a moving snowmachine. On BLM-managed lands only, a snowmachine may be used to position a caribou, wolf, or wolverine for harvest provided that the animals are not shot from a moving snowmachine.</P>
            <P>(F) A federally qualified subsistence user (recipient) may designate another federally qualified subsistence user to take musk oxen on his or her behalf unless the recipient is a member of a community operating under a community harvest system. The designated hunter must get a designated hunter permit and must return a completed harvest report. The designated hunter may hunt for any number of recipients, but have no more than two harvest limits in his/her possession at any one time.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Subsistence taking of fish.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> (1) Regulations in this section apply to the taking of fish or their parts for subsistence uses.</P>
            <P>(2) You may take fish for subsistence uses at any time by any method unless you are restricted by the subsistence fishing regulations found in this section. The harvest limit specified in this section for a subsistence season for a species and the State harvest limit set for a State season for the same species are not cumulative, except as modified by regulations in paragraph (e) of this section. This means that if you have taken the harvest limit for a particular species under a subsistence season specified in this section, you may not, after that, take any additional fish of that species under any other harvest limit specified for a State season.</P>
            <P>(3) You may not possess, transport, give, receive, or barter subsistence-taken fish or their parts that have been taken contrary to Federal law or regulation or State law or regulation (unless superseded by regulations in this part).</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods, means, and general restrictions.</E> (1) Unless otherwise specified in this section or under terms of a required subsistence fishing permit (as may be modified by regulations in this section), you may use the following <PRTPAGE P="316"/>legal types of gear for subsistence fishing:</P>
            <P>(i) A set gillnet;</P>
            <P>(ii) A drift gillnet;</P>
            <P>(iii) A purse seine;</P>
            <P>(iv) A hand purse seine;</P>
            <P>(v) A beach seine;</P>
            <P>(vi) Troll gear;</P>
            <P>(vii) A fish wheel;</P>
            <P>(viii) A trawl;</P>
            <P>(ix) A pot;</P>
            <P>(x) A longline;</P>
            <P>(xi) A fyke net;</P>
            <P>(xii) A lead;</P>
            <P>(xiii) A herring pound;</P>
            <P>(xiv) A dip net;</P>
            <P>(xv) Jigging gear;</P>
            <P>(xvi) A mechanical jigging machine;</P>
            <P>(xvii) A handline;</P>
            <P>(xviii) A cast net;</P>
            <P>(xix) A rod and reel; and</P>
            <P>(xx) A spear.</P>
            <P>(2) You must include an escape mechanism on all pots used to take fish or shellfish. The escape mechanisms are as follows:</P>
            <P>(i) A sidewall, which may include the tunnel, of all shellfish and bottomfish pots must contain an opening equal to or exceeding 18 inches in length, except that in shrimp pots the opening must be a minimum of 6 inches in length. The opening must be laced, sewn, or secured together by a single length of untreated, 100 percent cotton twine, no larger than 30 thread. The cotton twine may be knotted at each end only. The opening must be within 6 inches of the bottom of the pot and must be parallel with it. The cotton twine may not be tied or looped around the web bars. Dungeness crab pots may have the pot lid tie-down straps secured to the pot at one end by a single loop of untreated, 100 percent cotton twine no larger than 60 thread, or the pot lid must be secured so that, when the twine degrades, the lid will no longer be securely closed.</P>
            <P>(ii) All king crab, Tanner crab, shrimp, miscellaneous shellfish and bottomfish pots may, instead of complying with paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, satisfy the following: a sidewall, which may include the tunnel, must contain an opening at least 18 inches in length, except that shrimp pots must contain an opening at least 6 inches in length. The opening must be laced, sewn, or secured together by a single length of treated or untreated twine, no larger than 36 thread. A galvanic timed-release device, designed to release in no more than 30 days in saltwater, must be integral to the length of twine so that, when the device releases, the twine will no longer secure or obstruct the opening of the pot. The twine may be knotted only at each end and at the attachment points on the galvanic timed-release device. The opening must be within 6 inches of the bottom of the pot and must be parallel with it. The twine may not be tied or looped around the web bars.</P>
            <P>(3) For subsistence fishing for salmon, you may not use a gillnet exceeding 50 fathoms in length, unless otherwise specified in this section. The gillnet web must contain at least 30 filaments of equal diameter or at least 6 filaments, each of which must be at least 0.20 millimeter in diameter.</P>
            <P>(4) Except as otherwise provided for in this section, you may not obstruct more than one-half the width of any stream with any gear used to take fish for subsistence uses.</P>
            <P>(5) You may not use live nonindigenous fish as bait.</P>
            <P>(6) You must have your first initial, last name, and address plainly and legibly inscribed on the side of your fish wheel facing midstream of the river.</P>
            <P>(7) You may use kegs or buoys of any color but red on any permitted gear, except in the following areas where kegs or buoys of any color, including red, may be used:</P>
            <P>(i) Yukon-Northern Area; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Kuskokwim Area.</P>
            <P>(8) You must have your first initial, last name, and address plainly and legibly inscribed on each keg, buoy, stakes attached to gillnets, stakes identifying gear fished under the ice, and any other unattended fishing gear which you use to take fish for subsistence uses.</P>
            <P>(9) You may not use explosives or chemicals to take fish for subsistence uses.</P>

            <P>(10) You may not take fish for subsistence uses within 300 feet of any dam, fish ladder, weir, culvert or other artificial obstruction, unless otherwise indicated.<PRTPAGE P="317"/>
            </P>
            <P>(11) <E T="03">Transactions between rural residents.</E> Rural residents may exchange in customary trade subsistence-harvested fish, their parts, or their eggs, legally taken under the regulations in this part, for cash from other rural residents. The Board may recognize regional differences and regulates customary trade differently for separate regions of the State.</P>

            <P>(ii) Upper Copper River District—The total number of salmon per household taken within the Upper Copper River District and exchanged in customary trade to rural residents may not exceed 50 percent of the annual harvest of salmon by the household. No more than 50 percent of the annual household limit may be sold under paragraphs (b)(11) and (12) of this section when taken together. These customary trade sales must be immediately recorded on a customary trade recordkeeping form. The recording requirement and the responsibility to ensure the household limit is not exceeded rests with the seller.</P>
            <P>(iii) Customary trade of Yukon River Chinook salmon may only occur between Federally qualified rural residents with a current customary and traditional use determination for Yukon River Chinook salmon.</P>
            <P>(12) <E T="03">Transactions between a rural resident and others.</E> In customary trade, a rural resident may exchange fish, their parts, or their eggs, legally taken under the regulations in this part, for cash from individuals other than rural residents if the individual who purchases the fish, their parts, or their eggs uses them for personal or family consumption. If you are not a rural resident, you may not sell fish, their parts, or their eggs taken under the regulations in this part. The Board may recognize regional differences and regulates customary trade differently for separate regions of the State.</P>
            <P>(i) Bristol Bay Fishery Management Area—The total cash value per household of salmon taken within Federal jurisdiction in the Bristol Bay Fishery Management Area and exchanged in customary trade between rural residents and individuals other than rural residents may not exceed $400.00 annually. These customary trade sales must be immediately recorded on a customary trade recordkeeping form. The recording requirement and the responsibility to ensure the household limit is not exceeded rest with the seller.</P>
            <P>(ii) Upper Copper River District—The total cash value of salmon per household taken within the Upper Copper River District and exchanged in customary trade between rural residents and individuals other than rural residents may not exceed $500.00 annually.

            <P>(iii) Customary trade of Yukon River Chinook salmon may only occur between Federally qualified rural residents with a current customary and traditional use determination for Yukon River Chinook salmon.</P>
            <P>(13) <E T="03">No sale to, nor purchase by, fisheries businesses.</E> (i) You may not sell fish, their parts, or their eggs taken under the regulations in this part to any individual, business, or organization required to be licensed as a fisheries business under Alaska Statute AS 43.75.011 (commercial limited-entry permit or crew license holders excluded) or to any other business as defined under Alaska Statute 43.70.110(1) as part of its business transactions.</P>
            <P>(ii) If you are required to be licensed as a fisheries business under Alaska Statute AS 43.75.011 (commercial limited-entry permit or crew license holders excluded) or are a business as defined under Alaska Statute 43.70.110(1), you may not purchase, receive, or sell fish, their parts, or their eggs taken under the regulations in this part as part of your business transactions.</P>

            <P>(14) Except as provided elsewhere in this section, you may not take rainbow/steelhead trout.<PRTPAGE P="318"/>
            </P>
            <P>(15) You may not use fish taken for subsistence use or under subsistence regulations in this part as bait for commercial or sport fishing purposes.</P>
            <P>(16) Unless specified otherwise in this section, you may use a rod and reel to take fish without a subsistence fishing permit. Harvest limits applicable to the use of a rod and reel to take fish for subsistence uses shall be as follows:</P>
            <P>(i) If you are required to obtain a subsistence fishing permit for an area, that permit is required to take fish for subsistence uses with rod and reel in that area. The harvest and possession limits for taking fish with a rod and reel in those areas are the same as indicated on the permit issued for subsistence fishing with other gear types.</P>
            <P>(ii) Except as otherwise provided for in this section, if you are not required to obtain a subsistence fishing permit for an area, the harvest and possession limits for taking fish for subsistence uses with a rod and reel are the same as for taking fish under State of Alaska subsistence fishing regulations in those same areas. If the State does not have a specific subsistence season and/or harvest limit for that particular species, the limit shall be the same as for taking fish under State of Alaska sport fishing regulations.</P>
            <P>(17) Unless restricted in this section, or unless restricted under the terms of a subsistence fishing permit, you may take fish for subsistence uses at any time.</P>
            <P>(18) Provisions on ADF&amp;G subsistence fishing permits that are more restrictive or in conflict with the provisions contained in this section do not apply to Federal subsistence users.</P>
            <P>(19) You may not intentionally waste or destroy any subsistence-caught fish or shellfish; however, you may use for bait or other purposes, whitefish, herring, and species for which harvest limits, seasons, or other regulatory methods and means are not provided in this section, as well as the head, tail, fins, and viscera of legally taken subsistence fish.</P>
            <P>(20) The taking of fish from waters within Federal jurisdiction is authorized outside of published open seasons or harvest limits if the harvested fish will be used for food in traditional or religious ceremonies that are part of funerary or mortuary cycles, including memorial potlatches, provided that:</P>
            <P>(i) Prior to attempting to take fish, the person (or designee) or Tribal Government organizing the ceremony contacts the appropriate Federal fisheries manager to provide the nature of the ceremony, the parties and/or clans involved, the species and the number of fish to be taken, and the Federal waters from which the harvest will occur;</P>
            <P>(ii) The taking does not violate recognized principles of fisheries conservation, and uses the methods and means allowable for the particular species published in the applicable Federal regulations (the Federal fisheries manager will establish the number, species, or place of taking if necessary for conservation purposes);</P>
            <P>(iii) Each person who takes fish under this section must, as soon as practical, and not more than 15 days after the harvest, submit a written report to the appropriate Federal fisheries manager, specifying the harvester's name and address, the number and species of fish taken, and the date and locations of the taking; and</P>
            <P>(iv) No permit is required for taking under this section; however, the harvester must be eligible to harvest the resource under Federal regulations.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Fishing permits and reports.</E> (1) You may take salmon only under the authority of a subsistence fishing permit, unless a permit is specifically not required in a particular area by the subsistence regulations in this part, or unless you are retaining salmon from your commercial catch consistent with paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) If a subsistence fishing permit is required by this section, the following permit conditions apply unless otherwise specified in this section:</P>
            <P>(i) You may not take more fish for subsistence use than the limits set out in the permit;</P>
            <P>(ii) You must obtain the permit prior to fishing;</P>
            <P>(iii) You must have the permit in your possession and readily available for inspection while fishing or transporting subsistence-taken fish;</P>

            <P>(iv) If specified on the permit, you must record, prior to leaving the fishing site, daily records of the catch, showing the number of fish taken by <PRTPAGE P="319"/>species, location and date of catch, and other such information as may be required for management or conservation purposes; and</P>
            <P>(v) If the return of catch information necessary for management and conservation purposes is required by a fishing permit and you fail to comply with such reporting requirements, you are ineligible to receive a subsistence permit for that activity during the following calendar year, unless you demonstrate that failure to report was due to loss in the mail, accident, sickness, or other unavoidable circumstances. You must also return any tags or transmitters that have been attached to fish for management and conservation purposes.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Relation to commercial fishing activities.</E> (1) If you are a Federally qualified subsistence user who also commercial fishes, you may retain fish for subsistence purposes from your lawfully-taken commercial catch.</P>
            <P>(2) When participating in a commercial and subsistence fishery at the same time, you may not use an amount of combined fishing gear in excess of that allowed under the appropriate commercial fishing regulations.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Management of Municipal Watersheds.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Forest Service shall manage National Forest watersheds that supply municipal water under multiple use prescriptions in forest plans (36 CFR part 219). When a municipality desires protective actions or restrictions of use not specified in the forest plan, within agreements, and/or special use authorizations, the municipality must apply to the Forest Service for consideration of these needs.</P>
              <P>(b) When deemed appropriate by the Regional Forester, requested restrictions and/or requirements shall be incorporated in the forest plan without written agreements. Written agreements with municipalities to assure protection of water supplies are appropriate when requested by the municipality and deemed necessary by the Regional Forester. A special use authorization may be needed to effect these agreements.</P>
              <P>(c) In preparing any municipal watershed agreement for approval by the Regional Forester or issuing special use authorization to protect municipal water supplies, the authorized forest officer shall specify the types of uses, if any, to be restricted; the nature and extent of any restrictions; any special land management protective measures and/or any necessary standards and guidelines needed to protect water quality or quantity; and any resources that are to be provided by the municipality.</P>
              <P>(d) A special use authorization (36 CFR 251.54) is required if the municipality is to use the subject lands, restrict public access, or control resource uses within the watershed. Special use authorizations issued pursuant to this section are subject to the same fee waivers, conditions, and procedures applicable to all other special uses as set forth in subpart B of this part.</P>
              <P>(e) Any municipal watershed management agreements, special use authorizations, requirements, and/or restrictions shall be consistent with forest plans, or amendments and revisions thereto.</P>

              <P>(a) Whoever locates a mining claim within the Norbeck Wildlife Preserve must, within 10 days after posting the location notice upon such claim, file a true copy of such location notice with the Forest Supervisor of the Black Hills National Forest at Custer, South Dakota, and further, within 10 days after said location notice is filed for record pursuant to the State laws of South Dakota, a true copy of the recorded location certificate must be filed with said Forest Supervisor.<PRTPAGE P="345"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) All mining locators shall in all developments and operations make all reasonable provisions for the disposal of tailings, dumpage, and other deleterious materials or substances in such manner as to prevent obstruction, pollution, or deterioration of the land, streams, ponds, lakes, or springs, as may be directed by the Forest Supervisor.</P>
              <P>(c) All slash resulting from cutting or destruction of forest growth incident and necessary to mining operations must be disposed of as directed by the Forest Supervisor.</P>

              <P>(e) No use of the surface of a mining claim or the resources therefrom not reasonably required for carrying on mining and prospecting shall be allowed, except under the National Forest rules and regulations, nor shall the locator prevent or obstruct other occupancy of the surface or use of surface resources under authority of National Forest Regulations, or permits issued thereunder, if such occupancy or use is not in conflict with mineral developments.</P>
              <P>(f) When any road is to be built for mining purposes upon a mining claim, the locator must apply to the Forest Supervisor for the applicable rules and regulations governing the construction and maintenance of roads within the Black Hills National Forest, and such road will be built in accordance with such specifications and in such locations as the Forest Supervisor may direct.</P>

              <P>(g) In conducting mining operations the locator, his agents, representatives, or employees, or other persons whose presence in the area or in the vicinity thereof, is occasioned by such mining operations, shall use due diligence in the prevention and suppression of fires, and shall, when requested by the Forest Supervisor, or his authorized representative, be available for service in the extinguishment and suppression of all fires occurring within the Preserve: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That if such fire does not originate through any negligence on the part of the locator, his agents, representatives, or employees, or other persons whose presence in the area or in the vicinity thereof, is occasioned by such mining operations and does not threaten the structures, improvements or property incident to the mining operation, such persons shall be paid for their services at the current rate of pay of fire fighters employed by the United States.</P>
              <P>(h) Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to relieve the locator from complying with any requirements of the laws of the State of South Dakota, nor from compliance with or conformity to any requirements of any Federal law or regulation now existing or which later may be enacted or promulgated, and applicable to the subject involved in this section.</P>

              <P>(a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, in conveyance of lands to the United States under authorized programs of the Forest Service, where owners reserve the right to enter upon the conveyed lands and to cut and remove timber and timber products, said reservations shall be subject to the following conditions, rules and regulations which shall be expressed in and made a part of the deed of conveyance to the United States and such reservations shall be exercised thereunder and in obedience thereto:</P>

              <P>(1) Whoever undertakes to exercise the reserved rights, hereinafter called operator, shall give prior written notice to Forest Service and shall submit satisfactory evidence of authority to exercise such rights. Operator shall repair, replace, or restore any improvements owned by the United States or its permittees, damaged or destroyed by the timber operations and he shall <PRTPAGE P="346"/>restore the land to a condition safe and reasonably serviceable for authorized programs of Forest Service.</P>
              <P>(2) In cutting and removing timber and timber products and in locating, constructing and using mills, logging roads, railroads, chutes, landings, camps, or other improvements, no unnecessary damage shall be done to the air, water and soil resources, and to young growth or to trees left standing. All survey monuments and witness trees shall be preserved.</P>
              <P>(3) All trees, timber or timber products of species or sizes not specifically reserved which are unnecessarily cut, damaged, or destroyed by operator shall be paid for at double the usual rates charged in the locality for sales of similar National Forest timber and timber products.</P>
              <P>(4) Slash and debris resulting from the cutting, removal, or processing of timber or timber products, or from construction operations, shall be disposed of or otherwise treated by methods acceptable to the Forest Service. Such treatment or disposal shall comply with known air and water quality criteria and standards and include necessary preparatory work such as fireline constructing and snag falling. The timing of log removal and preparatory work shall not unnecessarily delay slash disposal or treatment.</P>
              <P>(5) Operator is authorized to construct and maintain buildings, facilities, and other improvements, including roads needed to log the reserved timber. Construction and maintenance plans, designs, and location shall be approved in writing by Forest Service before construction is started.</P>
              <P>(6) All buildings, camps, equipment, and other structures or improvements shall be removed from the lands within 6 months from date of completion or abandonment of the operation, unless relieved by Forest Service by issuance of a special-use permit. Otherwise such buildings, camps, equipment, and other structures or improvements shall become the property of the United States, but this does not relieve operator of liability for the cost of removal and restoration of the site.</P>
              <P>(7) Nothing in this section shall be construed to exempt operator from any requirements of the laws of the States in which situated; nor from compliance with or conformity to any requirement of any law which later may be enacted and which otherwise would be applicable.</P>
              <P>(8) While operations are in progress, operator, his employees, any subcontractors, and their employees, shall take all reasonable and practicable action in the prevention and suppression of fire, and shall be available for service in the suppression of all fires within the reserved area. On any fire not caused by negligence on the part of the operator, Forest Service shall pay operator at fire-fighting rates common in the area or at prior agreed rates for equipment or manpower furnished by operator.</P>
              <P>(9) Only one cutting shall be made on any portion of the area on which timber is reserved. Forest Service may permit the cutting of special products, or products the cutting of which is seasonal, on any portion of the area in advance of the cutting of the chief products of the reserved timber. Each reservation of timber shall include a specific period of time within which material may be removed.</P>
              <P>(10) Forest Service shall have the right to use any road constructed under the authority of this timber reservation for any and all purposes in connection with the protection and administration of the National Forest.</P>
              <P>(11) Operator shall take all reasonable precautions to prevent pollution of the air, soil, and water, in operation hereunder.</P>
              <P>(12) All activities by operator in the reserved area shall be conducted in a safe, orderly, and workmanlike manner.</P>

              <P>(13) For the protection of streamcourses, the following measures shall be observed by operator: Culverts or bridges will be required on temporary roads at all points where it is necessary to cross streamcourses. Such facilities shall be of sufficient size and design to provide unobstructed flow of water. Equipment will not be operated in streamcourses except at designated crossings and as essential to construction or removal of culverts and bridges. Any stream that is temporarily diverted must be restored to the natural course as soon as practicable, and in <PRTPAGE P="347"/>any event prior to a major runoff season.</P>
              <P>(14) Operator shall perform currently as weather and soil conditions permit, the following erosion control work on portions of the reserved area where logging is in progress or has been completed: Construct cross-ditches and water-spreading ditches where staked or otherwise marked on the ground by Forest Service; after a temporary road has served operator's purpose, operator shall remove culverts and bridges, eliminate ditches, out-slope and cross-drain roadbed and remove ruts and berms to the extent necessary to stabilize fills and otherwise minimize erosion; operator shall avoid felling into, yarding in, or crossing natural meadows; and operations will not take place when soil and water conditions are such that excessive damage will result.</P>
              <P>(b) The conditions, rules and regulations set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) through (14) of this section shall not apply to reservations contained in conveyances of land to the United States under the Act of March 3, 1925, as amended (43 Stat. 1133, 64 Stat. 82, 16 U.S.C. 555).</P>
              <P>(c) In cases where a State, or an agency, or a political subdivision thereof, reserves timber rights for the cutting and removal of timber and timber products, in the conveyance of land to the United States under authorized programs of the Forest Service and there are provisions in the laws of such State or in conditions, rules and regulations promulgated by such State, agency or political subdivision thereof, which the Chief, Forest Service, determines are adequate to protect the interest of the United States in the event of the exercise of such reservation, the Chief, Forest Service, is hereby authorized, in his discretion, to subject the exercise of the reservation to such statutory provisions or such conditions, rules, and regulations in lieu of the conditions, rules and regulations set forth in paragraphs (a) (1) through (14) of this section. In that event, such statutory provisions or such conditions, rules and regulations shall be expressed in and made a part of the deed of conveyance to the United States and the reservation shall be exercised thereunder and in obedience thereto.</P>

              <P>(2)(i) None of the lands in which minerals are reserved shall be so used, occupied, or disturbed as to preclude their full use for authorized programs of the Forest Service until the record owner of the reserved rights, or the successors, assigns, or lessees thereof, shall have applied for and received a permit authorizing such use, occupancy, or disturbance of those specifically described parts of the lands as may reasonably be necessary to exercise of the reserved rights.<PRTPAGE P="348"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) Said permit shall be issued upon agreement as to conditions necessary to protect the interest of the United States including such conditions deemed necessary to provide for the safety of the public and other users of the land, and upon initial payment of the annual fee, which shall be at the rate of $2 per acre or fraction of acre included in the permit.</P>
              <P>(iii) The permit shall also provide that the record owner of the reserved right or the successors, assigns, or lessees thereof, will repair or replace any improvements damaged or destroyed by the mining operations and restore the land to a condition safe and reasonably serviceable for authorized programs of the Forest Service, and shall provide for a bond in sufficient amount as determined necessary by the Forest Service to guarantee such repair, replacement or restoration.</P>
              <P>(iv) Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the permit shall be cause for revocation of all rights to use, occupy, or disturb the surface of the lands covered by the permit, but in the event of revocation, a new permit shall be issued upon application when the causes for revocation of the preceding permit have been satisfactorily remedied and the United States has been reimbursed for any damages it has incurred from the noncompliance.</P>
              <P>(3) All structures, other improvements, and materials shall be removed from the lands within one year after the date of revocation of the permit.</P>
              <P>(4) Timber and/or young growth cut or destroyed in connection with exercise of the reserved right shall be paid for at rates determined by the Forest Service to be fair and equitable for comparable timber and/or young growth in the locality.

            <P>(a) All uses of National Forest System lands, improvements, and resources, except those authorized by the regulations governing sharing use of roads (§ 212.9); grazing and livestock use (part 222); the sale and disposal of timber and special forest products, such as greens, mushrooms, and medicinal plants (part 223); and minerals (part 228) are designated “special uses.” Before conducting a special use, individuals or entities must submit a proposal to the authorized officer and must obtain a special use authorization from the authorized officer, unless that requirement is waived by paragraphs (c) through (e)(3) of this section.</P>

            <P>(b) Nothing in this section prohibits the temporary occupancy of National <PRTPAGE P="352"/>Forest System lands without a special use authorization when necessary for the protection of life and property in emergencies, if a special use authorization is applied for and obtained at the earliest opportunity, unless waived pursuant to paragraphs (c) through (e)(3) of this section. The authorized officer may, pursuant to § 251.56 of this subpart, impose in that authorization such terms and conditions as are deemed necessary or appropriate and may require changes to the temporary occupancy to conform to those terms and conditions. Those temporarily occupying National Forest System lands without a special use authorization assume liability, and must indemnify the United States, for all injury, loss, or damage arising in connection with the temporary occupancy.</P>
            <P>(c) A special use authorization is not required for noncommercial recreational activities, such as camping, picnicking, hiking, fishing, boating, hunting, and horseback riding, or for noncommercial activities involving the expression of views, such as assemblies, meetings, demonstrations, and parades, unless:</P>
            <P>(1) The proposed use is a noncommercial group use as defined in § 251.51 of this subpart;</P>
            <P>(2) The proposed use is still photography as defined in § 251.51 of this subpart; or</P>
            <P>(3) Authorization of that use is required by an order issued under § 261.50 or by a regulation issued under § 261.70 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(d) Travel on any National Forest System road shall comply with all Federal and State laws governing the road to be used and does not require a special use authorization, unless:</P>
            <P>(1) The travel is for the purpose of engaging in a noncommercial group use, outfitting or guiding, a recreation event, commercial filming, or still photography, as defined in § 251.51 of this subpart, or for a landowner's ingress or egress across National Forest System lands that requires travel on a National Forest System road that is not authorized for general public use under § 251.110(d) of this part; or</P>
            <P>(2) Authorization of that use is required by an order issued under § 261.50 or by a regulation issued under § 261.70 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(e) For proposed uses other than a noncommercial group use, a special use authorization is not required if, based upon review of a proposal, the authorized officer determines that the proposed use has one or more of the following characteristics:</P>
            <P>(1) The proposed use will have such nominal effects on National Forest System lands, resources, or programs that it is not necessary to establish terms and conditions in a special use authorization to protect National Forest System lands and resources or to avoid conflict with National Forest System programs or operations;</P>
            <P>(2) The proposed use is regulated by a State agency or another Federal agency in a manner that is adequate to protect National Forest System lands and resources and to avoid conflict with National Forest System programs or operations; or</P>
            <P>(3) The proposed use is not situated in a congressionally designated wilderness area, and is a routine operation or maintenance activity within the scope of a statutory right-of-way for a highway pursuant to R.S. 2477 (43 U.S.C. 932, repealed Oct. 21, 1976) or for a ditch or canal pursuant to R.S. 2339 (43 U.S.C. 661, as amended), or the proposed use is a routine operation or maintenance activity within the express scope of a documented linear right-of-way.</P>

            <P>(c) <E T="03">Rights of proponents.</E> A proposal to obtain a special use authorization does <PRTPAGE P="357"/>not grant any right or privilege to use National Forest System lands. Rights or privileges to occupy and use National Forest System lands under this subpart are conveyed only through issuance of a special use authorization.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Proposal content</E>—(1) <E T="03">Proponent identification.</E> Any proponent for a special use authorization must provide the proponent's name and mailing address, and, if the proponent is not an individual, the name and address of the proponent's agent who is authorized to receive notice of actions pertaining to the proposal.</P>

In addition, if requested by an authorized officer, a proponent in one of the following categories must furnish the information specified for that category:</P>
            <P>(A) If the proponent is a State or local government agency: a copy of the authorization under which the proposal is made;</P>
            <P>(B) If the proponent is a public corporation: the statute or other authority under which it was organized;</P>

            <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) The name and address of each affiliate of the entity;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) In the case of an affiliate which is controlled by the entity, the number of shares and the percentage of any class of voting stock of the affiliate that the entity owns either directly or indirectly; or</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) In the case of an affiliate which controls that entity, the number of shares and the percentage of any class of voting stock of that entity owned, either directly or indirectly by the affiliate; or</P>
            <P>(E) If the proponent is a partnership, association, or other unincorporated entity: a certified copy of the partnership agreement or other similar document, if any, creating the entity, or a certificate of good standing under the laws of the State.</P>

            <P>(4) <E T="03">Project description.</E> Except for requests for planning permits for a major development, a proponent must provide a project description, including maps and appropriate resource information, in sufficient detail to enable the authorized officer to determine the feasibility of a proposed project or activity, any benefits to be provided to the public, the safety of the proposal, the lands to be occupied or used, the terms and conditions to be included, and the proposal's compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and orders.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Additional information.</E> The authorized officer may require any other information and data necessary to determine feasibility of a project or activity <PRTPAGE P="358"/>proposed; compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and orders; compliance with requirements for associated clearances, certificates, permits, or licenses; and suitable terms and conditions to be included in the authorization. The authorized officer shall make requests for any additional information in writing.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Pre-application actions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Initial screening.</E> Upon receipt of a request for any proposed use other than for noncommercial group use, the authorized officer shall screen the proposal to ensure that the use meets the following minimum requirements applicable to all special uses:</P>
            <P>(i) The proposed use is consistent with the laws, regulations, orders, and policies establishing or governing National Forest System lands, with other applicable Federal law, and with applicable State and local health and sanitation laws.</P>
            <P>(ii) The proposed use is consistent or can be made consistent with standards and guidelines in the applicable forest land and resource management plan prepared under the National Forest Management Act and 36 CFR part 219.</P>
            <P>(iii) The proposed use will not pose a serious or substantial risk to public health or safety.</P>
            <P>(iv) The proposed use will not create an exclusive or perpetual right of use or occupancy.</P>
            <P>(v) The proposed use will not unreasonably conflict or interfere with administrative use by the Forest Service, other scheduled or authorized existing uses of the National Forest System, or use of adjacent non-National Forest System lands.</P>
            <P>(vi) The proponent does not have any delinquent debt owed to the Forest Service under terms and conditions of a prior or existing authorization, unless such debt results from a decision on an administrative appeal or from a fee review and the proponent is current with the payment schedule.</P>
            <P>(vii) The proposed use does not involve gambling or providing of sexually oriented commercial services, even if permitted under State law.</P>
            <P>(viii) The proposed use does not involve military or paramilitary training or exercises by private organizations or individuals, unless such training or exercises are federally funded.</P>
            <P>(ix) The proposed use does not involve disposal of solid waste or disposal of radioactive or other hazardous substances.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Results of initial screening.</E> Any proposed use other than a noncommercial group use that does not meet all of the minimum requirements of paragraphs (e)(1)(i)-(ix) of this section shall not receive further evaluation and processing. In such event, the authorized officer shall advise the proponent that the use does not meet the minimum requirements. If the proposal was submitted orally, the authorized officer may respond orally. If the proposal was made in writing, the authorized officer shall notify the proponent in writing that the proposed use does not meet the minimum requirements and shall simultaneously return the request.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Guidance and information to proponents.</E> For proposals for noncommercial group use as well as for those proposals that meet the minimum requirements of paragraphs (e)(1)(i)-(ix), the authorized officer, to the extent practicable, shall provide the proponent guidance and information on the following:</P>
            <P>(i) Possible land use conflicts as identified by review of forest land and resource management plans, landownership records, and other readily available sources;</P>
            <P>(ii) Proposal and application procedures and probable time requirements;</P>
            <P>(iii) Proponent qualifications;</P>
            <P>(iv) Applicable fees, charges, bonding, and/or security requirements;</P>
            <P>(v) Necessary associated clearances, permits, and licenses;</P>
            <P>(vi) Environmental and management considerations;</P>
            <P>(vii) Special conditions; and</P>
            <P>(viii) identification of on-the-ground investigations which will require temporary use permits.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Confidentiality.</E> If requested by the proponent, the authorized officer, or other Forest Service official, to the extent reasonable and authorized by law, shall hold confidential any project and program information revealed during pre-application contacts.<PRTPAGE P="359"/>
            </P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Second-level screening of proposed uses.</E> A proposal which passes the initial screening set forth in paragraph (e)(1) and for which the proponent has submitted information as required in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, proceeds to second-level screening and consideration. In order to complete this screening and consideration, the authorized officer may request such additional information as necessary to obtain a full description of the proposed use and its effects. An authorized officer shall reject any proposal, including a proposal for commercial group uses, if, upon further consideration, the officer determines that:</P>
            <P>(i) The proposed use would be inconsistent or incompatible with the purposes for which the lands are managed, or with other uses; or</P>
            <P>(ii) The proposed use would not be in the public interest; or</P>
            <P>(iii) The proponent is not qualified; or</P>
            <P>(iv) The proponent does not or cannot demonstrate technical or economic feasibility of the proposed use or the financial or technical capability to undertake the use and to fully comply with the terms and conditions of the authorization; or</P>
            <P>(v) There is no person or entity authorized to sign a special use authorization and/or there is no person or entity willing to accept responsibility for adherence to the terms and conditions of the authorization.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">NEPA compliance for second-level screening process.</E> A request for a special use authorization that does not meet the criteria established in paragraphs (e)(5)(i) through (e)(5)(v) of this section does not constitute an agency proposal as defined in 40 CFR 1508.23 and, therefore, does not require environmental analysis and documentation.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Special requirements for certain proposals</E>—(1) <E T="03">Oil and gas pipeline rights-of-way.</E> These proposals must include the citizenship of the proponent(s) and disclose the identity of its participants as follows:</P>
            <P>(i) Citizens of another country, the laws, customs, or regulations of which deny similar or like privileges to citizens or corporations of the United States, shall not own an appreciable interest in any oil and gas pipeline right-of-way or associated permit; and</P>
            <P>(ii) The authorized officer shall promptly notify the House Committee on Resources and the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources upon receipt of a proposal for a right-of-way for a pipeline 24 inches or more in diameter, and no right-of-way for that pipeline shall be granted until notice of intention to grant the right-of-way, together with the authorized officer's detailed findings as to the term and conditions the authorized officer proposes to impose, have been submitted to the committees.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Major development.</E> Proponents of a major development may submit a request for a planning permit of up to 10 years in duration. Requests for a planning permit must include the information contained in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(3) of this section. Upon completion of a master development plan developed under a planning permit, proponents may then submit a request for a long-term authorization to construct and operate the development. At a minimum, a request for a long-term permit for a major development must include the information contained in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2)(ii) through (d)(5) of this section. Issuance of a planning permit does not prejudice approval or denial of a subsequent request for a special use permit for the development.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Application processing and response</E>—(1) <E T="03">Acceptance of applications.</E> Except for proposals for noncommercial group uses, if a request does not meet the criteria of both screening processes or is subsequently denied, the proponent must be notified with a written explanation of the rejection or denial and any written proposal returned to the proponent. If a request for a proposed use meets the criteria of both the initial and second-level screening processes as described in paragraph (e) of this section, the authorized officer shall notify the proponent that the agency is prepared to accept a written formal application for a special use authorization and shall, as appropriate or necessary, provide the proponent guidance and information of the type described in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) through (e)(3)(viii) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="360"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Processing applications.</E> (i) Upon acceptance of an application for a special use authorization other than a planning permit, the authorized officer shall evaluate the proposed use for the requested site, including effects on the environment. The authorized officer may request such additional information as necessary to obtain a full description of the proposed use and its effects.</P>
            <P>(ii) Federal, State, and local government agencies and the public shall receive adequate notice and an opportunity to comment upon a special use proposal accepted as a formal application in accordance with Forest Service NEPA procedures.</P>
            <P>(iii) The authorized officer shall give due deference to the findings of another agency such as a Public Utility Commission, the Federal Regulatory Energy Commission, or the Interstate Commerce Commission in lieu of another detailed finding. If this information is already on file with the Forest Service, it need not be refiled, if reference is made to the previous filing date, place, and case number.</P>
            <P>(iv) Applications for noncommercial group uses must be received at least 72 hours in advance of the proposed activity. Applications for noncommercial group uses shall be processed in order of receipt, and the use of a particular area shall be allocated in order of receipt of fully executed applications, subject to any relevant limitations set forth in this section.</P>
            <P>(v) For applications for planning permits, including those issued for a major development as described in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, the authorized officer shall assess only the applicant's financial and technical qualifications and determine compliance with other applicable laws, regulations, and orders. Planning permits may be categorically excluded from documentation in an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement pursuant to Forest Service Handbook 1909.15 (36 CFR 200.4).</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Response to applications for noncommercial group uses.</E> (i) All applications for noncommercial group uses shall be deemed granted and an authorization shall be issued for those uses pursuant to the determination as set forth below, unless applications are denied within 48 hours of receipt. Where an application for a noncommercial group use has been granted or is deemed to have been granted and an authorization has been issued under this paragraph, an authorized officer may revoke that authorization only as provided under § 251.60(a)(1)(i).</P>
            <P>(ii) An authorized officer shall grant an application for a special use authorization for a noncommercial group use upon a determination that:</P>
            <P>(A) Authorization of the proposed activity is not prohibited by the rules at 36 CFR part 261, subpart B, or by Federal, State, or local law unrelated to the content of expressive activity;</P>
            <P>(B) Authorization of the proposed activity is consistent or can be made consistent with the standards and guidelines in the applicable forest land and resource management plan required under the National Forest Management Act and 36 CFR part 219;</P>
            <P>(C) The proposed activity does not materially impact the characteristics or functions of the environmentally sensitive resources or lands identified in Forest Service Handbook 1909.15, chapter 30;</P>
            <P>(D) The proposed activity will not delay, halt, or prevent administrative use of an area by the Forest Service or other scheduled or existing uses or activities on National Forest System lands, including but not limited to uses and activities authorized under parts 222, 223, 228, and 251 of this chapter;</P>
            <P>(E) The proposed activity does not violate State and local public health laws and regulations as applied to the proposed site. Issues addressed by State and local public health laws and regulations as applied to the proposed site include but are not limited to:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The sufficiency of sanitation facilities;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The sufficiency of waste-disposal facilities;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) The availability of sufficient potable drinking water;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) The risk of disease from the physical characteristics of the proposed site or natural conditions associated with the proposed site; and</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) The risk of contamination of the water supply;<PRTPAGE P="361"/>
            </P>
            <P>(F) The proposed activity will not pose a substantial danger to public safety. Considerations of public safety must not include concerns about possible reaction to the users' identity or beliefs from non-members of the group that is seeking an authorization and shall be limited to the following:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The potential for physical injury to other forest users from the proposed activity;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The potential for physical injury to users from the physical characteristics of the proposed site or natural conditions associated with the proposed site;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) The potential for physical injury to users from scheduled or existing uses or activities on National Forest System lands; and</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) The adequacy of ingress and egress in case of an emergency;</P>
            <P>(G) The proposed activity does not involve military or paramilitary training or exercises by private organizations or individuals, unless such training or exercises are federally funded; and</P>
            <P>(H) A person or persons 21 years of age or older have been designated to sign and do sign a special use authorization on behalf of the applicant.</P>
            <P>(iii) If an authorized officer denies an application because it does not meet the criteria in paragraphs (g)(3)(ii)(A) through (g)(3)(ii)(H) of this section, the authorized officer shall notify the applicant in writing of the reasons for the denial. If an alternative time, place, or manner will allow the applicant to meet the eight evaluation criteria, an authorized officer shall offer that alternative. If an application is denied solely under paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(C) of this section and all alternatives suggested are unacceptable to the applicant, the authorized officer shall offer to have completed the requisite environmental and other analyses for the requested site. A decision to grant or deny the application for which an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement is prepared is subject to the notice and appeal procedures at 36 CFR part 215 and shall be made within 48 hours after the decision becomes final under that appeal process. A denial of an application in paragraphs (g)(3)(ii)(A) through (g)(3)(ii)(H) of this section constitutes final agency action, is not subject to administrative appeal, and is immediately subject to judicial review.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Response to all other applications.</E> Based on evaluation of the information provided by the applicant and other relevant information such as environmental findings, the authorized officer shall decide whether to approve the proposed use, approve the proposed use with modifications, or deny the proposed use. A group of applications for similar uses having minor environmental impacts may be evaluated with one analysis and approved in one decision.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Authorization of a special use.</E> Upon a decision to approve a special use or a group of similar special uses, the authorized officer may issue one or more special use authorizations as defined in § 251.51 of this subpart.</P>

            <P>(a) A holder is authorized only to occupy such land and structures and conduct such activities as is specified in the special use authorization. The holder may sublet the use and occupancy of the premises and improvements authorized only with the prior written approval of the authorized officer, but the holder shall continue to be responsible for compliance with all conditions of the special use authorization.</P>

            <P>(b) All rights not expressly granted are retained by the United States, including but not limited to (1) continuing rights of access to all National Forest System land (including the subsurface and air space); (2) a continuing right of physical entry to any part of the authorized facilities for inspection, monitoring, or for any other purposes or reason consistent with any right or obligation of the United States under any law or regulation; and (3) the right to require common use of the land or to authorize the use by others in any way not inconsistent with a holder's existing rights and privileges after consultation with all parties and agencies involved. When costs can be feasibly allocated and have not been amortized, a <PRTPAGE P="362"/>new holder may be required to compensate existing holders for an equitable proportion of the original costs or other expense associated with the common use.</P>
            <P>(c) Special use authorizations are subject to all outstanding valid rights.</P>
            <P>(d) Each special use authorization will specify the lands to be used or occupied which shall be limited to that which the authorized officer determines: (1) Will be occupied by the facilities authorized; (2) to be necessary for the construction, operation, maintenance, and full utilization of the authorized facilities or the conduct of authorized activities; and, (3) to be necessary to protect the public health and safety and the environment.</P>
            <P>(e) The holder will secure permission under applicable law, and pay in advance, the value as determined by the authorized officer for any mineral and vegetative materials (including timber) to be cut, removed, used, or destroyed by the holder from the authorized use area or other National Forest System land. The authorized officer may, in lieu of requiring an advance payment, require the holder to stockpile or stack the material at designated locations for later disposal by the United States.</P>

              <P>The Department is making explicit its preexisting understanding of § 251.56(a)(1)(ii)(G) of this subpart in the context of authorizing noncommercial group uses of National Forest System lands. Section 251.56(a)(1)(ii)(G) provides that each special use authorization shall contain such terms and conditions as the authorized officer deems necessary to otherwise protect the public interest. In the context of noncommercial group uses, the Forest Service interprets the term “public interest” found in § 251.56(a)(1)(ii)(G) to refer to the three public interests identified by the Forest Service on August 30, 1995. These public interests include the protection of resources and improvements on National Forest System lands, the allocation of space among potential or existing uses and activities, and public health and safety concerns. Under this construction, § 251.56(a)(1)(ii)(G) allows the Forest Service to impose terms and conditions that are not specifically addressed in § 251.56(a)(1)(ii)(A)-(F) but only those that further these public interests. The Forest Service shall implement and enforce § 251.56(a)(1)(ii)(G) in accordance with this interpretation.</P>
            </NOTE>
            
            <P>(2) Authorizations for use of National Forest System lands may be conditioned to require State, county, or other Federal agency licenses, permits, certificates, or other approval documents, such as a Federal Communication Commission license, a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission license, a State water right, or a county building permit.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Duration and renewability</E>—(1) <E T="03">Requirements.</E> If appropriate, each special use authorization will specify its duration and renewability. The duration shall be no longer than the authorized officer determines to be necessary to <PRTPAGE P="363"/>accomplish the purpose of the authorization and to be reasonable in light of all circumstances concerning the use, including</P>
            <P>(i) Resource management direction contained in land management and other plans;</P>
            <P>(ii) Public benefits provided;</P>
            <P>(iii) Cost and life expectancy of the authorized facilities;</P>
            <P>(iv) Financial arrangements for the project; and</P>
            <P>(v) The life expectancy of associated facilities, licenses, etc. Except for special use authorizations issued under the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986, authorizations exceeding 30 years shall provide for revision of terms and conditions at specified intervals to reflect changing times and conditions.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Ski area permits.</E> (i) For authorizations issued under the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986, the authorized officer normally shall issue a ski area authorization for 40 years, if, upon consideration of information submitted by the applicant, the authorized officer finds that the ski area development meets the following standards:</P>
            <P>(A) In the case of an existing permit holder, existing on-site investment is of sufficient magnitude to justify authorization for 40 years;</P>
            <P>(B) In the case of an existing permit holder, existing investment of capital is in ski-related facilities;</P>
            <P>(C) Planned investment capital is directly related to development of ski area facilities and is not for financing regular, ongoing operation and maintenance costs;</P>
            <P>(D) Ski facilities requiring long-term investment are, or will be, located predominately on land authorized under a permit;</P>
            <P>(E) The number and magnitude of planned facilities, as detailed in a Master Development Plan, clearly require long-term financing and/or operation;</P>
            <P>(F) The United States is not the owner of the principal facilities within the authorized ski area.</P>
            <P>(ii) A term of less than 40 years shall be authorized for a ski area when the applicant requests a shorter term or when, in the authorized officer's discretion:</P>
            <P>(A) Analysis of the information submitted by the applicant indicates that a shorter term is sufficient for financing of the ski area;</P>
            <P>(B) The ski area development, whether existing or proposed, does not meet the standards of paragraph (2)(i)(A) through (F) of this section; or</P>
            <P>(C) A 40-year authorization would be inconsistent with the approved forest land and resource management plan governing the area (36 CFR part 219).</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Preconstruction approvals.</E> Forest Service approval of location, design and plans (or standards, if appropriate) of all developments within the authorized area will be required prior to construction.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Liability.</E> Holders shall pay the United States for all injury, loss, or damage, including fire suppression costs, in accordance with existing Federal and State laws.</P>
            <P>(1) Holders shall also indemnify the United States for any and all injury, loss, or damage, including fire suppression costs, the United States may suffer as a result of claims, demands, losses, or judgments caused by the holder's use or occupancy.</P>
            <P>(2) Holders of special use authorizations for high risk use and occupancy, such as, but not limited to, powerlines and oil and gas pipelines, shall be held liable for all injury, loss, or damage, including fire suppression costs, caused by the holder's use or occupancy, without regard to the holder's negligence, provided that maximum liability shall be specified in the special use authorization as determined by a risk assessment, prepared in accordance with established agency procedures, but shall not exceed $1,000,000 for any one occurrence. Liability for injury, loss, or damage, including fire suppression costs, in excess of the specified maximum shall be determined by the laws governing ordinary negligence of the jurisdiction in which the damage or injury occurred.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Bonding.</E> An authorized officer may require the holder of a special use authorization for other than a noncommercial group use to furnish a bond or other security to secure all or any of the obligations imposed by the terms of the authorization or by any applicable law, regulation or order.<PRTPAGE P="364"/>
            </P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Special terms and conditions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Public service enterprises.</E> Special use permits authorizing the operation of public service enterprises shall require that the permittee charge reasonable rates and furnish such services as may be necessary in the public interest, except where such rates and services are regulated by Federal, State or municipal agencies having jurisdiction.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Common carriers.</E> Oil and gas pipelines and related facilities authorized under section 28 of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, 41 Stat. 449, as amended (30 U.S.C. 185), shall be constructed, operated and maintained as common carriers. The owners or operators of pipelines shall accept, convey, transport, or purchase without discrimination all oil or gas delivered to the pipeline without regard to whether such oil or gas was produced on Federal or nonfederal lands. In the case of oil or gas produced from Federal lands or from the resources on the Federal lands in the vicinity of the pipeline, the Secretary may, after a full hearing with due notice thereof to interested parties and a proper finding of facts, determine the proportionate amounts to be accepted, conveyed, transported, or purchased. The common carrier provisions of this section shall not apply to any natural gas pipeline operated (i) by any person subject to regulation under the Natural Gas Act, 52 Stat. 821, as amended, (15 U.S.C. 717) or (ii) by any public utility subject to regulation by a State or municipal regulatory agency having jurisdiction to regulate the rates and charges for the sale of natural gas to consumers within the State or municipality. Where natural gas not subject to State regulatory or conservation laws governing its purchase by pipeline companies is offered for sale, each pipeline company shall purchase, without discrimination, any such natural gas produced in the vicinity of the pipeline.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Conversion of Ski Area Authorizations.</E> (1) The Forest Service shall request that all existing permit holders convert existing authorizations for ski areas to a new authorization issued pursuant to the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act.</P>
            <P>(2) Any current holder of a ski area permit who wishes to convert an existing permit to one issued pursuant to the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act must submit a written request for the new authorization to the authorized officer.</P>
            <P>(3) With the consent of the holder, the authorized officer shall convert the authorization if:</P>
            <P>(i) The holder is in compliance with the existing authorization;</P>
            <P>(ii) All fees currently due under the existing authorization are paid in full; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Any proposed modifications of terms and conditions of the existing authorization included in a request for conversion meet the standards of paragraphs (2)(i) (A) through (F) of this section and the relevant requirements of this subpart.</P>
            <P>(4) A holder retains the right to decline a new authorization offered pursuant to this paragraph and to continue to operate under the terms of the existing permit. However, pursuant to the rules at § 251.61 of this subpart, major modifications of existing permits shall require conversion to a permit issued under the authority of the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act, unless the holder provides compelling justification for retaining the existing permit.</P>

            <P>(a) Except as otherwise provided in this part or when specifically authorized by the Secretary of Agriculture, special use authorizations shall require the payment in advance of an annual rental fee as determined by the authorized officer.</P>
            <P>(1) The fee shall be based on the fair market value of the rights and privileges authorized, as determined by appraisal or other sound business management principles.</P>

            <P>(2) Where annual fees of one hundred dollars ($100) or less are assessed, the authorized officer may require either annual payment or a payment covering more than one year at a time. If the annual fee is greater than one hundred dollars ($100), holders who are private <PRTPAGE P="365"/>individuals (that is, acting in an individual capacity), as opposed to those who are commercial, other corporate, or business or government entities, may, at their option, elect to make either annual payments or payments covering more than one year.</P>
            <P>(3) A base cabin user fee for a recreation residence use shall be 5 percent of the market value of the recreation residence lot, established by an appraisal conducted in accordance with the Act of October 11, 2000 (16 U.S.C. 6201-13).</P>
            <P>(b) All or part of the fee may be waived by the authorized officer, when equitable and in the public interest, for the use and occupancy of National Forest System land in the following circumstances:</P>
            <P>(1) The holder is a State or local government or any agency or instrumentality thereof, excluding municipal utilities and cooperatives whose principal source of revenue from the authorized use is customer charges; or</P>
            <P>(2) The holder is a nonprofit association or nonprofit corporation, which is not controlled or owned by profit-making corporations or business enterprises, and which is engaged in public or semi-public activity to further public health, safety, or welfare, except that free use will not be authorized when funds derived by the holder through the authorization are used to increase the value of the authorized improvements owned by the holder, or are used to support other activities of the holder; or</P>
            <P>(3) The holder provides without charge, or at reduced charge, a valuable benefit to the public or to the programs of the Secretary; or</P>
            <P>(4) When the rental fee is included in the fees for an authorized use or occupancy for which the United States is already receiving compensation; or</P>
            <P>(5) When a right-of-way is authorized in reciprocation for a right-of-way conveyed to the United States; or</P>
            <P>(6) For rights-of-way involving cost-share roads or reciprocal right-of-way agreements.</P>
            <P>(c) No rental fee will be charged when the holder is the Federal government.</P>
            <P>(d) No fee shall be charged when the authorization is for a noncommercial group use as defined in § 251.51 of this subpart.</P>
            <P>(e) Special use authorizations issued under § 251.53(g) of this part may require as all or a part of the consideration the reconditioning and maintenance of the government-owned or controlled structures, improvements, and land to a satisfactory standard. The total consideration will be based upon the fair market value of the rights and privileges authorized.</P>
            <P>(f) Special use authorizations involving government-owned or controlled buildings, structures, or other improvements which require caretakers' services, or the furnishing of special services such as water, electric lights, and clean-up, may require the payment of an additional fee or charge to cover the cost of such services.</P>
            <P>(g) Except where specified otherwise by terms of a special use authorization, rental fees may be initiated or adjusted whenever necessary: (1) As a result of fee review, reappraisal; or (2) upon a change in the holder's qualifications under paragraph (b) of this section; and (3) notice is given prior to initiating or adjusting rental fees.</P>
            <P>(h) Each ski area authorization issued under the authority of the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act shall include a clause that provides that the Forest Service may adjust and calculate future rental fees to reflect Agency revisions to the existing system for determining fees based on fair market value or to comply with any new fee system for determining fees based on fair market value that may be adopted after issuance of the authorization.</P>
            <P>(i) Each permit or term permit for a recreation residence use shall include a clause stating that the Forest Service shall recalculate the base cabin user fee at least every 10 years and shall use an appraisal to recalculate that fee as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Assessment of fees to recover agency processing and monitoring costs.</E> The Forest Service shall assess fees to recover <PRTPAGE P="366"/>the agency's processing costs for special use applications and monitoring costs for special use authorizations. Applicants and holders shall submit sufficient information for the authorized officer to estimate the number of hours required to process their applications or monitor their authorizations. Cost recovery fees are separate from any fees charged for the use and occupancy of National Forest System lands.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Special use applications and authorizations subject to cost recovery requirements.</E> Except as exempted in paragraphs (g)(1) through (g)(4) of this section, the cost recovery requirements of this section apply in the following situations to the processing of special use applications and monitoring of special use authorizations issued pursuant to this subpart:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Applications for use and occupancy that require a new special use authorization.</E> Fees for processing an application for a new special use authorization shall apply to any application formally accepted by the agency on or after March 23, 2006 and to any application formally accepted by the agency before March 23, 2006, which the agency has not commenced processing. Proposals accepted as applications which the agency has commenced processing prior to March 23, 2006 shall not be subject to processing fees. The cost recovery provisions of this section shall not apply to or supersede written agreements providing for recovery of processing costs executed by the agency and applicants prior to March 23, 2006.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Changes to existing authorizations.</E> Processing fees apply to proposals that require an application to amend or formally approve specific activities or facilities as identified in an existing authorization, operating plan, or master development plan. Processing fees also apply to agency actions to amend a special use authorization.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Agency actions to issue a special use authorization and applications for issuance of a new special use authorization due to termination of an existing authorization, including termination caused by expiration, a change in ownership or control of the authorized facilities, or a change in ownership or control of the holder of the authorization.</E> Upon termination of an existing authorization, a holder shall be subject to a processing fee for issuance of a new authorization, even if the holder's existing authorization does not require submission of an application for a new authorization.</P>
            <P>(4) Monitoring of authorizations issued or amended on or after March 23, 2006.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Processing fee requirements.</E> A processing fee is required for each application for or agency action to issue a special use authorization as identified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section. Processing fees do not include costs incurred by the applicant in providing information, data, and documentation necessary for the authorized officer to make a decision on the proposed use or occupancy pursuant to the provisions at § 251.54.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Basis for processing fees.</E> The processing fee categories 1 through 6 set out in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (c)(2)(vi) of this section are based upon the costs that the Forest Service incurs in reviewing the application, conducting environmental analyses of the effects of the proposed use, reviewing any applicant-generated environmental documents and studies, conducting site visits, evaluating an applicant's technical and financial qualifications, making a decision on whether to issue the authorization, and preparing documentation of analyses, decisions, and authorizations for each application. The processing fee for an application shall be based only on costs necessary for processing that application. “Necessary for” means that but for the application, the costs would not have been incurred and that the costs cover only those activities without which the application cannot be processed. The processing fee shall not include costs for studies for programmatic planning or analysis or other agency management objectives, unless they are necessary for the application being processed. For example, the processing fee shall not include costs for capacity studies, use allocation decisions, corridor or communications site planning, and biological studies that address species diversity, unless they are necessary for the application. Proportional costs for analyses, such as capacity studies, that are necessary for an application may be included in the <PRTPAGE P="367"/>processing fee for that application. The costs incurred for processing an application, and thus the processing fee, depend on the complexity of the project; the amount of information that is necessary for the authorized officer's decision in response to the proposed use and occupancy; and the degree to which the applicant can provide this information to the agency. Processing work conducted by the applicant or a third party contracted by the applicant minimizes the costs the Forest Service will incur to process the application, and thus reduces the processing fee. The total processing time is the total time estimated for all Forest Service personnel involved in processing an application and is estimated case by case to determine the fee category.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Processing fee determinations.</E> The applicable fee rate for processing applications in minor categories 1 through 4 (paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (c)(2)(iv) of this section) shall be assessed from a schedule. The processing fee for applications in category 5, which may be either minor or major, shall be established in the master agreement (paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section). For major category 5 (paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section) and category 6 (paragraph (c)(2)(vi) of this section) cases, the authorized officer shall estimate the agency's full actual processing costs. The estimated processing costs for category 5 and category 6 cases shall be reconciled as provided in paragraphs (c)(5)(ii) and (iii) and (c)(6)(ii) and (iii) of this section.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Reduction in processing fees for certain category 6 applications.</E> For category 6 applications submitted under authorities other than the Mineral Leasing Act, the applicant:</P>
            <P>(A) May request a reduction of the processing fee based upon the applicant's written analysis of actual costs, the monetary value of the rights and privileges sought, that portion of the costs incurred for the benefit of the general public interest, the public service provided, the efficiency of the agency processing involved, and other factors relevant to determining the reasonableness of the costs. The agency will determine whether the estimate of full actual costs should be reduced based upon this analysis and will notify the applicant in writing of this determination; or</P>
            <P>(B) May agree in writing to waive payment of reasonable costs and pay the actual costs incurred in processing the application.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Processing fee categories.</E> No fee is charged for applications taking 1 hour or less for the Forest Service to process. Applications requiring more than 1 hour for the agency to process are covered by the fee categories 1 through 6 set out in the following paragraphs i through vi.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Category 1: Minimal Impact: More than 1 hour and up to and including 8 hours.</E> The total estimated time in this minor category is more than 1 hour and up to and including 8 hours for Forest Service personnel to process an application.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Category 2: More than 8 and up to and including 24 hours.</E> The total estimated time in this minor category is more than 8 and up to and including 24 hours for Forest Service personnel to process an application.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Category 3: More than 24 and up to and including 36 hours.</E> The total estimated time in this minor category is more than 24 and up to and including 36 hours for Forest Service personnel to process an application.</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Category 4: More than 36 and up to and including 50 hours.</E> The total estimated time in this minor category is more than 36 and up to and including 50 hours for Forest Service personnel to process an application.</P>
            <P>(v) <E T="03">Category 5: Master agreements.</E> The Forest Service and the applicant may enter into master agreements for the agency to recover processing costs associated with a particular application, a group of applications, or similar applications for a specified geographic area. This category is minor if 50 hours or less are needed for Forest Service personnel to process an application and major if more than 50 hours are needed. In signing a master agreement for a major category application submitted under authorities other than the Mineral Leasing Act, an applicant waives the right to request a reduction of the processing fee based upon the reasonableness factors enumerated in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. A <PRTPAGE P="368"/>master agreement shall at a minimum include:</P>
            <P>(A) The fee category or estimated processing costs;</P>
            <P>(B) A description of the method for periodic billing, payment, and auditing;</P>
            <P>(C) A description of the geographic area covered by the agreement;</P>
            <P>(D) A work plan and provisions for updating the work plan;</P>
            <P>(E) Provisions for reconciling differences between estimated and final processing costs; and</P>
            <P>(F) Provisions for terminating the agreement.</P>
            <P>(vi) <E T="03">Category 6: More than 50 hours.</E> In this major category more than 50 hours are needed for Forest Service personnel to process an application. The authorized officer shall determine the issues to be addressed and shall develop preliminary work and financial plans for estimating recoverable costs.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Multiple applications other than those covered by master agreements (category 5).</E> (i) <E T="03">Unsolicited applications where there is no competitive interest.</E> Processing costs that are incurred in processing more than one of these applications (such as the cost of environmental analysis or printing an environmental impact statement that relates to all of the applications) must be paid in equal shares or on a prorated basis, as deemed appropriate by the authorized officer, by each applicant, including applicants for recreation special uses that are otherwise exempt under paragraph (g)(3) of this section when the Forest Service requires more than 50 hours in the aggregate to process the applications submitted in response to the prospectus.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Unsolicited proposals where competitive interest exists.</E> When there is one or more unsolicited proposals and the authorized officer determines that competitive interest exists, the agency shall issue a prospectus. All proposals accepted pursuant to that solicitation shall be processed as applications. The applicants are responsible for the costs of environmental analyses that are necessary for their applications and that are conducted prior to issuance of the prospectus. Processing fees for these cases shall be determined pursuant to the procedures for establishing a category 6 processing fee and shall include costs such as those incurred in printing and mailing the prospectus; having parties other than the Forest Service review and evaluate applications; establishing a case file; recording data; conducting financial reviews; and, for selected applicants, any additional environmental analysis required in connection with their applications. Processing fees shall be paid in equal shares or on a prorated basis, as deemed appropriate by the authorized officer, by all parties who submitted proposals that were processed as applications pursuant to the solicitation, including applicants for recreation special uses that are otherwise exempt under paragraph (g)(3) of this section when the Forest Service requires more than 50 hours in the aggregate to process the applications submitted in response to the prospectus.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Solicited applications.</E> When the Forest Service solicits applications through the issuance of a prospectus on its own initiative, rather than in response to an unsolicited proposal or proposals, the agency is responsible for the cost of environmental analyses conducted prior to issuance of the prospectus. All proposals accepted pursuant to that solicitation shall be processed as applications. Processing fees for these cases shall be determined pursuant to the procedures for establishing a category 6 processing fee and shall include costs such as those incurred in printing and mailing the prospectus; having parties other than the Forest Service review and evaluate applications; establishing a case file; recording data; conducting financial reviews; and, for selected applicants, any additional environmental analysis required in connection with their applications. Processing fees shall be paid in equal shares or on a prorated basis, as deemed appropriate by the authorized officer, by all parties who submitted proposals that were processed as applications pursuant to the solicitation, including applicants for recreation special uses that are otherwise exempt under paragraph (g)(3) of this section when the Forest Service requires more than 50 hours in the aggregate to process the applications submitted in response to the prospectus.<PRTPAGE P="369"/>
            </P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Billing and revision of processing fees.</E> (i) <E T="03">Billing.</E> When the Forest Service accepts a special use application, the authorized officer shall provide written notice to the applicant that the application has been formally accepted. The authorized officer shall not bill the applicant a processing fee until the agency is prepared to process the application.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Revision of processing fees.</E> Minor category processing fees shall not be reclassified into a higher minor category once the processing fee category has been determined. However, if the authorized officer discovers previously undisclosed information that necessitates changing a minor category processing fee to a major category processing fee, the authorized officer shall notify the applicant or holder of the conditions prompting a change in the processing fee category in writing before continuing with processing the application. The applicant or holder may accept the revised processing fee category and pay the difference between the previous and revised processing categories; withdraw the application; revise the project to lower the processing costs; or request review of the disputed fee as provided in paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(4) of this section.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Payment of processing fees.</E> (i) Payment of a processing fee shall be due within 30 days of issuance of a bill for the fee, pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section. The processing fee must be paid before the Forest Service can initiate or, in the case of a revised fee, continue with processing an application. Payment of the processing fee by the applicant does not obligate the Forest Service to authorize the applicant's proposed use and occupancy.</P>
            <P>(ii) For category 5 cases, when the estimated processing costs are lower than the final processing costs for applications covered by a master agreement, the applicant shall pay the difference between the estimated and final processing costs.</P>
            <P>(iii) For category 6 cases, when the estimated processing fee is lower than the full actual costs of processing an application submitted under the Mineral Leasing Act, or lower than the full reasonable costs (when the applicant has not waived payment of reasonable costs) of processing an application submitted under other authorities, the applicant shall pay the difference between the estimated and full actual or reasonable processing costs.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Refunds of processing fees.</E> (i) Processing fees in minor categories 1 through 4 are nonrefundable and shall not be reconciled.</P>
            <P>(ii) For category 5 cases, if payment of the processing fee exceeds the agency's final processing costs for the applications covered by a master agreement, the authorized officer either shall refund the excess payment to the applicant or, at the applicant's request, shall credit it towards monitoring fees due.</P>
            <P>(iii) For category 6 cases, if payment of the processing fee exceeds the full actual costs of processing an application submitted under the Mineral Leasing Act, or the full reasonable costs (when the applicant has not waived payment of reasonable costs) of processing an application submitted under other authorities, the authorized officer either shall refund the excess payment to the applicant or, at the applicant's request, shall credit it towards monitoring fees due.</P>
            <P>(iv) For major category 5 and category 6 applications, an applicant whose application is denied or withdrawn in writing is responsible for costs incurred by the Forest Service in processing the application up to and including the date the agency denies the application or receives written notice of the applicant's withdrawal. When an applicant withdraws a major category 5 or category 6 application, the applicant also is responsible for any costs subsequently incurred by the Forest Service in terminating consideration of the application.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Customer service standards.</E> The Forest Service shall endeavor to make a decision on an application that falls into minor processing category 1, 2, 3, or 4, and that is subject to a categorical exclusion pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act, within 60 calendar days from the date of receipt of the processing fee. If the application cannot be processed within the 60-day period, then prior to the 30th calendar day of the 60-day period, the authorized <PRTPAGE P="370"/>officer shall notify the applicant in writing of the reason why the application cannot be processed within the 60-day period and shall provide the applicant with a projected date when the agency plans to complete processing the application. For all other applications, including all applications that require an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement, the authorized officer shall, within 60 calendar days of acceptance of the application, notify the applicant in writing of the anticipated steps that will be needed to process the application. These customer service standards do not apply to applications that are subject to a waiver of or exempt from cost recovery fees under §§ 251.58(f) or (g).</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Monitoring fee requirements.</E> The monitoring fee for an authorization shall be assessed independently of any fee charged for processing the application for that authorization pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section. Payment of the monitoring fee is due upon issuance of the authorization.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Basis for monitoring fees.</E> Monitoring is defined at § 251.51. For monitoring fees in minor categories 1 through 4, authorization holders are assessed fees based upon the estimated time needed for Forest Service monitoring to ensure compliance with the authorization during the construction or reconstruction of temporary or permanent facilities and rehabilitation of the construction or reconstruction site. Major category 5 and category 6 monitoring fees shall be based upon the agency's estimated costs to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the authorization during all phases of its term, including but not limited to monitoring to ensure compliance with the authorization during the construction or reconstruction of temporary or permanent facilities and rehabilitation of the construction or reconstruction site. Monitoring for all categories does not include billings, maintenance of case files, annual performance evaluations, or scheduled inspections to determine compliance generally with the terms and conditions of an authorization.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Monitoring fee determinations.</E> The applicable fee rate for monitoring compliance with authorizations in minor categories 1 through 4 (paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (d)(2)(iv) of this section) shall be assessed from a schedule. The monitoring fee for authorizations in category 5, which may be minor or major, shall be established in the master agreement (paragraph (d)(2)(v) of this section). For major category 5 (paragraph (d)(2)(v) of this section) and category 6 (paragraph (d)(2)(vi) of this section) cases, the authorized officer shall estimate the agency's full actual monitoring costs. The estimated monitoring costs for category 5 and category 6 cases shall be reconciled as provided in paragraphs (d)(3)(ii) and (iii) and (d)(4)(ii) and (iii) of this section.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Reductions in monitoring fees for certain category 6 authorizations.</E> For category 6 authorizations issued under authorities other than the Mineral Leasing Act, the holder:</P>
            <P>(A) May request a reduction of the monitoring fee based upon the holder's written analysis of actual costs, the monetary value of the rights or privileges granted, that portion of the costs incurred for the benefit of the general public interest, the public service provided, the efficiency of the agency monitoring involved, and other factors relevant to determining the reasonableness of the costs. The agency will determine whether the estimate of full actual costs should be reduced based upon this analysis and will notify the holder in writing of this determination; or</P>
            <P>(B) May agree in writing to waive payment of reasonable costs and pay the actual costs incurred in monitoring the authorization.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Monitoring fee categories.</E> No monitoring fee is charged for authorizations requiring 1 hour or less for the Forest Service to monitor. Authorizations requiring more than1 hour for the agency to monitor are covered by fee categories 1 through 6 set out in the following paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (vi) of this section.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Category 1: Minimal Impact: More than 1 hour and up to and including 8 hours.</E> This minor category requires more than1 hour and up to and including 8 hours for Forest Service personnel to monitor compliance with a <PRTPAGE P="371"/>special use authorization during construction or reconstruction of temporary or permanent facilities and rehabilitation of the construction or reconstruction site.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Category 2: More than 8 and up to and including 24 hours.</E> This minor category requires more than 8 and up to and including 24 hours for Forest Service personnel to monitor compliance with a special use authorization during construction or reconstruction of temporary or permanent facilities and rehabilitation of the construction or reconstruction site.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Category 3: More than 24 and up to and including 36 hours.</E> This minor category requires more than 24 and up to and including 36 hours for Forest Service personnel to monitor compliance with a special use authorization during construction or reconstruction of temporary or permanent facilities and rehabilitation of the construction or reconstruction site.</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Category 4: More than 36 and up to and including 50 hours.</E> This minor category requires more than 36 and up to and including 50 hours for Forest Service personnel to monitor compliance with a special use authorization during construction or reconstruction of temporary or permanent facilities and rehabilitation of the construction or reconstruction site.</P>
            <P>(v) <E T="03">Category 5: Master agreements.</E> The Forest Service and the holder of an authorization may enter into a master agreement for the agency to recover monitoring costs associated with a particular authorization or by a group of authorizations for a specified geographic area. This category is minor if 50 hours or less are needed for Forest Service personnel to monitor compliance with an authorization and major if more than 50 hours are needed. In signing a master agreement for a major category authorization issued under authorities other than the Mineral Leasing Act, a holder waives the right to request a reduction of the monitoring fee based upon the reasonableness factors enumerated in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. A master agreement shall at a minimum include:</P>
            <P>(A) The fee category or estimated monitoring costs;</P>
            <P>(B) A description of the method for periodic billing, payment, and auditing of monitoring fees;</P>
            <P>(C) A description of the geographic area covered by the agreement;</P>
            <P>(D) A monitoring work plan and provisions for updating the work plan;</P>
            <P>(E) Provisions for reconciling differences between estimated and final monitoring costs; and</P>
            <P>(F) Provisions for terminating the agreement.</P>
            <P>(vi) <E T="03">Category 6: More than 50 hours.</E> This major category requires more than 50 hours for Forest Service personnel to monitor compliance with the terms and conditions of the authorization during all phases of its term, including, but not limited, to monitoring compliance with the authorization during the construction or reconstruction of temporary or permanent facilities and rehabilitation of the construction or reconstruction site.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Billing and payment of monitoring fees.</E> (i) The authorized officer shall estimate the monitoring costs and shall notify the holder of the required fee. Monitoring fees in minor categories 1 through 4 must be paid in full before or at the same time the authorization is issued. For authorizations in major category 5 and category 6, the estimated monitoring fees must be paid in full before or at the same time the authorization is issued, unless the authorized officer and the applicant or holder agree in writing to periodic payments.</P>
            <P>(ii) For category 5 cases, when the estimated monitoring costs are lower than the final monitoring costs for authorizations covered by a master agreement, the holder shall pay the difference between the estimated and final monitoring costs.</P>

            <P>(iii) For category 6 cases, when the estimated monitoring fee is lower than the full actual costs of monitoring an authorization issued under the Mineral Leasing Act, or lower than the full reasonable costs (when the holder has not waived payment of reasonable costs) of monitoring an authorization issued under other authorities, the holder shall pay the difference in the next periodic payment or the authorized officer shall bill the holder for the difference between the estimated and full <PRTPAGE P="372"/>actual or reasonable monitoring costs. Payment shall be due within 30 days of receipt of the bill.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Refunds of monitoring fees.</E> (i) Monitoring fees in minor categories 1 through 4 are nonrefundable and shall not be reconciled.</P>
            <P>(ii) For category 5 cases, if payment of the monitoring fee exceeds the agency's final monitoring costs for the authorizations covered by a master agreement, the authorized officer shall either adjust the next periodic payment to reflect the overpayment or refund the excess payment to the holder.</P>
            <P>(iii) For category 6 cases, if payment of the monitoring fee exceeds the full actual costs of monitoring an authorization issued under the Mineral Leasing Act, or the full reasonable costs (when the holder has not waived payment of reasonable costs) of monitoring an authorization issued under other authorities, the authorized officer shall either adjust the next periodic payment to reflect the overpayment or refund the excess payment to the holder.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Applicant and holder disputes concerning processing or monitoring fee assessments; requests for changes in fee categories or estimated costs.</E> (1) If an applicant or holder disagrees with the processing or monitoring fee category assigned by the authorized officer for a minor category or, in the case of a major processing or monitoring category, with the estimated dollar amount of the processing or monitoring costs, the applicant or holder may submit a written request before the disputed fee is due for substitution of an alternative fee category or alternative estimated costs to the immediate supervisor of the authorized officer who determined the fee category or estimated costs. The applicant or holder must provide documentation that supports the alternative fee category or estimated costs.</P>
            <P>(2) In the case of a disputed processing fee:</P>
            <P>(i) If the applicant pays the full disputed processing fee, the authorized officer shall continue to process the application during the supervisory officer's review of the disputed fee, unless the applicant requests that the processing cease.</P>
            <P>(ii) If the applicant fails to pay the full disputed processing fee, the authorized officer shall suspend further processing of the application pending the supervisory officer's determination of an appropriate processing fee and the applicant's payment of that fee.</P>
            <P>(3) In the case of a disputed monitoring fee:</P>
            <P>(i) If the applicant or holder pays the full disputed monitoring fee, the authorized officer shall issue the authorization or allow the use and occupancy to continue during the supervisory officer's review of the disputed fee, unless the applicant or holder elects not to exercise the authorized use and occupancy of National Forest System lands during the review period.</P>
            <P>(ii) If the applicant or holder fails to pay the full disputed monitoring fee, the authorized officer shall not issue the applicant a new authorization or shall suspend the holder's existing authorization in whole or in part pending the supervisory officer's determination of an appropriate monitoring fee and the applicant's or holder's payment of that fee.</P>
            <P>(4) The authorized officer's immediate supervisor shall render a decision on a disputed processing or monitoring fee within 30 calendar days of receipt of the written request from the applicant or holder. The supervisory officer's decision is the final level of administrative review. The dispute shall be decided in favor of the applicant or holder if the supervisory officer does not respond to the written request within 30 days of receipt.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Waivers of processing and monitoring fees.</E> (1) All or part of a processing or monitoring fee may be waived, at the sole discretion of the authorized officer, when one or more of the following criteria are met:</P>
            <P>(i) The applicant or holder is a local, State, or Federal governmental entity that does not or would not charge processing or monitoring fees for comparable services the applicant or holder provides or would provide to the Forest Service;</P>

            <P>(ii) A major portion of the processing costs results from issues not related to the project being proposed;<PRTPAGE P="373"/>

            <P>(vi) The proposed facility, project, or use will provide, without user or customer charges, a valuable benefit to the general public or to the programs of the Secretary of Agriculture.</P>
            <P>(2) An applicant's or holder's request for a full or partial waiver of a processing or monitoring fee must be in writing and must include an analysis that demonstrates how one or more of the criteria in paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (f)(1)(vi) of this section apply.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Scope and application.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The regulations in this subpart set forth the procedures by which landowners may apply for access across National Forest System lands and the terms and conditions that govern any special use or other authorization that is issued by the Forest Service to permit such access.</P>
            <P>(b) These regulations apply to access across all National Forest System lands, including Congressionally designated areas, and supplement the regulations in subpart B of this part, and in parts 212 and 293 of this chapter. The regulations of this subpart do not affect rights-of-way established under authority of R.S. 2477 (43 U.S.C. 932); rights-of-way transferred to States under 23 U.S.C. 317; access rights outstanding in third parties at the time the United States acquired the land; or the rights reserved in conveyances to the United States and in other easements granted by an authorized officer of the Forest Service. Except for the aforementioned rights-of-way, currently valid special-use authorizations will become subject to the rules of this subpart upon expiration, termination, reversion, modification, or reauthorization.</P>
            <P>(c) Subject to the terms and conditions contained in this part and in parts 212 and 293 of this chapter, as appropriate, landowners shall be authorized such access as the authorized officer deems to be adequate to secure them the reasonable use and enjoyment of their land.</P>
            <P>(d) ln those cases where a landowner's ingress or egress across National Forest System lands would require surface disturbance or would require the use of Government-owned roads, trails, or transportation facilities not authorized for general public use, the landowner must apply for and receive a special-use or road-use authorization documenting the occupancy and use authorized on National Forest System lands or facilities and identifying the landowner's rights, privileges, responsibilities, and obligations.</P>
            <P>(e) Where ingress and egress will require the use of existing Government-owned roads, trails, or other transportation facilities which are open and available for general public use, use by the landowner shall be in accordance with the provisions of part 212 of this chapter.</P>

            <P>(f) The rules of this subpart do not apply to access within conservation <PRTPAGE P="377"/>system units in Alaska which are subject to title XI of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. 3101), except for access to inholdings authorized by section 1110(b) of that Act.</P>
            <P>(g) Where there is existing access or a right of access to a property over non-National Forest land or over public roads that is adequate or that can be made adequate, there is no obligation to grant additional access through National Forest System lands.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Application requirements.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A landowner shall apply for access across National Forest System lands in accordance with the application requirements of § 251.54 of this part. Such application shall specifically include a statement of the intended mode of access to, and uses of, the non-Federal land for which the special-use authorization is requested.</P>
            <P>(b) The application shall disclose the historic access to the landowner's property and any rights of access which may exist over non-federally owned land and shall provide reasons why these means of access do not provide adequate access to the landowners property.</P>
            <P>(c) The information required to apply for access across National Forest lands under this subpart is approved for use under subpart B of this part and assigned OMB control number 0596-0082.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 251.113</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Instrument of authorization.</SUBJECT>
            <P>To grant authority to construct and/or use facilities and structures on National Forest System lands for access to non-Federal lands, the authorized officer shall issue a special-use authorization in conformance with the provisions of subpart B of this part or a road-use permit. In cases where Road Rights-of-way Construction And Use Agreements are in effect, the authorized officer may grant an easement in accordance with the provisions of part 212 of this chapter.</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 251.114</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Criteria, terms and conditions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) In issuing a special-use authorization for access to non-Federal lands, the authorized officer shall authorize only those access facilities or modes of access that are needed for the reasonable use and enjoyment of the land and that minimize the impacts on the Federal resources. The authorizing officer shall determine what constitutes reasonable use and enjoyment of the lands based on contemporaneous uses made of similarly situated lands in the area and any other relevant criteria.</P>
            <P>(b) Landowners must pay an appropriate fee for the authorized use of National Forest System lands in accordance with § 251.57 of this part.</P>

            <P>(c) A landowner may be required to provide a reciprocal grant of access to the United States across the landowner's property where such reciprocal right is deemed by the authorized officer to be necessary for the management of adjacent Federal land. In such case, the landowner shall receive the fair market value of the rights-of-way granted to the United States. If the value of the rights-of-way obtained by the Government exceeds the value of the rights-of-way granted, the difference in value will be paid to the <PRTPAGE P="378"/>landowner. If the value of the rights-of-way across Government land exceeds the value of the rights-of-way across the private land, an appropriate adjustment will be made in the fee charged for the special-use authorization as provided in § 251.57(b)(5) of this part.</P>
            <P>(d) For access across National Forest System lands that will have significant non-Forest user traffic, a landowner may be required to construct new roads or reconstruct existing roads to bring the roads to a safe and adequate standard. A landowner also may be required to provide for the operation and maintenance of the road. This may be done by arranging for such road to be made part of the local public road system, or formation of a local improvement district to assume the responsibilities for the operation and maintenance of the road as either a private road or as a public road, as determined to be appropriate by the authorizing officer.</P>
            <P>(e) When access is tributary to or dependent on forest development roads, and traffic over these roads arising from the use of landowner's lands exceeds their safe capacity or will cause damage to the roadway, the landowner(s) may be required to obtain a road-use permit and to perform such reconstruction as necessary to bring the road to a safe and adequate standard to accommodate such traffic in addition to the Government's traffic. In such case, the landowner(s) also shall enter into a cooperative maintenance arrangement with the Forest Service to ensure that the landowner's commensurate maintenance responsibilities are met or shall make arrangements to have the jurisdiction and maintenance responsibility for the road assumed by the appropriate public road authority.</P>
            <P>(f) In addition to ensuring that applicable terms and conditions of paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section are met, the authorizing officer, prior to issuing any access authorization, must also ensure that:</P>
            <P>(1) The landowner has demonstrated a lack of any existing rights or routes of access available by deed or under State or common law;</P>
            <P>(2) The route is so located and constructed as to minimize adverse impacts on soils, fish and wildlife, scenic, cultural, threatened and endangered species, and other values of the Federal land;</P>
            <P>(3) The location and method of access is as consistent as reasonably possible with the management of any congressionally designated area and is consistent with Forest Land and Resource Management Plans or the plans are amended to accommodate the access grant, and;</P>
            <P>(4) When access routes exist across the adjacent non-Federal lands or the best route as determined by the authorizing officer is across non-Federal lands, the applicant landowner has demonstrated that all legal recourse to obtain reasonable access across adjacent non-Federal lands has been exhausted or has little chance of success.</P>
            <P>(g) In addition to the other requirements of this section, the following factors shall be considered in authorizing access to non-federally owned lands over National Forest System lands which are components of the National Wilderness Preservation System:</P>
            <P>(1) The use of means of ingress and egress which have been or are being customarily used with respect to similarly situated non-Federal land used for similar purposes;</P>
            <P>(2) The combination of routes and modes of travel, including nonmotorized modes, which will cause the least lasting impact on the wilderness but, at the same time, will permit the reasonable use of the non-federally owned land;</P>
            <P>(3) The examination of a voluntary acquisition of land or interests in land by exchange, purchase, or donation to modify or eliminate the need to use wilderness areas for access purposes.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Historical operator special use authorizations.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A historical operator has the right to continue to provide visitor services under appropriate terms and conditions contained in a special use authorization, as long as such services are determined by the authorized officer to be consistent with the purposes for which the CSU was established or expanded. A historical operator may not operate without such an authorization.</P>
            <P>(b) Any person who qualifies as a historical operator under this subpart and who wishes to exercise the rights granted to historical operators under section 1307(a) of ANILCA (16 U.S.C. 1397(a)) must notify the authorized officer responsible for the CSU.</P>
            <P>(c) A historical operator may apply for a special use authorization to provide visitor services similar to but in lieu of those provided by that historical operator before January 1, 1979.

            <P>(e) When a historical operator's special use authorization expires, the authorized officer shall offer to reissue the special use authorization for the same or similar visitor services, as long as the visitor services remain consistent with the purposes for which the CSU was established or expanded, the historical operator was lawfully and adequately providing visitor services under the previous special use authorization, and the historical operator continues to possess the capability to provide the visitor services adequately.</P>
            <P>(1) If the operator accepts the offer to reissue, the authorized officer shall issue a new special use authorization that clearly identifies the historical operations as required by paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) If the authorized officer determines that it is necessary to reduce the visitor services to be provided by a historical operator, the authorized officer shall modify the historical operator's special use authorization to reflect the reduced services as follows:</P>
            <P>(i) If more than one historical operator provides services in the area where visitor service capacity is to be reduced, the authorized officer shall apportion the reduction among the historical operators, taking into account historical operating levels and such other factors as are relevant to achieve a proportionate reduction among the operators.</P>
            <P>(ii) If the reductions in visitor service capacity make it necessary to reduce operators in an area, the authorized officer shall select, through a competitive process that is limited to historical operators only, the operator or operators to receive a special use authorization from among the historical operators. Historical operators participating in this competitive process may not claim a preference as a preferred operator under § 251.124.</P>
            <P>(f) Any of the following shall result in the loss of historical operator status:</P>

            <P>(1) Revocation of a special use authorization for historical types and levels of visitor services for failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the special use authorization;<PRTPAGE P="381"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) A historical operator's refusal of an offer to reissue a special use authorization made pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section;</P>
            <P>(3) A change in the controlling interest of a historical operator through sale, assignment, devise, transfer, or otherwise, except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section; or</P>
            <P>(4) An operator's failure to provide the authorized services for a period of more than 24 consecutive months.</P>
            <P>(g) A change in the controlling interest of a historical operator that results only in the acquisition of the controlling interest by an individual or individuals, who were personally engaged in the visitor service activities of the historical operator before January 1, 1979, shall not be deemed a change in the historical operator's controlling interest for the purposes of this subpart.</P>
            <P>(h) Nothing in this section shall prohibit the authorized officer from authorizing persons other than historical operators to provide visitor services in the same area, as long as historical operators receive authorization to provide visitor services that are the same as or similar to those they provided on or before January 1, 1979.</P>
            <P>(i) If an authorized officer grants to a historical operator an increase in the scope or level of visitor services from what was provided on or before January 1, 1979, beyond what was authorized under paragraph (d) of this section, for either the same or similar visitor services, the historical operator has no right of preference for the increased amount of authorized services. If additional operations are authorized, the special use authorization shall explicitly state that they are not subject to the historical operator preference.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Most directly affected Native Corporation determination.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Before issuance of the first special use authorization for a specific CSU pursuant to § 251.124 on or after the effective date of this subpart, the authorized officer shall give notice to Native Corporations interested in providing visitor services within the CSU and give them an opportunity to submit an application to be considered the Native Corporation most directly affected by the establishment or expansion of the CSU under section 1307(b) of ANILCA (16 U.S.C. 1397(b)). In giving notice of the application procedure, the authorized officer shall make clear that this is the only opportunity to apply for most directly affected status for that particular CSU.</P>
            <P>(1) At a minimum, an application from an interested Native Corporation shall include the following:</P>
            <P>(i) Name, address, and telephone number of the Native Corporation; date of its incorporation; its articles of incorporation and structure; and the name of the applicable CSU and the solicitation to which the Native Corporation is responding;</P>
            <P>(ii) Location of the Native Corporation's population centers; and</P>
            <P>(iii) An assessment of the socioeconomic impacts (including changes in historical and traditional use and landownership patterns) on the Native Corporation resulting from establishment or expansion of the applicable CSU.</P>
            <P>(2) In addition to the minimum information required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section, Native Corporations may submit such additional information as they consider relevant.</P>
            <P>(b) Upon receipt of all applications from interested Native Corporations, the authorized officer shall determine the most directly affected Native Corporation considering the following factors:</P>
            <P>(1) Distance and accessibility from the Native Corporation's population centers and/or business address to the applicable CSU;</P>
            <P>(2) Socioeconomic impacts (including changes in historical and traditional use and landownership patterns) on Native Corporations resulting from establishment or expansion of the applicable CSU; and</P>
            <P>(3) Information provided by Native Corporations and other information considered relevant by the authorized officer to assessment of the effects of establishment or expansion of the applicable CSU.</P>

            <P>(c) In the event that two or more Native Corporations are determined to be equally affected for purposes of the most directly affected Native Corporation determination pursuant to this section, each such Native Corporation <PRTPAGE P="382"/>shall be considered a preferred operator under this subpart.</P>
            <P>(d) A Native Corporation determined to be most directly affected for a CSU shall maintain that status for all future visitor service solicitations for that CSU.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Preferred operator competitive special use authorization procedures.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) In selecting persons to provide visitor services for a CSU, the authorized officer shall, if the number of visitor service authorizations is to be limited, give a preference (subject to any rights of historical operators under this subpart) to preferred operators as defined in this subpart who are determined to be qualified to provide such visitor services.</P>
            <P>(b) In such circumstances, the authorized officer shall solicit applications competitively by issuing a prospectus for persons to apply for a visitor services authorization. Notwithstanding Forest Service outfitting and guiding policy in Forest Service Handbook 2709.11, chapter 40, when authorizations, including priority use permits for activities other than sport hunting and fishing, expire in accordance with their terms, they shall not be reissued if there is a need to limit use and when there is competitive interest by preferred operators.</P>
            <P>(c) To qualify as a preferred operator under this subpart, an applicant responding to a solicitation made under this section must be determined by the authorized officer to be a local resident as defined in § 251.121 of this subpart, or the Native Corporation most directly affected by establishment or expansion of the CSU covered by the solicitation pursuant to § 251.123 of this subpart.</P>
            <P>(d) Applicants seeking preferred operator status based on local residency must provide documentation verifying their claim. Factors demonstrating the location of an individual's primary, permanent residence and business include, but are not limited to, the permanent address indicated on licenses issued by the State of Alaska, tax returns, and voter registration.</P>
            <P>(e) An application from a preferred operator in the form of a corporation, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture, individual entrepreneurship, nonprofit entity, or other form of organization shall be considered valid only when the application documents to the satisfaction of the authorized officer that the preferred operator holds the controlling interest in the corporation, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture, individual entrepreneurship, nonprofit entity, or other form of organization.</P>
            <P>(f) A qualified preferred operator shall be given preference, pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section, over all other applicants, except with respect to use allocated to historical operators pursuant to § 251.122 of this subpart.</P>
            <P>(g) If the best application from a preferred operator is at least substantially equal to the best application from a non-preferred operator, the preferred operator shall be issued the visitor service authorization. If an application from an applicant other than a preferred operator is determined to be the best application (and no preferred operator submits a responsive application that is substantially equal to it), the preferred operator who submitted the best application from among the applications submitted by preferred operators shall be given the opportunity, by amending its application, to meet the terms and conditions of the best application received. If the amended application of that preferred operator is considered by the authorized officer to be at least substantially equal to the best application, the preferred operator shall be issued the visitor service authorization. If a preferred operator does not amend its application to meet the terms and conditions of the best application, the authorized officer shall issue the visitor service authorization to the applicant who submitted the best application in response to the prospectus.</P>

            <P>(b) Local residents and most directly affected Native Corporations have <PRTPAGE P="383"/>equal priority for consideration in providing visitor services pursuant to § 251.124 of this subpart.</P>
            <P>(c) Nothing in this subpart shall prohibit the authorized officer from issuing special use authorizations to other applicants within the CSU, as long as the requirements of § 251.124 are met.</P>
            <P>(d) If an operator qualifies as a local resident for any part of an area designated in the solicitation for a specific visitor service, in matters related solely to that solicitation, the operator shall be treated as a local resident for the entire area covered by that solicitation.</P>
            <P>(e) The preferences described in this section may not be sold, assigned, transferred, or devised, either directly or indirectly, in whole or in part.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Scope and applicability.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) These rules set forth the procedures for conducting exchanges of National Forest System lands. The procedures in these rules may be supplemented by instructions issued to Forest Service officers in Chapter 5400 of the Forest Service Manual and Forest Service Handbooks 5409.12 and 5409.13.</P>
            <P>(b) These rules apply to all National Forest System exchanges of land or interests in land, including but not limited to minerals, water rights, and timber, except those exchanges made under the authority of Small Tracts Act of January 12, 1983 (16 U.S.C. 521c-521i) (36 CFR part 254, subpart C), and as otherwise noted. These rules also apply to other methods of acquisition, where indicated.</P>

            <P>(c) The application of these rules to exchanges made under the authority of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, as amended (43 U.S.C. 1621), or the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. 3192), shall be limited to those provisions which do <PRTPAGE P="384"/>not conflict with the provisions of these Acts.</P>
            <P>(d) Unless the parties to an exchange otherwise agree, land exchanges for which the parties have agreed in writing to initiate prior to April 7, 1994, will proceed in accordance with the rules and regulations in effect at the time of the agreement.</P>
            <P>(e) Except for exchanges requiring cash equalization payments made available through the Land and Water Conservation Act of 1965, as amended (16 U.S.C. 460[1]9), the boundaries of a national forest are automatically extended to encompass lands acquired under the Weeks Act of March 1, 1911, as amended (16 U.S.C. 516), provided the acquired lands are contiguous to existing national forest boundaries and total no more than 3,000 acres in each exchange.</P>
            <P>(f) Exchanges under the Weeks Act of March 1, 1911, or the General Exchange Act of March 20, 1922, may involve land-for-timber (non-Federal land exchanged for the rights to Federal timber), or timber-for-land (the exchange of the rights to non-Federal timber for Federal land), or tripartite land-for-timber (non-Federal land exchanged for the rights to Federal timber cut by a third party in behalf of the exchange parties).</P>
            <P>(g) Land exchanges involving National Forest System lands are authorized by a number of statutes, depending upon the status (conditions of ownership) of such lands and the purpose for which an exchange is to be made. The status of National Forest System land is determined by the method by which the land or interests therein became part of the National Forest System. Unless otherwise provided by law, lands acquired by the United States in exchanges assume the same status as the Federal lands conveyed.</P>
            <P>(h) The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, as amended (43 U.S.C. 1701), is supplemental to all applicable exchange laws, except the cash equalization provisions of the Sisk Act of December 4, 1967, as amended (16 U.S.C. 484a).</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 254.3</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Requirements.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Discretionary nature of exchanges.</E> The Secretary is not required to exchange any Federal lands. Land exchanges are discretionary, voluntary real estate transactions between the Federal and non-Federal parties. Unless and until the parties enter into a binding exchange agreement, any party may withdraw from and terminate an exchange proposal at any time during the exchange process.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Determination of public interest.</E> The authorized officer may complete an exchange only after a determination is made that the public interest will be well served.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Factors to consider.</E> When considering the public interest, the authorized officer shall give full consideration to the opportunity to achieve better management of Federal lands and resources, to meet the needs of State and local residents and their economies, <PRTPAGE P="386"/>and to secure important objectives, including but not limited to: protection of fish and wildlife habitats, cultural resources, watersheds, and wilderness and aesthetic values; enhancement of recreation opportunities and public access; consolidation of lands and/or interests in lands, such as mineral and timber interests, for more logical and efficient management and development; consolidation of split estates; expansion of communities; accommodation of existing or planned land use authorizations (§ 254.4(c)(4); promotion of multiple-use values; implementation of applicable Forest Land and Resource Management Plans; and fulfillment of public needs.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Findings.</E> To determine that an exchange well serves the public interest, the authorized officer must find that—</P>
            <P>(i) The resource values and the public objectives served by the non-Federal lands or interests to be acquired must equal or exceed the resource values and the public objectives served by the Federal lands to be conveyed, and</P>
            <P>(ii) The intended use of the conveyed Federal land will not substantially conflict with established management objectives on adjacent Federal lands, including Indian Trust lands.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Documentation.</E> The findings and the supporting rationale shall be documented and made part of the administrative record.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Equal value exchanges.</E> Except as provided in § 254.11 of this subpart, lands or interests to be exchanged must be of equal value or equalized in accordance with the methods set forth in § 254.12 of this subpart. An exchange of lands or interests shall be based on market value as determined by the Secretary through appraisal(s), through bargaining based on appraisal(s), through other acceptable and commonly recognized methods of determining market value, or through arbitration.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Same-State exchanges.</E> Unless otherwise provided by statute, the Federal and non-Federal lands involved in an exchange must be located within the same State.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Congressional designations.</E> Upon acceptance of title by the United States, lands acquired by the Secretary of the Interior by exchange under the authority granted by the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, as amended, which are within the boundaries of any unit of the National Forest System, the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, the National Trails System, the National Wilderness Preservation System, or any other system established by Act of Congress; or the boundaries of any national conservation area or national recreation area established by Act of Congress, immediately are reserved for and become a part of the unit or area in which they are located, without further action by the Secretary of the Interior, and, thereafter, shall be managed in accordance with all laws, rules, regulations, and land resource management plans applicable to such unit or area.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Land and resource management planning.</E> The authorized officer shall consider only those exchange proposals that are consistent with land and resource management plans (36 CFR part 219). Lands acquired by exchange that are located within areas having an administrative designation established through the land management planning process shall automatically become part of the area within which they are located, without further action by the Forest Service, and shall be managed in accordance with the laws, rules, regulations, and land and resource management plan applicable to such area.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Environmental analysis.</E> After an agreement to initiate an exchange is signed, the authorized officer shall undertake an environmental analysis in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4371), the Council on Environmental Quality regulations (40 CFR parts 1500-1508), and Forest Service environmental policies and procedures (Forest Service Manual Chapter 1950 and Forest Service Handbook 1909.15). In making this analysis, the authorized officer shall consider timely written comments received in response to the exchange notice published pursuant to § 254.8 of this subpart.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Reservations or restrictions in the public interest.</E> In any exchange, the authorized officer shall reserve such rights or retain such interests as are needed to protect the public interest or <PRTPAGE P="387"/>shall otherwise restrict the use of Federal lands to be exchanged, as appropriate. The use or development of lands conveyed out of Federal ownership are subject to any restrictions imposed by the conveyance documents and all laws, regulations, and zoning authorities of State and local governing bodies.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Hazardous substances</E>—(1) <E T="03">Federal lands.</E> The authorized officer shall determine whether hazardous substances are known to be present on the Federal lands involved in the exchange and shall provide notice of known storage, release, or disposal of hazardous substances on the Federal lands in the contract agreement and in the conveyance document, pursuant to 40 CFR part 373 and 42 U.S.C. 9620. For purposes of this section, the notice of hazardous substances on involved Federal lands in an agreement to initiate an exchange or an exchange agreement meets the requirements for notices established in 40 CFR part 373. Unless the non-Federal party is a potentially responsible party under 42 U.S.C. 9607(a) and participated as an owner, or in the operation, arrangement, generation, or transportation of the hazardous substances found on the Federal land, the conveyance document from the United States must contain a covenant warranting that all remedial action necessary to protect human health and the environment with respect to any such substances remaining on the property has been taken before the date of transfer and that any additional remedial action found necessary after the transfer shall be conducted by the United States, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 9620(h)(3). The conveyance document must also reserve to the United States the right of access to the conveyed property if remedial or corrective action is required after the date of transfer. Where the non-Federal party is a potentially responsible party with respect to the property, it may be appropriate to enter into an agreement as referenced in 42 U.S.C. 9607(e) whereby that party would indemnify the United States and hold the United States harmless against any loss or cleanup costs after conveyance.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Non-Federal lands.</E> The non-Federal party shall notify the authorized officer of any hazardous substances known to have been released, stored, or disposed of on the non-Federal land, pursuant to § 254.4 of this subpart. Notwithstanding such notice, the authorized officer shall determine whether hazardous substances are known to be present on the non-Federal land involved in an exchange. If hazardous substances are known or believed to be present on the non-Federal land, the authorized officer shall reach an agreement with the non-Federal party regarding the responsibility for appropriate response action concerning the hazardous substances before completing the exchange. The terms of this agreement and any appropriate “hold harmless agreement” shall be included in an exchange agreement, pursuant to § 254.14 of this subpart.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Legal description of properties.</E> All lands subject to an exchange must be properly described on the basis of either a survey executed in accordance with the Public Land Survey System laws and standards of the United States or, if those laws and standards cannot be applied, the lands shall be properly described and clearly locatable by other means as may be prescribed or allowed by law.</P>
            <P>(k) <E T="03">Special review.</E> Except as provided in this paragraph, land acquisitions of $150,000 or more in value made under the authority of the Weeks Act of March 1, 1911, as amended (16 U.S.C. 516), must be submitted to Congress for oversight review, pursuant to the Act of October 22, 1976, as amended (16 U.S.C. 521b). However, minor and insignificant changes in land acquisition proposals need not be resubmitted for congressional oversight, provided the general concept of and basis for the acquisition remain the same.</P>

In the absence of current market information reliably supporting value, the parties may agree to use other acceptable and commonly recognized methods to estimate value.</P>
            <P>(e) An agreement to initiate may be amended by consent of the parties or terminated at any time upon written notice by any party.</P>
            <P>(f) Entering into an agreement to initiate an exchange does not legally bind any party to proceed with processing or to consummate a proposed exchange, or to reimburse or pay damages to any party to a proposed exchange that is not consummated or to anyone doing business with any such party.</P>
            <P>(g) The withdrawal from an exchange proposal by the authorized officer at any time prior to the notice of decision pursuant to § 254.13 of this subpart is not appealable under 36 CFR part 214 or 215.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Assumption of costs.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Generally, each party to an exchange will bear their own costs of the exchange. However, if the authorized officer finds it is in the public interest as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, an agreement to initiate an exchange may provide that:</P>

In this case, the appraiser also must estimate the value of the Federal and non-Federal properties in a similar manner.</P>
            <P>(2) In estimating market value, the appraiser may not independently add the separate values of the fractional interests to be conveyed, unless market evidence indicates the following:</P>

            <P>(5) A disclosure of any condition that is observed during the inspection of the property or becomes known to the appraiser through the normal research which would lead the appraiser to believe that hazardous substances may be present on the property being appraised;</P>
            <P>(6) A comparative market analysis and, if more than one method of valuation is used, an analysis and reconciliation of the methods used to support the appraiser's estimate of value;</P>
            <P>(7) A description of comparable sales, including a description of all relevant physical, legal, and economic factors such as parties to the transaction, source and method of financing, effect of any favorable financing on sale price, and verification by a party involved in the transaction;</P>

Bargaining or any other process must be based on an objective analysis of the valuation in the appraisal report(s) and is a means of reconciling differences in such report(s). Bargaining or another process to determine values may involve one or more of the following actions:</P>

For example, encumbrances such as taxes, judgment liens, mortgages, and other objections or title defects shall be eliminated, released, or waived in accordance with requirements of the preliminary title opinion of the USDA Office of the General Counsel or the Department of Justice, as appropriate.</P>
            <P>(ii) The United States shall not accept lands in which there are reserved or outstanding interests that would interfere with the use and management of the land by the United States or would otherwise be inconsistent with the authority under which, or the purpose for which, the lands are to be acquired. Reserved interests of the non-Federal landowner are subject to the appropriate rules and regulations of the Secretary, except upon special finding by the Chief, Forest Service in the case of States, agencies, or political subdivisions thereof (36 CFR part 251, subpart A).</P>
            <P>(iii) Any personal property owned by the non-Federal party which is not a part of the exchange proposal, should be removed by the non-Federal party prior to acceptance of title by the United States, unless the authorized officer and the non-Federal party to the exchange previously agree upon a specified period to remove the personal property.

            <P>(iv) The exchange parties must reach agreement on the arrangements for the relocation of any tenants.

The non-Federal exchange party shall submit documented proof of such agreement prior to issuance of a decision to approve the land exchange, as instructed by the authorized officer. If an agreement cannot be reached, the authorized officer shall consider other alternatives to accommodate the authorized use or shall determine whether there are specific and compelling reasons in the public interest for revoking the authorization for that use pursuant to 36 CFR 251.60.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>

            <P>These regulations set forth procedures by which the Secretary of Agriculture may resolve land disputes and management problems pursuant to Pub. L. 97-465, commonly called the Small Tracts Act, by conveying, through sale, exchange, or interchange, <PRTPAGE P="398"/>three categories of tracts of land: Parcels encroached on, road rights-of-way, and mineral survey fractions. Implementation of these regulations does not constitute authorization of nor consent to adverse possession against lands administered by the Secretary of Agriculture.</P>

            <P>For the purpose of this subpart,</P>
            <P>An <E T="03">applicant</E> is a person who occupies or has improvements on National Forest System land under claim of title or color of title, or who owns land abutting or underlying a road right-of-way, or who owns land interspersed with or adjacent to mineral survey fractions.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Approximately equal value</E> is a comparative estimate of value of lands involved in an interchange where elements of value, such as physical characteristics and other amenities, are readily apparent and substantially similar.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Claim of title</E> is a claim of land as a person's own, based on any reasonable evidence which establishes the person's actual use of the land as though the person had full title thereto from the time the person obtained ownership of abutting land.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Color of title</E> arises from an instrument purporting to convey title to a tract of land.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Encroachments</E> are improvements occupied or used on National Forest System land under claim of title or color of title.</P>

              <E T="03">Exchange</E> is a discretionary, voluntary transaction involving mutual transfers of land or interests in land between the Secretary of Agriculture acting by and through the Forest Service and a nonfederal entity.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Good faith</E> is honesty of intention and freedom from knowledge of circumstances which ought to put a prudent person upon inquiry.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Improvements</E> mean an addition to property costing labor or capital which affects its value. The term generally includes fixtures, structures and attendant facilities, or buildings.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Interchange</E> is a land transfer in which the Secretary and another person exchange lands or interests in lands of approximately equal value without a formal appraisal.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Mineral survey fractions</E> are small parcels of National Forest System lands interspersed with or adjacent to lands transferred out of Federal ownership under the mining laws.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Person</E> includes any nonfederal entity such as a State or any political subdivision as well as any individual or business entity.</P>
            <P>

            <P>Unauthorized livestock or livestock in excess of those authorized by a grazing permit on the National Forest System, which are not removed therefrom within the periods prescribed by this regulation, may be impounded and disposed of by a forest officer as provided herein.</P>
            <P>(a) When a Forest officer determines that such livestock use is occurring, has definite knowledge of the kind of livestock, and knows the name and address of the owners, such livestock may be impounded any time five days after written notice of intent to impound such livestock is mailed by certified or registered mail or personally delivered to such owners.</P>
            <P>(b) When a Forest officer determines that such livestock use is occurring, but does not have complete knowledge of the kind of livestock, or if the name of the owner is unknown, such livestock may be impounded any time 15 days after the date a notice of intent to impound livestock is first published in a local newspaper and posted at the county courthouse and in one or more local post offices. The notice will identify the area in which it will be effective.</P>
            <P>(c) Unauthorized livestock or livestock in excess of those authorized by a grazing permit on National Forest System which are owned by persons given notice under paragraph (a) of this section, and any such livestock in areas for which a notice has been posted and published under paragraph (b) of this section, may be impounded without further notice any time within the 12-month period immediately following the effective date of the notice or notices given under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</P>
            <P>(d) Following the impoundment of livestock, a notice of sale of impounded livestock will be published in a local newspaper and posted at the county courthouse and in one or more local post offices. The notice will describe the livestock and specify the date, time, and place of the sale. The date shall be at least five days after the publication and posting of such notice.</P>
            <P>(e) The owner may redeem the livestock any time before the date and time set for the sale by submitting proof of ownership and paying for all expenses incurred by the United States in gathering, impounding, and feeding or pasturing the livestock. However, when the impoundment costs exceed fair market value a minimum acceptable redemption price at fair market value may be established for each head of livestock.</P>

            <P>(f) If the livestock are not redeemed on or before the date and time fixed for their sale, they shall be sold at public sale to the highest bidder, providing this bid is at or above the minimum amount set by the Forest Service. If a bid at or above the minimum amount is not received, the livestock may be sold at private sale at or above the minimum amount, reoffered at public sale, condemned and destroyed, or otherwise disposed of. When livestock are sold pursuant to this regulation, the forest officer making the sale shall furnish the purchaser a bill or other written instrument evidencing the sale. Agreements may be made with State agencies whereby livestock of unknown ownership and livestock of known ownership, which are not redeemed by the owner, are released to the agency for disposal in accordance with State law, <E T="03">Provided,</E> That remuneration of proceeds from the sale of said animals in excess of costs of impoundment and to arrange for disposal of livestock of known ownership will be refunded to the former owner.</P>

Forest officers will notify the owner of the dog, if known, of such impounding, and the owner will be given five days to redeem the dog. A dog may be redeemed by the owner submitting adequate evidence of <PRTPAGE P="418"/>ownership and paying all expenses incurred by the Forest Service in capturing and impounding it. If the owner fails to redeem the dog within five days after notice, or if the owner cannot be ascertained within 10 days from the date of impounding, the dog may be destroyed or otherwise disposed of at the discretion of the Forest officer having possession of it.</P>

Whenever such Forest officer knows the name and address of the owner, such impoundment may be effected at any time five days after the date that written notice of the trespass is mailed by registered mail or delivered to such owner.</P>
            <P>(b) If the local Forest Officer does not know the name and address of the owner of property in trespass, impoundment may be effected at any time 72 hours after a notice of intention to impound the property in trespass is posted in at least one place in the vicinity of the property.</P>
            <P>(c) Personal property impounded under this regulation may be disposed of at the expiration of 90-days after the date of impoundment. The owner may redeem the personal property within the 90-day period by submitting proof of ownership and paying all expenses incurred by the United States in advertising, gathering, moving, impounding, storing, and otherwise caring for the property, and also for the value of the use of the site occupied during the period of the trespass.</P>
            <P>(d) The owner of impounded property may redeem it by the date set for its disposition, but shall remain liable for all costs associated with its impoundment, removal, transportation, and storage. Impounded property that is not redeemed by the date set for its disposition shall become the property of the United States and may be retained by the Forest Service for official use, sold at public sale to the highest bidder, or otherwise disposed of. When impounded property is sold, the forest officer conducting the sale shall furnish the purchaser with a bill of sale or other written instrument evidencing the sale. The original owner shall remain liable for all costs associated with impoundment, removal, transportation, and storage of the property, minus any amount received from the sale of the property.</P>

Such use must be consistent with the status of a national insignia. Business or calling cards commercially prepared for employees, at employee expense, may display the insignia without special license.</P>

          <P>The rules of this part implement the requirements of the Federal Cave Resources Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 4301-4309), hereafter referred to as the “Act”. The rules apply to cave management on National Forest System lands. These rules, in conjunction with <PRTPAGE P="423"/>rules in part 261 of this chapter, provide the basis for identifying and managing significant caves on National Forest System lands in accordance with the Act. National Forest System lands will be managed in a manner which, to the extent practical, protects and maintains significant cave resources in accordance with the policies outlined in the Forest Service Directive System and the management direction contained in the individual forest plans.</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">Nominations for initial and subsequent listings.</E> The authorized officer will give governmental agencies and the public, including those who utilize caves for scientific, educational, or recreational purposes, the opportunity to nominate caves. The authorized officer shall give public notice, including a notice published in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> calling for nominations for the initial listing and setting forth the procedures for preparing and submitting the nominations. Nominations for subsequent listings will be accepted from governmental agencies and the public by the Forest Supervisor where the cave is located as new cave discoveries are made. Caves nominated but not approved for designation may be renominated as additional documentation or new information becomes available.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Evaluation for initial and subsequent listings.</E> The evaluation of the nominations for significant caves will be carried out in consultation with individuals and organizations interested in the management and use of caves and cave resources, within the limits imposed by the confidentiality provisions of § 290.4. Nominations shall be evaluated using the criteria in § 290.3 (c) and (d).</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Criteria for significant caves.</E> A significant cave on National Forest System lands shall possess one or more of the following features, characteristics, or values.</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Biota.</E> The cave provides seasonal or yearlong habitat for organisms or animals, or contains species or subspecies of flora or fauna native to caves, or are sensitive to disturbance, or are found on State or Federal sensitive, threatened, or endangered species lists.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Cultural.</E> The cave contains historic properties or archeological resources (as defined in Parts 800.2 and 296.3 of this chapter respectively, or in 16 U.S.C. 470, <E T="03">et seq.</E>), or other features included in or eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places because of their research importance for history or prehistory, historical associations, or other historical or traditional significance.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Geologic/Mineralogic/Paleontologic.</E> The cave possesses one or more of the following features:</P>

          <P>(i) Geologic or mineralogic features that are fragile, represent formation <PRTPAGE P="424"/>processes that are of scientific interest, or that are otherwise useful for study.</P>
          <P>(ii) Deposits of sediments or features useful for evaluating past events.</P>
          <P>(iii) Paleontologic resources with potential to contribute useful educational or scientific information.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Hydrologic.</E> The cave is a part of a hydrologic system or contains water which is important to humans, biota, or development of cave resources.</P>
          <P>(5) <E T="03">Recreational.</E> The cave provides or could provide recreational opportunities or scenic values.</P>
          <P>(6) <E T="03">Educational or scientific.</E> The cave offers opportunities for educational or scientific use; or, the cave is virtually in a pristine state, lacking evidence of contemporary human disturbance or impact; or, the length, volume, total depth, pit depth, height, or similar measurements are notable.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Specially designated areas.</E> All caves located within special management areas, such as Special Geologic Areas, Research Natural Areas, or National Monuments, that are designated wholly or in part due to the cave resources found therein are determined to be significant.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Designation and documentation.</E> If the authorized officer determines that a cave nominated and evaluated under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section meets one or more of the criteria in paragraph (c) of this section, the authorized officer shall designate the cave as significant. The authorized officer will notify the nominating party of the results of the evaluation and designation. Each forest will retain appropriate documentation for all significant caves located within its administrative boundaries. At a minimum, this documentation shall include a statement of finding signed and dated by the authorized officer and the information used to make the determination. This documentation will be retained as a permanent record in accordance with the confidentiality provision in § 290.4.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Undiscovered passages.</E> If a cave is determined to be significant, its entire extent on federal land, including passages not mapped or discovered at the time of the determination, is deemed significant. This includes caves that extend from lands managed by any other Federal agency into National Forest System lands, as well as caves initially believed to be separate for which interconnecting passages are discovered after significance is determined.</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Decision final.</E> The decision to designate or not designate a cave as significant is made at the sole discretion of the authorized officer based upon the criteria in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section and is not subject to further administrative review of appeal under Parts 217 or 251.82 of this chapter.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Casual collecting on National Forest System lands.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Casual collecting is allowed without a permit on National Forest System lands where such collection is consistent with the laws governing the management of those lands, the land management plans, and where the lands in question are not closed to casual collection.</P>
          <P>(b) National Forest System lands are open to casual collection unless otherwise closed, as described in § 291.12.</P>
          <P>(c) Research activities do not constitute casual collection, and therefore, research involving the collecting of common invertebrate and plant paleontological resources requires a permit.</P>
          <P>(d) Using scientific principles and expertise, the Authorized Officer may determine that certain invertebrate and plant paleontological resources do or do not meet the definition of “common invertebrate and plant paleontological resources” as set forth in these regulations, and thus, whether such resources can be casually collected or must be collected under permit.</P>
          <P>(e) Determinations as described above in paragraph (d) of this section are subject to the conditions as stated in § 291.9(c)(1) through (4).</P>
          <P>(f) It is the responsibility of the collecting public to ensure that they are casually collecting in an area that is open to casual collection, and that the materials they collect are subject to casual collection.</P>
          <P>(g) Paleontological resources collected on National Forest System lands, including common invertebrate and plant paleontological resources subject to casual collecting, cannot be sold. Sale of these paleontological resources is a violation of 16 U.S.C. 470aaa-5(a)(3) and § 291.27(a)(3) and may subject the violator to civil and criminal penalties.</P>

Hearings shall be conducted in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 554.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Commencement of hearing procedures.</E> Upon receipt of a request for a hearing, the hearing office shall assign an administrative law judge to the case. Notice of assignment shall be given promptly to the parties, and thereafter, all pleadings, papers, and other documents in the proceeding shall be filed directly with the administrative law judge, with copies served on the opposing party.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Appearance and practice.</E> (1) The respondent may appear in person, by representative, or by counsel, and may participate fully in the proceedings. If respondent fails to appear and the administrative law judge determines such failure is without good cause, the administrative law judge may, in his/her discretion, determine that such failure shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing and consent to the making of a decision on the record made at the hearing.</P>
          <P>(2) Departmental counsel shall represent the Agency in the proceedings. Upon notice to the Authorized Officer of the assignment of an administrative law judge to the case, said counsel shall enter his/her appearance on behalf of the Agency and shall file all petitions and correspondence exchanges by the Agency and the respondent which shall become part of the hearing record.

          <SUBJECT>Petition for judicial review; collection of unpaid assessments.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Judicial review.</E> Any person against whom a final administrative decision is issued assessing a penalty may file a petition for judicial review of the decision in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or in the district in which the violation is alleged to have occurred within the 30 calendar day period beginning on the date the decision was issued. Upon notice of such filing, the Secretary shall promptly file such a certified copy of the record on which the decision was issued. The court shall hear the action on the record made before the Secretary and shall sustain the action if it is supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. Judicial review is limited by the requirement to exhaust administrative remedies under 7 U.S.C. 6912(e).</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Failure to pay.</E> Failure to pay a penalty assessed is a debt to the U.S. Government. If any person fails to pay a penalty within 30 calendar days after the final administrative decision and the person has not filed a petition for judicial review of the decision in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section; or after a court in an action brought in paragraph (a) of this section has entered a final judgment upholding <PRTPAGE P="438"/>the assessment of the penalty, the Secretary may request the Attorney General to institute a civil action in a district court of the United States for any district in which the person if found, resides, or transacts business, to collect the penalty (plus interest at currently prevailing rates from the date of the final decision or the date of the final judgment, as the case may be). The district court shall have jurisdiction to hear and decide any such action. In such action, the validity, amount, and appropriateness of such penalty shall not be subject to review. Any person who fails to pay on a timely basis the amount of an assessment of a civil penalty shall be required to pay, in addition to such amount and interest, attorney's fees and costs for collection proceedings. This section does not preclude the use of other collection methods such as Treasury offset, where appropriate.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Introduction.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Administration of the Shasta and Clair Engle-Lewiston Units will be coordinated with the other purposes of the Central Valley Project of the Bureau of Reclamation and of the recreation area as a whole so as to provide for: (1) Public outdoor recreation benefits; (2) conservation of scenic, scientific, historic, and other values contributing to public enjoyment; and (3) the management, utilization, and disposal of renewable natural resources which in the judgment of the Secretary of Agriculture will promote or is compatible with, and does not significantly impair, public recreation and conservation of scenic, scientific, historic, or other values contributing to public enjoyment.</P>
            <P>(b) The Secretary may not acquire without consent of the owner any privately owned “improved property” or interests therein within the boundaries of these units, so long as the appropriate local zoning agency shall have in force and applicable to such property a duly adopted, valid, zoning ordinance that is approved by the Secretary. This suspension of the Secretary's authority to acquire “improved property” without the owner's consent would automatically cease: (1) If the property is made the subject of a variance or exception to any applicable zoning ordinance that does not conform to the applicable standards contained in §§ 292.11 to 292.13; or (2) if such property is put to any use which does not conform to any applicable zoning ordinance approved by the Secretary.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Improved property</E> as used in §§ 292.11 to 292.13, means any building or group of related buildings, the actual construction of which was begun before February 7, 1963, together with not more than three acres of land in the same ownership on which the building or group of buildings is situated, but the Secretary may exclude from such “improved property” any shore or waters, together with so much of the land adjoining such shore or waters, as he deems necessary for public access thereto.</P>

            <P>(d) Sections 292.11 to 292.13 specify the standards with which local zoning ordinances for the Shasta and Clair Engle-Lewiston Units must conform if <PRTPAGE P="441"/>the “improved property” or unimproved property proposed for development as authorized by the Act within the boundaries of the units is to be exempt from acquisition by condemnation. The objectives of §§ 292.11 to 292.13 are to:</P>
            <P>(1) Prohibit new commercial or industrial uses other than those which the Secretary considers to be consistent with the purposes of the act establishing the national recreation area; (2) promote the protection and development of properties in keeping with the purposes of that Act by means of use, acreage, setback, density, height or other requirements; and (3) provide that the Secretary receive notice of any variance granted under, or any exception made to, the application of the zoning ordinance approved by him.</P>
            <P>(e) Following promulgation of §§ 292.11 to 292.13 of final form, the Secretary is required to approve any zoning ordinance or any amendment to an approved zoning ordinance submitted to him which conforms to the standards contained in the regulations in effect at the time of adoption of the ordinance or amendment.</P>
            <P>(f) Any owner of unimproved property who proposes to develop his property for service to the public may submit to the Secretary a development plan setting forth the manner in which and the time by which the property is to be developed and the use to which it is proposed to be put. If the Secretary determines that the development and the use of the property conforms to approved zoning ordinances, and serves the purposes of the National Recreation Area and that the property is not needed for easements and rights-of-way for access, utilities, or facilities, or for administration sites, campgrounds, or other areas needed for use by the United States for visitors, he may in his discretion issue to such owner a certification that so long as the property is developed, maintained, and used in conformity with approved zoning ordinances the Secretary's authority to acquire the property without the owner's consent is suspended.</P>

            <SUBJECT>General provisions; procedures.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Approval of zoning ordinance and development plans.</E> (1) All validly adopted zoning ordinances and amendments thereto pertaining to the Shasta and Clair Engle-Lewiston Units may be submitted by the county of origin to the Secretary for written approval relative to their conformance with the applicable standards of §§ 292.11 to 292.13. Within 60 days following submission, the county will be notified of the Secretary's approval or disapproval of the zoning ordinances or amendments thereto. If more than 60 days are required, the county will be notified of the expected delay and of the additional time deemed necessary to reach a decision. The Secretary's approval shall remain effective so long as the zoning ordinances or amendments thereto remain in effect as approved.</P>
            <P>(2) Development plans pertaining to unimproved property within the Shasta and Clair Engle-Lewiston Units may be submitted by the owner to the Secretary for determination as to whether they conform with approved zoning ordinances and whether the planned use and development would serve the Act. Within 30 days following submission of such plans the Secretary will approve or disapprove the plans or, if more than 30 days are required, will notify the applicant of the expected delay and of the additional time deemed necessary.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Amendment of ordinances.</E> Amendments of approved ordinances may be furnished in advance of their adoption to the Secretary for written decision as to their conformance with applicable standards of §§ 292.11 to 292.13.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Variances or exceptions to application of ordinances.</E> (1) The Secretary shall be given written notice of any variance granted under, or any exception made to, the application of a zoning ordinance or amendment thereto approved by him.</P>

            <P>(2) The County, or private owners of improved property, may submit to the Secretary proposed variances or exceptions to the application of an approved zoning ordinance or amendment thereto for written advice as to whether the intended use will make the property subject to acquisition without the owner's consent. Within 30 days following <PRTPAGE P="442"/>his receipt of such a request, the Secretary will advise the interested party or parties as to his determination. If more than 30 days are required by the Secretary for such determination, he shall so notify the interested party or parties stating the additional time required and the reasons therefore.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Certification of property.</E> Where improvements and land use of improved property conform with approved ordinances, or with approved variances from such ordinances, certification that the Secretary's authority to acquire the property without the owner's consent is suspended may be obtained by any party in interest upon request to the Secretary. Where the development and use of unimproved property for service to the public is approved by the Secretary, certification that the authority to acquire the property without the owner's consent is suspended may be issued to the owner.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Effect of noncompliance.</E> Suspension of the Secretary's authority to acquire any improved property without the owner's consent will automatically cease if: (1) Such property is made the subject of variance or exception to any applicable zoning ordinance that does not conform to the applicable standard in the Secretary's regulation, (2) such property is put to a use which does not conform to any applicable zoning ordinance, or, as to property approved by the Secretary for development, a use which does not conform to the approved development plan or (3) the local zoning agency does not have in force a duly adopted, valid zoning ordinance that is approved by the Secretary in accordance with the standards of §§ 292.11 to 292.13.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Nonconforming commercial or industrial uses.</E> Any existing commercial or industrial uses not in conformance with approved zoning ordinances shall be discontinued within 10 years from the date such ordinances are approved: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That with the approval of the Secretary such 10-year period may be extended by the county for a prescribed period sufficient to allow the owner reasonable additional time to amortize investments made in the property before November 8, 1965.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Standards.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The standards set forth in §§ 292.11-292.13 shall apply to the Shasta and Clair Engle-Lewiston Units, which are defined by the boundary descriptions in the notice of the Secretary of Agriculture of July 12, 1966 (31 FR 9469), and to a strip of land outside the National Recreation Area on either side of Federal Aid Secondary Highway Numbered 1089, as more fully described in 2(a) of the act establishing the recreation area (79 Stat. 1296).</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">New industrial or commercial uses.</E> New industrial or commercial uses will be prohibited in any location except under the following conditions:</P>
            <P>(1) The industrial use is such that its operation, physical structures, or waste byproducts would not have significant adverse impacts on surrounding or nearby outdoor recreation, scenic and esthetic values. Industrial uses having an adverse impact include, but are not limited to, cement production, gravel extraction operations involving more than one-fourth acre of surface, smelters, sand, gravel and aggregate processing plants, fabricating plants, pulpmills, and commercial livestock feeder yards.</P>
            <P>(2)(i) The commercial use is for purposes of providing food, lodging, automotive or marine maintenance facilities and services to accommodate recreationists and the intended land occupancy and physical structures are such that they can be harmonized with adjacent land development and surrounding appearances in accordance with approved plans and schedules.</P>
            <P>(ii) This standard provides for privately owned and operated businesses whose purposes and physical structures are in keeping with objectives for use and maintenance of the area's outdoor recreation resources. It precludes establishment of drive-in theaters, zoos, and similar nonconforming types of commercial entertainment.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Protection of roadsides.</E> Provisions to protect natural scenic qualities and maintain screening along public travel routes will include:</P>

            <P>(1) Prohibition of new structural improvements or visible utility lines within a strip of land extending back not less than 150 feet from both sides of the centerline of any public road or <PRTPAGE P="443"/>roadway except roads within subdivisions or commercial areas. In addition to buildings, this prohibition pertains to above-ground power and telephone lines, borrow pits, gravel, or earth extraction areas, and quarries.</P>
            <P>(2) Retention of trees and shrubs in the above-prescribed roadside strips to the full extent that is compatible with needs for public safety and road maintenance. Wholesale clearing by chemical or other means for fire control and other purposes will not be practiced under this standard.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Protection of shorelines.</E> Provisions to protect scenic qualities and reduce potentials for pollution of public reservoirs will include: Prohibition of structures within 300 feet horizontal distance from highwater lines of reservoirs other than structures the purpose of which is to service and accommodate boating or to facilitate picnicking and swimming: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That exceptions to this standard may be made upon showing satisfactory to the Secretary that proposed structures will not conflict with scenic and antipollution considerations.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Property development.</E> Location and development of structures will conform with the following minimum standards:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Commercial development.</E> (i) Stores, restaurants, garages, service stations, and comparable business enterprises will be situated in centers zoned for this purpose unless they are operated as part of a resort or hotel. Commercial centers will be of sufficient size that expansion of facilities or service areas is not dependent upon use of public land.</P>
            <P>(ii) Sites outside designated commercial centers will be used for resort development contingent upon case by case concurrence of the responsible county officials and the Secretary that such use is, in all aspects, compatible with the purposes for establishing the recreation area.</P>
            <P>(iii) Structures for commercial purposes, inclusive of isolated resorts or motels, will not exceed two stories height at front elevation, and will be conventional architecture and will utilize colors, nonglare roofing materials, and spacing or layout that harmonizes with forested settings. Except for signs, structures designed primarily for purposes of calling attention to products or service will not be permitted.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Residential development.</E> (i) Locations approved for residential development will be buffered by distance, topography, or forest cover from existing or planned public use areas such as trailer parks, campgrounds, or organization sites. Separation will be sufficient to avoid conflicts resulting from intervisibility, noise, and proximity that is conducive to private property trespass.</P>

            <P>(ii) Requirements for approval of residential areas will include: (<E T="03">a</E>) Construction of access when main access would otherwise be limited to a road constructed by the United States primarily to service publicly owned recreation developments; (<E T="03">b</E>) limitation of residences to single-family units situated at a density not exceeding two per acre, but any lot of less than a half-acre may be used for residential purposes if, on or before promulgation of §§ 292.11-292.13, such lot was in separate ownership or was delineated in a county-approved plat that constitutes part of a duly recorded subdivision; (<E T="03">c</E>) use of set-backs, limitations to natural terrain, neutral exterior colors, nonglare roofing materials, and limitations of building heights fully adequate to harmonize housing development with the objective of the National Recreation Area as set forth in the act.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Signs and signing.</E> Only those signs may be permitted which: (i) Do not exceed 1 square foot in area for any residential use; (ii) do not exceed 40 square feet in area, 8 feet in length, and 15 feet maximum height from ground for any other use, including advertisement of the sale or rental of property; and (iii) which are not illuminated by any neon or flashing device. Commercial signs may be placed only on the property on which the advertised use occurs, or on the property which is advertised for sale or rental. Signs shall be subdued in appearance, harmonizing in design and color with the surroundings and shall not be attached to any tree or shrub. Nonconforming signs may continue for a period not to exceed 2 years from the date a zoning ordinance containing these limitations is adopted.</P>

            <P>(d) <E T="03">Certification of compliance with standards</E>—(1) <E T="03">Present use.</E> Any owner of property may request in writing the Area Ranger to examine the present use of the property and issue a certification that such present use conforms to the applicable standards established in § 292.16 for the land use category in which the property is placed. If after examination the Area Ranger determines that the present use of the property does so conform, he will issue a certification to this effect.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Planned development or change in use.</E> Any owner of property who proposes to change the use or develop his property for other than agricultural use may submit to the Area Ranger a use or development plan setting forth the manner in which and the time by which the property is to be developed and the use to which the property is to be put.

Such certification shall specify that it is only effective so long as the property is not subdivided, and is not further improved and the improvements existing on the effective date of these regulations, are not reconstructed, altered or relocated, except to meet standards. The certification shall specify the date on which it shall terminate.</P>
            <P>(2) If the Area Ranger determines, prior to certification, that a part or all of a property, for which a request for certification is made, is needed for access to and utilization of public property or for recreation and other facilities, he may except from the certification that part of the property needed for these purposes.</P>

            <P>(j) <E T="03">Limitation on acquisitions.</E> Acquisitions of lands or interests therein for access to and utilization of public property and for recreation and other facilities shall not exceed 5 percent of the total acreage of all private property within the Sawtooth National Recreation Area on August 22, 1972. A land acquisition plan shall be prepared by the Area Ranger and approved by the Regional Forester showing those properties needed for access to and utilization of public property or for recreation and other facilities. Said plan may be revised from time to time upon approval by the Regional Forester. Said plan shall be available for inspection by the public in the office of the Area Ranger.</P>
            <P>(k) <E T="03">Land exchanges.</E> Some parcels of Federal lands within the Sawtooth National Recreation Area are classified or may be subsequently classified in the overall general plan for the Recreation Area as suitable for selection through land exchange. Using existing land exchange authorities, these Federal lands may be made available for selection by parties owning land within the boundaries of the National Recreation Area to resolve some existing or potential land use conflicts. The values of the properties so exchanged shall be approximately equal, or, if they are not approximately equal, they shall be equalized by the payment of cash. Federal lands which may be located within the boundaries of designated communities will be considered for exchange only after acceptable community development plans and ordinances have been implemented.</P>

            <P>(iii) Notify the operator that more time is necessary to review the plan because of the need to prepare an environmental impact statement, or conduct a cultural resource survey, or other stated reasons; in such cases, the operator will be notified of the approximate time needed to complete the review; or,</P>
            <P>(iv) Notify the operator of an apparent conflict of ownership and that additional proof of ownership is required; or,</P>
            <P>(v) Notify the operator that the operating plan as submitted is inadequate to support any conclusion as to substantial impairment, and that additional information will be required; or,</P>
            <P>(vi) Notify the operator that the operating plan is not approved since such operations as specified in the plan would create substantial impairment.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Operating plans—suspension, revocation, or modification.</E> The authorized officer may suspend or revoke authorization to operate in whole or in part where such operations are causing substantial impairment which cannot be mitigated. At any time during operations under an approved operating plan, the operator may be required to modify the operating plan to minimize or avoid substantial impairment of the values of the SNRA.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Bond requirements.</E> (1) An operator shall furnish a bond, in the amount determined by the Area Ranger to be appropriate for reclamation of the disturbed surface area, prior to the commencement of operations. In lieu of a bond, the operator may deposit into a Federal depository, as directed by the Forest Service, cash in an amount equal to the required dollar amount of the bond or negotiable securities of the United States having market value at the time of deposit or not less than the required dollar amount of the bond.</P>
            <P>(2) When the reclamation of the project, or portions thereof, has been completed, the operator will notify the Area Ranger who will examine the area to determine whether the reclamation is acceptable. When the Area Ranger has accepted as completed any portion of the reclamation, he shall reduce proportionately the amount of bond thereafter to be required with respect to the remaining reclamation. However, the operator will not be released from liability under the bond for the amount which may be necessary to revegetate each planting area for a minimum period of at least 5 years after the first efforts at revegetation if those initial efforts are unsuccessful.</P>
            <P>(3) If the Area Ranger determines that revegetation is likely to occur before the expiration of such minimum period, he may release the operator from the extended liability under the bond for revegetation of planting area.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Access.</E> The operator shall permit free and unrestricted public access to and through lands included within an unpatented mining claim for all lawful and proper purposes. In areas where such access would unduly interfere with authorized operations or would constitute a hazard to public health and safety, public use may be restricted with prior approval of the Area Ranger.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose and scope.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The Act establishing the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area (hereafter referred to as HCNRA) (16 <PRTPAGE P="452"/>U.S.C. 460gg-460gg-13) encourages the retention of traditional and valid uses of private land within the HCNRA, such as ranching, grazing, farming, timber harvesting, and the occupation of homes and lands associated therewith, as they existed at the time the HCNRA was established on December 31, 1975. To this end, the Act directs the Secretary of Agriculture to promulgate regulations establishing standards for the use and development of private land within the HCNRA and grants the Secretary limited condemnation authority to address situations where the standards are not met. The purpose of this subpart is to establish standards that would guide the Secretary's consideration of the use of the limited condemnation authority granted by the Act.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Scope.</E> The regulations in this subpart establish standards applicable to all private property within the boundaries of the HCNRA, including that within the boundaries of the Rapid, Snake, and Imnaha Wild and Scenic Rivers and the Hells Canyon Wilderness. The regulations in this subpart do not operate to restrict the use and development of private property; rather, they serve to inform the landowner of those uses that are compatible with purposes for which the HCNRA was established. Uses not compatible with these standards could result in the Secretary acquiring land or interests therein without a landowner's consent.</P>
            <P>The regulations in this subpart, in and of themselves, do not effect a taking of private property, including valid, existing water rights, nor do the standards established in this subpart limit or restrict a private landowner's property use that is compatible with the purposes of the Act. The Responsible Official may use the regulations in this subpart solely to determine whether private land uses or developments are compatible with the purposes and direction of the Act and, if not, to determine whether the Secretary should consider initiating condemnation proceedings to acquire land or scenic easements.</P>

            </P>
            <P>(b) Areas which should be managed for public recreation requiring development and substantial improvements may be given special classification as public recreation areas. Areas in single tracts of not more than 160 acres may be approved and classified by the Chief of the Forest Service or by such officers as he may designate. Areas in excess of 160 acres will be classified by the Secretary of Agriculture. Classification hereunder may include areas used or selected to be used for the development and maintenance as camp grounds, picnic grounds, organization camps, resorts, public service sites (such as for restaurants, filling stations, stores, horse and boat liveries, garages, and similar types of public service accommodations), bathing beaches, winter sports areas, lodges, and similar facilities and appurtenant structures needed by the public to enjoy the recreation resources of the national forests. The boundaries of all areas so classified shall be clearly marked on the ground and notices of such classification shall be posted at conspicuous places thereon. Areas classified under this section shall thereby be set apart and reserved for public recreation use and such classification shall constitute a formal closing of the area to any use or occupancy inconsistent with the classification.</P>

Such roads may also be used for collecting and transporting coal mine methane. Any buried infrastructure, including pipelines, needed for the capture, collection, and use of coal mine methane, will be located within the <PRTPAGE P="489"/>rights-of-way of temporary roads that are otherwise necessary for coal-related surface activities including the installation and operation of methane venting wells.</P>
            <P>(2) If proposed road construction/reconstruction meets one of the exceptions, subject to the legal rights identified in § 294.43(c)(1), the responsible official must determine:</P>
            <P>(i) Motorized access, without road construction is not feasible;</P>
            <P>(ii) When proposing to construct a forest road, that a temporary road would not provide reasonable access;</P>
            <P>(iii) Road construction is consistent with the applicable land management plan direction;</P>
            <P>(iv) Within a native cutthroat trout catchment or identified recovery watershed, road construction will not diminish, over the long-term, conditions in the water influence zone and the extent of the occupied native cutthroat trout habitat; and</P>
            <P>(v) That watershed conservation practices will be applied to all projects occurring in native cutthroat trout habitat.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Road construction/reconstruction/decommissioning project implementation and management.</E> The following elements will be incorporated into any road construction/reconstruction projects implemented within Colorado Roadless Areas.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Road construction/reconstruction.</E> If it is determined that a road is authorized in a Colorado Roadless Area, conduct construction in a manner that reduces effects on surface resources, and prevents unnecessary or unreasonable surface disturbance.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Road decommissioning.</E> Decommission any road and restore the affected landscape when it is determined that the road is no longer needed for the established purpose prior to, or upon termination or expiration of a contract, authorization, or permit, if possible; or upon termination or expiration of a contract, authorization, or permit, whichever is sooner. Require the inclusion of a road decommissioning provision in all contracts or permits. Design decommissioning to stabilize, restore, and revegetate unneeded roads to a more natural state to protect resources and enhance roadless area characteristics. Examples include obliteration, denial of use, elimination of travelway functionality, and removal of the road prism (restoration of the road corridor to the original contour and hydrologic function).</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Road designations.</E> The designation of a temporary road constructed or reconstructed pursuant to this subpart may not be changed to forest road except where a forest road is allowed under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Road use.</E> Use of motor vehicles for administrative purposes by the Forest Service and by fire, emergency, or law enforcement personnel is allowed. All roads constructed pursuant to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section shall prohibit public motorized vehicles (including off-highway vehicles) except:</P>
            <P>(i) Where specifically used for the purpose for which the road was established; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Motor vehicle use that is specifically authorized under a Federal law or regulation.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Road maintenance.</E> Maintenance of roads is permissible in Colorado Roadless Areas.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Other activities.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Water Rights.</E> This subpart in no manner restricts any party from seeking modification of a pre-existing water court decree, but after July 3, 2012 any Forest Service authorization required for road construction, road reconstruction, tree cutting, or linear construction zones associated with a modified water court decree must conform to the requirements in this subpart; provided that road construction or reconstruction may be authorized where necessary to change the location of a headgate and associated ditch, pursuant to Colorado Revised Statute 2011 § 37-86-111.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Oil and Gas Leases.</E> Oil and gas leases issued within a Colorado Roadless Area after July 3, 2012 will prohibit road construction/reconstruction. The Forest Service shall not authorize the Bureau of Land Management to grant any request for a waiver, exception, or modification to any oil or gas lease if doing so would result in any road construction within a Colorado Roadless Area. For oil and gas leases issued in a Colorado Roadless Area prior to July 3, 2012, the rule preserves any existing leases and surface development rights. The rule also preserves any existing limitations on surface development rights arising from lease terms, lease stipulations, conditions of approval, 36 CFR 228.100, and Onshore Oil and Gas Orders.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Oil and Gas Leases on Upper Tier Acres.</E> Oil and gas leases issued within upper tier acres after July 3, 2012 will require a no surface occupancy stipulation. The Forest Service shall not authorize the Bureau of Land Management to grant any request for a waiver, exception, or modification to any oil or gas lease if doing so would result in surface occupancy within an upper tier area.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Oil and Gas Surface Use Plans of Operation.</E> Where applicable and consistent with lease rights, during the review of any application for a surface use plan of operations affecting lands within a Colorado Roadless Area, the responsible official will:</P>
            <P>(1) Locate, without compromising health and safety standards, roads, well sites, and facilities on pre-existing areas of surface disturbance. Project design shall minimize the amount of necessary temporary road construction or reconstruction.</P>
            <P>(2) Consider an alternative for proposed operations that addresses locating directional drilling of multi-well sites on pre-existing areas of surface disturbance. Such an alternative can be dismissed from detailed analysis with clear justification.</P>
            <P>(3) Restrict road construction for leases partially within Colorado Roadless Areas to portions of the lease outside of Colorado Roadless Areas except when doing so will be substantially more environmentally damaging, compromise safety standards, or is unfeasible due to surface and/or operational conditions.</P>
            <P>(4) Perform reclamation of surface disturbances incrementally, to minimize the total area of disturbance at any given point in time during the exploration or development of a lease.</P>
            <P>(5) Design temporary roads and facilities to blend with the terrain to minimize visual impacts and to facilitate restoration when the road is no longer needed.</P>
            <P>(6) Co-locate, consistent with health and safety standards, power lines, flow lines and pipelines within the right-of-way of roads or other LCZs to minimize the area of surface disturbance.</P>
            <P>(7) Consider new and developing low impact techniques and technologies and either apply or dismiss with justification.</P>
            <P>(8) Consider the best available technology to minimize noise and air emissions.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Trails.</E> Nothing in this subpart shall affect the current or future management of motorized and non-motorized trails in Colorado Roadless Areas. Decisions concerning the management or status of motorized and non-motorized trails within Colorado Roadless Areas under this subpart shall be made during the applicable forest travel management processes.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Motorized access.</E> Nothing in this subpart shall be construed as limiting the authority of the responsible official to approve existing and future motorized access not requiring road construction or reconstruction in Colorado Roadless Areas associated with grazing <PRTPAGE P="492"/>permits, special use authorizations, and other authorizations.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Livestock grazing.</E> The authority to issue livestock grazing permits on national forest system lands within a Colorado Roadless Area is not affected by this subpart; however, no new temporary or forest roads shall be authorized through grazing permits issued after July 3, 2012.</P>

            <P>Modifications and administrative corrections pursuant to this subpart, after coordination with the State, may be made under the following circumstances:</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Modifications to boundaries.</E> The Chief of the Forest Service may modify the boundaries of any designated Colorado Roadless Area identified in § 294.49 or add new Colorado Roadless Areas based on changed circumstances. Modifications and additions will be reflected in the set of maps maintained at the national headquarters office of the Forest Service. The construction or reconstruction of a temporary road or tree cutting, sale, or removal will not result in any boundary modification of a Colorado Roadless Area. Public notice with a minimum 90-day comment period will be provided for any proposed Colorado Roadless Area boundary modifications or additions.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Administrative corrections to boundaries.</E> The Chief of the Forest Service may issue administrative corrections after public notice and a 30-day comment period. Administrative corrections to the maps of any designated Colorado Roadless Areas identified in § 294.49, including upper tier acres are adjustments to remedy errors such as clerical or improvements in mapping technology. Other than clerical errors, an administrative correction is based on improved field data due to updated imagery, global positioning system data, or other collected field data.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Amendments to rule language.</E> Any amendment of this subpart will include coordination with the State and the appropriate level of NEPA analysis. A minimum 90-day comment period will be provided.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Scope and applicability.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) This subpart does not revoke, suspend, or modify any permit, contract, lease, or other legal instrument authorizing or granting rights to the occupancy and use of National Forest system land issued prior to July 3, 2012 nor does it affect the authority or the discretion of the responsible official to reissue any such permit, contract, or other legal instrument upon its expiration or termination.</P>
            <P>(b) This subpart does not revoke, suspend, or modify any project or activity decision made prior to July 3, 2012.</P>
            <P>(c) The provisions set forth in this subpart provide the maximum level of tree cutting, sale and removal, and road construction and reconstruction activity allowed within Colorado Roadless Areas. Land management plan components can be more restrictive than this subpart and will continue to provide direction and guidance for projects and activities within Colorado Roadless Areas. Nothing in this subpart shall prohibit a responsible official from further restricting activities allowed within Colorado Roadless Areas. This subpart does not compel the amendment or revision of any land management plan.</P>
            <P>(d) The prohibitions and restrictions established in this subpart are not subject to reconsideration, revision, or rescission in subsequent project decisions or land management plan amendments or revisions undertaken pursuant to 36 CFR part 219.</P>
            <P>(e) Nothing in this subpart waives any applicable requirements regarding site specific environmental analysis, public involvement, consultation with Tribes and other agencies, or compliance with applicable laws.</P>
            <P>(f) If any provision in this subpart or its application to any person or to certain circumstances is held to be invalid, the remainder of the regulations in this subpart and their application remain in force.</P>
            <P>(g) After July 3, 2012 36 CFR 294.10 through 294.14 shall have no effect within the State of Colorado.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The regulations in this part implement provisions of the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979, as amended (16 U.S.C. 470aa-mm) by establishing the uniform definitions, standards, and procedures to be followed by all Federal land managers in providing protection for archaeological resources, located on public lands and Indian lands of the United States. These regulations enable Federal land managers to protect archaeological resources, taking into consideration provisions of the American Indian Religious Freedom Act (92 Stat. 469; 42 U.S.C. 1996), through permits authorizing excavation and/or removal of archaeological resources, through civil penalties for unauthorized excavation and/or removal, through provisions for the preservation of archaeological resource collections and data, and through provisions for ensuring confidentiality of information about archaeological resources when disclosure would threaten the archaeological resources.</P>
          <P>(b) The regulations in this part do not impose any new restrictions on activities permitted under other laws, authorities, and regulations relating to mining, mineral leasing, reclamation, and other multiple uses of the public lands.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Permit requirements and exceptions.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Any person proposing to excavate and/or remove archaeological resources from public lands or Indian lands, and to carry out activities associated with such excavation and/or removal, shall apply to the Federal land manager for a permit for the proposed work, and shall not begin the proposed work until a permit has been issued. The Federal land manager may issue a permit to any qualified person, subject to appropriate terms and conditions, provided that the person applying for a permit meets conditions in § 296.8(a) of this part.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Exceptions:</E> (1) No permit shall be required under this part for any person conducting activities on the public lands under other permits, leases, licenses, or entitlements for use, when <PRTPAGE P="499"/>those activities are exclusively for purposes other than the excavation and/or removal of archaeological resources, even though those activities might incidentally result in the disturbance of archaeological resources. General earth-moving excavation conducted under a permit or other authorization shall not be construed to mean excavation and/or removal as used in this part. This exception does not, however, affect the Federal land manager's responsibility to comply with other authorities which protect archaeological resources prior to approving permits, leases, licenses, or entitlements for use; any excavation and/or removal of archaeological resources required for compliance with those authorities shall be conducted in accordance with the permit requirements of this part.</P>
          <P>(2) No permit shall be required under this part for any person collecting for private purposes any rock, coin, bullet, or mineral which is not an archaeological resource as defined in this part, provided that such collecting does not result in disturbance of any archaeological resource.</P>
          <P>(3) No permit shall be required under this part or under section 3 of the Act of June 8, 1906 (16 U.S.C. 432), for the excavation or removal by any Indian tribe or member thereof of any archaeological resource located on Indian lands of such Indian tribe, except that in the absence of tribal law regulating the excavation or removal or archaeological resources on Indian lands, an individual tribal member shall be required to obtain a permit under this part;</P>
          <P>(4) No permit shall be required under this part for any person to carry out any archaeological activity authorized by a permit issued under section 3 of the Act of June 8, 1906 (16 U.S.C. 432), before the enactment of the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979. Such permit shall remain in effect according to its terms and conditions until expiration.</P>
          <P>(5) No permit shall be required under section 3 of the Act of June 8, 1906 (16 U.S.C. 432) for any archaeological work for which a permit is issued under this part.</P>
          <P>(c) Persons carrying out official agency duties under the Federal land manager's direction, associated with the management of archaeological resources, need not follow the permit application procedures of § 296.6. However, the Federal land manager shall insure that provisions of §§ 296.8 and 296.9 have been met by other documented means, and that any official duties which might result in harm to or destruction of any Indian tribal religious or cultural site, as determined by the Federal land manager, have been the subject of consideration under § 296.7.</P>
          <P>(d) Upon the written request of the Governor of any State, on behalf of the State or its educational institutions, the Federal land manager shall issue a permit, subject to the provisions of §§ 296.5(b)(5), 296.7, 296.8(a) (3), (4), (5), (6), and (7), 296.9, 296.10, 296.12, and 296.13(a) to such Governor or to such designee as the Governor deems qualified to carry out the intent of the Act, for purposes of conducting archaeological research, excavating and/or removing archaeological resources, and safeguarding and preserving any materials and data collected in a university, museum, or other scientific or educational institution approved by the Federal land manager.</P>
          <P>(e) Under other statutory, regulatory, or administrative authorities governing the use of public lands and Indian lands, authorizations may be required for activities which do not require a permit under this part. Any person wishing to conduct on public lands or Indian lands any activities related to but believed to fall outside the scope of this part should consult with the Federal land manager, for the purpose of determining whether any authorization is required, prior to beginning such activities.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Notification to Indian tribes of possible harm to, or destruction of, sites on public lands having religious or cultural importance.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) If the issuance of a permit under this part may result in harm to, or destruction of, any Indian tribal religious or cultural site on public lands, as determined by the Federal land manager, at least 30 days before issuing such a permit the Federal land manager shall notify any Indian tribe which may consider the site as having religious or cultural importance. Such notice shall not be deemed a disclosure to the public for purposes of section 9 of the Act.</P>
          <P>(1) Notice by the Federal land manager to any Indian tribe shall be sent to the chief executive officer or other designated official of the tribe. Indian tribes are encouraged to designate a tribal official to be the focal point for any notification and discussion between the tribe and the Federal land manager.</P>

          <P>(2) The Federal land manager may provide notice to any other Native American group that is known by the Federal land manager to consider sites <PRTPAGE P="501"/>potentially affected as being of religious or cultural importance.</P>
          <P>(3) Upon request during the 30-day period, the Federal land manager may meet with official representatives of any Indian tribe or group to discuss their interests, including ways to avoid or mitigate potential harm or destruction such as excluding sites from the permit area. Any mitigation measures which are adopted shall be incorporated into the terms and conditions of the permit under § 296.9.</P>
          <P>(4) When the Federal land manager determines that a permit applied for under this part must be issued immediately because of an imminent threat of loss or destruction of an archaeological resource, the Federal land manager shall so notify the appropriate tribe.</P>
          <P>(b)(1) In order to identify sites of religious or cultural importance, the Federal land manager shall seek to identify all Indian tribes having aboriginal or historic ties to the lands under the Federal land manager's jurisdiction and seek to determine, from the chief executive officer or other designated official of any such tribe, the location and nature of specific sites of religious or cultural importance so that such information may be on file for land management purposes. Information on sites eligible for or included in the National Register of Historic Places may be withheld from public disclosure pursuant to section 304 of the Act of October 15, 1966, as amended (16 U.S.C. 470w-3).</P>
          <P>(2) If the Federal land manager becomes aware of a Native American group that is not an Indian tribe as defined in this part but has aboriginal or historic ties to public lands under the Federal land manager's jurisdiction, the Federal land manager may seek to communicate with official representatives of that group to obtain information on sites they may consider to be of religious or cultural importance.</P>
          <P>(3) The Federal land manager may enter into agreement with any Indian tribe or other Native American group for determining locations for which such tribe or group wishes to receive notice under this section.</P>
          <P>(4) The Federal land manager should also seek to determine, in consultation with official representatives of Indian tribes or other Native American groups, what circumstances should be the subject of special notification to the tribe or group after a permit has been issued. Circumstances calling for notification might include the discovery of human remains. When circumstances for special notification have been determined by the Federal land manager, the Federal land manager will include a requirement in the terms and conditions of permits, under § 296.9(c), for permittees to notify the Federal land manger immediately upon the occurrence of such circumstances. Following the permittee's notification, the Federal land manager will notify and consult with the tribe or group as appropriate. In cases involving Native American human remains and other “cultural items”, as defined by NAGPRA, the Federal land manager is referred to NAGPRA and its implementing regulations.</P>
