      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

              <P>(iv) Provide different or separate aid, benefits, or services to individuals with handicaps or to any class of individuals with handicaps than is provided to others unless such action is necessary to provide qualified individuals with handicaps with aid, benefits, or services that are as effective as those provided to others;</P>
              <P>(v) Deny a qualified individual with handicaps the opportunity to participate as a member of planning or advisory boards;</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph does not—</P>
              <P>(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps;</P>
              <P>(2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or</P>

              <P>(3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 100.550(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee <PRTPAGE P="13"/>after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Historic preservation programs.</E> In meeting the requirements of § 100.550(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals with handicaps. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 100.550(a) (2) or (3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—</P>
              <P>(i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;</P>
              <P>(ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Adopting other innovative methods.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Time period for compliance.</E> The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by November 7, 1988, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by September 6, 1991, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by March 6, 1989, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—</P>
              <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals with handicaps;</P>
              <P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;</P>
              <P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</P>
              <P>(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.</P>

              <P>For the purpose of this subpart, the following definitions will apply:</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Administrative Offset</E> means withholding money payable by the United States Government (including money payable by the United States Government on behalf of a State Government) to, or held by the Government for, a person to satisfy a debt the person owes the United States Government.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Centralized offset</E> means the offset of Federal payments through the Treasury Offset Program to collect debts which creditor agencies have certified pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716(c), 3720A(a) and applicable regulations. The term <PRTPAGE P="16"/>“centralized offset” includes the Treasury Offset Program's processing of offsets of Federal payments disbursed by disbursing officials other than the Department of the Treasury.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Claim or debt</E> means an amount of money, funds, or property that has been determined by an agency official to be owed to the United States by a person, organization, or entity, except another Federal agency. For the purposes of <E T="03">administrative offset</E> under 31 U.S.C. 3716, the terms <E T="03">claim</E> and <E T="03">debt</E> include an amount of money, funds, or property owed by a person to a State (including past-due support being enforced by a State), the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, the United States Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</P>

              <P>
                <E T="03">Delinquent</E> refers to the status of a debt and means a debt has not been paid by the date specified in the initial written demand for payment or applicable contractual agreement with the NLRB, unless other satisfactory payment arrangements have been made by that date. If the debtor fails to satisfy obligations under a payment agreement with the NLRB after other payment arrangements have been made, the debt becomes a delinquent debt.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Payment in full</E> means payment of the total debt due the United States, including any interest, penalty, and administrative costs of collection assessed against the debtor.</P>

              <P>The NLRB's authority to compromise a debt or to suspend or terminate collection action on a debt covered by these procedures is limited by 31 U.S.C. 3711(a) to claims that:</P>
              <P>(a) Have not been referred to another Federal Agency for further collection actions; and</P>
              <P>(b) Do not exceed $100,000 (exclusive of any interest) or such higher amount as the Attorney General shall from time to time prescribe for purposes of compromise or suspension or termination of collection activity.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Written demand for payment.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The NLRB will promptly make written demand upon the debtor for payment of money or the return of specific property. The written demand for payment will be consistent with the requirements of 31 CFR chapter IX § 901.2. The date by which payment is due to avoid any late charges will be 60 days from the date that the demand letter is mailed or hand-delivered.</P>
              <P>(b) The failure to state in a letter of demand a matter described in 31 CFR chapter IX § 901.2 is not a defense for a debtor and does not prevent the NLRB from proceeding with respect to that matter.</P>
              <P>(c) When necessary, to protect the Government's interest, written demand may be preceded by other appropriate action, including immediate referral for litigation. It may be appropriate to contact a debtor or his representative or guarantor by other means (telephone, in person, etc.) to discuss prompt payment, the debtor's ability to repay the debt, and to inform the debtor of his rights and the affect of nonpayment or delayed payment.</P>
              <P>(d) When the NLRB learns that a bankruptcy petition has been filed with respect to a debtor, the NLRB will cease collection action immediately unless it has been determined that the automatic stay imposed at the time of filing pursuant to 11 U.S.C. 362 has been lifted or is no longer in effect.</P>

              <P>(a) A debtor who disputes a debt should provide the NLRB with an explanation as to why the debt is incorrect within 60 days from the date the initial demand letter was mailed or hand-delivered. The debtor may support the explanation by affidavits, cancelled checks, or other relevant evidence.</P>
              <P>(b) If the debtor's arguments appear to have merit, the NLRB may waive the interest period pursuant to 29 CFR 100.617(c) pending a final determination of the existence or the amount of the debt.</P>

However, the NLRB retains the authority to resolve disputes, compromise claims, suspend or terminate collection action, and initiate enforced collection through litigation. When appropriate, the NLRB shall contract for collection services in accordance with guidance and standards contained in 31 CFR chapter IX parts 900-904.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Collection by administrative offset.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Application.</E> (1) The NLRB may administratively undertake collection by centralized offset on each claim which is liquidated or certain in amount in accordance with the guidance and standards in 31 CFR parts 900-904 and 5 U.S.C. 5514.</P>
              <P>(2) This section does not apply to those debts described in 31 CFR 901.3(a)(2).</P>
              <P>(3) Unless otherwise provided for by contract or law, debts or payments that are not subject to administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716 may be collected by administrative offset under the common law or other applicable statutory authority.</P>
              <P>(4) Generally, administrative offset of payments under the authority of 31 U.S.C. 3716 may not be conducted more than 10 years after the Government's right to collect the claim or debt first accrued.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Mandatory centralized offset.</E> (1) The NLRB is required to refer past due legally enforceable, nontax debts that are over 180 days delinquent to the Department of the Treasury for collection by centralized administrative offset. A debt is legally enforceable if there has been a final determination by the NLRB that the debt, in the amount stated, is due and there are no legal bars to collection action. Debts under this section will be referred and collected pursuant to procedures in 31 CFR 901.3(b).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">NLRB administrative offset.</E> The NLRB, in order to refer a delinquent debt to the Department of the Treasury for administrative offset, adopts the administrative offset procedures as prescribed by 31 CFR 901.3.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Non-centralized administrative offset.</E> Generally, non-centralized administrative offsets are ad hoc case-by-case offsets that the NLRB would conduct at its own discretion, internally or in cooperation with the agency certifying or authorizing payments to the debtor. Non-centralized administrative offset is used when centralized administrative offset is not available or appropriate to collect past due legally enforceable, nontax delinquent debts. In these cases, the NLRB may make a request directly to a payment-authorizing agency to offset a payment due a debtor to collect a delinquent debt. The NLRB adopts the procedures in 31 CFR 901.3(c) so that it may request that the Department of the Treasury or any other payment authorizing agency to conduct a non-centralized administrative offset.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Requests to OPM to offset a debtor's anticipated or future benefit payments under the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund and the Federal Employees Retirement System.</E> Upon providing <PRTPAGE P="19"/>OPM written certification that a debtor has been afforded the procedures provided for in this section, the NLRB will request that OPM offset a debtor's anticipated or future benefit payments under the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (Fund) in accordance with regulations codified at 5 CFR 831.1801-831.1808 and the Federal Employees Retirement System (System) in accordance with regulations codified at 5 CFR 845.401-845.408. Upon receipt of a request, OPM will identify and “flag” a debtor's account in anticipation of the time when the debtor requests or becomes eligible for payments from the Fund or System. This will satisfy any requirement that offset be initiated prior to the expiration of the time limitations referenced in 29 CFR 100.614(a)(4).</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Review requirements.</E> For purposes of this section, whenever the NLRB is required to afford a debtor a review within the Agency, the NLRB shall provide the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for a review of the record in accordance with 31 CFR 901.3(e). The NLRB will provide the debtor with the reasonable opportunity for an oral hearing in accordance with 31 CFR 285.11(f), when the debtor requests reconsideration of the debt, and the NLRB determines that the question of the indebtedness cannot be resolved by review of the written record, for example, when the validity of the debt turns on an issue of credibility or veracity.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Administrative Wage Garnishment.</E> The NLRB is authorized to collect debts from a debtor's wages by means of administrative wage garnishment in accordance with the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3720D and 31 CFR 285.11. This section adopts and incorporates all of the provisions of 31 CFR 285.11 concerning administrative wage garnishment, including the hearing procedures described in 31 CFR 285.11(f). The NLRB may use administrative wage garnishment to collect a delinquent debt unless the debtor is making timely payments under an agreement to pay the debt in installments.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Payment collection.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The NLRB shall make every effort to collect a claim in full before it becomes delinquent, but will consider arranging for payment in regular installments consistent with 31 CFR 901.8, if the debtor furnishes satisfactory evidence that he is unable to pay the debt in one lump sum. Except for a claim described in 5 U.S.C. 5514, all installment payment arrangements must be in writing and require the payment of interest, penalties, and other administrative costs. If possible, the installment payments should be sufficient in size and frequency to liquidate the debt in three years or less.</P>
              <P>(b) If a debt is paid in one lump sum after it becomes delinquent, the NLRB shall impose charges for interest, penalties, and administrative costs as specified in 31 CFR 901.9.</P>
              <P>(c) Payment of a debt is made by check, electronic funds transfer, draft, or money order payable to the National Labor Relations Board. Payment should be made to the National Labor Relations Board, Finance Branch, 1099 14th Street NW., Washington, DC 20570, unless payment is—</P>
              <P>(1) Made pursuant to arrangements with the Department of Justice;</P>
              <P>(2) Ordered by a Court of the United States; or</P>

              <P>(a) Pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3717, the NLRB shall assess interest, penalties, and administrative costs on debts owed to the United States Government. Interest, penalties, and administrative costs will be assessed in accordance with the provisions contained in 31 CFR 901.9.</P>
              <P>(b) The NLRB shall waive collection of interest on a debt or any portion of the debt which is paid in full within 30 days after the date on which the interest began to accrue.</P>

              <P>(c) The NLRB may waive interest during a period a disputed debt is under investigation or review by the NLRB. However, this additional waiver is not <PRTPAGE P="20"/>automatic and must be requested before the expiration of the initial 30-day waiver period. The NLRB may grant the additional waiver only if it finds merit in the explanation the debtor has submitted.</P>
              <P>(d) The NLRB may waive collection of interest, penalties, and administrative costs if it finds that one or more of the following conditions exist:</P>
              <P>(1) The debtor is unable to pay any significant sum toward the debt within a reasonable period of time;</P>
              <P>(2) Collection of interest, penalties, and administrative costs will jeopardize collection of the principal of the debt;</P>
              <P>(3) The NLRB is unable to enforce collection in full within a reasonable period of time by enforced collection proceedings; or</P>
              <P>(4) Collection is not in the best interest of the United States, including when an administrative offset or installment agreement is in effect.</P>
              <P>(e) The NLRB is authorized to impose interest and related charges on debts not subject to 31 U.S.C. 3717, in accordance with common law.</P>

Debts shall be referred as early as possible, consistent with the standards contained if 31 CFR parts 900-904 and, in any event, well within the period for initiating timely lawsuits against the debtors. The NLRB will make every effort to refer delinquent debts to the Department of Justice within one year of the date such debts became delinquent.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Initiation of unfair labor practice cases.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The investigation of an alleged violation of the National Labor Relations Act is initiated by the filing of a charge, which must be in writing and signed, and must either be notarized or must contain a declaration by the person signing it, under the penalties of the Criminal Code, that its contents are true and correct to the best of the persons' knowledge and belief. The charge is filed with the Regional Director for the Region in which the alleged violations have occurred or are occurring. A blank form for filing such charge is supplied by the Regional Office upon request. The charge contains the name and address of the person against whom the charge is made and a statement of the facts constituting the alleged unfair labor practices.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Investigation of charges.</SUBJECT>
              <P>When the charge is received in the Regional Office it is filed, docketed, and assigned a case number. The Regional Director may cause a copy of the charge to be served on the person against whom the charge is made, but timely service of a copy of the charge within the meaning of the proviso to section 10(b) of the Act is the exclusive responsibility of the charging party and not of the Regional Director. The Regional Director requests the person filing the charge to submit promptly evidence in its support. As part of the investigation hereinafter mentioned, the person against whom the charge is filed, hereinafter called the respondent, is asked to submit a statement of position in respect to the allegations. The case is assigned for investigation to a member of the field staff, who interviews representatives of the parties and other persons who have knowledge as to the charge, as is deemed necessary. In the investigation and in all other stages of the proceedings, charges alleging violations of section 8(b)(4) (A), (B), and (C), charges alleging violations of section 8(b)(4)(D) in which it is deemed appropriate to seek injunctive relief under section 10(1) of the Act, and charges alleging violations of section 8(b)(7) or 8(e) are given priority over all other cases in the office in which they are pending except cases of like character; and charges alleging violations of sections 8(a)(3) or 8(b)(2) are given priority over all other cases except cases of like character and cases under section 10(1) of the Act. The Regional Director may exercise discretion to dispense with any portion of the investigation described in this section as appears necessary in consideration of such factors as the amount of time necessary to complete a full investigation, the nature of the proceeding, and the public interest. After investigation, the case may be disposed of through informal methods such as withdrawal, dismissal, or settlement; or the case may necessitate formal methods of disposition. Some of the informal methods of handling unfair labor practice cases will be stated first.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Withdrawal of charges.</SUBJECT>

              <P>If investigation reveals that there has been no violation of the National Labor Relations Act or the evidence is insufficient to substantiate the charge, the Regional Director recommends withdrawal of the charge by the person who filed. Withdrawal may also be requested on the initiative of the complainant. If the complainant accepts the recommendation of the Regional <PRTPAGE P="23"/>Director or requests withdrawal, the respondent is immediately notified of the withdrawal of the charge.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Dismissal of charges and appeals to the General Counsel.</SUBJECT>
              <P>If the complainant refuses to withdraw the charge as recommended, the Regional Director dismisses the charge. The Regional Director thereupon informs the parties of this section, together with a simple statement of the grounds therefor, and the complainant's right of appeal to the General Counsel in Washington, DC, within 14 days. If the complainant appeals to the General Counsel, the entire file in the case is sent to Washington, DC, where the case is fully reviewed by the General Counsel with staff assistance. Oral presentation of the appeal issues may be permitted a party on timely written request, in which event the other parties are notified and afforded a like opportunity at another appropriate time. Following such review, the General Counsel may sustain the Regional Director's dismissal, stating the grounds of affirmance, or may direct the Regional Director to take further action.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 101.7</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Settlements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Before any complaint is issued or other formal action taken, the Regional Director affords an opportunity to all parties for the submission and consideration of facts, argument, offers of settlement, or proposals of adjustment, except where time, the nature of the proceeding, and the public interest do not permit. Normally prehearing conferences are held, the principal purpose of which is to discuss and explore such submissions and proposals of adjustment. The Regional Office provides Board-prepared forms for such settlment agreements, as well as printed notices for posting by the respondent. These agreements, which are subject to the approval of the Regional Director, provide for an appeal to the General Counsel, as described in § 101.6, by a complainant who will not join in a settlement or adjustment deemed adequate by the Regional Director. Proof of compliance is obtained by the Regional Director before the case is closed. If the respondent fails to perform the obligations under the informal agreement, the Regional Director may determine to institute formal proceedings.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 101.8</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Complaints.</SUBJECT>
              <P>If the charge appears to have merit and efforts to dispose of it by informal adjustment are unsuccessful, the Regional Director institutes formal action by issuance of a complaint and notice of hearing. In certain types of cases, involving novel and complex issues, the Regional Director, at the discretion of the General Counsel, must submit the case for advice from the General Counsel before issuing a complaint. The complaint, which is served on all parties, sets forth the facts upon which the Board bases its jurisidiction and the facts relating to the alleged violations of law by the respondent. The respondent must file an answer to the complaint within 14 days of its receipt, setting forth a statement of its defense.</P>
            </SECTION>
            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 101.9</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Settlement after issuance of complaint.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Even though formal proceedings have begun, the parties again have full opportunity at every stage to dispose of the case by amicable adjustment and in compliance with the law. Thus, after the complaint has been issued and a hearing scheduled or commenced, the attorney in charge of the case and the Regional Director afford all parties every opportunity for the submission and consideration of facts, argument, offers of settlement, or proposals of adjustment, except where time, the nature of the proceeding, and the public interest do not permit.</P>

              <P>(b)(1) After the issuance of a complaint, the Agency favors a formal settlement agreement, which is subject to the approval of the Board in Washington, DC. In such an agreement, the parties agree to waive their right to hearing and agree further that the Board may issue an order requiring the respondent to take action appropriate to the terms of the settlement. Ordinarily the formal settlement agreement also contains the respondent's consent to the Board's application for <PRTPAGE P="24"/>the entry of a judgment by the appropriate circuit court of appeals enforcing the Board's order.</P>
              <P>(2) In some cases, however, the Regional Director, who has authority to withdraw the complaint before the hearing (§ 102.18), may conclude that an informal settlement agreement of the type described in § 101.7 is appropriate. Such agreement is not subject to approval by the Board and does not provide for a Board order. It provides for the withdrawal of the complaint.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) If after issuance of a complaint but before opening of the hearing, the charging party will not join in a settlement tentatively agreed upon by the Regional Director, the respondent, and any other parties whose consent may be required, the Regional Director serves a copy of the proposed settlement agreement on the charging party with a brief written statement of the reasons for proposing its approval. Within 7 days after service of these documents, the charging party may file with the Regional Director a written statement of any objections to the proposed settlement. Such objections will be considered by the Regional Director in determining whether to approve the proposed settlement. If the settlement is approved by the Regional Director notwithstanding the objections, the charging party is so informed and provided a brief written statement of the reasons for the approval.</P>
              <P>(2) If the settlement agreement approved by the Regional Director is a formal one, providing for the entry of a Board order, the settlement agreement together with the charging party's objections and the Regional Director's written statements are submitted to Washington, DC, where they are reviewed by the General Counsel. If the General Counsel decides to approve the settlement agreement, the charging party is so informed and the agreement and accompanying documents are submitted to the Board, upon whose approval the settlement is contingent. Within 7 days after service of notice of submission of the settlement agreement to the Board, the charging party may file with the Board in Washington, DC, a further statement in support of objections to the settlement agreement.</P>
              <P>(3) If the settlement agreement approved by the Regional Director is an informal one, providing for the withdrawal of the complaint, the charging party may appeal the Regional Director's action to the General Counsel, as provided in § 102.19 of the Board's Rules and Regulations.</P>
              <P>(d)(1) If the settlement occurs after the opening of the hearing and before issuance of the administrative law judge's decision and there is an all-party informal settlement, the request for withdrawal of the complaint must be submitted to the administrative law judge for approval. If the all-party settlement is a formal one, final approval must come from the Board. If any party will not join in the settlement agreed to by the other parties, the administrative law judge will give such party an opportunity to state on the record or in writing its reasons for opposing the settlement.</P>
              <P>(2) If the administrative law judge decides to accept or reject the proposed settlement, any party aggrieved by such ruling may ask for leave to appeal to the Board as provided in § 102.26.</P>
              <P>(e)(1) In the event the respondent fails to comply with the terms of a settlement stipulation, upon which a Board order and court judgment are based, the Board may petition the court to adjudge the respondent in contempt. If the respondent refuses to comply with the terms of a settlement stipulation providing solely for the entry of a Board order, the Board may petition the court for enforcement of its order pursuant to section 10 of the National Labor Relations Act.</P>
              <P>(2) In the event the respondent fails to comply with the terms of an informal settlement agreement, the Regional Director may set the agreement aside and institute further proceedings.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 101.10</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Hearings.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Except in extraordinary situations the hearing is open to the public and usually conducted in the Region where the charge originated. A duly designated administrative law judge presides over the hearing. The Government's case is conducted by an attorney attached to the Board's Regional Office, who has the responsibility of presenting the evidence in support of <PRTPAGE P="25"/>the complaint. The rules of evidence applicable in the district courts of the United States under the Rules of Civil Procedure adopted by the Supreme Court are, so far as practicable, controlling. Counsel for the General Counsel, all parties to the proceeding, and the administrative law judge have the power to call, examine, and cross-examine witnesses and to introduce evidence into the record. They may also submit briefs, engage in oral argument, and submit proposed findings and conclusions to the administrative law judge. The attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence material to any matter under investigation may be compelled by subpoena.</P>
              <P>(b) The functions of all administrative law judges and other Board agents or employees participating in decisions in conformity with section 8 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 557) are conducted in an impartial manner and any such administrative law judge, agent, or employee may at any time withdraw if he or she deems himself or herself disqualified because of bias or prejudice. The Board's attorney has the burden of proof of violations of section 8 of the National Labor Relations Act and section 222(f) of the Telegraph Merger Act. In connection with hearings subject to the provisions of section 7 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 556):</P>
              <P>(1) No sanction is imposed or rule or order issued except upon consideration of the whole record or such portions thereof as may be cited by any party and as supported by and in accordance with the preponderance of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence.</P>
              <P>(2) Every party has the right to present its case or defense by oral or documentary evidence, to submit rebuttal evidence, and to conduct such cross-examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts.</P>
              <P>(3) Where any decision rests on official notice of a material fact not appearing in the evidence in the record, any party is on timely request afforded a reasonable opportunity to show the contrary.</P>
              <P>(4) Subject to the approval of the administrative law judge, all parties to the proceeding voluntarily may enter into a stipulation dispensing with a verbatim written transcript of record of the oral testimony adduced at the hearing and providing for the waiver by the respective parties of their right to file with the Board exceptions to the findings of fact (but not to conclusions of law or recommended orders) in the administrative law judge's decision.</P>
            </SECTION>
            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 101.11</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Administrative law judge's decision.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) At the conclusion of the hearing the administrative law judge prepares a decision stating findings of fact and conclusions, as well as the reasons for the determinations on all material issues, and making recommendations as to action which should be taken in the case. The administrative law judge may recommend dismissal or sustain the complaint, in whole or in part, and recommend that the respondent cease and desist from the unlawful acts found and take action to remedy their effects.</P>
              <P>(b) The administrative law judge's decision is filed with the Board in Washington, DC, and copies are simultaneously served on each of the parties. At the same time the Board, through its Executive Secretary, issues and serves on each of the parties an order transferring the case to the Board. The parties may accept and comply with the administrative law judge's recommended order, which, in the absence of exceptions, shall become the order of the Board. Or, the parties or counsel for the Board may file exceptions to the administrative law judge's decision with the Board. Whenever any party files exceptions, any other party may file an answering brief limited to questions raised in the exceptions and/or may file cross-exceptions relating to any portion of the administrative law judge's decision. Cross-exceptions may be filed only by a party who has not previously filed exceptions. Whenever any party files cross-exceptions, any other party may file an answering brief to the cross-exceptions. The parties may request permission to appear and argue orally before the Board in Washington, DC. They may also submit proposed findings and conclusions to the Board.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Board decision and order.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) If any party files exceptions to the administrative law judge's decision, the Board, with the assistance of the staff counsel to each Board Member who function in much the same manner as law clerks do for judges, reviews the entire record, including the administrative law judge's decision and recommendations, the exceptions thereto, the complete transcript of evidence, and the exhibits, briefs, and arguments. The Board does not consult with members of the administrative law judge's staff of the division of judges or with any agent of the General Counsel in its deliberations. It then issues its decision and order in which it may adopt, modify, or reject the findings and recommendations of the administrative law judge. The decision and order contains detailed findings of fact, conclusions of law, and basic reasons for decision on all material issues raised, and an order either dismissing the complaint in whole or in part or requiring the respondent to cease and desist from its unlawful practices and to take appropriate affirmative action.</P>
              <P>(b) If no exceptions are filed, the administrative law judge's decision and recommended order automatically become the decision and order of the Board pursuant to section 10(c) of the Act. All objections and exceptions, whether or not previously made during or after the hearing, are deemed waived for all purposes.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Compliance with Board decision and order.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Shortly after the Board's decision and order is issued the Director of the Regional Office in which the charge was filed communicates with the respondent for the purpose of obtaining compliance. Conferences may be held to arrange the details necessary for compliance with the terms of the order.</P>
              <P>(b) If the respondent effects full compliance with the terms of the order, the Regional Director submits a report to that effect to Washington, DC, after which the case may be closed. Despite compliance, however, the Board's order is a continuing one; therefore, the closing of a case on compliance is necessarily conditioned upon the continued observance of that order; and in some cases it is deemed desirable, notwithstanding compliance, to implement the order with an enforcing court judgment. Subsequent violations of the order may become the basis of further proceedings.</P>

              <P>If the respondent does not comply with the Board's order, or the Board deems it desirable to implement the order with a court judgment, the Board may petition the appropriate Federal court for enforcement. Or, the respondent or any person aggrieved by a final order of the Board may petition the circuit court of appeals to review and set aside the Board's order. If a petition for review is filed, the respondent or aggrieved person must ensure that the Board receives, by service upon its Deputy Associate General Counsel of the Appellate Court Branch, a court-stamped copy of the petition with the date of filing. Upon such review or enforcement proceedings, the court reviews the record and the Board's findings and order and sustains them if they are in accordance with the requirements of law. The court may enforce, modify, or set aside in whole or in part the Board's findings and order, or it may remand the case to the Board for further proceedings as directed by the court. Following the court's judgment, either the Government or the private party may petition the Supreme Court for review upon writ of certiorari. Such applications for review to the Supreme Court are handled by the Board through the Solicitor General of the United States.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Compliance with court judgment.</SUBJECT>

              <P>After a Board order has been enforced by a court judgment, the Board has the responsibility of obtaining compliance with that judgment. Investigation is made by the Regional Office of the respondent's efforts to comply. If it finds that the respondent has failed to live up to the terms of the court's judgment, the General Counsel may, on behalf of the Board, petition the court to hold the respondent in contempt of <PRTPAGE P="27"/>court. The court may order immediate remedial action and impose sanctions and penalties.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Backpay proceedings.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) After a Board order directing the payment of backpay has been issued or after enforcement of such order by a court judgment, if informal efforts to dispose of the matter prove unsuccessful, the Regional Director then has discretion to issue a “backpay specification” in the name of the Board and a notice of hearing before an administrative law judge, both of which are served on the parties involved. The specification sets forth computations showing gross and net backpay due and any other pertinent information. The respondent must file an answer within 21 days of the receipt of the specification, setting forth a particularized statement of its defense.</P>
              <P>(b) In the alternative, the Regional Director, under the circumstances specified above, may issue and serve on the parties a notice of hearing only, without a specification. Such notice contains, in addition to the time and place of hearing before an administrative law judge, a brief statement of the matters in controversy.</P>
              <P>(c) The procedure before the administrative law judge or the Board, whether initiated by the “backpay specification” or by notice of hearing without backpay specification, is substantially the same as that described in §§ 101.10 to 101.14, inclusive.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Initiation and investigation of a case under section 8(b)(7).</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The investigation of an alleged violation of section 8(b)(7) of the Act is initiated by the filing of a charge. The manner of filing such charge and the contents thereof are the same as described in § 101.2. In some cases, at the time of the investigation of the charge, there may be pending a representation petition involving the employees of the employer named in the charge. In those cases, the results of the investigation of the charge will determine the cause of the petition.</P>
              <P>(b) The investigation of the charge is conducted in accordance with the provisions of § 101.4, insofar as they are applicable. If the investigation reveals that there is merit in the charge, a complaint is issued as described in § 101.8, and an application is made for an injunction under section 10(1) of the Act, as described in § 101.37. If the investigation reveals that there is no merit in the charge, the Regional Director, absent a withdrawal of the charge, dismisses it, subject to appeal to the General Counsel. However, if the investigation reveals that issuance of a complaint may be warranted but for the pendency of a representation petition involving the employees of the employer named in the charge, action on the charge is suspended pending the investigation of the petition as provided in § 101.23.</P>

              <P>(a) A representation petition <SU>1</SU>
                <FTREF/> involving the employees of the employer named in the charge is handled under an expedited procedure when the investigation of the charge has revealed that:</P>

                <P>

                  <SU>1</SU> The manner of filing of such petition and the contents thereof are the same as described in 29 CFR 102.60 and 102.61 and the statement of the general course of proceedings under Section 9(c) of the Act published in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> insofar as they are applicable, except that the petitioner is not required to allege that a claim was made on the employer for recognition or that the union represents a substantial number of employees.</P>
              </FTNT>
              <P>(1) The employer's operations affect commerce within the meaning of the Act;</P>
              <P>(2) Picketing of the employer is being conducted for an object proscribed by section 8(b)(7) of the Act;</P>
              <P>(3) Subparagraph (C) of that section of the Act is applicable to the picketing; and</P>

              <P>(4) The petition has been filed within a reasonable period of time not to exceed 30 days from the commencement <PRTPAGE P="28"/>of the picketing. In these circumstances, the member of the regional director's staff to whom the matter has been assigned investigates the petition to ascertain further: the unit appropriate for collective bargaining; and whether an election in that unit would effectuate the policies of the Act.</P>

              <P>(b) If, based on such investigation, the regional director determines that an election is warranted, the director may, without a prior hearing, direct that an election be held in an appropriate unit of employees. Any party aggrieved may file a request with the Board for special permission to appeal that action to the Board, but such review, if granted, will not, unless otherwise ordered by the Board, stay the proceeding. If it is determined that an election is not warranted, the director dismisses the petition or makes other disposition of the matter. Should the regional director conclude that an election is warranted, the director fixes the basis of eligibility of voters and the place, date, and hours of balloting. The mechanics of arranging the balloting, the other procedures for the conduct of the election, and the postelection proceedings are the same, insofar as appropriate, as those described in 29 CFR 102.69 and the statement of the general course of proceedings under Section 9(c) of the Act published in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> except that the regional director's rulings on any objections to the conduct of the election or challenged ballots are final and binding unless the Board, on an application by one of the parties, grants such party special permission to appeal from the regional director's rulings. The party requesting such review by the Board must do so promptly, in writing, and state briefly the grounds relied on. Such party must also immediately serve a copy on the other parties, including the regional director. Neither the request for review by the Board nor the Board's grant of such review operates as a stay of any action taken by the regional director, unless specifically so ordered by the Board. If the Board grants permission to appeal, and it appears to the Board that substantial and material factual issues have been presented with respect to the objections to the conduct of the election or challenged ballots, it may order that a hearing be held on such issues or take other appropriate action.</P>
              <P>(c) If the regional director believes, after preliminary investigation of the petition, that there are substantial issues which require determination before an election may be held, the director may order a hearing on the issues. This hearing is followed by regional director decision and direction of election, or other disposition. The procedures to be used in connection with such hearing and posthearing proceedings are the same, insofar as they are applicable, as those described in 29 CFR 102.63, 102.64, 102.65, 102.66, 102.67, 102.68, and 102.69, and the statement of the general course.</P>
              <P>(d) Should the parties so desire, they may, with the approval of the regional director, resolve the issues as to the unit, the conduct of the balloting, and related matters pursuant to informal consent procedures, as described in 29 CFR 102.62(a) and the statement of the general course.</P>
              <P>(e) If a petition has been filed which does not meet the requirements for processing under the expedited procedures, the regional director may process it under the procedures set forth in subpart C of 29 CFR part 102 and the statement of the general course.</P>

              <P>The investigation of the question as to whether the authority of a labor organization to make an agreement requiring membership in a labor organization as a condition of employment is to be rescinded is initiated by the filing of a petition by an employee or group of employees on behalf of 30 percent or more of the employees in a bargaining unit covered by an agreement between their employer and a labor organization requiring membership in such labor organization. The petition must be in writing and signed, and either must be notarized or must contain a declaration by the person signing it, under the penalties of the Criminal Code, that its contents are true and correct to the best of his knowledge and belief. It is filed with the regional director for the Region in which the alleged appropriate bargaining unit exists or, if the bargaining unit exists in two or more Regions, with the regional director for any of such Regions. The blank form, which is supplied by the Regional Office upon request or is available online, provides, among other things, for a description of the bargaining unit covered by the agreement, the approximate number of employees involved, the names of any other labor organizations which claim to represent the employees, the petitioner's position on the type, date(s), time(s), and location(s) of the election sought, and the name of, and contact information for, the individual who will serve as the petitioner's representative. The petition may be filed by facsimile or electronically. The petitioner must supply with the petition evidence of authorization from the employees.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Investigation of petition; withdrawals and dismissals.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Upon receipt of the petition in the Regional Office, it is filed, docketed, and assigned to a member of the staff, usually a field examiner, for investigation. The field examiner conducts an investigation to ascertain:</P>
              <P>(1) Whether the employer's operations affect commerce within the meaning of the Act,</P>
              <P>(2) Whether there is in effect an agreement requiring as a condition of employment membership in a labor organization,</P>
              <P>(3) Whether the petitioner has been authorized by at least 30 percent of the employees to file such a petition, and</P>
              <P>(4) Whether an election would effectuate the policies of the Act by providing for a free expression of choice by the employees.</P>

              <FP>The evidence of designation submitted by the petitioner, usually in the form of cards signed by individual employees authorizing the filing of such a petition, is checked to determine the proportion of employees who desire rescission.<PRTPAGE P="30"/>
              </FP>
              <P>(b) The petitioner may on its own initiative request the withdrawal of the petition if the investigation discloses that an election is inappropriate, because, among other possible reasons, the petitioner's card-showing is insufficient to meet the 30-percent statutory requirement referred to in subsection (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) For the same or similar reasons the Regional Director may request the petitioner to withdraw its petition. If the petitioner, despite the Regional Director's recommendation, refuses to withdraw the petition, the Regional Director then dismisses the petition, stating the grounds for his dismissal and informing the petitioner of the right of appeal to the Board in Washington, DC. The petitioner may within 14 days appeal from the Regional Director's dismissal by filing such request with the Board in Washington, DC. The request shall contain a complete statement setting forth the facts and reasons upon which the request is made. After a full review of the file with the assistance of its staff, the Board may sustain the dismissal, stating the grounds for its affirmance, or may direct the Regional Director to take further action.</P>

              <P>(a) The Board makes available to the parties three types of informal consent procedures through which authorization issues can be resolved without resort to formal procedures. These informal agreements are the consent election agreement with final regional director determinations of post-election disputes, the stipulated election agreement with discretionary Board review, and the full consent election agreement with final regional director determinations of pre- and post-election disputes. Forms for use in these informal procedures are available in the Regional Offices.</P>

The parties, however, have an opportunity to make appropriate challenges and objections to the conduct of the election and they have the same rights, and the same procedure is followed, with respect to objections to the conduct of the election and challenged ballots, as is described in subpart C of 29 CFR part 102 and the statement of the general course in connection with the postelection procedures in representation cases under Section 9(c) of the Act, except that no provision is made for a runoff election. If no such objections are filed within 7 days and if the challenged ballots are insufficient in number to affect the results of the election, the regional director issues to the parties a certification of the results of the election, with the same force and effect as if issued by the Board.</P>

              <P>(a) The procedures are the same as those described in subpart C of 29 CFR part 102 and the statement of the general course respecting representation cases arising under Section 9(c) of the Act insofar as applicable. If the preliminary investigation indicates that there are substantial issues which require determination before an appropriate election may be held, the regional director will institute formal proceedings by issuance of a notice of <PRTPAGE P="31"/>hearing on the issues which, after hearing, is followed by regional director decision and direction of election or dismissal. The notice of hearing together with a copy of the petition is served on the petitioner, the employer, and any other known persons or labor organizations claiming to have been designated by employees involved in the proceeding.</P>
              <P>(b) The hearing, usually open to the public, is held before a hearing officer who normally is an attorney or field examiner attached to the Regional Office but may be another qualified Agency official. The hearing, which is nonadversary in character, is part of the investigation in which the primary interest of the Board's agents is to insure that the record contains as full a statement of the pertinent facts as may be necessary for determination of the case. The parties are afforded full opportunity to present their respective positions and to produce the significant facts in support of their contentions that are relevant to the issue of whether the Board should conduct an election to determine whether the employees in a bargaining unit covered by an agreement between their employer and a labor organization made pursuant to section 8(a)(3) of the Act, desire that such authority be rescinded. In most cases a substantial number of the relevant facts are undisputed and stipulated. The parties are permitted to argue orally on the record before the hearing officer.</P>
              <P>(c) Upon the close of the hearing, the entire record in the case is then forwarded to the regional director, together with an informal analysis by the hearing officer of the issues and the evidence but without recommendations. Post-hearing briefs are filed only upon special permission of the regional director and within the time and addressing the subjects permitted by the regional director.</P>
              <P>(d) The parties have the same rights, and the same procedure is followed, with respect to objections to the conduct of the election and challenged ballots as is described in connection with the postelection procedures in representation cases under Section 9(c) of the Act.</P>

The parties may agree on an arbitrator, a proceeding under section 9(c) of the Act, or any other satisfactory method to resolve the dispute. If the agreed-upon method for voluntary adjustment results in a determination that employees represented by a charged union are entitled to perform the work in dispute, the Regional Director dismisses the charge against that union irrespective of whether the employer complies with that determination.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Proceedings following the filing of the petition.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A copy of the petition is served on all other parties and the appropriate Regional Director by the petitioner.</P>
              <P>(b) Interested persons may request intervention by a written motion to the Board. Such intervention may be granted at the discretion of the Board.</P>
              <P>(c) Parties other than the petitioner may reply to the petition in writing, admitting or denying any or all of the matters asserted therein.</P>
              <P>(d) No briefs shall be filed except upon special permission of the Board.</P>
              <P>(e) After review of the entire record, the Board issues an advisory opinion as to whether the facts presented would or would not cause it to assert jurisdiction over the case if the case had been originally filed before it. The Board will limit its advisory opinion to the jurisdictional issue confronting it, and will not presume to render an opinion on the merits of the case or on the question of whether the subject matter of the dispute is governed by the Labor Management Relations Act.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Informal procedures for obtaining opinions on jurisdictional questions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Although a formal petition is necessary to obtain an advisory opinion from the Board, other avenues are available to persons seeking informal and, in most cases, speedy opinions on jurisdictional issues. In discussion of jurisdictional questions informally with Regional Office personnel, information and advice concerning the Board's jurisdictional standards may be obtained. Such practices are not intended to be discouraged by the rules providing for formal advisory opinions by the Board, although the opinions expressed by such personnel are not to be regarded as binding upon the Board or the General Counsel.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 101.42</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Procedures for obtaining declaratory orders of the Board.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) When both an unfair labor practice charge and a representation petition are pending concurrently in a Regional Office, appeals from a Regional Director's dismissals thereof do not follow the same course. Appeal from the dismissal of a charge must be made to the General Counsel, while appeal from dismissal of a representation petition may be made to the Board. To obtain uniformity in disposing of such cases on jurisdictional grounds at the same stage of each proceeding, the General Counsel may file a petition for a declaratory order of the Board. Such order is intended only to remove uncertainty with respect to the question of whether the Board would assert jurisdiction over the labor dispute.</P>
              <P>(b) A petition to obtain a declaratory Board order may be filed only by the General Counsel. It must be in writing and signed. It is filed with the Executive Secretary of the Board in Washington, DC. No particular form is required, but the petition must be properly captioned and must contain the allegations required by § 102.106 of the Board's Rules and Regulations. None of the information sought relates to the merits of the dispute. The petition may be withdrawn any time before the Board issues its declaratory order deciding whether it would or would not assert jurisdiction over the cases.</P>

              <P>(a) A copy of the petition is served on all other parties.</P>
              <P>(b) Interested persons may request intervention by a written motion to the Board. Such intervention may be granted at the discretion of the Board.</P>
              <P>(c) All other parties may reply to the petition in writing.</P>
              <P>(d) Briefs may be filed.</P>
              <P>(e) After review of the record, the Board issues a declaratory order as to whether it will assert jurisdiction over the cases, but it will not render a decision on the merits at this stage of the cases.</P>
              <P>(f) The declaratory Board order will be binding on the parties in both cases.</P>

Non E-Filed documents must be received before the official closing time of the receiving office (see <E T="03">www.nlrb.gov</E> setting forth the official business hours of the Agency's several offices). E-Filed documents must be received by 11:59 p.m. of the time zone of the receiving office. In construing this section of the Rules, the Board will accept as timely filed any document which is postmarked on the day before (or earlier than) the due date; documents which are postmarked on or after the due date are untimely. “Postmarking” must include timely depositing the document with a delivery service that will provide a record showing that the document was given to the delivery service in sufficient time for delivery by the due date, but in no event later than the day before the due date. However, the following documents must be received on or before the last day for filing:</P>
              <P>(1) Charges filed pursuant to Section 10(b) of the Act (see also § 102.14).</P>
              <P>(2) Applications for awards and fees and other expenses under the Equal Access to Justice Act.</P>
              <P>(3) Petitions to revoke subpoenas.</P>
              <P>(4) Requests for extensions of time to file any document for which such an extension may be granted.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Extension of time to file.</E> Except as otherwise provided, a request for an extension of time to file a document must be filed no later than the date on which the document is due. Requests for extensions of time filed within 3 days of the due date must be grounded upon circumstances not reasonably foreseeable in advance. Requests for extension of time must be in writing and must be served simultaneously on the other parties. Parties are encouraged to seek agreement from the other parties for the extension, and to indicate the other parties' position in the extension of time request. An opposition to a request for an extension of time should be filed as soon as possible following receipt of the request.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Late-filed documents.</E> (1) The following documents may be filed within a reasonable time after the time prescribed by these Rules only upon good cause shown based on excusable neglect and when no undue prejudice would result:</P>
              <P>(i) In unfair labor practice proceedings, motions, exceptions, answers to a complaint or a backpay specification, and briefs; and</P>
              <P>(ii) In representation proceedings, exceptions, requests for review, motions, briefs, and any responses to any of these documents.</P>

              <P>(2) A party seeking to file such documents beyond the time prescribed by these Rules must file, along with the document, a motion that states the grounds relied on for requesting permission to file untimely. The specific facts relied on to support the motion <PRTPAGE P="40"/>must be set forth in affidavit form and sworn to by individuals with personal knowledge of the facts. The time for filing any document responding to the untimely document will not commence until the date a ruling issues accepting the untimely document. In addition, cross-exceptions are due within 14 days, or such further period as the Board may allow, from the date a ruling issues accepting the untimely filed documents.</P>

              <P>Where service is made by mail, private delivery service, or email, the date of service is the day when the document served is deposited in the United States mail, is deposited with a private delivery service that will provide a record showing the date the document was tendered to the delivery service, or is sent by email, as the case may be.

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Method of service for certain Agency-issued documents.</E> Complaints and compliance specifications (including accompanying notices of hearing, and amendments to either complaints or to compliance specifications), final orders of the Board in unfair labor practice cases and Administrative Law Judges' decisions must be served upon all parties personally, by registered or certified mail, by leaving a copy at the principal office or place of business of the person required to be served, by email as appropriate, or by any other method of service authorized by law.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Service of subpoenas.</E> Subpoenas must be served upon the recipient personally, by registered or certified mail, by leaving a copy at the principal office or place of business of the person required to be served, by private delivery service, or by any other method of service authorized by law.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Service of other Agency-issued documents.</E> Other documents may be served by the Agency by any of the foregoing methods as well as by regular mail, private delivery service, facsimile, or email.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Proof of service.</E> In the case of personal service, or delivery to a principal office or place of business, the verified return by the serving individual, setting forth the manner of such service, is proof of service. In the case of service by registered or certified mail, the return post office receipt is proof of service. However, these methods of proof of service are not exclusive; any sufficient proof may be relied upon to establish service.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Service upon representatives of parties.</E> Whenever these Rules require or permit the service of pleadings or other papers upon a party, a copy must be served on any attorney or other representative of the party who has entered a written appearance in the proceeding on behalf of the party. If a party is represented by more than one attorney or representative, service upon any one of such persons in addition to the party satisfies this requirement. Service by the Board or its agents of any documents upon any such attorney or other representative may be accomplished by any means of service permitted by these Rules, including regular mail.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Form of papers to be filed.</E> All papers filed with the Board, General Counsel, Regional Director, Administrative Law Judge, or Hearing Officer must be typewritten or otherwise legibly duplicated on 8<FR>1/2</FR> by 11-inch plain white paper, and must have margins no less than one inch on all four sides. Page numbers may be placed in the margins, but no text may appear there. Typeface that is single-spaced must not contain more than 10.5 characters per inch, and proportionally-spaced typeface must be 12 point or larger, for both text and footnotes. Condensed text is not permitted. The text must be double-spaced, but headings and footnotes may be single-spaced, and quotations more than two lines long may be indented and single-spaced. Case names must be italicized or underlined. Where any brief filed with the Board exceeds 20 pages, it must contain <PRTPAGE P="41"/>a subject index with page references and an alphabetical table of cases and other authorities cited.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Requests to exceed the page limits.</E> Requests for permission to exceed the page limits for documents filed with the Board must state the reasons for the requests. Unless otherwise specified, such requests must be filed not less than 10 days prior to the date the document is due.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">E-Filing with the Agency.</E> Unless otherwise permitted under this section, all documents filed in cases before the Agency must be filed electronically (“E-Filed”) on the Agency's Web site (<E T="03">www.nlrb.gov</E>) by following the instructions on the Web site. The Agency's Web site also contains certain forms that parties or other persons may use to prepare their documents for E-Filing. If the document being E-Filed is required to be served on another party to a proceeding, the other party must be served by email, if possible, or in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section. Unfair labor practice charges, petitions in representation proceedings, and showings of interest may be filed in paper format or E-Filed. A party who files other documents in paper format must accompany the filing with a statement explaining why the party does not have access to the means for filing electronically or why filing electronically would impose an undue burden. Notwithstanding any other provision in these Rules, if a document is filed electronically the filer need not also file a hard copy of the document, and only one copy of a document filed in hard copy should be filed. Documents may not be filed with the Agency via email without the prior approval of the receiving office.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Filing with the Agency by Mail or Delivery.</E> Documents to be filed with the Board are to be filed with the Office of the Executive Secretary in Washington, DC. Documents to be filed with the Regional Offices are to be filed with the Regional Office handling the case. Documents to be filed with the Division of Judges are to be filed with the Division office handling the matter.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Filing by fax with the Agency.</E> Only unfair labor practice charges, petitions in representation proceedings, objections to elections, and requests for extensions of time for filing documents will be accepted by the Agency if faxed to the appropriate office. Other documents may not be faxed. At the discretion of the receiving office, the person submitting a document by fax may be required simultaneously to file the original with the office by overnight delivery service. When filing a charge, a petition in a representation proceeding, or election objections by fax pursuant to this section, receipt of the faxed document by the Agency constitutes filing with the Agency. A failure to timely file or serve a document will not be excused on the basis of a claim that facsimile transmission could not be accomplished because the receiving machine was off-line or busy or unavailable for any other reason.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Service.</E> Unless otherwise specified, documents filed with the Agency must be simultaneously served on the other parties to the case including, as appropriate, the Regional Office in charge of the case. Service of documents by a party on other parties may be made personally, or by registered mail, certified mail, regular mail, email (unless otherwise provided for by these Rules), private delivery service, or by fax for documents of or under 25 pages in length. Service of documents by a party on other parties by any other means, including by fax for documents over 25 pages in length, is permitted only with the consent of the party being served. When a party does not have the ability to receive service by email or fax, or chooses not to accept service of a document longer than 25 pages by fax, the other party must be notified personally or by telephone of the substance of the filed document and a copy of the document must be served by personal service no later than the next day, by overnight delivery service, or by fax or email as appropriate. Unless otherwise specified elsewhere in these Rules, service on all parties must be made in the same manner as that used in filing the document with the Board, or in a more expeditious manner. When filing with the Board is done by hand, however, the <PRTPAGE P="42"/>other parties must be immediately notified of such action, followed by service of a copy in a manner designed to insure receipt by them by the close of the next business day. The provisions of this section apply to the General Counsel after a complaint has issued, just as they do to any other party, except to the extent that the provisions of § 102.4(a) provide otherwise.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Proof of service.</E> When service is made by registered or certified mail, the return post office receipt will be proof of service. When service is made by a private delivery service, the receipt from that service showing delivery will be proof of service. However, these methods of proof of service are not exclusive; any sufficient proof may be relied upon to establish service.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Statement of service.</E> The person or party filing a document with the Agency must simultaneously file a statement of service. Such statement must include the names of the parties served, the date and manner of service, and the location of service such as mailing address, fax number, or email address as appropriate. The Agency requires proof of service as defined in paragraph (g) of this section only if, subsequent to the receipt of the statement of service, a question is raised with respect to proper service. Failure to make proof of service does not affect the validity of the service.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Failure to properly serve.</E> Failure to comply with the requirements of this section relating to timeliness of service on other parties will be a basis for either:</P>
              <P>(1) Rejecting the document; or</P>
              <P>(2) Withholding or reconsidering any ruling on the subject matter raised by the document until after service has been made and the served party has had reasonable opportunity to respond.</P>

The body of the letter may not exceed 350 words. A party may file and serve on all other parties a response that is similarly limited.

              <P>(a) If, after the charge has been filed, the Regional Director declines to issue a complaint or, having withdrawn a complaint pursuant to § 102.18, refuses to reissue it, the Director will so advise the parties in writing, accompanied by a simple statement of the procedural or other grounds for that action. The Charging Party may obtain a review of such action by filing the “Appeal Form” with the General Counsel in Washington, DC, and filing a copy of the “Appeal Form” with the Regional Director, within 14 days from the service of the notice of such refusal to issue or reissue by the Regional Director, except where a shorter period is provided by § 102.81. The Charging Party may also file a statement setting forth the facts and reasons upon which the appeal is based. If such a statement is timely filed, the separate “Appeal Form” need not be served. A request for extension of time to file an appeal must be in writing and be received by the General Counsel, and a copy of such request filed with the Regional Director, prior to the expiration of the filing period. Copies of the acknowledgment of the filing of an appeal and of any ruling on a request for an extension of time for filing of the appeal must be served on all parties. Consideration of an appeal untimely filed is within the discretion of the General Counsel upon good cause shown.</P>
              <P>(b) Oral presentation in Washington, DC, of the appeal issues may be permitted by a party on written request made within 4 days after service of acknowledgement of the filing of an appeal. In the event such request is granted, the other parties must be notified and afforded, without additional request, a like opportunity at another appropriate time.</P>

              <P>(c) The General Counsel may sustain the Regional Director's refusal to issue or reissue a complaint, stating the grounds of the affirmance, or may direct the Regional Director to take further action; the General Counsel's decision must be served on all the parties. A motion for reconsideration of the decision must be filed within 14 days of service of the decision, except as hereinafter provided, and must state with particularity the error requiring reconsideration. A motion for reconsideration based upon newly discovered evidence which has become available only <PRTPAGE P="45"/>since the decision on appeal must be filed promptly on discovery of such evidence. Motions for reconsideration of a decision previously reconsidered will not be entertained, except in unusual situations where the moving party can establish that new evidence has been discovered which could not have been discovered by diligent inquiry prior to the first reconsideration.</P>

Immediately upon the filing of the answer, Respondent shall serve a copy thereof on the other parties. An answer of a party represented by counsel or non-attorney representative shall be signed by at least one such attorney or non-attorney representative of record in his/her individual name, whose address shall be stated. A party who is not represented by an attorney or non-attorney representative shall sign his/her answer and state his/her address. Except when otherwise specifically provided by rule or statute, an answer need not be verified or accompanied by affidavit. The signature of the attorney or non-attorney party representative constitutes a certificate by him/her that he/she has read the answer; that to the best of his/her knowledge, information, and belief there is good ground to support it; and that it is not interposed for delay. If an answer is not signed or is signed with intent to defeat the purpose of this section, it may be stricken as sham and false and the action may proceed as though the answer had not been served. For a willful violation of this section an attorney or non-attorney party representative may be subjected to appropriate disciplinary action. Similar action may be taken if scandalous or indecent matter is inserted.</P>

              <P>(a) All motions under §§ 102.22 and 102.29 made prior to the hearing must be filed in writing with the Regional Director issuing the complaint. All motions for default judgment, summary judgment, or dismissal made prior to the hearing must be filed in writing with the Board pursuant to the provisions of § 102.50. All other motions made prior to the hearing, including motions to reschedule the hearing under circumstances other than those set forth in § 102.16(a), must be filed in <PRTPAGE P="46"/>writing with the Chief Administrative Law Judge in Washington, DC, with the Associate Chief Judge in San Francisco, California, or with the Associate Chief Judge in New York, New York, as the case may be. All motions made at the hearing must be made in writing to the Administrative Law Judge or stated orally on the record. All motions filed subsequent to the hearing, but before the transfer of the case to the Board pursuant to § 102.45, must be filed with the Administrative Law Judge, care of the Chief Administrative Law Judge in Washington, DC, the Associate Chief Judge in San Francisco, or the Associate Chief Judge in New York, as the case may be. Motions must briefly state the order or relief applied for and the grounds therefor. All motions filed with a Regional Director or an Administrative Law Judge as set forth in this paragraph (a) must be filed together with an affidavit of service on the parties. All motions filed with the Board, including motions for default judgment, summary judgment, or dismissal, must be filed with the Executive Secretary of the Board in Washington, DC, together with an affidavit of service on the parties. Unless otherwise provided in these Rules, motions, oppositions, and replies must be filed promptly and within such time as not to delay the proceeding.</P>
              <P>(b) All motions for summary judgment or dismissal must be filed with the Board no later than 28 days prior to the scheduled hearing. Where no hearing is scheduled, or where the hearing is scheduled less than 28 days after the date for filing an answer to the complaint or compliance specification, whichever is applicable, the motion must be filed promptly. Upon receipt of the motion, the Board may deny the motion or issue a Notice to Show Cause why the motion may not be granted. If a Notice to Show Cause is issued, the hearing, if scheduled, will normally be postponed indefinitely. If a party desires to file an opposition to the motion prior to issuance of the Notice to Show Cause to prevent postponement of the hearing, it may do so. However, any such opposition must be filed no later than 21 days prior to the hearing. If a Notice to Show Cause is issued, an opposing party may file a response notwithstanding any opposition it may have filed prior to issuance of the notice. The time for filing the response must be fixed in the Notice to Show Cause. Neither the opposition nor the response must be supported by affidavits or other documentary evidence showing that there is a genuine issue for hearing. The Board in its discretion may deny the motion where the motion itself fails to establish the absence of a genuine issue, or where the opposing party's pleadings, opposition and/or response indicate on their face that a genuine issue may exist. If the opposing party files no opposition or response, the Board may treat the motion as conceded, and default judgment, summary judgment, or dismissal, if appropriate, will be entered.</P>
              <P>(c) A party that has filed a motion may file a reply to an opposition to its motion within 7 days of receipt of the opposition, but in the interest of administrative finality, further responses are not permitted except where there are special circumstances warranting leave to file such a response.</P>

The Administrative Law Judge designated to conduct the hearing will rule on all motions after opening of the hearing (except as provided in § 102.47), and any related orders, if announced at the hearing, will be stated orally on the record; in all other cases, the Administrative Law Judge will issue such rulings and orders in writing and must cause a copy to be served on each of the parties, or will make the ruling in the decision. Whenever the Administrative Law Judge has reserved ruling on any motion, and the proceeding is thereafter transferred to and continued before the Board pursuant to § 102.50, the Board must rule on such motion.</P>

Unless expressly authorized by the Rules and Regulations, rulings by the Regional Director or by the Administrative Law Judge on motions and/or by the Administrative Law Judge on objections, and related orders, may not be appealed directly to the Board except by special permission of the Board, but will be considered by the Board in reviewing the record if exception to the ruling or order is included in the statement of exceptions filed with the Board pursuant to § 102.46. Requests to the Board for special permission to appeal from a ruling of the Regional Director or of the Administrative Law Judge, together with the appeal from such ruling, must be filed in writing promptly and within such time as not to delay the proceeding, and must briefly state the reasons special permission may be granted and the grounds relied on for the appeal. The moving party must simultaneously serve a copy of the request for special permission and of the appeal on the other parties and, if the request involves a ruling by an Administrative Law Judge, on the Administrative Law Judge. Any statement in opposition or other response to the request and/or to the appeal must be filed within 7 days of receipt of the appeal, in writing, and must be served simultaneously on the other parties and on the Administrative Law Judge, if any. If the Board grants the request for special permission to appeal, it may proceed immediately to rule on the appeal.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Depositions; examination of witnesses.</SUBJECT>

              <P>Witnesses must be examined orally under oath at a hearing, except that for good cause shown after the issuance <PRTPAGE P="48"/>of a complaint, testimony may be taken by deposition.</P>
              <P>(a) Applications to take depositions, including deposition testimony contemporaneously transmitted by videoconference, must be in writing and set forth the reasons why the depositions may be taken, the name, mailing address and email address (if available) of the witness, the matters concerning which it is expected the witness will testify, and the time and place proposed for taking the deposition, together with the name and mailing and email addresses of the person before whom it is desired that the deposition be taken (for the purposes of this section hereinafter referred to as the “officer”). Such application must be made to the Regional Director prior to the hearing, and to the Administrative Law Judge during and subsequent to the hearing but before transfer of the case to the Board pursuant to § 102.45 or § 102.50. Such application must be served on the Regional Director or the Administrative Law Judge, as the case may be, and on all other parties, not less than 7 days (when the deposition is to be taken within the continental United States) and 15 days (if the deposition is to be taken elsewhere) prior to the time when it is desired that the deposition be taken. The Regional Director or the Administrative Law Judge, as the case may be, will upon receipt of the application, if in the Regional Director's or Administrative Law Judge's discretion, good cause has been shown, make and serve on the parties an order specifying the name of the witness whose deposition is to be taken and the time, place, and designation of the officer before whom the witness is to testify, who may or may not be the same officer as that specified in the application. Such order will be served on all the other parties by the Regional Director or on all parties by the Administrative Law Judge.</P>
              <P>(b) The deposition may be taken before any officer authorized to administer oaths by the laws of the United States or of the place where the examination is held, including any Board agent authorized to administer oaths. If the examination is held in a foreign country, it may be taken before any secretary of embassy or legation, consul general, consul, vice consul, or consular agent of the United States.</P>
              <P>(c) At the time and place specified in the order, the officer designated to take the deposition will permit the witness to be examined and cross-examined under oath by all the parties appearing in person or by contemporaneous transmission through videoconference, and testimony shall be transcribed by the officer or under the officer's direction. All objections to questions or evidence will be deemed waived unless made at the examination. The officer will not have power to rule upon any objections but the objections will be noted in the deposition. The testimony must be subscribed by the witness to the satisfaction of the officer who will attach a certificate stating that the witness was duly sworn by the officer, that the deposition is a true record of the testimony and exhibits given by the witness, and that the officer is not of counsel or attorney to any of the parties nor interested in the event of the proceeding or investigation. If the deposition is not signed by the witness because the witness is ill, dead, cannot be found, or refuses to sign it, such fact will be included in the certificate of the officer and the deposition may then be used as fully as though signed. The officer will immediately deliver the transcript, together with the certificate, in person, by registered or certified mail, or by E-File to the Regional Director or Division of Judges' office handling the matter.</P>
              <P>(d) The Administrative Law Judge will rule upon the admissibility of the deposition or any part of the deposition. A party may object to the admissibility of deposition testimony by videoconference on grounds that the taking of the deposition did not comply with appropriate safeguards as set forth in § 102.35(c), provided that the party opposing the admission of the deposition raised deficiencies in safeguards at the time of the deposition when corrections might have been made.</P>

              <P>(e) All errors or irregularities in compliance with the provisions of this section will be deemed waived unless a motion to suppress the deposition in whole or part is made with reasonable <PRTPAGE P="49"/>promptness after such defect is or, with due diligence, might have been ascertained.</P>
              <P>(f) If the parties so stipulate in writing, depositions may be taken before any person at any time or place, upon any notice and in any manner, and when so taken may be used like other depositions.</P>
              <P>(g) The official record of the deposition testimony will be the official transcript prepared by the officer designated to transcribe the deposition testimony.</P>

              <P>(a) The Board or any Board Member will, on the written application of any party, issue subpoenas requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of any evidence, including books, records, correspondence, electronic data, or documents, in their possession or under their control. The Executive Secretary has the authority to sign and issue any such subpoenas on behalf of the Board or any Board Member. Applications for subpoenas, if filed before the hearing opens, must be filed with the Regional Director. Applications for subpoenas filed during the hearing must be filed with the Administrative Law Judge. Either the Regional Director or the Administrative Law Judge, as the case may be, will grant the application on behalf of the Board or any Member. Applications for subpoenas may be made <E T="03">ex parte.</E> The subpoena must show on its face the name and address of the party at whose request the subpoena was issued.</P>
              <P>(b) Any person served with a subpoena, whether <E T="03">ad testificandum</E> or <E T="03">duces tecum,</E> if that person does not intend to comply with the subpoena, must, within 5 business days after the date of service of the subpoena, petition in writing to revoke the subpoena. The date of service for purposes of computing the time for filing a petition to revoke is the date the subpoena is received. All petitions to revoke subpoenas must be served on the party at whose request the subpoena was issued. A petition to revoke, if made prior to the hearing, must be filed with the Regional Director and the Regional Director will refer the petition to the Administrative Law Judge or the Board for ruling. Petitions to revoke subpoenas filed during the hearing must be filed with the Administrative Law Judge. Petitions to revoke subpoenas filed in response to a subpoena issued upon request of the Agency's Contempt, Compliance, and Special Litigation Branch must be filed with that Branch, which will refer the petition to the Board for ruling. Notice of the filing of petitions to revoke will be promptly given by the Regional Director, the Administrative Law Judge, or the Contempt, Compliance and Special Litigation Branch, as the case may be, to the party at whose request the subpoena was issued. The Administrative Law Judge or the Board, as the case may be, will revoke the subpoena if in their opinion the evidence whose production is required does not relate to any matter under investigation or in question in the proceedings or the subpoena does not describe with sufficient particularity the evidence whose production is required, or if for any other reason sufficient in law the subpoena is otherwise invalid. The Administrative Law Judge or the Board, as the case may be, will make a simple statement of procedural or other grounds for the ruling on the petition to revoke. The petition to revoke any opposition to the petition, response to the opposition, and ruling on the petition will not become part of the official record except upon the request of the party aggrieved by the ruling, at an appropriate time in a formal proceeding rather than at the investigative stage of the proceeding.</P>
              <P>(c) Upon refusal of a witness to testify, the Board may, with the approval of the Attorney General of the United States, issue an order requiring any individual to give testimony or provide other information at any proceeding before the Board if, in the judgment of the Board:</P>

              <P>(1) The testimony or other information from such individual may be necessary to the public interest; and<PRTPAGE P="50"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) Such individual has refused or is likely to refuse to testify or provide other information on the basis of the privilege against self-incrimination. Requests for the issuance of such an order by the Board may be made by any party. Prior to hearing, and after transfer of the proceeding to the Board, such requests must be made to the Board in Washington, DC, and the Board will take such action thereon as it deems appropriate. During the hearing, and thereafter while the proceeding is pending before the Administrative Law Judge, such requests must be made to the Administrative Law Judge. If the Administrative Law Judge denies the request, the ruling will be subject to appeal to the Board, in Washington, DC, in the manner and to the extent provided in § 102.26 with respect to rulings and orders by an Administrative Law Judge, except that requests for permission to appeal in this instance must be filed within 24 hours of the Administrative Law Judge's ruling. If no appeal is sought within such time, or if the appeal is denied, the ruling of the Administrative Law Judge becomes final and the denial becomes the ruling of the Board. If the Administrative Law Judge deems the request appropriate, the Judge will recommend that the Board seek the approval of the Attorney General for the issuance of the order, and the Board will take such action on the Administrative Law Judge's recommendation as it deems appropriate. Until the Board has issued the requested order, no individual who claims the privilege against self-incrimination will be required or permitted to testify or to give other information respecting the subject matter of the claim.</P>
              <P>(d) Upon the failure of any person to comply with a subpoena issued upon the request of a private party, the General Counsel will, in the name of the Board but on relation of such private party, institute enforcement proceedings in the appropriate district court, unless in the judgment of the Board the enforcement of the subpoena would be inconsistent with law and with the policies of the Act. Neither the General Counsel nor the Board will be deemed thereby to have assumed responsibility for the effective prosecution of the same before the court.</P>
              <P>(e) Persons compelled to submit data or evidence at a public proceeding are entitled to retain or, on payment of lawfully prescribed costs, to procure copies or transcripts of the data or evidence submitted by them. Persons compelled to submit data or evidence in the nonpublic investigative stages of proceedings may, for good cause, be limited by the Regional Director to inspection of the official transcript of their testimony, but must be entitled to make copies of documentary evidence or exhibits which they have produced.</P>

              <P>(9) Approve stipulations, including stipulations of facts that waive a hearing and provide for a decision by the <PRTPAGE P="52"/>Administrative Law Judge. Alternatively, the parties may agree to waive a hearing and decision by an Administrative Law Judge and submit directly to the Executive Secretary a stipulation of facts, which, if approved, provides for a decision by the Board. A statement of the issues presented may be set forth in the stipulation of facts, and each party may also submit a short statement (no more than three pages) of its position on the issues. If the Administrative Law Judge (or the Board) approves the stipulation, the Judge (or the Board) will set a time for the filing of briefs.

              <P>(b) Upon the request of any party or of the Administrative Law Judge assigned to hear a case, or upon the Chief Judge, Deputy Chief Judge, or Associate Chief Judge's own motion, the Chief Judge, Deputy Chief Judge or an Associate Chief Judge may assign a Judge other than the trial judge to conduct settlement negotiations. In exercising this discretion, the Chief Judge, Deputy Chief Judge, or Associate Chief Judge making the assignment will consider, among other factors, whether there is reason to believe that resolution of the dispute is likely, the request for assignment of a settlement judge is made in good faith, and the assignment is otherwise feasible. However, no such assignment will be made absent the agreement of all parties to the use of this procedure.</P>
              <P>(1) The settlement judge will convene and preside over conferences and settlement negotiations between the parties, assess the practicalities of a potential settlement, and report to the Chief Judge, Deputy Chief Judge, or Associate Chief Judge the status of settlement negotiations, recommending continuation or termination of the settlement negotiations. Where feasible, settlement conferences will be held in person.</P>
              <P>(2) The settlement judge may require that the attorney or other representative for each party be present at settlement conferences and that the parties or agents with full settlement authority also be present or available by telephone.</P>
              <P>(3) Participation of the settlement judge will terminate upon the order of the Chief Judge, Deputy Chief Judge, or Associate Chief Judges issued after consultation with the settlement judge. The conduct of settlement negotiations must not unduly delay the hearing.</P>
              <P>(4) All discussions between the parties and the settlement judge will be confidential. The settlement judge must not discuss any aspect of the case with the trial judge, and no evidence regarding statements, conduct, offers of settlement, and concessions of the parties made in proceedings before the settlement judge will be admissible in any proceeding before the Board, except by stipulation of the parties. Documents disclosed in the settlement process may not be used in litigation unless voluntarily produced or obtained pursuant to subpoena.</P>
              <P>(5) No decision of a Chief Judge, Deputy Chief Judge, or Associate Chief Judge concerning the assignment of a settlement judge or the termination of a settlement judge's assignment is appealable to the Board.</P>

              <P>(6) Any settlement reached under the auspices of a settlement judge is subject to approval in accordance with the <PRTPAGE P="53"/>provisions of § 101.9 of the Board's Statements of Procedure.</P>
              <P>(c) Upon a showing of good cause based on compelling circumstances, and under appropriate safeguards, the taking of video testimony by contemporaneous transmission from a different location may be permitted.</P>
              <P>(1) Applications to obtain testimony by videoconference must be presented to the Administrative Law Judge in writing, and the requesting party must simultaneously serve notice of the application upon all parties to the hearing. The application must set forth the compelling circumstances for such testimony, the witness's name and address, the location where the video testimony will be held, the matter concerning which the witness is expected to testify, the conditions in place to protect the integrity of the testimony, the transmission safeguards, and the electronic address from which the video testimony will be transmitted. Such application and any opposition must be made promptly and within such time as not to delay the proceeding.</P>
              <P>(2) Appropriate safeguards must ensure that the Administrative Law Judge has the ability to assess the witness's credibility and that the parties have a meaningful opportunity to examine and cross-examine the witness, and must include at a minimum measures that ensure that representatives of the parties have the opportunity to be present at the remote location, the judge, participants, and the reporter are able to hear the testimony and observe the witness, the camera view is adjustable to provide a close-up view of counsel and the witness and a panoramic view of the room, exhibits used in the witness's examination are exchanged in advance of the examination, and video technology assistance is available to assist with technical difficulties that arise during the examination. The Administrative Law Judge may also impose additional safeguards.</P>
              <P>(3) The official record of the videoconference testimony will be the official transcript prepared by the officer designated to transcribe the testimony.</P>

              <P>(a) An Administrative Law Judge may withdraw from a proceeding because of a personal bias or for other disqualifying reasons. Any party may request the Administrative Law Judge, at any time following the Judge's designation and before filing of the Judge's decision, to withdraw on grounds of personal bias or disqualification, by filing with the Judge promptly upon the discovery of the alleged facts a timely affidavit setting forth in detail the matters alleged to constitute grounds for disqualification. If, in the Administrative Law Judge's opinion, the affidavit is filed with due diligence and is sufficient on its face, the Judge will promptly disqualify himself/herself and withdraw from the proceeding. If the Administrative Law Judge does not disqualify himself/herself and withdraw from the proceeding, the Judge must rule upon the record, stating the grounds for that ruling, and proceed with the hearing, or, if the hearing has closed, the Judge will proceed with issuance of the decision, and the provisions of § 102.26, with respect to review of rulings of Administrative Law Judges, will apply.</P>
              <P>(b) If the Administrative Law Judge designated to conduct the hearing becomes unavailable to the Board after the hearing has been opened, the Chief Administrative Law Judge, Deputy Chief Administrative Law Judge, or an Associate Chief Administrative Law Judge, as the case may be, may designate another Administrative Law Judge for the purpose of further hearing or other appropriate action.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Administrative Law Judge's decision; contents of record; alternative dispute resolution program.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Administrative Law Judge's decision.</E> After a hearing for the purpose of taking evidence upon a complaint, the Administrative Law Judge will prepare a decision. The decision will contain findings of fact, conclusions of law, and the reasons or grounds for the findings and conclusions, and recommendations for the proper disposition of the case. If the Respondent is found to have engaged in the alleged unfair labor practices, the decision will also contain a recommendation for such affirmative action by the Respondent as will effectuate the policies of the Act. The Administrative Law Judge will file the decision with the Board. If the Judge delivers a bench decision, promptly upon receiving the transcript the Judge will certify the accuracy of the pages of the transcript containing the decision; file with the Board a certified copy of those pages, together with any supplementary matter the Judge may deem necessary to complete the decision; and serve a copy on each of the parties. Upon the filing of the decision, the Board will enter an order transferring the case to the Board, setting forth the date of the transfer and will serve on all the parties copies of the decision and the order. Service of the <PRTPAGE P="55"/>Administrative Law Judge's decision and of the order transferring the case to the Board is complete upon mailing.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Contents of record.</E> The charge upon which the complaint was issued and any amendments, the complaint and any amendments, notice of hearing, answer and any amendments, motions, rulings, orders, the transcript of the hearing, stipulations, exhibits, documentary evidence, and depositions, together with the Administrative Law Judge's decision and exceptions, and any cross-exceptions or answering briefs as provided in § 102.46, constitutes the record in the case.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Alternative dispute resolution program.</E> The Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Program is available to parties with unfair labor practice or compliance cases pending before the Board at any stage subsequent to the initial issuance of an Administrative Law Judge's decision or any other process involving the transfer to the Board of such cases. Participation in the ADR Program is voluntary, and a party that enters the ADR Program may withdraw any time after the first meeting with the neutral. No party will be charged fees or expenses for using the ADR Program.</P>
              <P>(1) The parties may request participation in the ADR Program by contacting the program director. Deadlines for filing pleadings with the Board will be stayed effective the date that the case enters the ADR Program. If the case is removed from the ADR Program, the time period for filing will begin to run and will consist of the time period that remained when the case entered the ADR Program. Notice will be provided to the parties of the date the case enters the ADR Program and the date it is removed from the ADR Program.</P>
              <P>(2) A case may remain in the ADR Program for 28 days from the first settlement meeting or until the parties reach a settlement, whichever occurs first. A request for extension of the stay beyond the 28 days will be granted only with the approval and in the discretion of both the neutral and the program director upon a showing that such an extension is supported by good cause.</P>
              <P>(3) Once the case enters the ADR Program, the program director will arrange for the appointment of a neutral to assist the parties in settling the case.</P>
              <P>(4) The preferred method of conducting settlement conferences is to have the parties or their representatives attend in person, and therefore the neutral will make every reasonable effort to meet with the participants face-to-face at the parties' location. Settlement conferences by telephone or through videoconference may be held if the parties so desire.</P>
              <P>(5) Parties may be represented by counsel at the conferences, but representation by counsel is not required. However, each party must have in attendance a representative who has the authority to bind the party to the terms of a settlement agreement.</P>
              <P>(6) The neutral may ask the parties to submit pre-conference memos setting forth the issues in dispute, prior settlement efforts, and anything else that the parties would like to bring to the neutral's attention. A party's memo will be treated as a confidential submission unless the party that prepared the memo authorizes its release to the other parties.</P>

              <P>(7) Settlement discussions held under the ADR Program will be confidential. All documents submitted to the neutral and statements made during the ADR proceedings, including proposed settlement terms, are for settlement purposes only and are confidential. However, evidence otherwise admissible or discoverable will not be rendered inadmissible or undiscoverable because of its use in the ADR proceedings. No evidence as to what transpired during the ADR proceedings will be admissible in any administrative or court proceeding except to the extent it is relevant to determining the existence or meaning of a settlement agreement. The parties and their representatives will not discuss with the press any matters concerning settlement positions communicated during the ADR proceedings except by express written permission of the other parties. There will be no communication between the <PRTPAGE P="56"/>ADR Program and the Board on specific cases submitted to the ADR Program, except for procedural information such as case name, number, timing of the process, and status.</P>
              <P>(8) The neutral has no authority to impose a settlement. Settlement agreements are subject to approval by the Board in accordance with its existing procedures for approving settlements.</P>
              <P>(9) No party will at any time or in any proceeding take the position that participation in the ADR Program resulted in the waiver of any legal rights related to the underlying claims in the case, except as set forth in any settlement agreement.</P>
              <P>(10) Nothing in the ADR Program is intended to discourage or interfere with settlement negotiations that the parties wish to conduct outside the ADR Program.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Exceptions and brief in support.</E> Within 28 days, or within such further period as the Board may allow, from the date of the service of the order transferring the case to the Board, pursuant to § 102.45, any party may (in accordance with Section 10(c) of the Act and §§ 102.2 through 102.5 and 102.7) file with the Board in Washington, DC, exceptions to the Administrative Law Judge's decision or to any other part of the record or proceedings (including rulings upon all motions or objections), together with a brief in support of the exceptions. The filing of exceptions and briefs is subject to the filing requirements of paragraph (h) of this section</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Exceptions.</E> (i) Each exception must:</P>

              <P>(C) Provide precise citations of the portions of the record relied on; and</P>
              <P>(D) Concisely state the grounds for the exception. If a supporting brief is filed, the exceptions document must not contain any argument or citation of authorities in support of the exceptions; any argument and citation of authorities must be set forth only in the brief. If no supporting brief is filed, the exceptions document must also include the citation of authorities and argument in support of the exceptions, in which event the exceptions document is subject to the 50-page limit for briefs set forth in paragraph (h) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) Any exception to a ruling, finding, conclusion, or recommendation which is not specifically urged will be deemed to have been waived. Any exception which fails to comply with the foregoing requirements may be disregarded.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Answering briefs to exceptions.</E> (1) Within 14 days, or such further period as the Board may allow, from the last date on which exceptions and any supporting brief may be filed, a party opposing the exceptions may file an answering brief to the exceptions, in accordance with the filing requirements of paragraph (h) of this section.</P>

              <P>(2) The answering brief to the exceptions must be limited to the questions raised in the exceptions and in the brief in support. It must present clearly the points of fact and law relied on in support of the position taken on each question. Where exception has been taken to a factual finding of the Administrative Law Judge and the party filing the answering brief proposes to support the Judge's finding, <PRTPAGE P="57"/>the answering brief must specify those pages of the record which the party contends support the Judge's finding.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Cross-exceptions and brief in support.</E> Any party who has not previously filed exceptions may, within 14 days, or such further period as the Board may allow, from the last date on which exceptions and any supporting brief may be filed, file cross-exceptions to any portion of the Administrative Law Judge's decision, together with a supporting brief, in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (h) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Answering briefs to cross-exceptions.</E> Within 14 days, or such further period as the Board may allow, from the last date on which cross-exceptions and any supporting brief may be filed, any other party may file an answering brief to such cross-exceptions in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (b) and (h) of this section. Such answering brief must be limited to the questions raised in the cross-exceptions.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Reply briefs.</E> Within 14 days from the last date on which an answering brief may be filed pursuant to paragraphs (b) or (d) of this section, any party may file a reply brief to any such answering brief. Any reply brief filed pursuant to this paragraph (e) must be limited to matters raised in the brief to which it is replying, and must not exceed 10 pages. No extensions of time will be granted for the filing of reply briefs, nor will permission be granted to exceed the 10-page limit. The reply brief must be filed with the Board and served on the other parties. No further briefs may be filed except by special leave of the Board. Requests for such leave must be in writing and copies must be served simultaneously on the other parties.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Failure to except.</E> Matters not included in exceptions or cross-exceptions may not thereafter be urged before the Board, or in any further proceeding.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Oral argument.</E> A party desiring oral argument before the Board must request permission from the Board in writing simultaneously with the filing of exceptions or cross-exceptions. The Board will notify the parties of the time and place of oral argument, if such permission is granted. Oral arguments are limited to 30 minutes for each party entitled to participate.

Unless the Board directs otherwise, the following procedures will apply.</P>
              <P>(1) The Board will consider motions to file an amicus brief only when: (a) A party files exceptions to an Administrative Law Judge's decision; or (b) a case is remanded by the court of appeals and the Board requests briefing from the parties.</P>

Where a case has been remanded by the court of appeals, the motion must be filed no later than 21 days after the parties file statements of position on remand. A motion filed outside these time periods must be supported by a showing of good cause. The motion will not operate to stay the issuance of a Board decision upon completion of the briefing schedule for the parties.</P>

              <P>(3) The motion must be accompanied by the proposed amicus brief and must comply with the service and form prescribed by § 102.5. The brief may be no more than 25 pages in length.<PRTPAGE P="58"/>

The specification will contain or be accompanied by a Notice of Hearing before an Administrative Law Judge at a specific place and at a time not less than 21 days after the service of the specification.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Contents of specification with respect to allegations concerning the amount of backpay due.</E> With respect to allegations concerning the amount of backpay due, the specification will specifically and in detail show, for each employee, the backpay periods broken down by calendar quarters, the specific figures and basis of computation of gross backpay and interim earnings, the expenses for each quarter, the net backpay due, and any other pertinent information.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Filing and service of answer to compliance specification.</E> Each Respondent alleged in the specification to have compliance obligations must, within 21 days from the service of the specification, file an answer with the Regional Director issuing the specification, and must immediately serve a copy on the other parties.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Form and contents of answer.</E> The answer to the specification must be in writing, signed and sworn to by the Respondent or by a duly authorized agent with appropriate power of attorney affixed, and contain the address of the Respondent. The answer must specifically admit, deny, or explain each allegation of the specification, unless the Respondent is without knowledge, in which case the Respondent must so state, such statement operating as a denial. Denials must fairly meet the substance of the allegations of the specification at issue. When a Respondent intends to deny only a part of an allegation, the Respondent must specify so much of it as is true and deny only the remainder. As to all matters within the knowledge of the Respondent, including but not limited to the various factors entering into the computation of gross backpay, a general <PRTPAGE P="61"/>denial will not suffice. As to such matters, if the Respondent disputes either the accuracy of the figures in the specification or the premises on which they are based, the answer must specifically state the basis for such disagreement, setting forth in detail the Respondent's position and furnishing the appropriate supporting figures.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Failure to answer or to plead specifically and in detail to backpay allegations of specification.</E> If the Respondent fails to file any answer to the specification within the time prescribed by this section, the Board may, either with or without taking evidence in support of the allegations of the specification and without further notice to the Respondent, find the specification to be true and enter such order as may be appropriate. If the Respondent files an answer to the specification but fails to deny any allegation of the specification in the manner required by paragraph (b) of this section, and the failure to deny is not adequately explained, such allegation will be deemed admitted as true, and may be so found by the Board without the taking of evidence supporting such allegation, and the Respondent will be precluded from introducing any evidence controverting the allegation.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Extension of time for filing answer to specification.</E> Upon the Regional Director's own motion or upon proper cause shown by any Respondent, the Regional Director issuing the compliance specification may, by written order, extend the time within which the answer to the specification must be filed.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Amendment to answer.</E> Following the amendment of the specification by the Regional Director, any Respondent affected by the amendment may amend its answer.</P>

A petition under paragraph (1)(A)(ii) of Section 9(c) of the Act, alleging that the individual or labor organization which has been certified or is being currently recognized as the bargaining representative is no longer such representative (hereinafter called a petition for decertification), may be filed by any employee or group of employees or any individual or labor organization acting in their behalf. Petitions under this section shall be in writing and signed, and either shall be sworn to before a notary public, Board agent, or other person duly authorized by law to administer oaths and take acknowledgments or shall contain a declaration by the person signing it, under the penalty of <PRTPAGE P="62"/>perjury, that its contents are true and correct (see 28 U.S.C. 1746). One original of the petition shall be filed, and a copy served on all parties named in the petition. A person filing a petition by facsimile pursuant to § 102.114(f) shall also file an original for the Agency's records, but failure to do so shall not affect the validity of the filing by facsimile, if otherwise proper. A person filing a petition electronically pursuant to § 102.114(i) need not file an original. Except as provided in § 102.72, such petitions shall be filed with the regional director for the Region wherein the bargaining unit exists, or, if the bargaining unit exists in two or more Regions, with the regional director for any of such Regions. A certificate of service on all parties named in the petition shall also be filed with the regional director when the petition is filed. Along with the petition, the petitioner shall serve the Agency's description of procedures in representation cases and the Agency's Statement of Position form on all parties named in the petition. Prior to the transfer of the record to the Board, the petition may be withdrawn only with the consent of the regional director with whom such petition was filed. After the transfer of the record to the Board, the petition may be withdrawn only with the consent of the Board. Whenever the regional director or the Board, as the case may be, approves the withdrawal of any petition, the case shall be closed.</P>

Except in cases presenting unusually complex issues, the regional director shall set the hearing for a date 8 days from the date of service of the notice excluding intervening Federal holidays, but if the 8th day is a weekend or Federal holiday, the regional director shall set the hearing for the following business day. The regional director may postpone the hearing for up to 2 business days upon request of a party showing special circumstances. The regional director may postpone the opening of the hearing for more than 2 business days upon request of a party showing extraordinary circumstances.

The employer shall maintain the posting until the petition is dismissed or withdrawn or the <PRTPAGE P="67"/>Notice of Petition for Election is replaced by the Notice of Election.

              <SUBJECT>Conduct of hearing.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The purpose of a hearing conducted under Section 9(c) of the Act is to determine if a question of representation exists. A question of representation exists if a proper petition has been filed concerning a unit appropriate for the purpose of collective bargaining or concerning a unit in which an individual or labor organization has been certified or is being currently recognized by the employer as the bargaining representative. Disputes concerning individuals' eligibility to vote or inclusion in an appropriate unit ordinarily need not be litigated or resolved before an election is conducted. If, upon the record of the hearing, the regional director finds that a question of representation exists, the director shall direct an election to resolve the question.</P>
              <P>(b) Hearings shall be conducted by a hearing officer and shall be open to the public unless otherwise ordered by the hearing officer. At any time, a hearing officer may be substituted for the hearing officer previously presiding. Subject to the provisions of § 102.66, it shall be the duty of the hearing officer to inquire fully into all matters and issues necessary to obtain a full and complete record upon which the Board or the regional director may discharge their duties under Section 9(c) of the Act.</P>
              <P>(c) The hearing shall continue from day to day until completed unless the regional director concludes that extraordinary circumstances warrant otherwise. The regional director may, in the director's discretion, adjourn the hearing to a different place by announcement thereof at the hearing or by other appropriate notice.</P>

              <P>(a) All motions, including motions for intervention pursuant to paragraphs (b) and (e) of this section, shall be in writing or, if made at the hearing, may be stated orally on the record and shall briefly state the order or relief sought and the grounds for such motion. The Motion shall immediately be served on the other parties to the proceeding. Motions made prior to the transfer of the record to the Board shall be filed with the regional director, except that motions made during the hearing shall be filed with the hearing officer. After the transfer of the record to the Board, all motions shall be filed with the Board. Such motions shall be printed or otherwise legibly duplicated. Eight copies of such motions shall be filed with the Board. Extra copies of electronically-filed papers need not be filed. The Regional Director may rule upon all motions filed with him/her, causing a copy of the ruling to be served on the parties, or may refer the motion to the Hearing Officer, except that if the Regional Director prior to the close of the hearing grants a motion to dismiss the petition, the petitioner may obtain a review of such ruling in the manner prescribed in § 102.71. The hearing officer shall rule, either orally on the record or in writing, upon all motions filed at the hearing or referred to the hearing officer as hereinabove provided, except that the hearing officer shall rule on motions to intervene and to amend the petition only as directed by the regional director, and except that all motions to dismiss petitions shall be referred for appropriate action at such time as the entire record is considered by the regional director or the Board, as the case may be. All motions, rulings, and orders shall become a part of the record, except that rulings on motions to revoke subpoenas shall become a part of the record only upon the request of the party aggrieved thereby as provided in § 102.66(f).</P>

              <P>(b) Any person desiring to intervene in any proceeding shall make a motion for intervention, stating the grounds upon which such person claims to have an interest in the proceeding. The regional director, or the hearing officer at the specific direction of the regional director, may by order permit intervention in person or by counsel or other representative to such extent and <PRTPAGE P="71"/>upon such terms as the regional director may deem proper, and such intervenor shall thereupon become a party to the proceeding.</P>
              <P>(c) Rulings by the hearing officer shall not be appealed directly to the regional director, except by special permission of the regional director, but shall be considered by the regional director when the director reviews the entire record. Requests to the regional director for special permission to appeal from a ruling of the hearing officer, together with the appeal from such ruling, shall be filed promptly, in writing, and shall briefly state the reasons special permission should be granted and the grounds relied on for the appeal. The moving party shall immediately serve a copy of the request for special permission and of the appeal on the other parties and on the regional director. Any statement in opposition or other response to the request and/or to the appeal shall be filed promptly, in writing, and shall be served immediately on the other parties and on the regional director. No party shall be precluded from raising an issue at a later time because it did not seek special permission to appeal. If the regional director grants the request for special permission to appeal, the regional director may proceed forthwith to rule on the appeal. Neither the filing nor the grant of such a request shall stay the proceedings unless otherwise ordered by the regional director. As stated in § 102.67, the parties may request Board review of regional director actions.</P>
              <P>(d) The right to make motions or to make objections to rulings on motions shall not be deemed waived by participation in the proceeding.</P>

              <P>(e)(1) A party to a proceeding may, because of extraordinary circumstances, move after the close of the hearing for reopening of the record, or move after the decision or report for reconsideration, for rehearing, or to reopen the record, but no such motion shall stay the time for filing a request for review of a decision or exceptions to a report. No motion for reconsideration, for rehearing, or to reopen the record will be entertained by the Board or by any regional director or hearing officer with respect to any matter which could have been but was not raised pursuant to any other section of these rules, except that the regional director may treat a request for review of a decision or exceptions to a report as a motion for reconsideration. A motion for reconsideration shall state with particularity the material error claimed and with respect to any finding of material fact shall specify the page of the record relied on for the motion. A motion for rehearing or to reopen the record shall specify briefly the error alleged to require a rehearing or hearing <E T="03">de novo,</E> the prejudice to the movant alleged to result from such error, the additional evidence sought to be adduced, why it was not presented previously, and what result it would require if adduced and credited. Only newly discovered evidence—evidence which has become available only since the close of the hearing—or evidence which the regional director or the Board believes should have been taken at the hearing will be taken at any further hearing.</P>
              <P>(2) Any motion for reconsideration or for rehearing pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall be filed within 14 days, or such further period as may be allowed, after the service of the decision or report. Any request for an extension of time to file such a motion shall be served promptly on the other parties. A motion to reopen the record shall be filed promptly on discovery of the evidence sought to be adduced.</P>

              <P>(3) The filing and pendency of a motion under this provision shall not unless so ordered operate to stay the effectiveness of any action taken or directed to be taken nor will a regional director or the Board delay any decision or action during the period specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, except that, if a motion for reconsideration based on changed circumstances or to reopen the record based on newly discovered evidence states with particularity that the granting thereof will affect the eligibility to vote of specific employees, the Board agent shall have discretion to allow such employees to vote subject to challenge even if they are specifically excluded in the direction of election and to challenge or permit the moving party to challenge the ballots of such employees even if <PRTPAGE P="72"/>they are specifically included in the direction of election in any election conducted while such motion is pending. A motion for reconsideration, for rehearing, or to reopen the record need not be filed to exhaust administrative remedies.</P>

The hearing officer may solicit offers of proof from the parties or their counsel as to any or all such issues. Offers of proof shall take the form of a written statement or an oral statement on the record identifying each witness the party would call to testify concerning the issue and summarizing each witness's testimony. If the regional director determines that the evidence described in an offer of proof is insufficient to sustain the proponent's position, the evidence shall not be received.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Preclusion.</E> A party shall be precluded from raising any issue, presenting any evidence relating to any issue, cross-examining any witness concerning any issue, and presenting argument concerning any issue that the party failed to raise in its timely Statement of Position or to place in dispute in response to another party's Statement of Position or response, except that no party shall be precluded from contesting or presenting evidence relevant to the Board's statutory jurisdiction to process the petition. Nor shall any party be precluded, on the grounds that a voter's eligibility or inclusion was not contested at the pre-election hearing, from challenging the eligibility of any voter during the election. If a party contends that the proposed unit is not appropriate in its Statement of Position but fails to specify the classifications, locations, or other employee groupings that must be added to or excluded from the proposed unit to make it an appropriate unit, the party shall also be precluded from raising any issue as to the appropriateness of the unit, presenting any evidence relating to the appropriateness of the unit, cross-examining any witness concerning the appropriateness of the unit, and presenting argument concerning the appropriateness of the unit. If the employer fails to timely furnish the lists of employees described in §§ 102.63(b)(1)(iii),(b)(2)(iii), or (b)(3)(iii), the employer shall be precluded from contesting the appropriateness of the proposed unit at any <PRTPAGE P="73"/>time and from contesting the eligibility or inclusion of any individuals at the pre-election hearing, including by presenting evidence or argument, or by cross-examination of witnesses.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Objections.</E> Any objection with respect to the conduct of the hearing, including any objection to the introduction of evidence, may be stated orally or in writing, accompanied by a short statement of the grounds of such objection, and included in the record. No such objection shall be deemed waived by further participation in the hearing.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Subpoenas.</E> The Board, or any Member thereof, shall, on the written application of any party, forthwith issue subpoenas requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of any evidence, including books, records, correspondence, or documents, in their possession or under their control. The Executive Secretary shall have the authority to sign and issue any such subpoenas on behalf of the Board or any Member thereof. Any party may file applications for subpoenas in writing with the Regional Director if made prior to hearing, or with the Hearing Officer if made at the hearing. Applications for subpoenas may be made ex parte. The Regional Director or the Hearing Officer, as the case may be, shall forthwith grant the subpoenas requested. Any person served with a subpoena, whether ad testificandum or duces tecum, if he or she does not intend to comply with the subpoena, shall, within 5 days after the date of service of the subpoena, petition in writing to revoke the subpoena. The date of service for purposes of computing the time for filing a petition to revoke shall be the date the subpoena is received. Such petition shall be filed with the Regional Director who may either rule upon it or refer it for ruling to the Hearing Officer except that if the evidence called for is to be produced at a hearing and the hearing has opened, the petition to revoke shall be filed with the Hearing Officer. Notice of the filing of petitions to revoke shall be promptly given by the Regional Director or Hearing Officer, as the case may be, to the party at whose request the subpoena was issued. The Regional Director or the Hearing Officer, as the case may be, shall revoke the subpoena if, in his/her opinion, the evidence whose production is required does not relate to any matter under investigation or in question in the proceedings or the subpoena does not describe with sufficient particularity the evidence whose production is required, or if for any other reason sufficient in law the subpoena is otherwise invalid. The Regional Director or the Hearing Officer, as the case may be, shall make a simple statement of procedural or other grounds for his/her ruling. The petition to revoke, any answer filed thereto, and any ruling thereon shall not become part of the record except upon the request of the party aggrieved by the ruling. Persons compelled to submit data or evidence are entitled to retain or, on payment of lawfully prescribed costs, to procure copies or transcripts of the data or evidence submitted by them.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Election details.</E> Prior to the close of the hearing, the hearing officer will:</P>
              <P>(1) Solicit the parties' positions on the type, date(s), time(s), and location(s) of the election and the eligibility period, but shall not permit litigation of those issues;</P>
              <P>(2) Solicit the name, address, email address, facsimile number, and phone number of the employer's on-site representative to whom the regional director should transmit the Notice of Election in the event the regional director directs an election;</P>
              <P>(3) Inform the parties that the regional director will issue a decision as soon as practicable and that the director will immediately transmit the document to the parties and their designated representatives by email, facsimile, or by overnight mail (if neither an email address nor facsimile number was provided); and</P>
              <P>(4) Inform the parties what their obligations will be under these rules if the director directs an election and of the time for complying with such obligations.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Oral argument and briefs.</E> Any party shall be entitled, upon request, to a reasonable period at the close of the hearing for oral argument, which shall be included in the stenographic report of the hearing. Post-hearing briefs shall be filed only upon special permission of the regional director and <PRTPAGE P="74"/>within the time and addressing the subjects permitted by the regional director. Copies of the brief shall be served on all other parties to the proceeding and a statement of such service shall be filed with the regional director together with the brief. No reply brief may be filed except upon special permission of the regional director.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Hearing officer analysis.</E> The hearing officer may submit an analysis of the record to the regional director but shall make no recommendations.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Witness fees.</E> Witness fees and mileage shall be paid by the party at whose instance the witness appears.</P>

            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 102.67</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Proceedings before the regional director; further hearing; action by the regional director; appeals from actions of the regional director; statement in opposition; requests for extraordinary relief; Notice of Election; voter list.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Proceedings before regional director.</E> The regional director may proceed, either forthwith upon the record or after oral argument, the submission of briefs, or further hearing, as the director may deem proper, to determine whether a question of representation exists in a unit appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining, and to direct an election, dismiss the petition, or make other disposition of the matter. A decision by the regional director upon the record shall set forth the director's findings, conclusions, and order or direction.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Directions of elections.</E> If the regional director directs an election, the direction ordinarily will specify the type, date(s), time(s), and location(s) of the election and the eligibility period. The regional director shall schedule the election for the earliest date practicable consistent with these rules. The regional director shall transmit the direction of election to the parties and their designated representatives by email, facsimile, or by overnight mail (if neither an email address nor facsimile number was provided). The regional director shall also transmit the Board's Notice of Election to the parties and their designated representatives by email, facsimile, or by overnight mail (if neither an email address nor facsimile number was provided), and it will ordinarily be transmitted simultaneously with the direction of election. If the direction of election provides for individuals to vote subject to challenge because their eligibility has not been determined, the Notice of Election shall so state, and shall advise employees that the individuals are neither included in, nor excluded from, the bargaining unit, inasmuch as the regional director has permitted them to vote subject to challenge. The election notice shall further advise employees that the eligibility or inclusion of the individuals will be resolved, if necessary, following the election.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Requests for Board review of regional director actions.</E> Upon the filing of a request therefor with the Board by any interested person, the Board may review any action of a Regional Director delegated to him/her under Section 3(b) of the Act except as the Board's Rules provide otherwise, but such a review shall not, unless specifically ordered by the Board, operate as a stay of any action by the Regional Director. The request for review may be filed at any time following the action until 14 days after a final disposition of the proceeding by the regional director. No party shall be precluded from filing a request for review of the direction of election within the time provided in this paragraph because it did not file a request for review of the direction of election prior to the election.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Grounds for review.</E> The Board will grant a request for review only where compelling reasons exist therefor. Accordingly, a request for review may be granted only upon one or more of the following grounds:</P>
              <P>(1) That a substantial question of law or policy is raised because of:</P>
              <P>(i) The absence of; or</P>
              <P>(ii) A departure from, officially reported Board precedent.</P>
              <P>(2) That the regional director's decision on a substantial factual issue is clearly erroneous on the record and such error prejudicially affects the rights of a party.</P>

              <P>(3) That the conduct of any hearing or any ruling made in connection with the proceeding has resulted in prejudicial error.<PRTPAGE P="75"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) That there are compelling reasons for reconsideration of an important Board rule or policy.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Contents of request.</E> A request for review must be a self-contained document enabling the Board to rule on the basis of its contents without the necessity of recourse to the record; however, the Board may, in its discretion, examine the record in evaluating the request. With respect to the ground listed in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, and other grounds where appropriate, the request must contain a summary of all evidence or rulings bearing on the issues together with page citations from the transcript and a summary of argument. Such request may not raise any issue or allege any facts not timely presented to the regional director.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Opposition to request.</E> Any party may, within 7 days after the last day on which the request for review must be filed, file with the Board a statement in opposition which shall be served in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (i) of this section. The Board may grant or deny the request for review without awaiting a statement in opposition.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Finality; waiver; denial of request.</E> The regional director's actions are final unless a request for review is granted. The parties may, at any time, waive their right to request review. Failure to request review shall preclude such parties from relitigating, in any related subsequent unfair labor practice proceeding, any issue which was, or could have been, raised in the representation proceeding. Denial of a request for review shall constitute an affirmance of the regional director's action which shall also preclude relitigating any such issues in any related subsequent unfair labor practice proceeding.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Grant of review; briefs.</E> The grant of a request for review shall not stay the regional director's action unless otherwise ordered by the Board. Except where the Board rules upon the issues on review in the order granting review, the appellants and other parties may, within 14 days after issuance of an order granting review, file briefs with the Board. Such briefs may be reproductions of those previously filed with the regional director and/or other briefs which shall be limited to the issues raised in the request for review. Where review has been granted, the Board may provide for oral argument or further hearing. The Board will consider the entire record in the light of the grounds relied on for review and shall make such disposition of the matter as it deems appropriate. Any request for review may be withdrawn with the permission of the Board at any time prior to the issuance of the decision of the Board thereon.</P>
              <P>(i)(1) <E T="03">Format of request.</E> All documents filed with the Board under the provisions of this Section shall be double spaced, on 8<FR>1/2</FR>- by 11-inch paper, and shall be printed or otherwise legibly duplicated.Extra copies of electronically-filed papers need not be filed. Requests for review, including briefs in support thereof and any motions under paragraph (j) of this section; statements in opposition thereto; and briefs on review shall not exceed 50 pages in length, exclusive of subject index and table of cases and other authorities cited, unless permission to exceed that limit is obtained from the Board by motion, setting forth the reasons therefor, filed not less than 5 days, including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, prior to the date the document is due. Where any brief filed pursuant to this section exceeds 20 pages, it shall contain a subject index with page authorities cited. A party may combine a request for review of the regional director's decision and direction of election with a request for review of a regional director's post-election decision, if the party has not previously filed a request for review of the pre-election decision. Repetitive requests will not be considered.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Service.</E> The party filing with the Board a request for review, a statement in opposition to a request for review, or a brief on review shall serve a copy thereof on the other parties and shall file a copy with the regional director. A certificate of service shall be filed with the Board together with the document.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Extensions.</E> Requests for extensions of time to file requests for review, statements in opposition to a request for review, or briefs, as permitted by this section, shall be filed with the <PRTPAGE P="76"/>Board or the regional director, as the case may be. The party filing the request for an extension of time shall serve a copy thereof on the other parties and, if filed with the Board, on the regional director. A statement of such service shall be filed with the document.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Requests for extraordinary relief.</E> (1) A party requesting review may also move in writing to the Board for one or more of the following forms of relief:</P>
              <P>(i) Expedited consideration of the request;</P>
              <P>(ii) A stay of some or all of the proceedings, including the election; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Impoundment and/or segregation of some or all of the ballots.</P>
              <P>(2) Relief will be granted only upon a clear showing that it is necessary under the particular circumstances of the case. The pendency of a motion does not entitle a party to interim relief, and an affirmative ruling by the Board granting relief is required before the action of the regional director will be altered in any fashion.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Notice of election.</E> The employer shall post copies of the Board's Notice of Election in conspicuous places, including all places where notices to employees in the unit are customarily posted, at least 3 full working days prior to 12:01 a.m. of the day of the election and shall also distribute it electronically if the employer customarily communicates with employees in the unit electronically. In elections involving mail ballots, the election shall be deemed to have commenced the day the ballots are deposited by the regional office in the mail. In all cases, the notices shall remain posted until the end of the election. The term working day shall mean an entire 24-hour period excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays. The employer's failure properly to post or distribute the election notices as required herein shall be grounds for setting aside the election whenever proper and timely objections are filed under the provisions of § 102.69(a). A party shall be estopped from objecting to the nonposting of notices if it is responsible for the nonposting, and likewise shall be estopped from objecting to the nondistribution of notices if it is responsible for the nondistribution.</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Voter list.</E> Absent extraordinary circumstances specified in the direction of election, the employer shall, within 2 business days after issuance of the direction, provide to the regional director and the parties named in such direction a list of the full names, work locations, shifts, job classifications, and contact information (including home addresses, available personal email addresses, and available home and personal cellular (“cell”) telephone numbers) of all eligible voters. The employer shall also include in a separate section of that list the same information for those individuals who, according to the direction of election, will be permitted to vote subject to challenge, including, for example, individuals in the classifications or other groupings that will be permitted to vote subject to challenge. In order to be timely filed and served, the list must be received by the regional director and the parties named in the direction respectively within 2 business days after issuance of the direction of election unless a longer time is specified therein. The list of names shall be alphabetized (overall or by department) and be in an electronic format approved by the General Counsel unless the employer certifies that it does not possess the capacity to produce the list in the required form. When feasible, the list shall be filed electronically with the regional director and served electronically on the other parties named in the direction. A certificate of service on all parties shall be filed with the regional director when the voter list is filed. The employer's failure to file or serve the list within the specified time or in proper format shall be grounds for setting aside the election whenever proper and timely objections are filed under the provisions of § 102.69(a). The employer shall be estopped from objecting to the failure to file or serve the list within the specified time or in the proper format if it is responsible for the failure. The parties shall not use the list for purposes other than the representation proceeding, Board proceedings arising from it, and related matters.</P>

              <P>The record in a proceeding conducted pursuant to the foregoing section shall consist of: the petition, notice of hearing with affidavit of service thereof, statements of position, responses to statements of position, offers of proof made at the pre-election hearing, motions, rulings, orders, the stenographic report of the hearing and of any oral argument before the regional director, stipulations, exhibits, affidavits of service, and any briefs or other legal memoranda submitted by the parties to the regional director or to the Board, and the decision of the regional director, if any. Immediately upon issuance of an order granting a request for review by the Board, the regional director shall transmit the record to the Board.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Election procedure; tally of ballots; objections; certification by the regional director; hearings; hearing officer reports on objections and challenges; exceptions to hearing officer reports; regional director decisions on objections and challenges.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Election procedure; tally; objections.</E> Unless otherwise directed by the Board, all elections shall be conducted under the supervision of the Regional Director in whose Region the proceeding is pending. All elections shall be by secret ballot. Whenever two or more labor organizations are included as choices in an election, either participant may, upon its prompt request to and approval thereof by the Regional Director, whose decision shall be final, have its name removed from the ballot, except that in a proceeding involving an employer-filed petition or a petition for decertification the labor organization certified, currently recognized, or found to be seeking recognition may not have its name removed from the ballot without giving timely notice in writing to all parties and the Regional Director, disclaiming any representation interest among the employees in the unit. A pre-election conference may be held at which the parties may check the list of voters and attempt to resolve any questions of eligibility or inclusions in the unit. When the election is conducted manually, any party may be represented by observers of its own selection, subject to such limitations as the Regional Director may prescribe. Any party and Board agents may challenge, for good cause, the eligibility of any person to participate in the election. The ballots of such challenged persons shall be impounded. Upon the conclusion of the election the ballots will be counted and a tally of ballots prepared and immediately made available to the parties. Within 7 days after the tally of ballots has been prepared, any party may file with the Regional Director objections to the conduct of the election or to conduct affecting the results of the election which shall contain a short statement of the reasons therefor and a written offer of proof in the form described in § 102.66(c) insofar as applicable, except that the Regional Director may extend the time for filing the written offer of proof in support of the election objections upon request of a party showing good cause. Such filing(s) must be timely whether or not the challenged ballots are sufficient in number to affect the results of the election. The party filing the objections shall serve a copy of the objections, including the short statement of reasons therefor, but not the written offer of proof, on each of the other parties to the case, and include a certificate of such service with the objections. A person filing objections by facsimile pursuant to § 102.114(f) shall also file an original for the Agency's records, but failure to do so shall not affect the validity of the filing if otherwise proper. In addition, extra copies need not be filed if the filing is by facsimile or electronically pursuant to § 102.114(f) or (i). The Regional Director will transmit a copy of the objections to be served on each of the other parties to the proceeding, but shall not transmit the offer of proof.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Certification in the absence of objections, determinative challenges and runoff elections.</E> If no objections are filed within the time set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, if the challenged ballots are insufficient in number to affect the results of the election, and if no runoff election is to be held pursuant to <PRTPAGE P="78"/>§ 102.70, the regional director shall forthwith issue to the parties a certification of the results of the election, including certification of representative where appropriate with the same force and effect as if issued by the Board.</P>
              <P>(c)(1)(i) <E T="03">Decisions resolving objections and challenges without a hearing.</E> If timely objections are filed to the conduct of an election or to conduct affecting the results of the election, and the regional director determines that the evidence described in the accompanying offer of proof would not constitute grounds for setting aside the election if introduced at a hearing, and the regional director determines that any determinative challenges do not raise substantial and material factual issues, the regional director shall issue a decision disposing of the objections and determinative challenges, and a certification of the results of the election, including certification of representative where appropriate.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Notices of hearing on objections and challenges.</E> If timely objections are filed to the conduct of the election or to conduct affecting the results of the election, and the regional director determines that the evidence described in the accompanying offer of proof could be grounds for setting aside the election if introduced at a hearing, or if the challenged ballots are sufficient in number to affect the results of the election and raise substantial and material factual issues, the regional director shall transmit to the parties and their designated representatives by email, facsimile, or by overnight mail (if neither an email address nor facsimile number was provided) a notice of hearing before a hearing officer at a place and time fixed therein. The regional director shall set the hearing for a date 21 days after the preparation of the tally of ballots or as soon as practicable thereafter, unless the parties agree to an earlier date, except that the regional director may consolidate the hearing concerning objections and challenges with an unfair labor practice proceeding before an administrative law judge. In any proceeding wherein the election has been held pursuant to § 102.62(a) or (c) and the representation case has been consolidated with an unfair labor practice proceeding for purposes of hearing, the administrative law judge shall, after issuing a decision, sever the representation case and transfer it to the regional director for further processing.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Hearings; hearing officer reports; exceptions to regional director.</E> The hearing on objections and challenges shall continue from day to day until completed unless the regional director concludes that extraordinary circumstances warrant otherwise. Any hearing pursuant to this section shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of §§ 102.64, 102.65, and 102.66, insofar as applicable. Any party shall have the right to appear at the hearing in person, by counsel, or by other representative, to call, examine, and cross-examine witnesses, and to introduce into the record evidence of the significant facts that support the party's contentions and are relevant to the objections and determinative challenges that are the subject of the hearing. The hearing officer may rule on offers of proof. Post-hearing briefs shall be filed only upon special permission of the hearing officer and within the time and addressing the subjects permitted by the hearing officer. Upon the close of such hearing, the hearing officer shall prepare and cause to be served on the parties a report resolving questions of credibility and containing findings of fact and recommendations as to the disposition of the issues. Any party may, within 14 days from the date of issuance of such report, file with the regional director an original and one copy of exceptions to such report, with supporting brief if desired. A copy of such exceptions, together with a copy of any brief filed, shall immediately be served on the other parties and a statement of service filed with the regional director. Within 7 days from the last date on which exceptions and any supporting brief may be filed, or such further time as the regional director may allow, a party opposing the exceptions may file an answering brief with the regional director. An original and one copy shall be submitted. A copy of such answering brief shall immediately be served on the other parties and a statement of service filed with the regional director. Extra copies of electronically-<PRTPAGE P="79"/>filed papers need not be filed. The regional director shall thereupon decide the matter upon the record or make other disposition of the case. If no exceptions are filed to such report, the regional director, upon the expiration of the period for filing such exceptions, may decide the matter forthwith upon the record or may make other disposition of the case.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Regional director decisions and Board review.</E> The decision of the regional director may include a certification of the results of the election, including certification of representative where appropriate, and shall be final unless a request for review is granted. If a consent election has been held pursuant to §§ 102.62(a) or (c), the decision of the regional director is not subject to Board review. If the election has been conducted pursuant to § 102.62(b), or by a direction of election issued following any proceeding under § 102.67, the parties shall have the right to Board review set forth in § 102.67, except that in any proceeding wherein a representation case has been consolidated with an unfair labor practice proceeding for purposes of hearing and the election was conducted pursuant to §§ 102.62(b) or 102.67, the provisions of § 102.46 shall govern with respect to the filing of exceptions or an answering brief to the exceptions to the administrative law judge's decision, and a request for review of the regional director's decision and direction of election shall be due at the same time as the exceptions to the administrative law judge's decision are due.</P>
              <P>(d)(1)(i) <E T="03">Record in case with hearing.</E> In a proceeding pursuant to this section in which a hearing is held, the record in the case shall consist of the notice of hearing, motions, rulings, orders, stenographic report of the hearing, stipulations, exhibits, together with the objections to the conduct of the election or to conduct affecting the results of the election, offers of proof made at the post-election hearing, any briefs or other legal memoranda submitted by the parties, any report on such objections and/or on challenged ballots, exceptions, the decision of the regional director, any requests for review, and the record previously made as defined in § 102.68. Materials other than those set out above shall not be a part of the record.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Record in case with no hearing.</E> In a proceeding pursuant to this section in which no hearing is held, the record shall consist of the objections to the conduct of the election or to conduct affecting the results of the election, any decision on objections or on challenged ballots and any request for review of such a decision, any documentary evidence, excluding statements of witnesses, relied upon by the regional director in his decision, any briefs or other legal memoranda submitted by the parties, and any other motions, rulings or orders of the regional director. Materials other than those set out above shall not be a part of the record, except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) Immediately upon issuance of an order granting a request for review by the Board, the regional director shall transmit to the Board the record of the proceeding as defined in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) In a proceeding pursuant to this section in which no hearing is held, a party filing a request for review of a regional director's decision on challenged ballots or on objections or on both, or any opposition thereto, may support its submission to the Board by appending thereto copies of any offer of proof, including copies of any affidavits or other documentary evidence, it has timely submitted to the regional director and which were not included in the decision.

              <P>(a) The regional director shall conduct a runoff election, without further order of the Board, when an election in which the ballot provided for not less than three choices (i.e., at least two representatives and “neither”) results in no choice receiving a majority of the valid ballots cast and no objections are filed as provided in § 102.69. Only one runoff shall be held pursuant to this section.</P>

              <P>(d) In the event the number of votes cast in an inconclusive election in which the ballot provided for a choice among two or more representatives and “neither” or “none” is equally divided among the several choices; or in the event the number of ballots cast for one choice in such election is equal to the number cast for another of the choices but less than the number cast for the third choice, the regional director shall declare the first election a nullity and shall conduct another election, providing for a selection from among the three choices afforded in the original ballot; and he shall thereafter proceed in accordance with paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section. In the event two or more choices receive the same number of ballots and another choice receives no ballots and there are no challenged ballots that would affect the results of the election, and if all eligible voters have cast valid ballots, there shall be no runoff election and a certification of results of election shall be issued. Only one such further election pursuant to this paragraph may be held.</P>
              <P>(e) Upon the conclusion of the runoff election, the provisions of § 102.69 shall govern, insofar as applicable.</P>

The Regional Director will fix the time and place of the election, eligibility requirements for voting, and other arrangements of the balloting, but the parties may enter into an agreement, subject to the approval of the Regional Director, fixing such arrangements. In any such consent agreements, provision may be made for final determination of all questions arising with respect to the balloting by the Regional Director or upon grant of a request for review, by the Board.</P>

The hearing date will not be less than 10 days after service of the notice of the filing of the charge. The Notice of Hearing must contain a simple statement of the issues involved in such dispute. Such Notice will be issued promptly, and, in cases in which it is deemed appropriate to seek injunctive relief pursuant to Section 10(l) of the Act, will normally be issued within 5 days of the date upon which injunctive relief is first sought. Hearings will be conducted by a Hearing Officer, and the procedure will conform, insofar as applicable, to the procedure set forth in §§ 102.64 through 102.68. Upon the close <PRTPAGE P="87"/>of the hearing, the proceeding will be transferred to the Board, and the Board will proceed either promptly upon the record, or after oral argument, or the submission of briefs, or further hearing, to determine the dispute or otherwise dispose of the matter.

However, no briefs will be filed in cases designated in the Notice of Hearing as involving the national defense, and the parties, after the close of the evidence, may argue orally upon the record their respective contentions and positions; except that, upon application for leave to file briefs expeditiously made to the Board in Washington, DC, after the close of the hearing, the Board may for good cause shown, grant leave to file briefs and set a time for filing. Simultaneously upon such filing, a copy must be served on the other parties. No reply brief may be filed except upon special leave of the Board.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Freedom of Information Act Regulations: Agency materials including formal documents available pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act; requests for described records; time limit for response; appeal from denial of request; fees for document search, duplication, and review; files and records not subject to inspection.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) <E T="03">Introduction.</E> This subpart contains the Rules that the National Labor Relations Board (Agency) follows in processing requests for records under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552. The Rules in this subpart may be read in conjunction with the text of the FOIA and the Uniform Freedom of Information Fee <PRTPAGE P="91"/>Schedule and Guidelines published by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB Guidelines). Some records will be made available on the Agency's Web site at <E T="03">www.nlrb.gov</E> to facilitate public access. Requests made by individuals for records about themselves under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552(a), are processed under § 102.119.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">FOIA Officials.</E> The following are designated as the Agency's FOIA officials with responsibilities for complying with the FOIA:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">FOIA Officer.</E> The Assistant General Counsel for the FOIA Branch is the Agency's designated FOIA Officer.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Chief FOIA Officer.</E> The Associate General Counsel for the Division of Legal Counsel is the Agency's designated Chief FOIA Officer.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">FOIA Public Liaison.</E> The official(s) designated by the Chief FOIA Officer is the Agency's FOIA Public Liaison, with overall responsibilities for assisting in reducing delays, increasing transparency, understanding the status of requests, and assisting in the resolution of disputes. The designated FOIA Public Liaison is available on the Agency's Web site.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Authority to respond to requests and administrative appeals.</E> The FOIA Officer has the authority to act upon and respond on behalf of the Board and the General Counsel to all requests for Agency records, except for records maintained by the Agency's Office of the Inspector General. The Office of the Inspector General has the authority to respond to all requests for records maintained by that Office. The Chief FOIA Officer has the authority to respond on behalf of the Chairman of the Board and the General Counsel to all administrative appeals of adverse determinations. The Chief FOIA Officer's authority includes responding, on behalf of the Chairman of the Board, to appeals of initial determinations made by the Office of the Inspector General.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Records made available.</E> Records that are required by the FOIA under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2) may be accessed through the Agency's Web site at <E T="03">www.nlrb.gov</E>.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) <E T="03">Formal documents.</E> The formal documents constituting the record in a case or proceeding are matters of official record and, until officially destroyed pursuant to applicable statutory authority, are available to the public pursuant to the procedures in this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Certification of records.</E> The Executive Secretary will certify copies of all formal documents maintained by the Board upon request made a reasonable time in advance of need and payment of lawfully prescribed costs. The Deputy General Counsel will certify copies of any record maintained by, or originating from, the Office of General Counsel and any division, branch, or office organizationally overseen by the Office of the General Counsel, including any Regional, Subregional, or Resident Office.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) <E T="03">Making FOIA requests to the Agency</E>—(i) <E T="03">Content of requests</E>—(A) <E T="03">Description of records sought.</E> Requests for records must be in writing and must reasonably describe the record so as to permit its identification and location. To the extent possible, requesters may include specific information, such as the NLRB case number, case name, date(s) of record(s) requested, and/or full name of the party, author, or recipient of the record(s) in question. Requesters should include as much detail as practicable about the records sought. Requesters may contact the FOIA Public Liaison to discuss the records sought and to receive assistance in describing the records.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Assumption of fees.</E> Requests must contain a specific statement assuming financial responsibility for the direct costs of responding to the request in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(C) <E T="03">Specificity requirement.</E> Requests that do not reasonably describe the records sought or assume sufficient financial responsibility for responding to the request, or that otherwise fail to comply with this section, may delay the Agency's response to the request.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Transmission of requests.</E> Requests for records maintained by the Agency should be made to the FOIA Branch, which is located in the Agency's Washington, DC headquarters. The FOIA Branch is responsible for responding to requests for records originating from, or maintained by, the Board and the Office of the General Counsel, including Regional, Subregional, and resident <PRTPAGE P="92"/>offices. Requests for records maintained by the Agency's Office of the Inspector General may be made directly to that office.</P>

              <P>(A) Requesters may file FOIA requests electronically through the Agency's Web site (<E T="03">https://www.nlrb.gov</E>), which is the preferred method of submission to allow for prompt receipt, including for requests for records maintained by the Agency's Office of the Inspector General. FOIA requests may also be made by mail to the Agency's Washington, DC headquarters address, by email to the Agency's designated mailbox, or by facsimile. The mailing address, email address, and facsimile number are available on the Agency's Web site.</P>
              <P>(B) Requests not made through the Agency's Web site should be clearly marked to indicate that they contain a request for records under the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
              <P>(C) Requests made to an Agency division, branch, or any office other than the FOIA Branch will be forwarded to the FOIA Branch by the receiving office, but in that event, the applicable time limit for response set forth in paragraph (i) of this section will be calculated from the date of receipt by the FOIA Branch. The receiving office will normally forward the request to the FOIA Branch within 10 days of the initial receipt.</P>
              <P>(D) Requests made to the Agency for records that originated with another governmental agency may be referred to that agency.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Processing of FOIA requests</E>—(i) <E T="03">Timing of response.</E> The Agency ordinarily responds to FOIA requests according to their order of receipt. An initial determination will be issued within 20 working days (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> exempting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the receipt of a request. Responsive records are released at the time of the determination or, if necessary, at a time thereafter on a rolling basis.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Expedited treatment.</E> A request for expedited processing may be made at any time during the pendency of a FOIA request or appeal. Requests and appeals will be taken out of order and given expedited treatment when warranted. A requester must provide sufficient justification to grant such processing by showing that any one of the following circumstances exists:</P>
              <P>(A) The lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or</P>
              <P>(B) There is an urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information; or</P>
              <P>(C) The loss of substantial due process rights; or</P>
              <P>(D)(<E T="03">1</E>) There is widespread and exceptional media interest and possible questions exist about the government's integrity which may affect public confidence.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Within 10 calendar days of receipt of a request for expedited processing, the Agency will decide whether to grant it and will notify the requester of the decision. Once the determination has been made to grant expedited processing, the request will be given priority and processed as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited processing is denied, the Agency will act expeditiously on any appeal of that decision.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Initial determination of requests.</E> Within 20 working days after receipt of a request by the FOIA Branch, a determination will be made whether to comply with such request, and the requester will be notified in writing of that determination. In the case of requests made for records maintained by the Agency's Office of the Inspector General, that determination will be made by the Office of the Inspector General. Requesters will be made aware of their right to seek assistance from the Agency's FOIA Public Liaison.</P>
              <P>(A) <E T="03">Grants of requests.</E> If the determination is to comply with the request, the records will be made promptly available to the person making the request and, at the same time, a statement of any charges due in accordance with the fee schedule provisions of paragraph (d)(2) of this section will be provided.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Denials of requests.</E> If the determination is to deny the request in any respect, the requester will be notified in writing of that determination. The <PRTPAGE P="93"/>determination will set forth: The reason(s) for the denial; the name and title or position of each person responsible for the denial; and an estimate of the volume of records or information withheld, in number of pages or in some other reasonable form of estimation: However, this estimate does not need to be provided if the volume is otherwise indicated through deletions on records disclosed in part, or if providing an estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption. The determination will also inform the requester of the right to seek dispute resolution services from the Agency's FOIA Public Liaison or the Office of Government Information Services, as well as the right to appeal the adverse determination under the administrative appeal provisions of paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section.</P>
              <P>(C) Adverse determinations may consist of: A determination to withhold any requested record in whole or in part; a determination that a requested record does not exist or cannot be located; a determination that what has been requested is not a record subject to the FOIA; a determination on any disputed fee matter, including a denial of a request for a fee waiver or reduction or placement in a particular fee category; and a denial of a request for expedited treatment. An adverse determination to an administrative appeal by the Chief FOIA Officer will be the final action of the Agency. An adverse determination will inform the requester of the right to seek dispute resolution services from the Agency's FOIA Public Liaison or the Office of Government Information Services, as well as the right to appeal the adverse determination under the administrative appeal provisions of paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Records containing business information.</E> Business information obtained by the Agency from a submitter will be disclosed under the FOIA only consistent with the procedures established in this section.</P>
              <P>(A) For purposes of this section:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) <E T="03">Business information</E> means commercial or financial information obtained by the Agency from a submitter that may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) <E T="03">Submitter</E> means any person or entity from whom the Agency obtains business information, directly or indirectly. The term includes corporations; state, local, and tribal governments; and foreign governments.</P>
              <P>(B) A submitter of business information will use good faith efforts to designate, by appropriate markings, either at the time of submission or at a reasonable time thereafter, any portions of its submission that it considers to be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4. These designations will expire 10 years after the date of the submission unless the submitter requests, and provides justification for, a longer designation period. The Agency will provide a submitter with prompt written notice of a FOIA request or administrative appeal that seeks its business information wherever required under paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(C) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(F) of this section, in order to give the submitter an opportunity to object to disclosure of any specified portion of that information under paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(D) of this section. The notice will either describe the business information requested or include copies of the requested records or record portions containing the information. When notification of a voluminous number of submitters is required, notification may be made by posting or publishing the notice in a place reasonably likely to accomplish notification.</P>
              <P>(C) Notice will be given to a submitter whenever: The information has been designated in good faith by the submitter as information considered protected from disclosure under Exemption 4; or the Agency has reason to believe that the information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4.</P>

              <P>(D) The Agency will allow a submitter a reasonable time to respond to the notice described in paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. If a submitter has any objection to disclosure, it is required to submit a detailed written statement. The statement must specify all grounds for withholding any portion of the information under any exemption of the FOIA and, in the case of Exemption 4, it must show why the <PRTPAGE P="94"/>information is a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential. In the event that a submitter fails to respond to the notice within the time specified in it, the submitter will be considered to have no objection to disclosure of the information. Information provided by a submitter under this paragraph may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.</P>
              <P>(E) The Agency will consider a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure in deciding whether to disclose business information. Whenever the Agency decides to disclose business information over the objection of a submitter, the Agency will give the submitter written notice, which will include: A statement of the reason(s) why each of the submitter's disclosure objections was not sustained; a description of the business information to be disclosed; and a specified disclosure date, which will be a reasonable time subsequent to the notice.</P>
              <P>(F) The notice requirements of paragraphs (c)(2)(iv)(B) and (E) of this section will not apply if: The Agency determines that the information may not be disclosed; the information lawfully has been published or has been officially made available to the public; disclosure of the information is required by statute (other than the FOIA) or by a regulation issued in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12600 (3 CFR, 1988 Comp., p. 235); or the designation made by the submitter under paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(B) of this section appears obviously frivolous—except that, in such a case, the Agency will, within a reasonable time prior to a specified disclosure date, give the submitter written notice of any final decision to disclose the information.</P>
              <P>(G) Whenever a requester files a lawsuit seeking to compel the disclosure of business information, the Agency will promptly notify the submitter.</P>
              <P>(H) Whenever the Agency provides a submitter with notice and an opportunity to object to disclosure under paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(B) of this section, the Agency will also notify the requester(s). Whenever the Agency notifies a submitter of its intent to disclose requested information under paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(E) of this section, the Agency will also notify the requester(s). Whenever a submitter files a lawsuit seeking to prevent the disclosure of business information, the Agency will notify the requester(s).</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Administrative appeals.</E> (A) An appeal from an adverse determination made pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section must be filed within 90 calendar days of the service of the notification of the adverse determination, in whole or in part. Appeals of adverse determinations made by the FOIA Officer or the Office of the Inspector General may be filed with the Division of Legal Counsel in Washington, DC.</P>
              <P>(B) As provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section, an adverse determination will notify the requester of the right to appeal the adverse determination and will specify where such appeal may be filed. Within 20 working days after receipt of an appeal, the Chief FOIA Officer will make a determination with respect to such appeal and will notify the requester in writing. If the determination is to grant the appeal, the responsive records will be made promptly available to the requester upon receipt of payment of any charges due in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d)(2) of this section. If the appeal is denied, in whole or in part, the requester will be notified of the reasons for the decision, the name and title or position of any person responsible for the denial, and the provisions for judicial review of that determination under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. Section 552(4)(B).</P>
              <P>(C) Before seeking judicial review of an adverse determination, a requester must first submit a timely administrative appeal.</P>
              <P>(D) Even if no FOIA appeal is filed, the Chief FOIA Officer may, without regard to the time limit for filing of an appeal, initiate reconsideration of an adverse determination by issuing written notice to the requester. In such event, the time limit for making the determination will commence with the issuance of such notification.</P>
              <P>(vi) <E T="03">Extension of time to respond to requests.</E> In unusual circumstances as specified in this paragraph (c)(2)(vi), the Agency may extend the time limits <PRTPAGE P="95"/>prescribed in either paragraph (c)(2)(i) or (iv) of this section by written notice to the requester setting forth the reasons for such extension and the date on which a determination is expected, and notifying the requester of the right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services. The extension of time will not exceed 10 working days. As used in this paragraph (c)(2)(vi), <E T="03">unusual circumstances</E> means, but only to the extent reasonably necessary to the proper processing of the particular request:</P>
              <P>(A) The need to search for and collect the requested records from other offices in the Agency that are separate from the FOIA Branch;</P>
              <P>(B) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are sought in a single request;</P>
              <P>(C)(<E T="03">1</E>) The need for consultation, which will be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request or with two or more offices in the Agency having a substantial subject matter interest in the request.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) If the request cannot be processed within the time limits prescribed above, the Agency will provide the requester with an opportunity to limit the request so that it may be processed within the 10-day extended time limit for response. The requester may also arrange an alternative time frame with the Agency for processing the request or a modified request. The Agency's FOIA Public Liaison is available to assist with any issues that may arise.</P>
              <P>(vii) <E T="03">Preservation of FOIA request files.</E> The Agency will preserve files created in response to requests for information under the FOIA and files created in responding to administrative appeals under the FOIA until disposition or destruction is authorized by Title 44 of the United States Code or the National Archives and Records Administration's General Records Schedule 4.2, item 020. Records will not be disposed of or destroyed while they are the subject of a pending request, appeal, or lawsuit under the FOIA.</P>
              <P>(d)(1) <E T="03">Fees.</E> For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Direct costs</E> means those expenditures which are actually incurred in searching for and duplicating and, in the case of commercial use requests, reviewing documents to respond to a FOIA request.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Search</E> refers to the process of looking for and retrieving records or information responsive to a request. It includes page-by-page or line-by-line identification of material within documents and also includes reasonable efforts to locate and retrieve information from records maintained in electronic form or format. The Agency will ensure that searches are done in the most efficient and least expensive manner reasonably possible.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Duplication</E> refers to the process of making a copy of a record, or the information contained in it, necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Such copies can take the form of paper, microfilm, videotape, audiotape, or electronic records (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> magnetic tape or disk), among others. The Agency will honor a requester's specified preference of form or format of disclosure if the record is readily reproducible with reasonable efforts in the requested form or format by the office responding to the request.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Review</E> refers to the process of examining documents located in response to a request that is for commercial use to determine whether any portion of it is exempt from disclosure. It includes processing any documents for disclosure, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> doing all that is necessary to redact and prepare them for disclosure. Review time includes time spent considering any formal objection to disclosure made by a business submitter under paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section, but does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Commercial use request</E> refers to a request from or on behalf of a person who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made, which can include furthering those interests through litigation.<PRTPAGE P="96"/>
              </P>
              <P>(vi) <E T="03">Educational institution</E> refers to a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an institution of graduate higher education, an institution of professional education, or an institution of vocational education, that operates a program of scholarly research. To be in this category, a requester must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use but are sought to further scholarly research.</P>
              <P>(vii) <E T="03">Representative of the news media</E> refers to any person actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public. The term <E T="03">news</E> means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large and publishers of periodicals (but only in instances where they can qualify as disseminators of <E T="03">news</E>) who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the general public. For “freelance” journalists to be regarded as working for a news organization, they must demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that organization. A publication contract is the clearest proof, but the Agency will also look to the past publication record of a requester in making this determination. To be in this category, a requester must not be seeking the requested records for commercial use. However, a request for records supporting the news dissemination function of the requester will not be considered to be for a commercial use.</P>
              <P>(viii) <E T="03">Working days,</E> as used in this section, means calendar days excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Fee schedule.</E> Requesters will be subject to a charge of fees for the full allowable direct costs of document search, review, and duplicating, as appropriate, in accordance with the following schedules, procedures, and conditions:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Schedule of charges:</E>
              </P>
              <P>(A) For each one-quarter hour or portion thereof of clerical time $3.10.</P>
              <P>(B) For each one-quarter hour or portion thereof of professional time $9.25.</P>
              <P>(C) For each sheet of duplication (not to exceed 8<FR>1/2</FR> by 14 inches) of requested records $0.12.</P>
              <P>(D) All other direct costs of preparing a response to a request will be charged to the requester in the same amount as incurred by the Agency. Such costs will include, but not be limited to: Certifying that records are true copies; sending records to requesters or receiving records from the Federal records storage centers by special methods such as express mail; and, where applicable, conducting computer searches for information and for providing information in electronic format.</P>
              <P>(ii) Fees incurred in responding to information requests are to be charged in accordance with the following categories of requesters:</P>
              <P>(A) Commercial use requesters will be assessed charges to recover the full direct costs for searching for, reviewing for release, and duplicating the records sought. Requesters must reasonably describe the records sought.</P>
              <P>(B) Educational institution requesters will be assessed charges for the cost of reproduction alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. To be eligible for inclusion in this category, requesters must show that the request is being made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for commercial use, but are sought in furtherance of scholarly research. Requesters must reasonably describe the records sought.</P>
              <P>(C) Requesters who are representatives of the news media will be assessed charges for the cost of reproduction alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. To be eligible for inclusion in this category, a requester must meet the criteria in paragraph (d)(1)(vii) of this section, and the request must not be made for commercial use. In reference to this class of requester, a request for records supporting the news dissemination function of the requester will not be considered to be a request for commercial use. Requesters must reasonably describe the records sought.</P>

              <P>(D) All other requesters, not elsewhere described, will be assessed <PRTPAGE P="97"/>charges to recover the full reasonable direct cost of searching for and reproducing records that are responsive to the request, except that the first 100 pages of reproduction and the first 2 hours of search time will be furnished without charge. Requesters must reasonably describe the records sought.</P>
              <P>(E) Absent a reasonably based factual showing that a requester may be placed in a particular user category, fees will be imposed as provided for in the commercial use requester category.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Unusual fee circumstances.</E> (A) In no event will fees be imposed on any requester when the total charges are less than $5, which is the Agency's cost of collecting and processing the fee itself.</P>
              <P>(B) If the Agency reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requesters acting together is attempting to divide a request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding fees, the Agency may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly. The Agency may presume that multiple requests of this type made within a 30-day period have been made to avoid fees. Where requests are separated by a longer period, the Agency will aggregate them only where there exists a solid basis for determining that aggregation is warranted under all the circumstances involved. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters will not be aggregated.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Requests for fee waiver or reduction.</E> Documents are to be furnished without charge or at reduced levels if disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Disclosure to data brokers or others who merely compile and market government information for direct economic return will not be presumed to primarily serve the public interest. A fee waiver or reduction is justified where the public interest standard is satisfied and that public interest is greater in magnitude than that of any identified commercial interest in disclosure. Where only some of the requested records satisfy the requirements for a fee waiver, a waiver will be granted for those records.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Failure to pay fees.</E> If a requester fails to pay chargeable fees that were incurred as a result of the Agency's processing of the information request, beginning on the 31st day following the date on which the notification of charges was sent, the Agency may assess interest charges against the requester in the manner prescribed in 31 U.S.C. Section 3717. Where appropriate, other steps permitted by federal debt collection statutes, including disclosure to consumer reporting agencies, use of collection agencies, and offset, will be used by the Agency to encourage payment of amounts overdue.</P>
              <P>(vi) <E T="03">Assumption of financial responsibility for processing requests.</E> Each request for records must contain a specific statement assuming financial liability, in full or to a specified maximum amount, for charges, in accordance with paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, which may be incurred by the Agency in responding to the request. If the anticipated charges exceed the maximum limit stated by the person making the request, or if the request contains no assumption of financial liability or charges, the requester will be notified and afforded an opportunity to assume financial liability. In either case, the request for records will not be deemed received for purposes of the applicable time limit for response until a written assumption of financial liability is received. The Agency may require a requester to make an advance payment of anticipated fees under the following circumstances:</P>
              <P>(A) If the anticipated charges are likely to exceed $250, the Agency will notify the requester of the likely cost and obtain satisfactory assurance of full payment when the requester has a history of prompt payment of FOIA fees, or require an advance payment of an amount up to the full estimated charges in the case of requesters with no history of payment.</P>

              <P>(B) If a requester has previously failed to pay fees that have been charged in processing a request within 30 days of the date the notification of fees was sent, the requester will be required to pay the entire amount of fees that are owed, plus interest as provided for in paragraph (d)(2)(v) of this section, before the Agency will process a <PRTPAGE P="98"/>further information request. In addition, the Agency may require advance payment of fees that the Agency estimates will be incurred in processing the further request before the Agency commences processing that request. When the Agency acts under paragraph (d)(2)(vi)(A) or (B) of this section, the administrative time limits for responding to a request or an appeal from initial determinations will begin to run only after the Agency has received the fee payments required in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(vii) <E T="03">Fees may be charged even if no documents are provided.</E> Charges may be imposed even though the search discloses no records responsive to the request, or if records located are determined to be exempt from disclosure.</P>

              <P>(1) If the entire contents of any such statement relate to the subject matter of the testimony of the witness, the Administrative Law Judge must order the statement to be delivered directly to the respondent for examination and use for the purpose of cross-examination.</P>

              <P>(2) If the General Counsel claims that any statement ordered to be produced under this section contains matter which does not relate to the subject matter of the testimony of the witness, the Administrative Law Judge will order the General Counsel to deliver the statement for the inspection of the Administrative Law Judge <E T="03">in camera.</E> Upon delivery, the Administrative Law Judge will excise the portions of such statement which do not relate to the subject matter of the testimony of the witness except that the Administrative Law Judge has discretion to decline to excise portions which, although not relating to the subject matter of the testimony of the witness, do relate to other matters raised by the pleadings. With the material excised, the Administrative Law Judge will then direct delivery of the statement to the Respondent for use on cross-examination. If any portion of the statement is withheld and the Respondent objects to the withholding, the General Counsel will preserve the entire text of the statement, and, if the Respondent files exceptions with the Board based upon such withholding, make the entire text available to the Board for the purpose of determining the correctness of the ruling of the Administrative Law Judge. If the General Counsel elects not to comply with an order of the Administrative Law Judge directing delivery to the Respondent of any statement, or portion thereof as the Administrative Law Judge may direct, the Administrative Law Judge will strike from the record the testimony of the witness.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Privacy Act Regulations: notification as to whether a system of records contains records pertaining to requesting individuals; requests for access to records, amendment of requests; fees for document duplication; files and records exempted from certain Privacy Act requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) An individual will be informed whether a system of records maintained by the Agency contains a record pertaining to such individual. An inquiry may be made in writing or in person during normal business hours to the official of the Agency designated for that purpose and at the address set forth in a notice of a system of records published by this Agency, in a Notice of Systems of Government-wide Personnel Records published by the Office of Personnel Management, or in a Notice of Government-wide Systems of Records published by the Department of Labor. Copies of such notices, and assistance in preparing an inquiry, may be obtained from any Regional Office of the Board or at the Board offices in Washington, DC. The inquiry may contain sufficient information, as defined in the notice, to identify the record.</P>
              <P>(2) Reasonable verification of the identity of the inquirer, as described in paragraph (e) of this section, will be required to assure that information is disclosed to the proper person. The Agency will acknowledge the inquiry in writing within 10 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) and, wherever practicable, the acknowledgment will supply the information requested. If, for good cause shown, the Agency cannot supply the information within 10 days, the inquirer will within that time period be notified in writing of the reasons therefor and when it is anticipated the information will be supplied. An acknowledgment will not be provided when the information is supplied within the 10-day period. If the Agency refuses to inform an individual whether a system of records contains a record pertaining to an individual, the inquirer will be notified in writing of that determination and the reasons therefor, and of the right to obtain review of that determination under the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section. The provisions of this paragraph (a)(2) do not apply to the extent that requested information from the relevant system of records has been exempted from this Privacy Act requirement.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) An individual will be permitted access to records pertaining to such individual contained in any system of records described in the notice of system of records published by the Agency, or access to the accounting of disclosures from such records. The request for access must be made in writing or in person during normal business hours to the person designated for that purpose and at the address set forth in the published notice of system of records. Copies of such notices, and assistance in preparing a request for access, may be obtained from any Regional Office of the Board or at the Board offices in Washington, DC. Reasonable verification of the identity of the requester, as described in paragraph (e) of this section, will be required to assure that records are disclosed to the proper person. A request for access to records or the accounting of disclosures from such records will be acknowledged in writing by the Agency within 10 days of receipt (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) and, wherever practicable, the acknowledgment will inform the requester whether access will be granted and, if so, the time and location at which the records or accounting will be made available. If access to the record of accounting is to be granted, the record or accounting will normally be provided within 30 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) of the request, unless for good cause shown the Agency is unable to do so, in which case the individual will be informed in writing within that 30-day period of the reasons therefor and when it is anticipated that access will be granted. An acknowledgment of a request will not be provided if the record is made available within the 10-day period.</P>

              <P>(2) If an individual's request for access to a record or an accounting of disclosure from such a record under the provisions of this paragraph (b) is denied, the notice informing the individual of the denial will set forth the <PRTPAGE P="101"/>reasons therefor and advise the individual of the right to obtain a review of that determination under the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section. The provisions of this paragraph (b)(2) do not apply to the extent that requested information from the relevant system of records has been exempted from this Privacy Act requirement.</P>
              <P>(c) An individual granted access to records pertaining to such individual contained in a system of records may review all such records. For that purpose, the individual may be accompanied by a person of the individual's choosing, or the record may be released to the individual's representative who has written consent of the individual, as described in paragraph (e) of this section. A first copy of any such record or information will ordinarily be provided without charge to the individual or representative in a form comprehensible to the individual. Fees for any other copies of requested records will be assessed at the rate of 12 cents for each sheet of duplication.</P>
              <P>(d) An individual may request amendment of a record pertaining to such individual in a system of records maintained by the Agency. A request for amendment of a record must be in writing and submitted during normal business hours to the person designated for that purpose and at the address set forth in the published notice for the system of records containing the record of which amendment is sought. Copies of such notices, and assistance in preparing a request for amendment, may be obtained from any Regional Office of the Board or at the Board offices in Washington, DC. The requester must provide verification of identity as described in paragraph (e) of this section, and the request must set forth the specific amendment requested and the reason for the requested amendment. The Agency will acknowledge in writing receipt of the request within 10 days of receipt (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) and, whenever practicable, the acknowledgement will advise the individual of the determination of the request. If the review of the request for amendment cannot be completed and a determination made within 10 days, the review will be completed as soon as possible, normally within 30 days (Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays excluded) of receipt of the request unless unusual circumstances preclude completing the review within that time, in which event the requester will be notified in writing within that 30-day period of the reasons for the delay and when the determination of the request may be expected. If the determination is to amend the record, the requester will be so notified in writing and the record will be amended in accordance with that determination. If any disclosures accountable under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c) have been made, all previous recipients of the record which was amended must be advised of the amendment and its substance. If it is determined that the request may not be granted, the requester will be notified in writing of that determination and of the reasons therefor, and advised of the right to obtain review of the adverse determination under the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section. The provisions of this paragraph (d) do not apply to the extent that requested information from the relevant system of records has been exempted from this Privacy Act requirement.</P>
              <P>(e) Verification of the identification of individuals required under paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this section to assure that records are disclosed to the proper person will be required by the Agency to an extent consistent with the nature, location, and sensitivity of the records being disclosed. Disclosure of a record to an individual will normally be made upon the presentation of acceptable identification. Disclosure of records by mail may be made on the basis of the identifying information set forth in the request. Depending on the nature, location, and sensitivity of the requested record, a signed notarized statement verifying identity may be required by the Agency. Proof of authorization as representative to have access to a record of an individual must be in writing, and a signed notarized statement of such authorization may be required by the Agency if the record requested is of a sensitive nature.</P>
              <P>(f)(1) Review may be obtained with respect to:<PRTPAGE P="102"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) A refusal, under paragraph (a) or (g) of this section, to inform an individual if a system of records contains a record concerning that individual;</P>
              <P>(ii) A refusal, under paragraph (b) or (g) of this section, to grant access to a record or an accounting of disclosure from such a record; or</P>
              <P>(iii) A refusal, under paragraph (d) of this section, to amend a record.</P>
              <P>(iv) The request for review may be made to the Chairman of the Board if the system of records is maintained in the office of a Member of the Board, the Office of the Executive Secretary, the Office of the Solicitor, the Office of Congressional and Public Affairs, or the Division of Administrative Law Judges. Consistent with the provisions of Section 3(d) of the Act, and the delegation of authority from the Board to the General Counsel, the request may be made to the General Counsel if the system of records is maintained by an office of the Agency other than those enumerated above. Either the Chairman of the Board or the General Counsel may designate in writing another officer of the Agency to review the refusal of the request. Such review will be completed within 30 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) from the receipt of the request for review unless the Chairman of the Board or the General Counsel, as the case may be, for good cause shown, extends such 30-day period.</P>
              <P>(2) If, upon review of a refusal under paragraph (a) or (g) of this section, the reviewing officer determines that the individual may be informed of whether a system of records contains a record pertaining to that individual, such information will be promptly provided. If the reviewing officer determines that the information was properly denied, the individual will be so informed in writing with a brief statement of the reasons therefor.</P>
              <P>(3) If, upon review of a refusal under paragraph (b) or (g) of this section, the reviewing officer determines that access to a record or to an accounting of disclosures may be granted, the requester will be so notified and the record or accounting will be promptly made available to the requester. If the reviewing officer determines that the request for access was properly denied, the individual will be so informed in writing with a brief statement of the reasons therefor, and of the right to judicial review of that determination under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(g)(1)(B).</P>
              <P>(4) If, upon review of a refusal under paragraph (i) of this section, the reviewing official grants a request to amend, the requester will be so notified, the record will be amended in accordance with the determination, and, if any disclosures accountable under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c) have been made, all previous recipients of the record which was amended will be advised of the amendment and its substance. If the reviewing officer determines that the denial of a request for amendment may be sustained, the Agency will advise the requester of the determination and the reasons therefor, and that the individual may file with the Agency a concise statement of the reason for disagreeing with the determination, and may seek judicial review of the Agency's denial of the request to amend the record. In the event a statement of disagreement is filed, that statement:</P>
              <P>(i) Will be made available to anyone to whom the record is subsequently disclosed together with, at the discretion of the Agency, a brief statement summarizing the Agency's reasons for declining to amend the record; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Will be supplied, together with any Agency statements, to any prior recipients of the disputed record to the extent that an accounting of disclosure was made.</P>

              <P>(g) To the extent that portions of systems of records described in notices of Government-wide systems of records published by the Office of Personnel Management are identified by those notices as being subject to the management of an officer of this Agency, or an officer of the Agency is designated as the official to contact for information, access, or contents of those records, individual requests for access to those records, requests for their amendment, and review of denials of requests for amendment will be in accordance with the provisions of 5 CFR 297.101 through 297.501, as promulgated by the Office of Personnel Management. To the extent <PRTPAGE P="103"/>that portions of systems of records described in notices of Government-wide systems of records published by the Department of Labor are identified by those notices as being subject to the management of an officer of the Agency, or an officer of the Agency is designated as the official to contact for information, access, or contents of those records, individual requests for access to those records, requests for their amendment, and review of denials of requests for amendment will be in accordance with the provisions of this section. Review of a refusal to inform an individual whether such a system of records contains a record pertaining to that individual and review of a refusal to grant an individual's request for access to a record in such a system may be obtained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
              <P>(h) Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), the system of records maintained by the Office of the Inspector General of the National Labor Relations Board that contains Investigative Files will be exempted from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a, except subsections (b), (c)(1) and (2), (e)(4)(A) through (F), (e)(6), (7), (9), (10), and (11), and (i), from 29 CFR 102.117(c) and (d), and from 29 CFR 102.119(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), and (f), insofar as the system contains investigatory material compiled for criminal law enforcement purposes.</P>
              <P>(i) Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), the system of records maintained by the Office of the Inspector General of the National Labor Relations Board that contains the Investigative Files must be exempted from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), and (f), from 29 CFR 102.117(c) and (d), and from 29 CFR 102.119(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), and (f), insofar as the system contains investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes not within the scope of the exemption at 29 CFR 102.119(h).</P>
              <P>(j) Privacy Act exemptions contained in paragraphs (h) and (i) of this section are justified for the following reasons:</P>
              <P>(1) 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) requires an agency to make the accounting of each disclosure of records available to the individual named in the record at that individual's request. These accountings must state the date, nature, and purpose of each disclosure of a record and the name and address of the recipient. Accounting for each disclosure would alert the subjects of an investigation to the existence of the investigation and the fact that they are subjects of the investigation. The release of such information to the subjects of an investigation would provide them with significant information concerning the nature of the investigation and could seriously impede or compromise the investigation, endanger the physical safety of confidential sources, witnesses, law enforcement personnel, and their families and lead to the improper influencing of witnesses, the destruction of evidence, or the fabrication of testimony.</P>
              <P>(2) 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(4) requires an agency to inform any person or other agency about any correction or notation of dispute made by the agency in accordance with subsection (d) of the Act. Since this system of records is being exempted from subsection (d) of the Act, concerning access to records, this section is inapplicable to the extent that this system of records will be exempted from subsection (d) of the Act.</P>

              <P>(3) 5 U.S.C. 552a(d) requires an agency to permit an individual to gain access to records pertaining to the individual, to request amendment to such records, to request a review of an agency decision not to amend such records, and to contest the information contained in such records. Granting access to records in this system of records could inform the subject of an investigation of an actual or potential criminal violation, of the existence of that investigation, of the nature and scope of the information and evidence obtained as to the individual's activities, or of the identity of confidential sources, witnesses, and law enforcement personnel and could provide information to enable the subject to avoid detection or apprehension. Granting access to such information could seriously impede or compromise an investigation, endanger the physical safety of confidential sources, witnesses, law enforcement personnel, and their families, lead to the improper influencing of witnesses, <PRTPAGE P="104"/>the destruction of evidence, or the fabrication of testimony, and disclose investigative techniques and procedures. In addition, granting access to such information could disclose classified, security-sensitive, or confidential business information and could constitute an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of others.</P>
              <P>(4) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1) requires each agency to maintain in its records only such information about an individual as is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the agency required by statute or by executive order of the President. The application of this provision could impair investigations and law enforcement because it is not always possible to detect the relevance or necessity of specific information in the early stages of an investigation. Relevance and necessity are often questions of judgment and timing, and it is only after the information is evaluated that the relevance and necessity of such information can be established. In addition, during the course of the investigation, the investigator may obtain information which is incidental to the main purpose of the investigative jurisdiction of another agency. Such information cannot readily be segregated. Furthermore, during the course of the investigation, the investigator may obtain information concerning the violation of laws other than those which are within scope of the investigator's jurisdiction. In the interest of effective law enforcement, OIG investigators may retain this information, since it can aid in establishing patterns of criminal activity and can provide valuable leads for other law enforcement agencies.</P>
              <P>(5) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(2) requires an agency to collect information to the greatest extent practicable directly from the subject individual when the information may result in adverse determinations about an individual's rights, benefits, and privileges under Federal programs. The application of this provision could impair investigations and law enforcement by alerting the subject of an investigation, thereby enabling the subject to avoid detection or apprehension, to influence witnesses improperly, to destroy evidence, or to fabricate testimony. Moreover, in certain circumstances, the subject of an investigation cannot be required to provide information to investigators and information must be collected from other sources. Furthermore, it is often necessary to collect information from sources other than the subject of the investigation to verify the accuracy of the evidence collected.</P>
              <P>(6) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(3) requires an agency to inform each person whom it asks to supply information, on a form that can be retained by the person, of the authority under which the information is sought and whether disclosure is mandatory or voluntary; of the principal purposes for which the information is intended to be used; of the routine uses which may be made of the information; and of the effects on the person, if any, of not providing all or any part of the requested information. The application of this provision could provide the subject of an investigation with substantial information about the nature of that investigation that could interfere with the investigation. Moreover, providing such a notice to the subject of an investigation could seriously impede or compromise an undercover investigation by revealing its existence and could endanger the physical safety of confidential sources, witnesses, and investigators by revealing their identities.</P>

              <P>(7) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(G) and (H) require an agency to publish a <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice concerning its procedures for notifying an individual, at the individual's request, if the system of records contains a record pertaining to the individual, how to gain access to such a record, and how to contest its content. Since this system of records is being exempted from subsection (f) of the Act, concerning agency rules, and subsection (d) of the Act, concerning access to records, these requirements are inapplicable to the extent that this system of records will be exempt from subsections (f) and (d) of the Act. Although the system would be exempt from these requirements, OIG has published information concerning its notification, access, and contest procedures because, under certain circumstances, OIG could decide it is appropriate for an individual to have access to all or a <PRTPAGE P="105"/>portion of the individual's records in this system of records.</P>

              <P>(8) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(I) requires an agency to publish a <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice concerning the categories of sources of records in the system of records. Exemption from this provision is necessary to protect the confidentiality of the sources of information, to protect the privacy and physical safety of confidential sources and witnesses, and to avoid the disclosure of investigative techniques and procedures. Although the system will be exempt from this requirement, OIG has published such a notice in broad generic terms.</P>

              <P>(9) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(5) requires an agency to maintain its records with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness as is reasonably necessary to assure fairness to the individual in making any determination about the individual. Since the Act defines <E T="03">maintain</E> to include the collection of information, complying with this provision could prevent the collection of any data not shown to be accurate, relevant, timely, and complete at the moment it is collected. In collecting information for criminal law enforcement purposes, it is not possible to determine in advance what information is accurate, relevant, timely, and complete. Facts are first gathered and then placed into a logical order to prove or disprove objectively the criminal behavior of an individual. Material which seems unrelated, irrelevant, or incomplete when collected can take on added meaning or significance as the investigation progresses. The restrictions of this provision could interfere with the preparation of a complete investigative report, thereby impeding effective law enforcement.</P>
              <P>(10) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(8) requires an agency to make reasonable efforts to serve notice on an individual when any record on such individual is made available to any person under compulsory legal process when such process becomes a matter of public record. Complying with this provision could prematurely reveal an ongoing criminal investigation to the subject of the investigation.</P>
              <P>(11) 5 U.S.C. 552a(f)(1) requires an agency to promulgate rules that establish procedures whereby an individual can be notified in response to the individual's request if any system of records named by the individual contains a record pertaining to the individual. The application of this provision could impede or compromise an investigation or prosecution if the subject of an investigation were able to use such rules to learn of the existence of an investigation before it could be completed. In addition, mere notice of the fact of an investigation could inform the subject and others that their activities are under or may become the subject of an investigation and could enable the subjects to avoid detection or apprehension, to influence witnesses improperly, to destroy evidence, or to fabricate testimony. Since this system would be exempt from subsection (d) of the Act, concerning access to records, the requirements of subsection (f)(2) through (5) of the Act, concerning agency rules for obtaining access to such records, are inapplicable to the extent that this system of records will be exempted from subsection (d) of the Act. Although this system would be exempt from the requirements of subsection (f) of the Act, OIG has promulgated rules which establish agency procedures because, under certain circumstances, it could be appropriate for an individual to have access to all or a portion of the individual's records in this system of records.</P>
              <P>(12) 5 U.S.C. 552a(g) provides for civil remedies if an agency fails to comply with the requirements concerning access to records under subsections (d)(1) and (3) of the Act; maintenance of records under subsection (e)(5) of the Act; and any other provision of the Act, or any rule promulgated thereunder, in such a way as to have an adverse effect on an individual. Since this system of records would be exempt from subsections (c) (3) and (4), (d), (e)(1), (2), and (3) and (4)(G) through (I), (e)(5), and (8), and (f) of the Act, the provisions of subsection (g) of the Act would be inapplicable to the extent that this system of records will be exempted from those subsections of the Act.</P>

              <P>(k) Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), the system of records maintained by <PRTPAGE P="106"/>the NLRB containing Agency Disciplinary Case Files (Nonemployees) are exempt from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4) (G), (H), and (I), and (f) insofar as the system contains investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes other than material within the scope of 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2).</P>
              <P>(l) The Privacy Act exemption set forth in paragraph (k) of this section is claimed on the ground that the requirements of subsections (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4) (G), (H), and (I), and (f) of the Privacy Act, if applied to Agency Disciplinary Case Files, would seriously impair the ability of the NLRB to conduct investigations of alleged or suspected violations of the NLRB's misconduct rules, as set forth in paragraphs (j)(1), (3), (4), (7), (8), and (11) of this section.</P>
              <P>(m) Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes that is contained in the Next Generation Case Management System (NxGen) (NLRB-33), are exempt from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (e)(4)(H), (e)(4)(I), and (f). This information was formerly contained within the following legacy systems, which remain accessible and which also are exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) The following three legacy systems of records are exempt in their entirety from provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (e)(4)(H), (e)(4)(I), and (f), because the systems contain investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes, other than material within the scope of 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2): Case Activity Tracking System (CATS) and Associated Regional Office Files (NLRB-25), Regional Advice and Injunction Litigation System (RAILS) and Associated Headquarters Files (NLRB-28), and Appeals Case Tracking System (ACTS) and Associated Headquarters Files (NLRB-30).</P>
              <P>(2) Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), limited categories of information from the following four systems of records are exempt from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (e)(4)(H), (e)(4)(I), and (f), insofar as the systems contain investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes, other than material within the scope of 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2):</P>
              <P>(i) The legacy Judicial Case Management Systems-Pending Case List (JCMS-PCL) and Associated Headquarters Files (NLRB-21)—information relating to requests to file injunctions under 29 U.S.C. 160(j), requests to initiate federal court contempt proceedings, certain requests that the Board initiate litigation or intervene in non-Agency litigation, and any other investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes;</P>
              <P>(ii) The legacy Solicitor's System (SOL) and Associated Headquarters Files (NLRB-23)—information relating to requests to file injunctions under 29 U.S.C. 160(j), requests to initiate federal court contempt proceedings, certain requests that the Board initiate litigation or intervene in non-Agency litigation, and any other investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes;</P>
              <P>(iii) The legacy Special Litigation Case Tracking System (SPLIT) and Associated Headquarters Files (NLRB-27)—information relating to investigative subpoena enforcement cases, injunction and mandamus actions regarding Agency cases under investigation, bankruptcy case information in matters under investigation, Freedom of Information Act cases involving investigatory records, certain requests that the Board initiate litigation or intervene in non-Agency litigation, and any other investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes; and</P>
              <P>(iv) The Freedom of Information Act Tracking System (FTS) and Associated Agency Files (NLRB-32)—information requested under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, that relates to the Agency's investigation of unfair labor practice and representation cases or other proceedings described in paragraphs (m)(1) and (2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(n) The reasons for exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) are as follows:</P>

              <P>(1) 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) requires an agency to make the accounting of each disclosure of records available to the individual named in the record at such individual's request. These accountings must state the date, nature, and purpose of each disclosure of a record, and the name and address of the recipient. <PRTPAGE P="107"/>Providing such an accounting of investigatory information to a party in an unfair labor practice or representation matter under investigation could inform that individual of the precise scope of an Agency investigation, or the existence or scope of another law enforcement investigation. Accordingly, this Privacy Act requirement could seriously impede or compromise either the Agency's investigation, or another law enforcement investigation, by causing the improper influencing of witnesses, retaliation against witnesses, destruction of evidence, or fabrication of testimony.</P>
              <P>(2) 5 U.S.C. 552a(d) requires an agency to permit an individual to gain access to records pertaining to such individual, to request amendment to such records, to request review of an agency decision not to amend such records, and, where the Agency refuses to amend records, to submit a statement of disagreement to be included with the records. Such disclosure of investigatory information could seriously impede or compromise the Agency's investigation by revealing the identity of confidential sources or confidential business information, or causing the improper influencing of witnesses, retaliation against witnesses, destruction of evidence, fabrication of testimony, or unwarranted invasion of the privacy of others. Amendment of the records could interfere with ongoing law enforcement proceedings and impose an undue administrative burden by requiring investigations to be continuously reinvestigated.</P>
              <P>(3) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1) requires an agency to maintain in its records only such information about an individual as is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the agency required by statute or by executive order of the President. This requirement could foreclose investigators from acquiring or receiving information the relevance and necessity of which is not readily apparent and could only be ascertained after a complete review and evaluation of all the evidence.</P>

              <P>(4) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(G) and (H) require an agency to publish a <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice concerning its procedures for notifying an individual, at the individual's request, if the system of records contains a record pertaining to the individual, for gaining access to such a record, and for contesting its content. Because certain information from these systems of records is exempt from subsection (d) of the Act concerning access to records, and consequently, from subsection (f) of the Act concerning Agency rules governing access, these requirements are inapplicable to that information.</P>

              <P>(5) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(I) requires an agency to publish a <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice concerning the categories of sources of records in the system of records. Exemption from this provision is necessary to protect the confidentiality of sources of information, to protect against the disclosure of investigative techniques and procedures, to avoid threats or reprisals against informers by subjects of investigations, and to protect against informers refusing to give full information to investigators for fear of having their identities as sources revealed.</P>
              <P>(6) 5 U.S.C. 552a(f) requires an agency to promulgate rules for notifying individuals of Privacy Act rights granted by subsection (d) of the Act concerning access and amendment of records. Because certain information from these systems is exempt from subsection (d) of the Act, the requirements of subsection (f) of the Act are inapplicable to that information.</P>

              <P>(a) Any Board agent of the categories defined in § 102.128 to whom a prohibited oral <E T="03">ex parte</E> communication is attempted to be made shall refuse to listen to the communication, inform the communicator of this rule, and advise <PRTPAGE P="110"/>the communicator that anything may be said in writing with copies to all parties. Any Board agent who receives, or who makes or knowingly causes to be made, an unauthorized <E T="03">ex parte</E> communication will place or cause to be placed on the public record of the proceeding:</P>
              <P>(1) The communication, if it was written;</P>
              <P>(2) A memorandum stating the substance of the communication, if it was oral;</P>
              <P>(3) All written responses to the prohibited communication; and</P>
              <P>(4) Memoranda stating the substance of all oral responses to the prohibited communication.</P>
              <P>(b) The Executive Secretary, if the proceeding is then pending before the Board, the Administrative Law Judge, if the proceeding is then pending before any such judge, or the Regional Director, if the proceeding is then pending before a Hearing Officer or the Regional Director, will serve copies of all such materials placed on the public record of the proceeding on all other parties to the proceeding and on the attorneys of record for the parties. Within 14 days after service of such copies, any party may file with the Executive Secretary, Administrative Law Judge, or Regional Director serving the communication, and serve on all other parties, a statement setting forth facts or contentions to rebut those contained in the prohibited communication. All such responses will be placed in the public record of the proceeding, and provision may be made for any further action, including reopening of the record which may be required under the circumstances. No action taken pursuant to this provision will constitute a waiver of the power of the Board to impose an appropriate penalty under § 102.133.</P>

              <P>(a) Where the nature and circumstances of a prohibited communication made by or caused to be made by a party to the proceeding are such that the interests of justice and statutory policy may require remedial action, the Board, the Administrative Law Judge, or the Regional Director, as the case may be, may issue to the party making the communication a Notice to Show Cause, returnable before the Board within a stated period not less than 7 days from the date of issuance, why the Board may not determine that the interests of justice and statutory policy require that the claim or interest in the proceeding of a party who knowingly makes a prohibited communication, or knowingly causes a prohibited communication to be made may be dismissed, denied, disregarded, or otherwise adversely affected on account of such violation.</P>

              <P>(b) Upon notice and hearing, the Board may censure, suspend, or revoke the privilege of practice before the Agency of any person who knowingly and willfully makes or solicits the making of a prohibited <E T="03">ex parte</E> communication. However, before the Board institutes formal proceedings under this paragraph (b), it will first advise the person or persons concerned in writing that it proposes to take such action and that they may show cause, within a period to be stated in such written advice, but not less than 7 days from the date thereof, why it may not take such action.</P>
              <P>(c) The Board may censure, or, to the extent permitted by law, suspend, dismiss, or institute proceedings for the dismissal of, any Board agent who knowingly and willfully violates the prohibitions and requirements of this rule.</P>

              <P>(a) Except where the Board determines that the public interest requires otherwise, meetings, or portions thereof, will not be open to public observation where the deliberations concern the issuance of a subpoena, the Board's participation in a civil action or proceeding or an arbitration, or the initiation, conduct, or disposition by the Board of particular representation or unfair labor practice proceedings under Section 8, 9, or 10 of the Act, or any court proceedings collateral or ancillary thereto.</P>
              <P>(b) Meetings, or portions thereof, may also be closed by the Board, except where it determines that the public interest requires otherwise, when the deliberations concern matters or information falling within the reasons for closing meetings specified in 5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(1) (secret matters concerning national defense or foreign policy); (c)(2) (internal personnel rules and practices); (c)(3) (matters specifically exempted from disclosure by statute); (c)(4) (privileged or confidential trade secrets and commercial or financial information); (c)(5) (matters of alleged criminal conduct or formal censure); (c)(6) (personal information where disclosure would cause a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy); (c)(7) (certain materials or information from investigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes); or (c)(9)(B) (disclosure would significantly frustrate implementation of a proposed Agency action).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Action necessary to close meeting; record of votes.</SUBJECT>
              <P>A meeting will be closed to public observation under § 102.139, only when a majority of the Board Members who will participate in the meeting vote to take such action.</P>

              <P>(a) When the meeting deliberations concern matters specified in § 102.139(a), <PRTPAGE P="112"/>the Board Members will vote at the beginning of the meeting, or portion of the meeting, on whether to close such meeting, or portion of the meeting, to public observation, and on whether the public interest requires that a meeting which may properly be closed may nevertheless be open to public observation. A record of such vote, reflecting the vote of each Board Member, will be kept and made available to the public at the earliest practicable time.</P>
              <P>(b) When the meeting deliberations concern matters specified in § 102.139(b), the Board will vote on whether to close such meeting, or portion of the meeting, to public observation, and on whether there is a public interest which requires that a meeting which may properly be closed may nevertheless be open to public observation. The vote will be taken at a time sufficient to permit inclusion of information concerning the open or closed status of the meeting in the public announcement of the vote. A single vote may be taken with respect to a series of meetings at which the deliberations will concern the same particular matters where such subsequent meetings are scheduled to be held within 30 days after the initial meeting. A record of such vote, reflecting the vote of each Board Member, will be kept and made available to the public within one day after the vote is taken.</P>
              <P>(c) Whenever any person whose interests may be directly affected by deliberations during a meeting, or a portion of a meeting, requests that the Board close the meeting, or a portion of the meeting, to public observation for any of the reasons specified in 5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(5) (matters of alleged criminal conduct or formal censure), (c)(6) (personal information where disclosure would cause a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy), or (c)(7) (certain materials or information from investigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes), the Board Members participating in the meeting, upon request of any one of its Members, will vote on whether to close such meeting, or a portion of the meeting, for that reason. A record of such vote, reflecting the vote of each Board Member participating in the meeting will be kept and made available to the public within 1 day after the vote is taken.</P>
              <P>(d) After public announcement of a meeting as provided in § 102.141, a meeting, or portion of a meeting, announced as closed may be opened, or a meeting, or portion of a meeting, announced as open may be closed, only if a majority of the Board Members who will participate in the meeting determine by a recorded vote that Board business so requires and that an earlier announcement of the change was not possible. The change made and the vote of each Board Member on the change will be announced publicly at the earliest practicable time.</P>
              <P>(e) Before a meeting may be closed pursuant to § 102.139, the Solicitor of the Board will certify that in the Solicitor's opinion the meeting may properly be closed to public observation. The certification will set forth each applicable exemptive provision for such closing. Such certification will be retained by the Agency and made publicly available as soon as practicable.</P>

              <P>(a) A public announcement setting forth the time, place, and subject matter of meetings or portions of meetings closed to public observation pursuant to the provisions of § 102.139(a) will be made at the earliest practicable time.</P>

              <P>(b) Except for meetings closed to public observation pursuant to the provisions of § 102.139(a), the Agency will publicly announce each meeting to be held at least 7 days before the scheduled date of the meeting. The announcement will specify the time, place, and subject matter of the meeting, whether it is to be open to public observation or closed, and the name, address, and phone number of an Agency official designated to respond to requests for information about the meeting. The 7-day period for advance notice may be shortened only upon a determination by a majority of the Board Members who will participate in the meeting that Agency business requires that such meeting be called at an earlier date, in which event the public announcements will be made at the earliest practicable time. A record of the <PRTPAGE P="113"/>vote to schedule a meeting at an earlier date will be kept and made available to the public.</P>
              <P>(c) Within 1 day after the vote to close a meeting, or any portion of a meeting, pursuant to the provisions of § 102.139(b), the Agency will make publicly available a full written explanation of its action closing the meeting, or portion of a meeting, together with a list of all persons expected to attend the meeting and their affiliation.</P>
              <P>(d) If after public announcement required by paragraph (b) of this section has been made, the time and place of the meeting are changed, a public announcement will be made at the earliest practicable time. The subject matter of the meeting may be changed after the public announcement only if a majority of the Members of the Board who will participate in the meeting determine that Agency business so requires and that no earlier announcement of the change was possible. When such a change in subject matter is approved a public announcement of the change will be made at the earliest practicable time. A record of the vote to change the subject matter of the meeting will be kept and made available to the public.</P>

              <P>(a) For every meeting or portion of a meeting closed under the provisions of § 102.139, the presiding officer will prepare a statement setting forth the time and place of the meeting and the persons present, which statement will be retained by the Agency. For each such meeting or portion of a meeting there will also be maintained a complete transcript or electronic recording of the proceedings, except that for meetings closed pursuant to § 102.139(a) the Board may, in lieu of a transcript or electronic recording, maintain a set of minutes fully and accurately summarizing any action taken, the reasons for taking the action, and views on the action taken, documents considered, and the Board Members' vote on each roll call vote.</P>
              <P>(b) The Agency will promptly make available to the public copies of transcripts, recordings, or minutes maintained as provided in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, except to the extent the items contain information which the Agency determines may be withheld pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552(c). Copies of transcripts or minutes, or transcriptions of electronic recordings including the identification of speakers, will, to the extent determined to be publicly available, be furnished to any person, subject to the payment of duplication costs in accordance with the schedule of fees set forth in § 102.117(c)(2)(iv), and the actual cost of transcription.</P>
              <P>(c) The Agency will maintain a complete verbatim copy of the transcript, a complete electronic recording, or a complete set of the minutes for each meeting or portion of a meeting closed to the public, for a period of at least one year after the close of the Agency proceeding of which the meeting was a part, but in no event for a period of less than 2 years after such meeting.</P>

              <P>(a) The term <E T="03">adversary adjudication,</E> as used in this subpart, means unfair labor practice proceedings pending before the Board on a complaint and backpay proceedings under §§ 102.52 through 102.59 pending before the Board on a Notice of Hearing at any time after October 1, 1984.<PRTPAGE P="114"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) A Respondent in an adversary adjudication who prevails in that proceeding, or in a significant and discrete substantive portion of that proceeding, and who otherwise meets the eligibility requirements of this section, is eligible to apply for an award of fees and other expenses allowable under the provisions of § 102.145.</P>
              <P>(c) Applicants eligible to receive an award are as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) An individual with a net worth of not more than $2 million;</P>
              <P>(2) A sole owner of an unincorporated business who has a net worth of not more than $7 million, including both personal and business interests, and not more than 500 employees;</P>
              <P>(3) A charitable or other tax-exempt organization described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) with not more than 500 employees;</P>
              <P>(4) A cooperative association as defined in Section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)) with not more than 500 employees; and</P>
              <P>(5) Any other partnership, corporation, association, unit of local government, or public or private organization with a net worth of not more than $7 million and not more than 500 employees.</P>
              <P>(d) For the purpose of eligibility, the net worth and number of employees of an applicant will be determined as of the date of the complaint in an unfair labor practice proceeding or the date of the Notice of Hearing in a backpay proceeding.</P>
              <P>(e) An applicant who owns an unincorporated business will be considered as an “individual” rather than a “sole owner of unincorporated business” if the issues on which the applicant prevails are related primarily to personal interests rather than to business interests.</P>
              <P>(f) The employees of an applicant include all persons who regularly perform services for remuneration for the applicant, under the applicant's direction and control. Part-time employees shall be included on a proportional basis.</P>
              <P>(g) The net worth and number of employees of the applicant and all of its affiliates will be aggregated to determine eligibility. Any individual, corporation, or other entity that directly or indirectly controls or owns a majority of the voting shares or other interest of the applicant, or any corporation or other entity of which the applicant directly or indirectly owns or controls a majority of the voting shares or other interest, will be considered an affiliate for purposes of this part, unless such treatment would be unjust and contrary to the purposes of the Equal Access to Justice Act (94 Stat. 2325) in light of the actual relationship between the affiliated entities. In addition, financial relationships of the applicant other than those described in this paragraph may constitute special circumstances that would make an award unjust.</P>
              <P>(h) An applicant that participates in an adversary adjudication primarily on behalf of one or more other persons or entities that would be ineligible is not itself eligible for an award.</P>

The burden of proof that an award should not be made to an eligible applicant is on the General Counsel, who may avoid an award by showing that the General Counsel's position in the proceeding was substantially justified.</P>

              <P>(a) Awards will be based on rates customarily charged by persons engaged in the business of acting as attorneys, agents and expert witnesses, even if the <PRTPAGE P="115"/>services were made available without charge or at a reduced rate to the applicant.</P>
              <P>(b) No award for the attorney or agent fees under these Rules may exceed $75 per hour. However, an award may also include the reasonable expenses of the attorney, agent, or witness as a separate item, if the attorney, agent, or expert witness ordinarily charges clients separately for such expenses.</P>
              <P>(c) In determining the reasonableness of the fee sought for an attorney, agent, or expert witness, the following matters will be considered:</P>
              <P>(1) If the attorney, agent, or expert witness is in practice, that person's customary fee for similar services, or, if an employee of the applicant, the fully allocated cost of the services;</P>
              <P>(2) The prevailing rate for similar services in the community in which the attorney, agent, or expert witness ordinarily performs services;</P>
              <P>(3) The time actually spent in the representation of the applicant; and</P>
              <P>(4) The time reasonably spent in light of the difficulty or complexity of the issues in the adversary adjudicative proceeding.</P>
              <P>(d) The reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test, project or similar matter prepared on behalf of an applicant may be awarded, to the extent that the charge for the service does not exceed the prevailing rate for similar services, and the study or other matter was necessary for preparation of the applicant's case.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Contents of application; net worth exhibit; documentation of fees and expenses.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) An application for an award of fees and expenses under the Act must identify the applicant and the adversary adjudication for which an award is sought. The application must state the particulars in which the applicant has prevailed and identify the positions of the General Counsel in that proceeding that the applicant alleges were not substantially justified. Unless the applicant is an individual, the application must also state the number, category, and work location of employees of the applicant and its affiliates and describe briefly the type and purpose of its organization or business.</P>
              <P>(b) The application must include a statement that the applicant's net worth does not exceed $2 million (if an individual) or $7 million (for all other applicants, including their affiliates). However, an applicant may omit this statement if:</P>
              <P>(1) It attaches a copy of a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service that it qualifies as an organization described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) or, in the case of a tax-exempt organization not required to obtain a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service on its exempt status, a statement that describes the basis for the applicant's belief that it qualifies under such Section; or</P>
              <P>(2) It states that it is a cooperative association as defined in Section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)).</P>
              <P>(c) The application must state the amount of fees and expenses for which an award is sought.</P>
              <P>(d) The application may also include any other matters that the applicant wishes this Agency to consider in determining whether and in what amount an award should be made.</P>
              <P>(e) The application must be signed by the applicant or an authorized officer or attorney of the applicant. It must also contain or be accompanied by a written verification under oath or under penalty of perjury that the information provided in the application is true.</P>

              <P>(f) Each applicant, except a qualified tax-exempt organization or cooperative <PRTPAGE P="116"/>association, must provide with its application a detailed exhibit showing the net worth of the applicant and any affiliates (as defined in § 102.143(g)) when the adversary adjudicative proceeding was initiated. The exhibit may be in any form convenient to the applicant that provides full disclosure of the applicant's and its affiliates' assets and liabilities and is sufficient to determine whether the applicant qualifies under the standards in this part. The Administrative Law Judge may require an applicant to file such additional information as may be required to determine its eligibility for an award.</P>

              <P>(g)(1) Unless otherwise directed by the Administrative Law Judge, the net worth exhibit will be included in the public record of the fee application proceeding. An applicant that objects to public disclosure of information in any portion of the exhibit may submit that portion of the exhibit in a sealed envelope labeled <E T="03">Confidential Financial Information,</E> accompanied by a motion to withhold the information from public disclosure. The motion must describe the information sought to be withheld and explain, in detail, why public disclosure of the information would adversely affect the applicant and why disclosure is not required in the public interest. The exhibit must be served on the General Counsel but need not be served on any other party to the proceeding. If the Administrative Law Judge finds that the information may not be withheld from disclosure, it will be placed in the public record of the proceeding.</P>
              <P>(2) If the Administrative Law Judge grants the motion to withhold from public disclosure, the exhibit will remain sealed, except to the extent that its contents are required to be disclosed at a hearing. The granting of the motion to withhold from public disclosure will not determine the availability of the document under the Freedom of Information Act in response to a request made under the provisions of § 102.117. Notwithstanding that the exhibit may be withheld from public disclosure, the General Counsel may disclose information from the exhibit to others if required in the course of an investigation to verify the claim of eligibility.</P>
              <P>(h) The application must be accompanied by full documentation of the fees and expenses for which an award is sought. A separate itemized statement must be submitted for each professional firm or individual whose services are covered by the application, showing the dates and the hours spent in connection with the proceeding by each individual, a description of the specific services performed, the rate at which each fee has been computed, any expenses for which reimbursement is sought, the total amount claimed, and the total amount paid or payable by the applicant or by any other person or entity for the services provided. The Administrative Law Judge may require the applicant to provide vouchers, receipts, or other substantiation for any expenses claimed.</P>

              <P>(a) An application may be filed after entry of the final order establishing that the applicant has prevailed in an adversary adjudication proceeding or in a significant and discrete substantive portion of that proceeding, but in no case later than 30 days after the entry of the Board's final order in that proceeding. The application for an award must be filed with the Board in Washington, DC, together with a certificate of service. The application must be served on the Regional Director and on all parties to the adversary adjudication in the same manner as other pleadings in that proceeding, except as provided in § 102.147(g)(1) for financial information alleged to be confidential.</P>

              <P>(b) Upon filing, the application will be referred by the Board to the Administrative Law Judge who heard the adversary adjudication upon which the application is based, or, in the event that proceeding had not previously been heard by an Administrative Law Judge, it will be referred to the Chief Administrative Law Judge for designation of an Administrative Law Judge, in accordance with § 102.34, to consider <PRTPAGE P="117"/>the application. When the Administrative Law Judge to whom the application has been referred is or becomes unavailable, the provisions of §§ 102.34 and 102.36 will apply.</P>
              <P>(c) Proceedings for the award of fees, but not the time limit of this section for filing an application for an award, will be stayed pending final disposition of the adversary adjudication in the event any person seeks reconsideration or review of the decision in that proceeding.</P>
              <P>(d) For purposes of this section the withdrawal of a complaint by a Regional Director under § 102.18 will be treated as a final order, and an appeal under § 102.19 will be treated as a request for reconsideration of that final order.</P>

              <P>(a) Within 35 days after service of an application, the General Counsel may file an answer to the application. Unless the General Counsel requests an extension of time for filing or files a statement of intent to negotiate under paragraph (b) of this section, failure to file a timely answer may be treated as a consent to the award requested. The filing of a motion to dismiss the application will stay the time for filing an answer to a date 35 days after issuance of any order denying the motion. Within 21 days after service of any motion to dismiss, the applicant may file a response. Review of an order granting a motion to dismiss an application in its entirety may be obtained by filing a request with the Board in Washington, DC, pursuant to § 102.27.</P>
              <P>(b) If the General Counsel and the applicant believe that the issues in the fee application can be settled, they may jointly file a statement of their intent to negotiate toward a settlement. The filing of such a statement will extend the time for filing an answer for an additional 35 days.</P>
              <P>(c) The answer must explain in detail any objections to the award requested and identify the facts relied on in support of the General Counsel's position. If the answer is based on alleged facts not already in the record of the adversary adjudication, supporting affidavits must be provided or a request made for further proceedings under § 102.152.</P>
              <P>(d) Within 21 days after service of an answer, the applicant may file a reply. If the reply is based on alleged facts not already in the record of the adversary adjudication, supporting affidavits must be provided or a request made for further proceedings under § 102.152.</P>
              <P>(e) Any party to an adversary adjudication other than the applicant and the General Counsel may file comments on a fee application within 35 days after it is served and on an answer within 21 days after it is served. A commenting party may not participate further in the fee application proceeding unless the Administrative Law Judge determines that such participation is required in order to permit full exploration of matters raised in the comments.</P>

              <P>(a) The term <E T="03">administrative offset</E> means the withholding of money payable by the United States to, or held by the United States on behalf of, a person to satisfy a debt owed the United States by that person.</P>
              <P>(b) The term <E T="03">debtor</E> is any person against whom the Board has a claim.</P>
              <P>(c) The term <E T="03">person</E> does not include any agency of the United States, or any state or local government.</P>
              <P>(d) The terms <E T="03">claim</E> and <E T="03">debt</E> are synonymous and interchangeable. They refer to an amount of money or property which has been determined by an appropriate Agency official to be owed to the United States from any person, organization, or entity, except another Federal agency.</P>
              <P>(e) A debt is considered <E T="03">delinquent</E> if it has not been paid by the date specified in the Agency's initial demand letter (§ 102.161), unless satisfactory payment arrangements have been made by that date, or if, at any time thereafter, the debtor fails to satisfy the debtor's obligations under a payment agreement with the Agency.</P>

              <P>Unless otherwise prohibited by law, the Agency may request that monies due and payable to a debtor by another Federal agency be administratively offset in order to collect debts owed the Agency by the debtor. In requesting an administrative offset, the Agency will provide the other Federal agency holding funds of the debtor with written certification stating:</P>
              <P>(a) That the debtor owes the Board a debt (including the amount of debt); and</P>
              <P>(b) That the Agency has complied with the applicable Federal Claims Collection Standards, including any hearing or review.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Exclusions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) The Agency is not authorized by the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (31 U.S.C. 3716) to use administrative offset with respect to:</P>
              <P>(i) Debts owed by any State or local government;</P>
              <P>(ii) Debts arising under or payments made under the Social Security Act, the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, or the tariff laws of the United States; or</P>
              <P>(iii) When a statute explicitly provides for or prohibits using administrative offset to collect the claim or type of claim involved.</P>
              <P>(2) No claim that has been outstanding for more than 10 years after the Board's right to collect the debt first accrued may be collected by means of administrative offset, unless facts material to the right to collect the debt were not known, and could not reasonably have been known, by the official of the Agency who was charged with the responsibility to discover and collect such debts until within 10 years of the initiation of the collection action. A determination of when the debt first accrued may be made according to existing laws regarding the accrual of debts, such as under 28 U.S.C. 2415. Unless otherwise provided by contract or law, debts or payments owed the Board which are not subject to administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716 may be collected by administrative offset under the common law or other applicable statutory authority, pursuant to this paragraph (a) or Board regulations established pursuant to such other statutory authority.</P>
              <P>(b) Collection by offset against a judgment obtained by a debtor against the United State will be accomplished in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3728.</P>

The Agency will also take such administrative steps as may be appropriate to carry out the purposes and ensure the effective implementation of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(b) Before collecting a claim by means of administrative offset, the Agency must ensure that administrative offset is feasible, allowable and appropriate, and must notify the debtor of the Agency's policies for collecting a claim by means of administrative offset.</P>
              <P>(c) Whether collection by administrative offset is feasible is a determination to be made by the Agency on a case-by-case basis, in the exercise of sound discretion. The Agency shall consider not only whether administrative offset can be accomplished, both practically and legally, but also whether administrative offset will further and protect the best interests of the United States Government. In appropriate circumstances, the Agency may give due consideration to the debtor's financial condition, and it is not expected that administrative offset will be used in every available instance, particularly where there is another readily available source of funds. The Agency may also consider whether administrative offset would substantially interfere with or defeat the purposes of the program authorizing the payments against which offset is contemplated.</P>
              <P>(d) Administrative offset must be considered by the Agency only after attempting to collect a claim under 31 U.S.C. 3711(a).</P>

In the demand letter, the Agency must provide the name of an Agency employee who can provide a full explanation of the claim. When the Agency deems it appropriate to protect the Government's interests (for example, to prevent the statute of limitations, 28 U.S.C. 2415, from expiring), written demand may be preceded by other appropriate actions.</P>
              <P>(b) In accordance with guidelines established by the Agency, the Agency official responsible for collection of the debt must send written notice to the debtor, informing the debtor, as appropriate, of the:</P>
              <P>(1) Nature and amount of the Board's claim;</P>
              <P>(2) Date by which payment is to be made (which normally may be not more than 30 days from the date that the initial notification was mailed or hand delivered);</P>

              <SUBJECT>Review of the obligation.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The debtor shall have the opportunity to obtain review by the Agency of the determination concerning the existence or amount of the debt as set forth in the notice. In cases where the amount of the debt has been fully liquidated, the review is limited to ensuring that the liquidated amount is correctly represented in the notice.</P>
              <P>(b) The debtor seeking review shall make the request in writing to the Agency, not more than 15 days from the date the demand letter was received by the debtor. The request for review shall state the basis for challenging the determination. If the debtor alleges that the Agency's information relating to the debt is not accurate, timely, relevant or complete, the debtor shall provide information or documentation to support this allegation.</P>
              <P>(c) The Agency may effect an administrative offset against a payment to be made to a debtor prior to the completion of the due process procedures required by this subpart, if failure to take the offset would substantially prejudice the Agency's ability to collect the debt; for example, if the time before the payment is to be made would not reasonably permit the completion of due process procedures. Administrative offset effected prior to completion of due process procedures must be promptly followed by the completion of those procedures. Amounts recovered by administrative offset, but later found not owed to the Agency, will be promptly refunded.</P>
              <P>(d) Upon completion of the review, the Agency's reviewing official shall transmit to the debtor the Agency's decision. If appropriate, this decision shall inform the debtor of the scheduled date on or after which administrative offset will begin. The decision shall also, if appropriate, indicate any changes in information to the extent such information differs from that provided in the initial notification to the debtor under § 102.161.</P>

              <P>(e) Nothing in this subpart will preclude the Agency from <E T="03">sua sponte</E> reviewing the obligation of the debtor, including reconsideration of the Agency's determination concerning the debt, and the accuracy, timeliness, relevance, and completeness of the information on which the debt is based.</P>

The regulations are not intended to limit or restrict debtor access to any judicial remedies to which the debtor may otherwise be entitled.</P>

By the date and in the manner prescribed by the IRS, the Agency may refer for tax refund offset past-due legally enforceable debts. Such referrals shall include the following information:</P>

              <P>(3) The debtor will have a minimum of 60 days from the date of notification to present evidence that all or part of the debt is not past due or legally enforceable, and the Agency will consider this evidence in a review of its determination that the debt is past due and legally enforceable.

              <SUBJECT>Exclusion from hearings; refusal of witness to answer questions; misconduct by attorneys and party representatives before the Agency; procedures for processing misconduct allegations.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Any attorney or other representative appearing or practicing before the Agency must conform to the standards of ethical and professional conduct required of practitioners before the courts, and the Agency will be guided by those standards in interpreting and applying the provisions of this section.</P>

              <P>(b) Misconduct by any person at any hearing before an Administrative Law Judge, Hearing Officer, or the Board may be grounds for summary exclusion from the hearing. Notwithstanding the procedures set forth in paragraph (e) of this section for handling allegations of <PRTPAGE P="124"/>misconduct, the Administrative Law Judge, Hearing Officer, or Board has the authority in the proceeding in which the misconduct occurred to admonish or reprimand, after due notice, any person who engages in misconduct at a hearing.</P>
              <P>(c) The refusal of a witness at any such hearing to answer any question which has been ruled to be proper may, in the discretion of the Administrative Law Judge or Hearing Officer, be grounds for striking all testimony previously given by such witness on related matters.</P>
              <P>(d) Misconduct by an attorney or other representative at any stage of any Agency proceeding, including but not limited to misconduct at a hearing, may be grounds for discipline. Such misconduct of an aggravated character may be grounds for suspension and/or disbarment from practice before the Agency and/or other sanctions.</P>
              <P>(e) All allegations of misconduct pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, except for those involving the conduct of Agency employees, will be handled in accordance with the following procedures:</P>
              <P>(1) Allegations that an attorney or party representative has engaged in misconduct may be brought to the attention of the Investigating Officer by any person. The Investigating Officer, for purposes of this paragraph (e)(1), is the head of the Division of Operations-Management, or designee.</P>
              <P>(2) The Investigating Officer or designee will conduct such investigation as is deemed appropriate and will have the usual powers of investigation provided in Section 11 of the Act. Following the investigation, the Investigating Officer will make a recommendation to the General Counsel, who will make the determination whether to institute disciplinary proceedings against the attorney or party representative. The General Counsel's authority to make this determination is not delegable to the Regional Director or other personnel in the Regional Office. If the General Counsel determines not to institute disciplinary proceedings, all interested persons will be notified of the determination, which is final.</P>
              <P>(3) If the General Counsel decides to institute disciplinary proceedings against the attorney or party representative, the General Counsel or designee will serve the respondent with a complaint which will include: A statement of the acts which are claimed to constitute misconduct including the approximate date and place of such acts together with a statement of the discipline recommended; notification of the right to a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge with respect to any material issues of fact or mitigation; and an explanation of the method by which a hearing may be requested. The complaint will not be issued until the respondent has been notified of the allegations in writing and has been afforded a reasonable opportunity to respond.</P>
              <P>(4) Within 14 days of service of the disciplinary complaint, the Respondent must file an answer admitting or denying the allegations, and may request a hearing. If no answer is filed or no material issue of fact or relevant to mitigation warranting a hearing is raised, the matter may be submitted directly to the Board. If no answer is filed, then the allegations will be deemed admitted.</P>
              <P>(5) Sections 102.24 through 102.51, rules applicable to unfair labor practice proceedings, apply to disciplinary proceedings under this section to the extent that they are not contrary to the provisions of this section.</P>
              <P>(6) The hearing will be conducted at a reasonable time, date, and place. In setting the hearing date, the Administrative Law Judge will give due regard to the Respondent's need for time to prepare an adequate defense and the need of the Agency and the Respondent for an expeditious resolution of the allegations.</P>
              <P>(7) The hearing will be public unless otherwise ordered by the Board or the Administrative Law Judge.</P>

              <P>(8) Any person bringing allegations of misconduct or filing a petition for disciplinary proceedings against an attorney or party representative will be given notice of the scheduled hearing. Any such person will not be a party to the disciplinary proceeding, however, and will not be afforded the rights of a <PRTPAGE P="125"/>party to call, examine or cross-examine witnesses and introduce evidence at the hearing, to file exceptions to the Administrative Law Judge's decision, or to appeal the Board's decision.</P>
              <P>(9) The Respondent will, upon request, be provided with an opportunity to read the transcript or listen to a recording of the hearing.</P>
              <P>(10) The General Counsel must establish the alleged misconduct by a preponderance of the evidence.</P>
              <P>(11) At any stage of the proceeding prior to hearing, the Respondent may submit a settlement proposal to the General Counsel, who may approve the settlement or elect to continue with the proceedings. Any formal settlement reached between the General Counsel and the Respondent, providing for entry of a Board order reprimanding, suspending, disbarring or taking other disciplinary action against the Respondent, is subject to final approval by the Board. In the event any settlement, formal or informal, is reached after opening of the hearing, such settlement must be submitted to the Administrative Law Judge for approval. In the event the Administrative Law Judge rejects the settlement, either the General Counsel or the Respondent may appeal such ruling to the Board as provided in § 102.26.</P>
              <P>(12) If it is found that the Respondent has engaged in misconduct in violation of paragraph (d) of this section, the Board may issue a final order imposing such disciplinary sanctions as it deems appropriate, including, where the misconduct is of an aggravated character, suspension and/or disbarment from practice before the Agency, and/or other sanctions.</P>
              <P>(f) Any person found to have engaged in misconduct warranting disciplinary sanctions under paragraph (d) of this section may seek judicial review of the administrative determination.</P>

Average length of stay shall be determined by reference to the most recent twelve month period preceding receipt of a representation petition for which data is readily available. The term “acute care hospital” shall include those hospitals operating as acute care facilities even if those hospitals provide such services as, for example, long term care, outpatient care, psychiatric care, or rehabilitative care, but shall exclude facilities that are primarily nursing homes, primarily psychiatric hospitals, or primarily rehabilitation hospitals.

            <P>The purpose of these guidelines is to provide information concerning the Department of Labor's administrative procedures in processing applications for assistance under the Federal Transit law, as codified at 49 U.S.C. chapter 53.</P>

            <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Upon receipt of copies of applications for Federal assistance subject to 49 U.S.C. 5333(b), together with a request for the certification of employee protective arrangements from the Department of Transportation, the Department of Labor will process those applications, which must be in final form. The Federal Transit Administration will provide the Department with the information necessary to enable the Department to certify the project.</P>
            <CITA>[60 FR 62969, Dec. 7, 1995, as amended at 73 FR 47055, Aug. 13, 2008]</CITA>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 215.3</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Employees represented by a labor organization.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a)(1) If affected employees are represented by a labor organization, it is expected that where appropriate, protective arrangements shall be the product of negotiation/discussion, pursuant to these guidelines.</P>
            <P>(2) In instances where states or political subdivisions are subject to legal restrictions on bargaining with employee organizations, the Department of Labor will utilize special procedures to satisfy the Federal statute in a manner which does not contravene state or local law. For example, employee protective terms and conditions, acceptable to both employee and applicant representatives, may be incorporated into a resolution adopted by the involved local government.</P>
            <P>(3) If an application involves a grant to a state administrative agency or designated recipient that will pass assistance through to subrecipients, the Department will refer and process each subrecipient's respective portion of the project in accordance with this section. If a state administrative agency or designated recipient has previously provided employee protections on behalf of subrecipients in accordance with the terms of a negotiated agreement, the referral will be based on those terms and conditions.</P>
            <P>(4) The referral procedures set forth in paragraphs (b) through (h) of this section are not applicable to the following grants:</P>
            <P>(i) Grants to applicants for the Over-the-Road Bus Accessibility Program, and grant applications for the Other Than Urbanized Program; a special warranty will be applied to such grants under the procedures in § 215.7.</P>
            <P>(ii) Grants to applicants serving populations under 200,000 under the Job Access and Reverse Commute Program or grants to capitalize State Infrastructure Bank accounts under the State Infrastructure Bank Program.</P>
            <P>(iii) Grants involving only capital assistance for replacement of equipment and/or facilities of like-kind; these will be certified by the Department without referral on the basis of existing agreements or the Unified Protective Arrangement as referenced in paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section. Where application of the existing protective agreement(s) or the Unified Protective Arrangement would not satisfy the requirements of the statute in the circumstances presented, the Department will make necessary modifications to the existing protections to ensure that the requirements of the statute are satisfied.</P>

            <P>(5) The Department will notify labor organizations representing potentially <PRTPAGE P="132"/>affected transit employees of the certification of grants without referral under paragraph (a)(4) of this section and inform them of their rights under the applicable protective arrangements.</P>
            <P>(b) Upon receipt from the Federal Transit Administration of an application involving affected employees represented by a labor organization, the Department will refer a copy of the application and proposed terms for certification to that organization and to the applicant, and will also provide a copy to subrecipients with unions in their service area.</P>
            <P>(1) For applicants with existing protections the Department's referral will be based on those protective terms and conditions that are appropriate to the grant and are set by:</P>
            <P>(i) A signed negotiated agreement or formal acceptance of the July 23, 1975 National (Model) Agreement;</P>
            <P>(ii) Agreed-upon terms adopted by a State or local government through a resolution or similar instrument;</P>
            <P>(iii)) A determination of protective terms by the Department that modifies in whole or in part negotiated or adopted protections; or</P>
            <P>(iv) A protective arrangement that has been modified to include provisions that are more protective than the Unified Protective Arrangement referred to in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) For applicants without protective terms and conditions set by an arrangement described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the referral will be based on the terms and conditions of the Unified Protective Arrangement.</P>
            <P>(c) Following referral and notification under paragraph (b) of this section, and subject to the exceptions defined in § 215.5, parties will be expected to engage in good faith efforts to reach mutually acceptable protective arrangements through negotiation/discussion within the timeframes designated under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.</P>
            <P>(d) As part of the Department of Labor's review of an application, a time schedule for case processing will be established by the Department of Labor and specified in its referral and notification letters under paragraph 215.3(b) or subsequent written communications to the parties.</P>
            <P>(1) Parties will be given fifteen (15) days from the date of the referral and notification letters to submit objections, if any, to the referred terms. The parties are encouraged to engage in negotiations/discussions during this period with the aim of arriving at a mutually agreeable solution to objections any party has to the terms and conditions of the referral.</P>
            <P>(2) Within ten (10) days of the date for submitting objections, the Department of Labor will:</P>
            <P>(i) Determine whether the objections raised are sufficient; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Take one of the two steps described in paragraphs (d)(5) and (6) of this section, as appropriate.</P>
            <P>(3) The Department of Labor will consider an objection to be sufficient when:</P>
            <P>(i) The objection raises material issues that may require alternative employee protections under 49 U.S.C. 5333(b); or</P>
            <P>(ii) The objection concerns changes in legal or factual circumstances that may materially affect the rights or interests of employees.</P>
            <P>(4) The Department of Labor will consult with the Federal Transit Administration for technical advice as to the validity of objections.</P>
            <P>(5) If the Department of Labor determines that there are no sufficient objections, the Department will issue its certification to the Federal Transit Administration.</P>

            <P>(6) If the Department of Labor determines that an objection is sufficient, the Department, as appropriate, will direct the parties to commence or continue negotiations/discussions, limited to issues that the Department deems appropriate and limited to a period not to exceed thirty (30) days. The parties will be expected to negotiate/discuss expeditiously and in good faith. The Department of Labor may provide mediation assistance during this period where appropriate. The parties may agree to waive any negotiations/discussions if the Department, after reviewing the objections, develops new terms and conditions acceptable to the parties. At the end of the designated negotiation/discussion period, if all issues <PRTPAGE P="133"/>have not been resolved, each party must submit to the Department its final proposal and a statement describing the issues still in dispute.</P>
            <P>(7) The Department will issue a certification to the Federal Transit Administration within five (5) days after the end of the negotiation/discussion period designated under paragraph (d)(6) of this section. The certification will be based on terms and conditions agreed to by the parties that the Department concludes meet the requirements of 49 U.S.C. 5333(b). To the extent that no agreement has been reached, the certification will be based on terms and conditions determined by the Department which are no less protective than the terms and conditions included in the referral pursuant to § 215.3(b)(1).</P>
            <P>(8) Notwithstanding that a certification has been issued to the Federal Transit Administration pursuant to paragraph (d)(7) of this section, no action may be taken which would result in irreparable harm to employees if such action concerns matters subject to the steps set forth in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
            <P>(e) If the certification referred to in paragraph (d)(7) of this section is not based on full mutual agreement of the parties, the Department of Labor will take the following steps to resolve outstanding differences:</P>
            <P>(1) The Department will set a schedule that provides for final resolution of the disputed issue(s) within sixty (60) days of the certification referred to in paragraph (d)(7) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) Within ten (10) days of the issuance of the certification referred to in paragraph (d)(7) of this section, and after reviewing the parties' descriptions of the disputed issues, the Department will define the issues still in dispute and set a schedule for final resolution of all such issues.</P>
            <P>(3) The Department may establish a briefing schedule, usually allowing no more than twenty (20) days for opening briefs and no more than ten (10) days for reply briefs, when the Department deems reply briefs to be beneficial. In either event, the Department will issue a final certification to the Federal Transit Administration no later than thirty (30) days after the last briefs are due.</P>
            <P>(4) The Department of Labor will decide the manner in which the dispute will be resolved. In making this decision, the Department may consider the form(s) of dispute resolution employed by the parties in their previous dealings as well as various forms of third party dispute resolution that may be appropriate. Any dispute resolution proceedings will normally be expected to commence within thirty (30) days of the certification referred to in paragraph (d)(7) of this section, and the Department will render a final determination, including the bases therefor, within thirty (30) days of the commencement of the proceedings.</P>
            <P>(5) The Department will make available final decisions it renders on disputed issues.</P>
            <P>(f) Nothing in these guidelines restricts the parties from continuing to negotiate/discuss over final terms and conditions and seeking a final certification of an agreement that meets the requirements of the Act prior to the issuance of a final determination by the Department.</P>
            <P>(g) If, subsequent to the issuance of the certification referred to in paragraph (d)(7) of this section, the parties reach an agreement on one or more disputed issues that meets the requirements of the Act, and/or the Department of Labor issues a final decision containing revised terms and conditions, the Department will take appropriate steps to substitute the new terms and conditions for those previously certified to the Federal Transit Administration.</P>
            <P>(h) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Department retains the right to withhold certification where circumstances inconsistent with the statute so warrant until such circumstances have been resolved.</P>

            <P>(a) The certification made by the Department of Labor will afford the same level of protection to those employees <PRTPAGE P="134"/>who are not represented by labor organizations.</P>

            <P>(a) Grant modifications in the form of grant amendments will be transmitted by the Federal Transit Administration to the Department for review. Applications amending a grant for which the Department has already certified fair and equitable arrangements to protect the interests of transit employees affected by the project, will be processed by the Department following one of the two procedures described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.</P>
            <P>(1) When an application amends a grant for which the Department has previously certified fair and equitable arrangements and the amendment makes changes to a project that may necessitate alternative employee protections, the Department will conclude that the amendment materially amends the existing assistance agreement. The Department will refer and/or process the labor certification provisions of such an amended grant according to procedures specified under §§ 215.3 and 215.4, as appropriate.</P>
            <P>(2) When an application amends in a manner that is not material a grant for which the Department has already certified fair and equitable arrangements, the Department will, on its own initiative and without referral to the parties, certify the subject grant on the same terms and conditions as were certified for the project as originally constituted. The Department's processing of these applications will be expedited and copies will be forwarded to interested parties.</P>
            <P>(b) Budget Revisions that make minor changes within the scope of the existing grant agreement and do not require a Federal Transit Administration grant amendment, as set forth in Federal Transit Administration guidance, will be covered under the Department's original certifications.</P>

            <SUBJECT>The Model Agreement.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The Model (or National) Agreement mentioned in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (b)(2) of § 215.3 refers to the agreement executed on July 23, 1975 by representatives of the American Public Transit Association (now known as the American Public Transportation Association) and the Amalgamated Transit Union and Transport Workers Union of America and on July 31, 1975 by representatives of the Railway Labor Executives' Association, Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, Brotherhood of Railway and Airline Clerks and International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The agreement is intended to serve as a ready-made employee protective arrangement for adoption by local parties in specific operating assistance project situations. The Department has determined that this agreement provides fair and equitable arrangements to protect the interests of employees in general purpose operating assistance project situations and meets the requirements of 49 U.S.C. 5333(b).</P>

            <SUBJECT>The Special Warranty.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) The Special Warranty mentioned in paragraph (b)(2) of § 215.3 refers to the protective arrangements developed for application to the Other Than Urbanized program. The warranty arrangement represents the understandings of the Department of Labor and the Department of Transportation, reached in May 1979, with respect to the protections to be applied for such grants. The Special Warranty provides fair and equitable arrangements to protect the interests of employees and meets the requirements of 49 U.S.C. 5333(b). The Special Warranty Arrangement applicable to OTRB and Other Than Urbanized grants will be derived from the terms and conditions of the May 1979 Special Section 13(c) Warranty, and the Department's subsequent experience under 49 U.S.C. 5333(b). From time to time, the Department may update this Special Warranty Arrangement to reflect developments in the employee protection program.<PRTPAGE P="135"/>
            </P>

            <P>(b) The requirements of 49 U.S.C. 5333(b) for OTRB and “Other Than Urbanized” grants are satisfied through application of a Special Warranty Arrangement certified by the Department of Labor; a copy of the current arrangement will be included on the OLMS <E T="03">Web site.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(c) The Federal Transit Administration will include the current version of the Special Warranty Arrangement, through reference in its Master Agreement, in each OTRB and Other Than Urbanized grant of assistance under the statute.</P>
            <P>(1) The Federal Transit Administration will notify the Department that it is funding an OTRB or Other Than Urbanized grant by transmitting to the Department an information copy of each grant application upon approval of the grant.</P>

            <P>(i) Each grant of assistance for an Other Than Urbanized program will contain a labor section identifying labor organizations representing transit employees of each subrecipient, the labor organizations representing employees of other transit providers in the service area, and a list of those transit providers. A sample format is posted on the OLMS <E T="03">Web site</E> to facilitate the inclusion of this information in the grant application.</P>
            <P>(ii) OTRB grants of assistance will contain a labor section identifying labor organizations representing employees of the recipient.</P>
            <P>(2) The Department will notify labor organizations representing potentially affected transit employees of the approval of Other Than Urbanized and OTRB grants and inform them of their rights under the Special Warranty Arrangement.</P>

              <P>(a) As used in this part, unless otherwise defined, the term <E T="03">fiscal year</E> means the calendar year or other period of 12 consecutive calendar months, on the basis of which financial accounts are kept by a labor organization reporting under this part. Where a labor organization designates a new fiscal year period prior to the expiration of a previously established fiscal year period, the resultant period of less than 12 consecutive calendar months, and thereafter the newly established fiscal year, shall in that order each constitute a fiscal year for purposes of the report required to be filed by section 201(b) of the Act, and of the regulations in this part.</P>
              <P>(b) A labor organization which is subject to section 201(b) of the Act for only a portion of its fiscal year because the labor organization first becomes subject to the Act during such fiscal year, may consider such portion as the entire fiscal year in making its report under this part.</P>

              <P>(b) Every labor organization shall include in its annual financial report filed as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, in such detail as may be necessary accurately to disclose its financial condition and operations for its preceding fiscal year and in such categories as prescribed by the Secretary under the provisions of this part, the information required by section 201(b) of the Act and found by the Secretary under section 208 thereof to be necessary in such report.</P>

              <P>(c) If, on the date for filing the annual financial report of a labor organization required under section 201(b) of the Act and this section, such labor organization is in trusteeship, the labor <PRTPAGE P="149"/>organization which has assumed trusteeship over such labor organization shall file such report as provided in § 408.5 of this chapter.</P>

                <P>Section 401(h) of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 (29 U.S.C. 481) provides that if, <PRTPAGE P="163"/>upon application of any member of a local labor organization, the Secretary of Labor finds, after hearing in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, that the constitution and bylaws of such labor organization do not provide an adequate procedure for the removal of an elected officer guilty of serious misconduct, such officer may be removed for cause shown and after notice and hearing, by the members in good standing voting in a secret ballot. Section 401(i) (29 U.S.C. 481) requires the Secretary to promulgate rules and regulations prescribing minimum standards and procedures for determining the adequacy of the removal procedures referred to in section 401(h). Section 402(a) (29 U.S.C. 482) provides that a member of a labor organization who has exhausted the available internal remedies of such organization and of any parent body, or who has invoked such remedies without obtaining a final decision within three months, may file a complaint with the Secretary within one month thereafter alleging violation of section 401 (including violation of the constitution and bylaws of the labor organization pertaining to the removal of officers). Section 402(b) (29 U.S.C. 482) provides that upon suit initiated by the Secretary, a Federal court may direct the conduct of a hearing and vote upon the removal of officers under the supervision of the Secretary, and in accordance with such rules and regulations as the Secretary may prescribe. It is the purpose of this part to implement those sections by prescribing regulations relating to the procedures and standards for determining the adequacy of removal procedures and the procedures for holding elections for the removal of officers.</P>

                <P>(a) Upon receipt of an application filed under § 417.3, the Chief, DOE shall cause an investigation to be conducted of the allegations contained therein, and if he finds probable cause to believe that the constitution and bylaws of the labor organization do not provide an adequate procedure for the removal of an elected officer(s) guilty of serious misconduct he shall:</P>

              <P>(a) This part discusses the meaning and scope of sections 3(i) and 3(j) of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 <SU>1</SU>
                <FTREF/> (hereinafter referred to as the Act). These provisions define the terms “labor organization” and “labor organization * * * in an industry affecting commerce” for purposes of the Act. <SU>2</SU>

                <P>
                  <SU>2</SU> It should be noted that the definition of the term “labor organization,” as well as other terms, in section 3 are for purposes of those portions of the Act included in titles I, II, III, IV, V (except section 505) and VI. They do not apply to title VII, which contains amendments of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, nor to section 505 of title V, which amends section 302 (a), (b), and (c) of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, as amended. The terms used in title VII and section 505 of title V have the same meaning as they have under the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, and the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, as amended.</P>
              </FTNT>
              <P>(b) The Act imposes on labor organizations various obligations and prohibitions relating generally, among other things, to the reporting of information and election and removal of officers. Requirements are also imposed on the officers, representatives, and employees of labor organizations. In addition, certain rights are guaranteed the members thereof. It thus becomes a matter of importance to determine what organizations are included within the applicability of the Act.</P>
              <P>(c) The provisions of the Act, other than title I and amendments to other statutes contained in section 505 and title VII, are subject to the general investigatory authority of the Secretary of Labor embodied in section 601 <SU>3</SU>
                <FTREF/> (and delegated by him to the Director), which empowers him to investigate whenever he believes it necessary in order to determine whether any person has violated or is about to violate such provisions. The correctness of an interpretation of these provisions can be determined finally and authoritatively only by the courts. It is necessary, however, for the Director to reach informed conclusions as to the meaning of the law to enable him to carry out his statutory duties of administration and enforcement. The interpretations of the Director contained in this part, which are issued upon the advice of the Solicitor of Labor, indicate the construction of the law which will guide him in performing his duties unless and until he is directed otherwise by authoritative rulings of the courts or unless and until he subsequently decides that a prior interpretation is incorrect. However, the omission to discuss a particular problem in this part, or in interpretations supplementing it, should not be taken to indicate the adoption of any position by the Director with respect to such problem or to constitute an administrative interpretation or practice. Interpretations of the Director with respect to the meaning of the terms “labor organization” and “labor organization * * * in an industry affecting commerce,” as used in the Act, are set forth in this part to provide those affected by the provisions of the Act with “a practical guide * * * as to how the office representing the public interest in its enforcement will seek to apply it.” <SU>4</SU>

              <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>

              <P>A “labor organization” under the Act must qualify under section 3(i). It must also be engaged in an industry affecting commerce. In accordance with the broad language used and the manifest congressional intent, the language will be construed broadly to include all labor organizations of any kind other <PRTPAGE P="170"/>than those clearly shown to be outside the scope of the Act.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Requirements of section 3(i).</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Organizations which deal with employers.</E> (1) The term “labor organization” includes “any organization of any kind, any agency, or employee representation committee, group, association, or plan * * * in which employees participate and which exists for the purpose, in whole or in part, of dealing with employers concerning grievances, labor disputes, wages, rates of pay, hours, or other terms or conditions of employment, * * *.” The quoted language is deemed sufficiently broad to encompass any labor organization irrespective of size or formal attributes. While it is necessary for employees to participate therein, such participating employees need not necessarily be the employees of the employer with whom the organization deals. In determining who are “employees” for purposes of this provision, resort must be had to the broad definition of “employee” contained in section 3(f) of the Act. <SU>5</SU>
                <FTREF/> It will be noted that the term includes employees whose work has ceased for certain specified reasons, including any current labor dispute.</P>
              <FTNT>
                <P>
                  <SU>5</SU> Sec. 3(f) reads: “ ‘Employee’ means any individual employed by an employer, and includes any individual whose work has ceased as a consequence of, or in connection with, any current labor dispute or because of any unfair labor practice or because of exclusion or expulsion from a labor organization in any manner or for any reason inconsistent with the requirements of this Act.”</P>
              </FTNT>
              <P>(2) To come within the quoted language in section 3(i) the organization must exist for the purpose, in whole or in part, of dealing with employers concerning grievances, etc. In determining whether a given organization exists wholly or partially for such purpose, consideration will be given not only to formal documents, such as its constitution or bylaws, but the actual functions and practices of the organization as well. Thus, employee committees which regularly meet with management to discuss problems of mutual interest and handle grievances are “labor organizations”, even though they have no formal organizational structure. <SU>6</SU>

              </FTNT>
              <P>(3) Since the types of labor organizations described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph are those which deal with employers, it is necessary to consider the definition of “employer” contained in section 3(e) of the Act in determining the scope of the language under consideration. <SU>7</SU>
                <FTREF/> The term “employer” is broadly defined to include “any employer or any group or association of employers engaged in an industry affecting commerce” which is “an employer within the meaning of any law of the United States relating to the employment of any employees * * *.” Such laws would include, among others, the Railway Labor Act, as amended, the Fair Labor Standards Act, as amended, the Labor Management Relations Act, as amended, and the Internal Revenue Code. The fact that employers may be excluded from the application of any of the foregoing acts would not preclude their qualification as employers for purposes of this Act. For example, employers of agricultural labor who are excluded from the application of the Labor Management Relations Act, as amended, would appear to be employers within the meaning of this Act.</P>
              <FTNT>
                <P>
                  <SU>7</SU> Sec. 3(e) reads: “ ‘Employer’ means any employer or any group or association of employers engaged in an industry affecting commerce, (1) which is, with respect to employees engaged in an industry affecting commerce, an employer within the meaning of any law of the United States relating to the employment of any employees or (2) which may deal with any labor organization concerning grievances, labor disputes, wages, rates of pay, hours of employment, or conditions of work, and includes any person acting directly or indirectly as an employer or as an agent of an employer in relation to an employee but does not include the United States or any corporation wholly owned by the Government of the United States or any State or political subdivision thereof.”</P>
              </FTNT>

              <P>(4) In defining “employer,” section 3(e) expressly excludes the “United States or any corporation wholly owned by the Government of the United States or any State or political <PRTPAGE P="171"/>subdivision thereof.” The term “political subdivision” includes, among others, counties and municipal governments. A labor organization composed entirely of employees of the governmental entities excluded by section 3(e) would not be a labor organization for the purposes of the Act with the exception of a labor organization composed of employees of the United States Postal Service which is subject to the Act by virtue of the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970. (Organizations composed of Federal government employees that meet the definition of “labor organization” in the Civil Service Reform Act or the Foreign Service Act are subject to the standards of conduct requirements of those Acts, 5 U.S.C. 7120 and 22 U.S.C. 4117, respectively. In addition, labor organizations subject to the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 are subject to the standards of conduct provisions of the Civil Service Reform Act pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 1351(a)(1). The regulations implementing the standards of conduct requirements are contained in parts 457-459 of this title.) However, in the case of a national, international or intermediate labor organization composed both of government locals and non-government or mixed locals, the parent organization as well as its mixed and non-government locals would be “labor organizations” and subject to the Act. In such case, the locals which are composed entirely of government employees would not be subject to the Act, although elections in which they participate for national officers or delegates would be so subject. <SU>8</SU>

Included are the area conferences and the joint councils of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and similar units of other national and international labor organizations.</P>

Under this provision, a labor organization not otherwise subject to the Act, such as one composed of Government employees, would appear to be “engaged in an industry affecting commerce” and, therefore, subject to the Act if it charters one or more local <PRTPAGE P="172"/>labor organizations which deal with an “employer” as defined in section 3(c). <SU>11</SU>

              <P>(3) <E T="03">Joint or system boards.</E> As mentioned above, in connection with railroad labor organizations the term “general committee” includes system boards. However, as used here the term has a broader meaning and includes, among others, boards which have members from more than one labor organization.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Joint councils.</E> A joint council is composed of locals not necessarily of the same national or international labor organization located in a particular area, such as a city or county. These bodies are sometimes called joint boards, joint executive boards, joint councils, or district councils. Included, for example, are councils of building and construction trades labor organizations.</P>

              <P>(a) The definition of “labor organization” in section 3(i) and the examples of labor organizations deemed to be engaged in an industry affecting commerce in section 3(j)(5) both except from the term “labor organization” a “State or local central body.” As used in these two sections, the phrase <E T="03">State or local central body</E> means an organization that:</P>
              <P>(1) Is chartered by a federation of national or international unions; and</P>

              <P>(2) Admits to membership local unions and subordinate bodies of national or international unions that are affiliated with the chartering federation within the State or local central body's territory and any local unions <PRTPAGE P="173"/>or subordinate bodies directly affiliated with the federation in such territory; and</P>
              <P>(3) Exists primarily to carry on educational, legislative and coordinating activities.</P>
              <P>(b) The term does not include organizations of local unions or subordinate bodies (1) of a single national or international union; or (2) of a particular department of a federation or similar association of national or international unions.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Extraterritorial application.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) It is not the purpose of the Act to impose on foreign labor organizations any regulation of the activities they carry on under the laws of the countries in which they are domiciled or have their principal place of business. The applicability of the Act is limited to the activities of persons or organizations within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States. The foregoing would be applicable, for example, to Canadian locals affiliated with international labor organizations organized within the United States.</P>
              <P>(b) On the other hand, labor organizations otherwise subject to the Act are not relieved of the requirements imposed upon them with respect to actions taken by them in the United States or which will have effect in the United States, by virtue of the fact that they have foreign members or affiliates that participate in these actions. For example, a national or international labor organization which conducts its required election of officers by referendum or at a convention of delegates must comply with the election provisions of the Act, <SU>16</SU>
                <FTREF/> even though members of foreign locals participate in the balloting, or delegates of foreign locals participate in the election at the convention.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Introductory statement.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) This part discusses the meaning and scope of the provisions of title IV of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act <SU>1</SU>
                  <FTREF/> (hereinafter referred to as the Act), which deal with the election of officers of labor organizations. These provisions require periodic election of union officers, and prescribe minimum standards to insure that such elections will be fairly conducted. Specific provisions are included to assure the right of union members to participate in selecting their officers without fear of interference or reprisal, and to protect the right to nominate candidates, run for office, and vote in officer elections. Title IV also sets forth the rights of candidates, provides for secret ballots in appropriate cases, and requires notice of nominations and elections, preservation of election records, and other safeguards to insure fair elections. However, the Act does not prescribe complete, detailed procedures for the nomination and election of union officers.</P>

                </FTNT>
                <P>(b) Interpretations of the Director with respect to the election provisions of title IV are set forth in this part to provide those affected by these provisions of the Act with “a practical guide * * * as to how the office representing the public interest in its enforcement will seek to apply it.” <SU>2</SU>
                  <FTREF/> The correctness of an interpretation can be determined finally and authoritatively only by the courts. It is necessary, however, for the Director to reach informed conclusions as to the meaning of the law to enable him to carry out his statutory duties of administration and enforcement. The interpretations of the Director contained in this part, which are issued upon the advice of the Solicitor of Labor, indicate the construction of the law which will guide him in performing his duties unless and until he is directed otherwise by authoritative rulings of the courts or unless and until he subsequently announces that a prior interpretation is incorrect. However, the fact that a particular problem is not discussed in this part, or in interpretations supplementing it, should not be taken to indicate the adoption of any position by the Director with respect to such problem or to constitute an administrative interpretation or practice.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Investigatory provision—application.</SUBJECT>
                <P>The provisions of section 601 of the Act provide general investigatory authority to investigate alleged violations of the Act including violations of title IV. However, section 601 in and of itself provides no remedy, and the section must be read in conjunction with the remedy and statutory scheme of section 402, i.e., exhaustion of internal union remedies and a complaint to the Secretary following completion of the election before suit can be filed. In view of the remedy provided, an investigation prior to completion of an election may have the effect of publicizing the activities or unsubstantiated allegations of one faction to the prejudice of the opposition. To avoid this result, and as a matter of sound statutory construction, the Department will exercise its investigatory authority only in circumstances in which the outcome of the election could not be affected by the investigation. <SU>4</SU>
                  <FTREF/> Thus, the Department ordinarily will employ its investigatory authority only where the procedural requirements for a title IV investigation have been met; but in unusual circumstances or where necessary to collect or preserve evidence an investigation may be conducted after the conclusion of balloting.</P>

                  <P>
                    <SU>4</SU> However questions involving the use of force or violence or the threat of the use of force or violence under circumstances which may violate section 610 (29 U.S.C. 530) of the Act will be referred promptly to the Department of Justice for appropriate action.</P>

It is likewise a crime for any labor organization or officer knowingly to permit such a person to serve in such positions. Persons subject to the prohibition applicable to convicted criminals may serve if their citizenship rights have been fully restored after being taken away by reason of the conviction, or if, following the procedures set forth in the Act, it is determined that their service would not be contrary to the purposes of the Act.</P>

                <P>An organization composed entirely of government employees (other than employees of the United States Postal Service) is not subject to the election provisions of the Act. Section 3(e) of the Act, defining the term “employer,” specifically excludes the United States Government, its wholly owned corporations, and the States and their political subdivisions from the scope of that term, and section 3(f) defines an “employee” as an individual employed by an “employer.” Since a “labor organization” is defined in section 3(i) as one in which “employees” participate and which exists in whole or in part for the purpose of “dealing with employers,” an organization composed entirely of government employees would not be a “labor organization” <SU>13</SU>

                  <FTREF/> as that term is defined in the Act. However, section 1209 of the Postal Reorganization Act provides that organizations of employees of the United States Postal Service shall be subject to the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act. A national, international or intermediate labor organization which has some locals of government employees not covered by the Act and other locals which are mixed or are composed entirely of employees covered by the Act would be subject to the election requirements of the Act. Its mixed locals <PRTPAGE P="178"/>would also be subject to the Act. The requirements would not apply to locals composed entirely of government employees not covered by the Act, except with respect to the election of officers of a parent organization which is subject to those requirements or the election of delegates to a convention of such parent organization, or to an intermediate body to which the requirements apply.</P>

                <P>Section 3(n) of the Act defines the word “officer” and it is this definition which must be used as a guide in determining what particular positions in a <PRTPAGE P="179"/>labor organization are to be filled in the manner prescribed in the Act. For purposes of the Act, “officer” means “any constitutional officer, any person authorized to perform the functions of president, vice president, secretary, treasurer, or other executive functions of a labor organization, and any member of its executive board or similar governing body.”</P>

                <P>A constitutional officer refers to a person holding a position identified as an officer by the constitution and bylaws of the labor organization. Thus, for example, a legislative representative of a labor organization who performs no executive functions and whose duties are confined to promoting the interests of members in legislative matters is nevertheless an officer who is required to be elected where the labor organization's constitution identifies the holder of such a position as an officer. On the other hand, legislative representatives who are required to be elected by the constitution and bylaws of a labor organization are not considered to be officers within the meaning of the Act if they are not designated as such by the constitution, are not members of any executive board or similar governing body, and do not perform executive functions. As defined in the Act, however, the term “officer” is not limited to individuals in positions identified as such or provided for in the constitution or other organic law of the labor organization. <SU>17</SU>
                  <FTREF/> The post of Honorary President, President Emeritus or Past President that is to be assumed by the retiring chief executive officer of a union would not be an officer position unless it is designated as an officer position by the union's constitution, or the holder of the position performs executive functions or serves on an executive board or similar governing body.</P>

                <P>The definitional phrase “a person authorized to perform the functions of president, vice president, secretary, treasurer, or other executive functions of a labor organization” brings within the term “officer” any person who in fact has executive or policy-making authority or responsibility, although he may not occupy a position identified as an officer under the constitution and bylaws of the organization. Authorization to perform such functions need not be contained in any provision of the constitution or bylaws or other document but may be inferred from actual practices or conduct. On the other hand, a person is not an officer merely because he performs ministerial acts for a designated officer who alone has responsibility. The normal functions performed by business agents and shop stewards, such as soliciting memberships, presenting or negotiating employee grievances within the work place, and negotiating contracts are not “other executive functions” as that phrase is used in section 3(n) of the Act. However, a directing business representative or a business manager usually exercises such a degree of executive authority as to be considered an officer and, therefore, must be elected. The duties normally pertaining to membership on a bargaining committee do not come within the phrase “other executive functions.” However, persons occupying such non-executive positions may be “officers” if they are ex officio members of the organization's executive board (or similar governing body) or if the constitution or bylaws of the union designate such positions as officers.</P>

                <P>(a) The functions that will bring a particular position with a title other than president, vice-president, secretary-treasurer, or executive board member within the definition of “officer” cannot be precisely defined. They are the functions typically performed by officers holding these titles in current labor union practice. Decisions in each case will require a practical judgment. As a general rule, a person will be regarded as being authorized to perform the functions of president if he is the chief or principal executive officer of the labor organization. Similarly, he will be regarded as being authorized to perform the functions of treasurer if he <PRTPAGE P="180"/>has principal responsibility for control and management of the organization's funds and fiscal operation. A member of any group, committee, or board which is vested with broad governing or policymaking authority will be regarded as a member of an “executive board or similar governing body.” The name or title that the labor organization assigns to the position is not controlling.</P>
                <P>(b) The purpose of the election requirement of the Act is to assure that persons in positions of control in labor organizations will be responsive to the desires of the members. <SU>18</SU>
                  <FTREF/> Professional and other staff members of the labor organization who do not determine the organization's policies or carry on its executive functions and who are employed merely to implement policy decisions and managerial directives established by the governing officials of the organization are not officers and are not required to be elected.</P>

For example, members of an “Executive-Grievance Committee” which exercises real governing powers are officers under the Act. However, it should be noted that committee membership alone will not ordinarily be regarded as an indication of officer status, unless the committee or its members meet the requirements contained in section 3(n) of the Act.</P>

                  <FTREF/> It would not be consistent with these provisions of the Act for officers elected for the maximum terms allowable under the statute to remain in office after the expiration of their terms without a new election. Failure to hold an election for any office after the statutory period has expired constitutes a continuing violation of the Act, which may be brought to the attention of the Secretary in the form of <PRTPAGE P="181"/>a complaint filed in accordance with the appropriate procedure. Title IV establishes only maximum time intervals between elections for officers. Labor organizations covered by these provisions may hold elections of officers with greater frequency than the specified maximum period. For example, a local labor organization is required to hold an election of officers at least once every three years, but it must hold an election every year if its governing rules so provide. It should be noted, moreover, that the provisions of title IV apply to all regular elections of officers in labor organizations subject to the Act. Thus, if a labor organization chooses to hold elections of officers more frequently than the statutory maximum intervals, it must observe the minimum standards set forth in title IV for the conduct of such elections.</P>

                <P>It is recognized that labor organizations may have a legitimate institutional interest in prescribing minimum standards for candidacy and officeholding in the organization. On the other hand, a dominant purpose of the Act is to ensure the right of members to participate fully in governing their union and to make its officers responsive to the members. A basic assumption underlying the concept of “free and democratic elections,” is that voters will exercise common sense and good judgment in casting their ballots. In union elections as in political elections, the good judgment of the members in casting their votes should be the primary determinant of whether a candidate is qualified to hold office. Therefore, restrictions placed on the right of members to be candidates must be closely scrutinized to determine whether they serve union purposes of such importance, in terms of protecting the union as an institution, as to justify subordinating the right of the individual member to seek office and the interest of the membership in a free, democratic choice of leaders.</P>

                <P>(a) The question of whether a qualification is reasonable is a matter which is not susceptible of precise definition, and will ordinarily turn on the facts in each case. However, court decisions in deciding particular cases have furnished some general guidelines. The Supreme Court in <E T="03">Wirtz</E> v. <E T="03">Hotel, Motel and Club Employees Union, Local 6,</E> 391 U.S. 492 at 499 (1968) held that:
                </P>
                <EXTRACT>
                  <P>Congress plainly did not intend that the authorization in section 401(e) of ‘reasonable qualifications uniformly imposed’ should be given a broad reach. The contrary is implicit in the legislative history of the section and in its wording that ‘every member in good standing shall be eligible to be a candidate and to hold office * * *.’ This conclusion is buttressed by other provisions of the Act which stress freedom of members to nominate candidates for Office. Unduly restrictive candidacy qualifications can result in the abuses of entrenched leadership that the LMRDA was expressly enacted to curb. The check of democratic elections as a preventive measure is seriously impaired by candidacy qualifications which substantially deplete the ranks of those who might run in opposition to incumbents.</P>
                </EXTRACT>
                

                <FP>Union qualifications for office should not be based on assumptions that certain experience or qualifications are necessary. Rather it must be assumed that the labor organization members will exercise common sense and judgment in casting their ballots. “Congress' model of democratic elections was political elections in this country” (<E T="03">Wirtz</E> v. <E T="03">Local 6,</E> 391 U.S. at 502) and a qualification may not be required without a showing that citizens assumed to make discriminating judgments in public elections cannot be relied on to make such judgments when voting as union members.</FP>

                <P>(1) The relationship of the qualification to the legitimate needs and interests of the union;</P>
                <P>(2) The relationship of the qualification to the demands of union office;</P>

                <P>Ordinarily the following types of requirements may be considered reasonable, depending on the circumstances in which they are applied and the effect of their application:</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Period of prior membership.</E> It would ordinarily be reasonable for a local union to require a candidate to have been a member of the organization for a reasonable period of time, not exceeding two years, before the election. However, if a member is involuntarily compelled to transfer from <PRTPAGE P="184"/>one local to another, such a requirement would not be reasonable if he is not given credit for his prior period of membership.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Continuity of good standing.</E> A requirement of continuous good standing based on punctual payment of dues will be considered a reasonable qualification only if (1) it provides a reasonable grace period during which members may make up missed payments without loss of eligibility for office, <SU>24</SU>
                  <FTREF/> and (2) the period of time involved is reasonable. What are reasonable periods of time for these purposes will depend upon the circumstances. Section 401(e) of the Act provides that a member whose dues have been withheld by the employer for payment to the labor organization pursuant to his voluntary authorization provided for in a collective bargaining agreement may not be declared ineligible to vote or be a candidate for office by reason of alleged delay or default in the payment of dues. If during the period allowed for payment of dues in order to remain in good standing, a member on a dues checkoff system has no earnings from which dues can be withheld, section 401(e) does not relieve the member of the responsibility of paying his dues in order to remain in good standing.</P>

                <P>(a) It may be reasonable for a labor organization to establish a requirement of attendance at a specified number of its regular meetings during the period immediately preceding an election, in order to insure that candidates have a demonstrated interest in and familiarity with the affairs of the organization. In the past, it was ordinarily considered reasonable to require attendance at no more than 50 percent of the meetings over a period not exceeding two years. Experience has demonstrated that it is not feasible to establish arbitrary guidelines for judging the reasonableness of such a qualification. Its reasonableness must be gauged in the light of all the circumstances of the particular case, including not only the frequency of meetings, the number of meetings which must be attended and the period of time over which the requirement extends, but also such factors as the nature, availability and extent of excuse provisions, whether all or most members have the opportunity to attend meetings, and the impact of the rule, i.e., the number or percentage of members who would be rendered ineligible by its application. <SU>25</SU>

The rule required attendance at fifty percent of the meetings for three years preceding the election unless prevented by union activities or working hours, with the result that 96.5 percent of the members were ineligible.</P>

                <P>Inasmuch as it is an unfair labor practice under the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA) for any employer (including persons acting in that capacity) to dominate or interfere with the administration of any labor organization, it follows that employers, while they may be members, may not be candidates for office or serve as officers. Thus, while it is recognized that in some industries, particularly construction, members who become supervisors, or contractors traditionally keep their union membership as a form of job security or as a means of retaining union benefits, such persons may <PRTPAGE P="187"/>not be candidates for or hold office. <SU>29</SU>
                  <FTREF/> Whether a restriction on officeholding by members who are group leaders or others performing some supervisory duties is reasonable depends on the particular circumstances. For instance, if such persons might be considered “supervisors” <SU>30</SU>
                  <FTREF/> under the LMRA, their right to be candidates under the Act may be limited. Another factor in determining the reasonableness of a ban on such persons is the position (if any) of the NLRB on the status of the particular employees involved. If, for example, the NLRB has determined that certain group leaders are part of the bargaining unit, it might be unreasonable for the union to prohibit them from running for office. An overall consideration in determining whether a member may fairly be denied the right to be a candidate for union office as an employer or supervisor is whether there is a reasonable basis for assuming that the person involved would be subject to a conflict of interest in carrying out his representative duties for employees and rank and file union members.</P>

                <P>(a) Unions may establish such other reasonable rules as are necessary to protect the members against leaders who may have committed serious offenses against the union. For example, a union may, after appropriate proceedings, bar from office persons who have misappropriated union funds, even if such persons were never indicted and convicted in a court of law for their offenses. Of course, the union would have to provide reasonable precautions to insure that no member is made ineligible to hold office on the basis of unsupported allegations and that any rights guaranteed him by the constitution and bylaws are protected. Similarly, a union may require an elected officer to sign an affidavit averring that he is not barred from serving as an officer by the provisions of section 504 of the Act since the union and its officers may not permit a person to serve as an officer if he is so barred (see footnote 23).</P>
                <P>(b) It would not violate the Act for a union to prohibit successive terms in office or to limit the number of years an officer may serve. Such rules are intended to encourage as many members as possible to seek positions of leadership in the organization.</P>

So long as such action is conducted in accordance with section 101(a)(5), a union may, for example, if its constitution and bylaws so provide, bar from office for a period of time any member who is guilty of specific acts, such as strikebreaking, detrimental to the union as an institution. However, if a union has improperly disciplined a member and barred him from candidacy, the Secretary may, in an appropriate case, treat him as a member in good standing entitled to all of the rights of members guaranteed by title IV.</P>

                <P>Qualifications for office which may seem reasonable on their face may not be proper if they are applied in an unreasonable manner or if they are not applied in a uniform way. An essential element of reasonableness is adequate advance notice to the membership of the precise terms of the requirement.

                  <FTREF/> Qualifications must be specific and objective. They must contain specific standards of eligibility by which any member can determine in advance whether or not he is qualified to be a candidate. For example, a constitutional provision which states that “a candidate shall not be eligible to run for office who intends to use his office as a cloak to effect purposes inimical to the scope and policies of the union” would not be a reasonable qualification within the meaning of section 401(e) because it is so general as to preclude a candidate from ascertaining whether he is eligible and would permit determinations of eligibility based on subjective judgments. Further, such a requirement is by its nature not capable of being uniformly imposed as required by section 401(e).</P>

                <SUBJECT>Notice.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) To meet this requirement, the labor organization must give timely notice reasonably calculated to inform all members of the offices to be filled in the election as well as the time, place, and form for submitting nominations. Such notice should be distinguished from the notice of election, discussed in § 452.99. Notice of nominations need not necessarily be given at least 15 days before nominations are held, nor is it required to be given by mail. In an election which is to be held by secret ballot, accordingly, notice of nominations may be given in any manner reasonably calculated to reach all members in good standing and in sufficient time to permit such members to nominate the candidates of their choice, so long as it is in accordance with the provisions of the labor organization's constitution or bylaws. Mailing such notice to the last known address of each member within a reasonable time prior to the date for making nominations would satisfy this requirement. Likewise, timely publication in the union newspaper with sufficient prominence to be seen by all members would be adequate notice. The method of making nominations, whether by mail, petition, or at meetings, could affect the determination of the timeliness of the notice. The nomination notice may be combined with the election notice if the requirements of both are met. Posting of a nomination notice may satisfy the requirement of a reasonable opportunity for making nominations if such posting is reasonably calculated to inform all members in good standing in sufficient time to permit such members to nominate the candidates of their choice.</P>

                <P>(a) When officers of a national or international labor organization or of an intermediate body are to be elected by secret ballot among the members of the constituent local unions, it is not unreasonable for the organization to employ a nominating procedure whereby each local may nominate only one <PRTPAGE P="190"/>candidate for each office. When such a procedure is employed the organization may require that each candidate be nominated by a certain number of locals before his name will appear on the ballot.

                <P>The Act imposes the duty on the union and its officers to comply with all reasonable requests of any candidate to distribute his campaign literature to the membership at his expense. When the organization or its officers authorize distribution of campaign literature on behalf of any candidate, similar distribution under the same conditions must be made for any other candidate, if he requests it.

                <P>Although section 401(c) specifies distribution to “all members in good standing,” a labor organization must also honor requests for distribution of literature to only a portion of the membership if such distribution is practicable. Each candidate may choose his own ways of campaigning for election according to his own ingenuity and resources. For example, some candidates for national or international union office may desire to limit distribution to delegates, but others may want to appeal directly to the membership or parts thereof in an effort to influence particular constituencies to choose delegates favorable to their candidacy.</P>

                <P>Each candidate must be treated equally with respect to the expense of such distribution. Thus, a union and its officers must honor a candidate's request for distribution where the candidate is willing and able to bear the expense of such distribution. However, should the candidate be unable to bear such expense, there is no requirement that the union distribute the literature of the candidate free of charge. In the event the union distributes any candidate's literature without charge, however, all other candidates are entitled to have their literature distributed on the same basis. Since labor organizations have an affirmative duty to comply with all reasonable requests of any candidate to distribute campaign literature (at the candidate's expense), a union rule refusing all such distributions would not be proper, even though applied in a nondiscriminatory fashion. In view of the fact that expenses of distribution are to be borne by the candidate a labor organization may not refuse to distribute campaign literature merely because it may have a small staff which cannot handle such distribution for all candidates. If this is the case, the organization may employ additional temporary staff or contract the job to a professional mailer and charge the expense incurred to the candidates for whom the service is being rendered. The organization may require candidates to tender in advance the estimated costs of distributing their literature, if such requirement is applied uniformly.</P>

This is left to the discretion of each candidate. The labor organization may not require that it be permitted to read a copy of the literature before it is sent out, nor may it censor the statements of the candidates in any way, even though the statement may include derogatory remarks about other candidates.

The list is not required to be maintained continuously and may be compiled immediately before each election. The form in which the list is to be maintained is not specified by the Act. Thus, a card index system may satisfy the requirements of the Act. The list may be organized alphabetically or geographically, or by local in a national or international labor organization.</P>
                <P>(b) It is the duty of the labor organization and its officers to refrain from discrimination in favor of or against any candidate with respect to the use of lists of members. Thus, if a union permits any candidate to use such lists in any way other than the right of inspection granted by the Act, it must inform all candidates of the availability of the list for that purpose and accord the same privilege to all candidates who request it. Such privileges may include permitting inspection of the list where members are not subject to a collective bargaining agreement requiring membership as a condition of employment, inspecting the list more than once, or copying the list.</P>

The opportunity to inspect the lists must be granted once during the 30-day period prior to the casting of ballots in the election.

Thus, a union may neither attack a candidate in a union-financed publication nor urge the nomination or election of a candidate in a union-financed letter to the members. Any such expenditure regardless of the amount, constitutes a violation of section 401(g). <SU>38</SU>

In holding such activity to be outside the prohibitions of section 401(g), although the committee was formed by defeated candidates and their supporters, the court stated that “* * * It does not promote the candidacy of any person if an election is declared invalid by a court under title IV's procedure despite the fact that in the rerun election the candidates may be identical. Neither the winner nor the loser of the disputed election gains votes by the setting aside of the election. Such action is not a vote-getting device but merely returns the parties to their pre-election status; it does not place any candidate into office.” <SU>39</SU>

                <SUBJECT>Expenditures by employers.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) As an additional safeguard, section 401(g) provides that no money of an employer is to be contributed or applied to promote the candidacy of any person in an election subject to the provisions of title IV. This includes indirect as well as direct expenditures. Thus, for example, campaigning by union stewards on company time with the approval of the employer would violate section 401(g) unless it can be shown that they are on legitimate work assignments, and that their campaign activities are only incidental to the performance of their assigned task and do not interfere with its performance. This prohibition against the use of employer money includes any costs incurred by an employer, or anything of value contributed by an employer, in order to support the candidacy of any individual in an election. It would not, however, extend to ordinary business practices which result in conferring a benefit, such as, for example, a discount on the cost of printing campaign literature which is made available on the same terms to other customers.</P>

                <P>(b) The prohibition against the use of employer money to support the candidacy of a person in any election subject to the provisions of title IV is not restricted to employers who employ members of the labor organization in which the election is being conducted, <PRTPAGE P="194"/>or who have any business or contractual relationship with the labor organization.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Opportunity to campaign.</SUBJECT>
                <P>There must be a reasonable period prior to the election during which office-seekers and their supporters may engage in the campaigning that the Act contemplates and guarantees. What is a reasonable period of time would depend upon the circumstances, including the method of nomination and the size of the union holding the election, both in terms of the number of members and the geographic area in which it operates. For example, a candidate for office in a local labor organization was improperly disqualified and then appealed to the international union which directed that his name be placed on the ballot. A complaint was considered properly filed alleging election violations because the candidate's name was restored to the ballot two days prior to the election so that he was denied an equal opportunity to campaign. Similarly, in a mail ballot election a union's delay in the distribution of campaign literature until after the ballots have been distributed and some have been cast would not satisfy the requirement to distribute such literature in compliance with a reasonable request. <SU>40</SU>
                  <FTREF/> Such a delay would deny the candidate a reasonable opportunity to campaign prior to the election and would thus not meet the requirement for adequate safeguards to insure a fair election. Where access to the convention floor is limited exclusively to delegates at a convention at which officers are to be elected, there must, nevertheless, be equal opportunity for all nominees to campaign. Thus, if the privilege of addressing the convention is accorded to any of the nominees, it must be accorded to all nominees who request it, whether they are delegates or not.</P>

                <P>A labor organization may condition the exercise of the right to vote upon the payment of dues, which is a basic obligation of membership. Such a rule must be applied uniformly. If a member has not paid his dues as required by the labor organization's constitution or bylaws he may not be allowed to vote. Thus, a rule which suspends a member's right to vote in an election of officers while the member is laid off and is not paying dues would not, in ordinary circumstances, be considered unreasonable, so long as it is applied in a nondiscriminatory manner. However, members must be afforded a reasonable opportunity to pay dues, including a grace period during which dues may be paid without any loss of rights. In the case where a member is laid off but desires to maintain his good standing and thus his membership rights by continuing to pay dues, it would be clearly unreasonable for the labor organization to refuse to accept his payment.</P>

                <P>A member in good standing whose dues are checked off by his employer pursuant to his voluntary authorization provided for in a collective bargaining agreement may not be disqualified from voting by reason of alleged delay or default in the payment of dues. For example, the constitution and bylaws of a labor organization call for suspension of members whose dues are three months in arrears. Dues to be paid directly by a member are two months in arrears when the union changes to a checkoff system. The member may not be denied the right to vote merely because the employer is late in submitting the checked off dues for the first month. It would not be inconsistent with the Act, however, for a union to require a new member who executes a checkoff authorization to pay one month's dues in advance on the date he becomes a member in order to be in good standing for the current month.</P>

After a member has resumed his good-standing status, it would be unreasonable to continue to deprive him of his right to vote for a period longer than that for a new member. A new member may reasonably be required to establish a relationship with the union by remaining in good standing for a continuous period of time, e.g., 6 <PRTPAGE P="196"/>months or a year, before being permitted to vote in an election of officers.

Thus, there is an obligation on the labor organization to conduct its periodic election of officers in such a way as to afford all its members a reasonable opportunity to cast ballots. A union may meet this obligation in a variety of ways, depending on factors such as the distance between the members' work site or homes and the polling place, the means of transportation available, the nature of the members' occupations, and their hours of work. A reasonable opportunity to vote may require establishing multiple polling places or the use of a mail ballot referendum when the members are widely dispersed. It would also be reasonable for the time period for voting to be extended to accommodate members who might otherwise be prevented from voting due to conflicting work schedules. Shortening the voting period by a late opening of the polls would not, in itself, be improper unless the intent or practical effect of such action is to deprive members of their right to vote.</P>

                <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>

                <P>The Act safeguards democratic processes by prescribing, in section 401, minimum standards for the regular periodic election of officers in labor organizations subject to its provisions. It <PRTPAGE P="197"/>does not, however, prescribe in detail election procedures which must be followed. Labor organizations are free to establish procedures for elections as long as they are fair to all members and are consistent with lawful provisions of the organization's constitution and bylaws and with section 401. The rights granted to members in section 401(e) refer to individuals, not labor organizations. For example, while locals may be members of an intermediate body, they are not entitled to the rights granted “members” in section 401(e).</P>

                <SUBJECT>Secret ballot.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) A prime requisite of elections regulated by title IV is that they be held by secret ballot among the members or in appropriate cases by representatives who themselves have been elected by secret ballot among the members. A secret ballot under the Act is “the expression by ballot, voting machine, or otherwise, but in no event by proxy, of a choice * * * cast in such a manner that the person expressing such choice cannot be identified with the choice expressed.” <SU>47</SU>
                  <FTREF/> Secrecy may be assured by the use of voting machines, or, if paper ballots are used, by providing voting booths, partitions, or other physical arrangements permitting privacy for the voter while he is marking his ballot. The ballot must not contain any markings which upon examination would enable one to identify it with the voter. Balloting by mail presents special problems in assuring secrecy. Although no particular method of assuring such secrecy is prescribed, secrecy may be assured by the use of a double envelope system for return of the voted ballots with the necessary voter identification appearing only on the outer envelope.</P>
                <FTNT>
                  <P>
                    <SU>47</SU> Act, sec. 3(k).</P>
                </FTNT>
                <P>(b) Should any voters be challenged as they are casting their ballots, there should be some means of setting aside the challenged ballots until a decision regarding their validity is reached without compromising the secrecy requirement. For example, each such ballot might be placed in an envelope with the voter's name on the outside. Of course, it would be a violation of the secrecy requirement to open these envelopes and count the ballots one at a time in such a way that each vote could be identified with a voter.</P>
                <P>(c) In a mail ballot election, a union may require members to sign the return envelope if the signatures may be used in determining eligibility. However, it would be unreasonable for a union to void an otherwise valid ballot merely because a member printed rather than signed his name if the union does not use the signatures to determine voter eligibility.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Outside agencies.</SUBJECT>
                <P>There is nothing in the Act to prevent a union from employing an independent organization as its agent to handle the printing, mailing, and counting of ballots in such elections if all the standards of the Act are met.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Notice of election.</SUBJECT>
                <P>Elections required by title IV to be held by secret ballot must be preceded by a notice of election mailed to each member at his last known home address not less than fifteen days prior to the election. <SU>48</SU>

                  <FTREF/> For purposes of computing the fifteen day period, the day on which the notices are mailed is not counted whereas the day of the election is counted. For example, if the election is to be held on the 20th day of the month, the notices must be mailed no later than the 5th day. The notice must include a specification of the date, time and place of the election and of the offices to be filled, and it must be in such form as to be reasonably calculated to inform the members of the impending election. Specification of the offices to be filled would not be necessary if it is a regular, periodic election of all officers and the notice so indicates. A statement in the union bylaws that an election will be held at a certain time does not constitute the notice required by the statute. Since the Act specifies that the notice must be mailed, other means of transmission such as posting on a bulletin board or hand delivery will not satisfy the requirement. A notice of election must be sent to every member as defined in section 3(o) of the Act, not only to <PRTPAGE P="198"/>members who are eligible to vote in the election. Where the notice, if mailed to the last known permanent or legal residence of the member, would not be likely to reach him because of a known extended absence from that place, the statutory phrase “last known home address” may reasonably be interpreted to refer to the last known temporary address of definite duration. A single notice for both nominations and election may be used if it meets the requirements of both such notices. <SU>49</SU>

Likewise, the fifteen-day election notice requirement applies to any runoff election which may be held after an inconclusive election. However, a separate notice would not be necessary if the election notice for the first election advises the members of the possibility of a runoff election and specifies such details as the time and place of such runoff election as may be necessary.</P>

                <P>(a) The statutory requirement for giving fifteen days' notice of election is a minimum standard. There is no objection to giving more notice than is required by law. However, it was clearly the intent of Congress to have members notified at a time which reasonably precedes the date of the election. For example, notice in a union publication which is expected to cover elections to be held six months later would not be considered reasonable.</P>
                <P>(b) Should a union change the date of an election from the date originally announced in the mail notice to the members, it must mail a second notice, containing the corrected date, at least fifteen days before the election.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Observers.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Under the provisions of section 401(c), each candidate must be permitted to have an observer (1) at the polls and (2) at the counting of the ballots. This right encompasses every phase and level of the counting and tallying process, including the counting and tallying of the ballots and the totaling, recording, and reporting of tally sheets. If there is more than one polling place, the candidate may have an observer at each location. If ballots are being counted at more than one location or at more than one table at a single location, a candidate is entitled to as many observers as necessary to observe the actual counting of ballots. The observer may note the names of those voting so that the candidates may be able to ascertain whether unauthorized persons voted in the election. The observers should be placed so that they do not compromise, or give the appearance of compromising, the secrecy of the ballot. The observer is not required to be a member of the labor organization unless the union's constitution and bylaws require him to be a member. There is no prohibition on the use of alternate observers, when necessary, or on a candidate serving as his own observer. Observers do not have the right to count the ballots.</P>
                <P>(b) The right to have an observer at the polls and at the counting of the ballots extends to all candidates for office in an election subject to title IV, i.e., this includes elections in intermediate bodies as well as elections in locals and national and international labor organizations.</P>
                <P>(c) In any secret ballot election which is conducted by mail, regardless of whether the ballots are returned by members to the labor organization office, to a mail box, or to an independent agency such as a firm of certified public accountants, candidates must be permitted to have an observer present at the preparation and mailing of the ballots, their receipt by the counting agency and at the opening and counting of the ballots.</P>
                <P>(d) Paying election observers is the responsibility of the candidate they represent unless the union has a rule providing for the payment of observers. If the union does have such a rule, it must be uniformly applied to all candidates.</P>

                <P>In any election which is required by the Act to be held by secret ballot, the votes cast by members of each local labor organization must be counted, and the results published, separately. <SU>52</SU>

                  <FTREF/> For example, where officers of an intermediate body are elected directly by members, the votes of each local must be tabulated and published separately. The publishing requirement is to assure that the results of the voting in each local are made known to all interested members. Thus, the presentation of the election report at a regular local membership meeting, and the entry of the report in the minutes, would normally accomplish this purpose in a local election. Such minutes would have to be available for inspection by members at reasonable times, unless copies of the report are made available. In an election that encompasses more than one local, publication may be accomplished by posting on appropriate <PRTPAGE P="200"/>bulletin boards, or in a union newspaper, or by any procedure which allows any member to obtain the information without unusual effort. Of course, the counting and reporting should account for all ballots cast in the election, although only valid votes will be counted in determining the successful candidates.</P>

A labor organization's wide range of discretion regarding the conduct of elections is thus circumscribed by a general rule of fairness. For example, if one candidate is permitted to have his nickname appear on the ballot, his opponent should enjoy the same privilege.</P>

A determination as to the position of a candidate's name on the ballot may be made by the union in any reasonable manner permitted by its constitution and bylaws, consistent with the requirement of fairness and the other provisions of the Act. For example, candidates may be listed according to their affiliation with a particular slate. However, while “slate voting” is permissible, the balloting must be consistent with the right of members to vote for the candidates of their choice. Thus, there must be provision for the voter to choose among individual candidates if he does not wish to vote for an entire slate. To avoid any misunderstanding in this regard, the voting instructions should specifically inform the voter that he need not vote for an entire slate.</P>

                <P>Officers of labor organizations who have been elected by secret ballot vote of their respective memberships may, by virtue of their election to office, serve as delegates to conventions at which officers will be elected, if the constitution and bylaws of the labor organization so provide. In such cases it is advisable to have a statement to this effect included on the ballots. Persons who have been appointed to serve unexpired terms of officers who are ex officio delegates to a convention at which officers will be elected may not vote for officers in such election.</P>

                <P>While officers of national or international labor organizations or of intermediate bodies who have been elected by a vote of the delegates to a convention may serve as delegates to conventions of their respective labor organizations if the constitution and bylaws so provide, they may not vote in officer elections at such conventions unless they have also been elected as delegates by a secret ballot vote of the members they are to represent. Of course, such officers may participate in the convention, i.e., they may preside over the convention, be nominated as candidates, or act in other capacities permitted under the organization's constitution and bylaws.</P>

                <P>A delegate from an intermediate body who participates in the election of officers at a national or international convention must have been elected by a secret ballot vote of the individual members of the constituent units of that body. He may not participate if he was elected by the delegates who make up the intermediate body. <PRTPAGE P="202"/>The secret ballot election required by the Act is an election among the general membership and not an election of delegates by other delegates.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Elections of intermediate body officers.</SUBJECT>
                <P>Section 401(d) states that officers of intermediate bodies shall be elected either by secret ballot among the members in good standing or by labor organization officers representative of such members who have been elected by secret ballot. The phrase “officers representative of such members” includes delegates who have been elected by secret ballot to represent labor organizations in intermediate bodies. Such delegates may therefore participate in the election of officers of intermediate bodies regardless of whether they are characterized as officers of the labor organization they represent.</P>

The following example is typical in organizations of railway employees. The chairman of a local grievance committee, which is not a labor organization under the Act, is not an officer within the meaning of the Act. If such a local chairman is a delegate to the general grievance committee, which is considered to be an intermediate body under the Act, however, he must be elected by secret ballot vote of the members he represents, if he votes for officers of the general grievance committee.</P>

There is no indication that Congress intended, in enacting title IV of the Act, to require representation in delegate bodies of labor organizations to reflect the proportionate number of members in each subordinate labor organization represented in such bodies. Questions of such proportionate representation are determined in accordance with the labor organization's constitution and bylaws insofar as they are not inconsistent with the election provisions of the Act. Congress did not attempt to specify the organizational structure or the system of representation which unions must adopt. However, all members must be represented; the union may not deny representation to locals below a certain size.</P>

                  <FTREF/> The complaint may not be filed until one of the two following conditions has been met: (1) The member must have exhausted the remedies available to him under the constitution and bylaws of the organization and its parent body, or (2) he must have invoked such remedies without obtaining a final decision within three calendar months after invoking them.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Investigation of complaint by Office of Labor-Management Standards, court action by the Secretary.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) The Office of Labor-Management Standards is required to investigate each complaint of a violation filed in accordance with the requirements of the Act and, if the Secretary finds probable cause to believe that a violation has occurred and has not been <PRTPAGE P="204"/>remedied, he is directed to bring within 60 days after the complaint has been filed a civil action against the labor organization in a Federal district court. In any such action brought by the Secretary the statute provides that if, upon a preponderance of the evidence after a trial upon the merits, the court finds (1) that an election has not been held within the time prescribed by the election provisions of the Act or (2) that a violation of these provisions “may have affected the outcome of an election”, the court shall declare the election, if any, to be void and direct the conduct of an election under the supervision of the Secretary, and, so far as is lawful and practicable, in conformity with the constitution and bylaws of the labor organization.</P>
                <P>(b) Violations of the election provisions of the Act which occurred in the conduct of elections held within the prescribed time are not grounds for setting aside an election unless they “may have affected the outcome.” The Secretary, therefore, will not institute court proceedings upon the basis of a complaint alleging such violations unless he finds probable cause to believe that they “may have affected the outcome of an election.”</P>
                <P>(b-1) The Supreme Court, in <E T="03">Hodgson</E> v. <E T="03">Local Union 6799, Steelworkers Union of America,</E> 403 U.S. 333, 91 S.Ct. 1841 (1971), ruled that the Secretary of Labor may not include in his complaint a violation which was known to the protesting member but was not raised in the member's protest to the union.</P>
                <FP>Complaints filed by the Department of Labor will accordingly be limited by that decision to the matters which may fairly be deemed to be within the scope of the member's internal protest and those which investigation discloses he could not have been aware of.</FP>
                <P>(c) Elections challenged by a member are presumed valid pending a final decision. The statute provides that until such time, the affairs of the labor organization shall be conducted by the elected officers or in such other manner as the union constitution and bylaws provide. However, after suit is filed by the Secretary the court has power to take appropriate action to preserve the labor organization's assets.</P>

Where the modification of the constitution and bylaws of a local labor organization requires action by the membership at a general meeting or by referendum, the general membership would be a “governing body” within the meaning of this provision. In the cases where any necessary modification of the constitution and bylaws can be made only by a constitutional convention of the labor organization, the election provisions become applicable not later than the next constitutional convention after the enactment of the statute, or one year after the enactment of the statute, whichever is sooner.</P>

                <P>(b) The statute does not require the calling of a special constitutional convention to make such modifications. However, if no convention is held within the one-year period, the executive board or similar governing body that has the power to act for the labor organization between conventions is empowered by the statute to make such interim constitutional changes as are necessary to carry out the provisions of title IV of the Act. Any election held thereafter would have to comply with the requirements of the Act.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Functions of the Department of Labor.</E> This part discusses the meaning and scope of section 502 of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 <SU>1</SU>
                  <FTREF/> (hereinafter referred to as <PRTPAGE P="206"/>the Act), which requires the bonding of certain officials, representatives, and employees of labor organizations and of trusts in which labor organizations are interested. The provisions of section 502 are subject to the general investigatory authority of the Secretary of Labor, embodied in section 601 of the Act (and delegated by him to the Director), which empowers him to investigate whenever he believes it necessary in order to determine whether any person has violated or is about to violate any provisions of the Act (except title I or amendments to other statutes made by section 505 or title VII). The Department of Labor is also authorized, under the general provisions of section 607, to forward to the Attorney General, for appropriate action, any evidence of violations of section 502 developed in such investigations, as may be found to warrant criminal prosecution under the Act or other Federal law.</P>

                  <FTREF/> The correctness of an interpretation can be determined finally and authoritatively only by the courts. It is necessary, however, for the Director to reach informed conclusions as to the meaning of the law to enable him to carry out his statutory duties of administration and enforcement. The interpretations of the Director contained in this part, which are issued upon the advice of the Solicitor of Labor, indicate the construction of the law which will guide him in performing his duties unless and until he is directed otherwise by authoritative rulings of the courts or unless and until he subsequently decides that a prior interpretation is incorrect. However, the omission to discuss a particular problem in this part, or in interpretations supplementing it, should not be taken to indicate the adoption of any position by the Director with respect to such problem or to constitute an administrative interpretation or practice.</P>

                <P>With respect to labor organizations, the term “officer, agent, shop steward, or other representative” is defined in section 3(q) of the Act to include “elected officials and key administrative personnel, whether elected or appointed (such as business agents, heads of departments or major units, and organizers who exercise substantial independent authority)”. Other individuals employed by a labor organization, including salaried non-supervisory professional staff, stenographic, and service personnel are “employees” and must be bonded if they handle <SU>5</SU>

Thus, the term covers trustees and key administrative personnel of trusts, such as the administrator of a trust, heads of departments or major units, and persons in similar positions. It covers such personnel, including trustees, regardless of whether they are representatives of or selected by labor organizations, or representatives of or selected by employers, <SU>6</SU>

The change between the two versions originated in the House Committee on Education and Labor. Prior to the reporting of the bill (H.R. 8342) by that Committee, a joint subcommittee of that Committee held extensive hearings, during the course of which witnesses including President Meany of the AFL-CIO criticized the bonding provision of the Senate bill on the ground that it required only union personnel of joint employer-union trusts to be bonded. (See Record of Hearings before a Joint Subcommittee of the Committee on Education <PRTPAGE/>and Labor, House of Representatives, 86th Congress, 1st Session, on H.R. 3540, H.R. 3302, H.R. 4473 and H.R. 4474, pp. 1493-94, 1979.</P>

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Independent institutions not included.</E> The analogy to the definition of the term “officer, agent, shop steward, or other representative,” when used with respect to a labor organization, shows that banks and other qualified financial institutions in which trust funds are deposited are not to be considered as “agents” or “representatives” of trusts within the meaning of section 502 and thus are not subject to the bonding requirement, even though they may also have administrative or management responsibilities with respect to such trusts. Similarly, the bonding requirement does not apply to brokers or other independent contractors who have contracted with trusts for the performance of functions which are normally not carried out by officials or employees of such trusts such as the buying of securities, the performance of other investment functions, or the transportation of funds by armored truck.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Employees of a trust in which a labor organization is interested.</E> As in the case of labor organizations, all individuals employed by a trust in which a labor organization is interested are “employees,” regardless of whether, technically, they are employed by the trust, by the trustees, by the trust administrator, or by trust officials in similar positions.</P>

                <P>The affirmative requirement for bonding the specified personnel is applicable only if they handle “funds or other property” of the labor organization or trust concerned. A consideration of the purpose of section 502 and a reading of the section as a whole, including provisions for fixing the amount of bonds, suffice to show that the term “funds or other property”, as used in this section of the Act, encompasses more than cash alone but that it does not embrace all of the property of a labor organization or of a trust in which a labor organization is interested. The term does not include property of a relatively permanent nature, such as land, buildings, furniture, fixtures and office and delivery equipment used in the operations of a labor organization or trust. It does, however, include items in the nature of quick assets, such as checks and other negotiable instruments, government obligations and marketable securities, as well as cash, and other property held, not for use, but for conversion into cash or for similar purposes making it substantially equivalent to funds.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Personnel who “handle” funds or other property.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">General considerations.</E> Section 502(a) requires “every” person specified in its bonding requirement “who handles” funds or other property of the labor organization or trust to be bonded. It does not contain any exemption based on the amount of the funds or other property handled by particular personnel. Therefore, if the bonding requirement is otherwise applicable to such persons, the amount of the funds or the value of the property handled by them does not affect such applicability. In determining whether a person “handles” funds or other property within the meaning of section 502(a), however, it is important to consider the term “handles” in the light of the basic purpose which Congress sought to achieve by the bonding requirement and the language chosen to make that purpose effective. Thus, while it is clear that section 502(a) should be considered as representing the minimum requirements which Congress deemed necessary in order to insure the reasonable protection of the funds and other property of labor organizations and trusts within the coverage of the section, it is equally clear from the legislative history <SU>7</SU>
                  <FTREF/> and the language used <PRTPAGE P="209"/>that Congress was aware of cost considerations and did not intend to require unreasonable, unnecessary or duplicative bonding. In terms of these general considerations, more specific content may be assigned to the term “handles” by reference to the prohibition in section 502(a) against permitting any person not covered by an appropriate bond “to receive, handle, disburse, or otherwise exercise custody or control” of the funds or other property of a labor organization or of a trust in which a labor organization is interested. The phrase “receive, handle, disburse, or otherwise exercise custody or control” is not to be considered as expanding the scope of the term “handles” but rather as indicating facets of “handles” which in a specific prohibition, Congress believed should be clearly set forth.</P>

                </FTNT>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Persons included generally.</E> The basic objective of section 502(a) is to provide reasonable protection of funds or other property rather than to insure against every conceivable possibility of loss. Accordingly, a person shall be deemed to be “handling” funds or other property, so as to require bonding under that section, whenever his duties or activities with respect to given funds or other property are such that there is a significant risk of loss by reason of fraud or dishonesty on the part of such person, acting either alone or in collusion with others.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Physical contact as criterion of “handling.”</E> Physical dealing with funds or other property is, under the principles above stated, not necessarily a controlling criterion in every case for determining the persons who “handle” within the meaning of section 502(a). Physical contact with cash, checks or similar property generally constitutes “handling.” On the other hand, bonding may not be required for office personnel who from time to time perform counting, packaging, tabulating or similar duties which involve physical contact with checks, securities, or other funds or property but which are performed under conditions that cannot reasonably be said to give rise to significant risks with respect to the receipt, safekeeping or disbursement of funds or property. This may be the case where significant risks of fraud or dishonesty in the performance of duties of an essentially clerical character are precluded by the closeness of the supervision provided or by the nature of the funds or other property handled.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">“Handling” funds or other property without physical contact.</E> Personnel who do not physically handle funds or property may nevertheless “handle” within the meaning of section 502(a) where they have or perform significant duties with respect to the receipt, safekeeping or disbursement of funds or other property. For example, persons who have access to a safe deposit box or similar depository for the purpose of adding to, withdrawing, checking or otherwise dealing with its contents may be said to “handle” these contents within the meaning of section 502(a) even though they do not at any time during the year actually secure such access for such purposes. Similarly, those charged with general responsibility for the safekeeping of funds or other property such as the treasurer of a labor organization, should be considered as handling funds or other property. It should also be noted that the extent of actual authority to deal with funds or property may be immaterial where custody or other functions have been granted which create a substantial risk of fraud or dishonesty. Thus, if a bank account were maintained in the name of a particular officer or employee whose signature the bank were authorized to honor, it could not be contended that he did not “handle” funds merely because he had been forbidden by the organization or by his superiors to make deposits or withdrawals.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Disbursement of funds or other property.</E> It is clear from both the purpose and language of section 502(a) that personnel described in the section who actually disburse funds or other property, such as officers or trustees authorized to sign checks or persons who make cash disbursements, must be considered as handling such funds and property. Whether others who may influence, authorize or direct disbursements must also be considered to handle funds or other property can be determined only by reference to the specific <PRTPAGE P="210"/>duties or responsibilities of these persons in a particular labor organization or trust.</P>

                <SUBJECT>“Handling” of funds or other property by personnel functioning as a governing body.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a)(1) <E T="03">General considerations.</E> For many labor organizations and trusts special problems involving disbursements will be presented by those who, as trustees or members of an executive board or similar governing body, are, as a group, charged with general responsibility for the conduct of the business and affairs of the organization or trust. Often such bodies may approve contracts, authorize disbursements, audit accounts and exercise similar responsibilities.</P>
                <P>(2) It is difficult to formulate any general rule for such cases. The mere fact that a board of trustees, executive board or similar governing body has general supervision of the affairs of a trust or labor organization, including investment policy and the establishment of fiscal controls, would not necessarily mean that the members of this body “handle” the funds or other property of the organization. On the other hand, the facts may indicate that the board or other body exercises such close, day-to-day supervision of those directly charged with the handling of funds or other property that it might be unreasonable to conclude that the members of such board were not, as a group, also participating in the handling of such funds and property. <SU>8</SU>
                  <FTREF/> Also, whether or not the members of a particular board of trustees or executive board handle funds or other property in their capacity as such, certain of these members may hold other offices or have other functions involving duties directly related to the receipt, safekeeping or disbursement of the funds or other property of the organization so that it would be necessary that they be bonded irrespective of their board membership.</P>

                </FTNT>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Nature of responsibilities as affecting “handling.”</E> With respect to particular responsibilities of boards of trustees, executive boards and similar bodies in disbursing funds or other property, much would depend upon the system of fiscal controls provided in a particular trust or labor organization. The allocation of funds or authorization of disbursements for a particular purpose is not necessarily handling of funds within the meaning of the section. If the allocation or authorization merely permits expenditures by a disbursing officer who has responsibility for determining the validity or propriety of particular expenditures, then the action of the disbursing officer and not that of the board would constitute handling. But if pursuant to a direction of the board, the disbursing officer performed only ministerial acts without responsibility to determine whether the expenditures were valid or appropriate, then the board's action would constitute handling. In such a case, the absence of fraud or dishonesty in the acts of the disbursing officer alone would not necessarily prevent fraudulent or dishonest disbursements. The person or persons who are charged with or exercise responsibility for determining whether specific disbursements are bona fide, regular, and in accordance with the applicable constitution, trust instrument, resolution or other laws or documents governing the disbursement of funds or other property should be considered to handle such funds and property and be bonded accordingly.</P>

It does not have reference to the special duties imposed upon representatives of labor organizations by virtue of the positions of trust which they occupy, which are dealt with in section 501(a), and for which civil remedies for breach of the duties are provided in section 501(b). The fact that the bonding requirement is limited to personnel who handle funds or other property indicates the correctness of these conclusions. They find further support in the differences between sections 501(a) and 502(a) of the Act which sufficiently indicate that the scope of the two sections is not coextensive.</P>

As usually applied under State laws, the term “fraud or dishonesty” encompasses such matters as larceny, theft, embezzlement, forgery, misappropriation, wrongful abstraction, wrongful conversion, willful misapplication or any other fraudulent or dishonest acts resulting in financial loss.</P>

                <SUBJECT>The meaning of “funds.”</SUBJECT>

                <P>While the protection of bonds required under the Act must extend to any actual loss from the acts of fraud or dishonesty in the handling of “funds or other property” (§ 453.7), the amount of the bond depends upon the “funds” handled by the personnel bonded and their predecessors, if any. “Funds” as here used is not defined in the Act. As in the case of “funds or other property” discussed earlier in § 453.7, the term would not include property of a relatively permanent nature such as land, buildings, furniture, fixtures, or property similarly held for use in the operations of the labor organization or trust rather than as quick assets. In its normal meaning, however, “funds” would include, in addition to cash, items such as bills and notes, government obligations and marketable securities, and in a particular case might well include all the “funds or other property” handled during the year in the positions occupied by the particular personnel for whom the bonding is required. In any event, it is clear that bonds fixed in the amount of 10 percent or more of the total “funds or other property” handled by the occupants of such positions during the preceding fiscal year would be in amounts sufficient to meet the statutory requirement. Of course, in situations where a significant saving in bonding costs might result from computing separately the amounts of “funds” and of “other property” handled, criteria for distinguishing particular items to be included in the quoted terms would prove useful. While the criteria to be applied in a particular case would depend on all the relevant facts concerning the specific items handled, it may be assumed as a general principle that at least those items which may be handled in a manner similar to cash and which involve a like risk of loss <PRTPAGE P="212"/>should be included in computing the amount of “funds” handled.</P>

                <P>The funds handled by personnel required to be bonded and their predecessors during the course of a fiscal year would ordinarily include the total of whatever such funds were on hand at the beginning of the fiscal year plus any items received or added in the form of funds during the year for any reason, such as dues, fees and assessments, trust receipts, or items received as a result of sales, investments, reinvestments, or otherwise. It would not, however, be necessary to count the same item twice in arriving at the total funds handled by personnel during a year. Once an item properly within the category of “funds” had been counted as handled by personnel during a year, there would be no need to count it again should it subsequently be handled by the same personnel during the same year in some other connection.</P>

                <P>The amount of any required bond is determined by the total funds handled during a fiscal year by each “person” bonded, and any predecessors of such “person”. The term “person”, however, is defined in section 3(d) of the Act to include “one or more” of the various individuals or entities there listed, so that there may be numerous instances where the bond of a “person” may include several individuals. Wherever this is the case, the amount of the bond for that “person” would, of course, be based on the total funds handled by all who comprise the “person” included in the bond, without regard to the precise extent to which any particular individual might have handled such funds. This would be the situation, for example, in many cases of joint or group activity in the performance of a single function. It would also be true where various individuals performed the same type of function for an organization, even though they acted independently of one another. There would, however, be no objection to bonding each individual separately, and fixing the amount of his bond on the basis of the total funds which he individually handled during the year.</P>

                <P>The amount of any required bond must in each instance be based on funds handled “during the preceding fiscal year,” and must be fixed “at the beginning” of an organization's fiscal year—that is, as soon after the date when such year begins as the necessary information from the preceding fiscal year can practicably be ascertained. This does not mean, however, that a new bond must be obtained each year. There is nothing in the Act which prohibits a bond for a term longer than one year, with whatever advantages such a bond might offer by way of a lower premium, but at the beginning of each fiscal year during its term the bond must be in at least the requisite amount. If it is below that level at that time for any reason, it would then be necessary either to modify the existing bond to increase it to the proper amount or to obtain a supplementary bond. In either event, the terms upon which this could best be done would be left to the parties directly concerned.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">General consideration.</E> In addition to such substantive matters as the personnel who must be bonded and the scope and the amount of the prescribed bonds, which have been discussed previously, the form of the bonds is the subject of a specific provision of section 502(a). Under this provision, a bond meeting the substantive requirements of the section may be either “individual or schedule in form.” These terms are not specially defined and could be descriptive of a variety of possible forms of bonds. According to trade usage, an individual bond is a single bond covering a single named individual to a designated amount, and bonds “schedule in form” may include either name schedule or position schedule bonds. A name schedule bond is typically a single bond covering a series or list of named individuals, each <PRTPAGE P="213"/>of whom is bonded separately to a designated amount. A position schedule bond is typically a single bond providing coverage with respect to any occupant or holder of one or more specified positions during the term of the bond, each office or position being covered to a designated amount. In a statute relating to trade or commerce, it is frequently helpful to consider whatever trade or commercial usages may have developed with respect to the statutory terms. <SU>9</SU>

                </FTNT>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Particular forms of bonds.</E> If the phrase “individual or schedule in form” is considered in light of the trade usages, section 502(a) at least permits bonds which are individual, name schedule or position schedule in form. Of course, section 502(a) does not require any particular type of individual or schedule bonds where different types exist or may be developed. It could not be said, for example, that a bond which schedules positions according to similarities in duties, risks, or required amounts of coverage is not “schedule in form” within the meaning of section 502(a) merely because the particular form of scheduling involved was not employed in bonds current at the time the section became law. A more specific illustration would be a bond scheduling shop stewards as a group because of the similar duties they perform in collecting dues, or members of an executive board as a group because of the fact that duties are imposed upon the board as such. A bond of this type would be “schedule in form” within the meaning of section 502(a) and, assuming adequacy of amount and coverage of all persons whom it is necessary to bond, such a bond would be in conformity with the statute. Also, a bond scheduling positions or groups of positions according to amounts of funds handled by occupants of the positions could be viewed as “schedule in form.”</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Additional bonding.</E> Section 502(a) neither prevents additional bonding beyond that required by its terms nor prescribes the form in which such additional coverage may be taken. Thus, so long as a particular bond is schedule in form as to the personnel required to be bonded and schedules coverage of these persons in at least the minimum required amount, additional coverage either as to personnel or amount may be taken in any form either in the same or in separate bonds. A bond which provided name or position schedule coverage for all persons required to be bonded under section 502(a), each scheduled person or position being bonded in at least the required minimum amount, would clearly be “schedule in form” within the meaning of section 502(a) regardless of the extent or form of additional schedule or blanket coverage provided in the same bond.</P>

                <P>Since section 502 is intended to protect the funds or other property of labor organizations and trusts in which labor organizations are interested, bonds under this section should allow for enforcement or recovery for the benefit of the labor organization or trust concerned by those ordinarily authorized to act for it in such matters. For example, in the case of a local labor organization, a bond would not be appropriate under section 502 if it protected only the interests of a national or international labor organization with which the local labor organization is affiliated or if it designated as the insured only some particular officer of the organization who does not legally represent it in similar formal instruments.</P>

The question of whether the relationship between the labor organization or the specified persons on the one hand, and another party or parties holding an interest in a broker, agent, or surety company on the other hand, is so close as to put the former in a position to influence or control the activities or operations of such broker, agent, or surety company through the latter, presents a question of fact which must necessarily be determined in each case in the light of all the pertinent circumstances.</P>
                <P>(c) It is also to be noted that the statute does not appear to restrict the disqualification to cases in which a direct or indirect interest is held by a labor organization as a whole, or by a substantial number of officers, agents, shop stewards, or other representatives of a labor organization, but provides for the disqualification also in cases where any one officer, agent, shop steward, or other representative of a labor organization holds such an interest.</P>

                <P>(a) Section 502(a) provides that persons who are not covered by bonds as required by that section shall not be permitted to receive, handle, disburse, or otherwise exercise custody or control of the funds or other property of a labor organization or of a trust in which a labor organization is interested. This prohibits personnel who are <PRTPAGE P="215"/>required to be bonded, as explained in § 453.8 from performing any of these acts without being covered by the required bonds. In addition, this provision makes it unlawful for any person with power to do so to delegate or assign the duties of receiving, handling, disbursing, or otherwise exercising custody or control of such funds or property to any person who is not bonded in accordance with the provisions of section 502(a).</P>
                <P>(b) The legislative history of the Act indicates, however, that it was not the intent of Congress to make compliance with the bonding requirements of section 502(a) a condition on the right of banks or other financial institutions to serve as the depository of the funds of labor organizations or trusts. Similarly, it appears that the provisions of that section do not require the bonding of brokers or other independent contractors who have contracted with labor organizations or trusts for the performance of functions which are normally not carried out by such labor organizations' or trusts' own officials or employees, such as the buying of securities, the performance of other investment functions, or the transportation of funds by armored truck. <SU>12</SU>

Bonds should be secured for such persons, in an amount based on the funds handled by their predecessors during the preceding fiscal year, before they are permitted to engage in any of the fund-handling activities referred to in the prohibition, unless coverage with respect to such persons is already provided by bonds in force meeting the requirements of section 502(a).</P>

This is so because the Act requires each such bond to be fixed at the beginning of the organization's fiscal year in an amount based on funds handled in the preceding fiscal year, and it could not well have been intended that the obtaining of a bond would be necessary in advance of the time when it would be possible to meet this requirement.</P>

They prescribe procedures and basic principles which the Director of Labor will utilize in effectuating the standards of conduct required of labor organizations composed of Federal government employees that are covered by these Acts. (Regulations implementing the other provisions of title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act are issued by the Federal Labor Relations Authority, the General Counsel of the Federal Labor Relations Authority, and the Federal Service Impasses Panel in title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Regulations implementing the other provisions of chapter 10 of the Foreign Service Act are issued by the Foreign Service Labor Relations Board, the Federal Labor Relations Authority, the General Counsel of the Federal Labor Relations Authority, and the Foreign Service Impasse Disputes Panel in title 22 of the Code of Federal Regulations.) <SU>1</SU>

                <SUBJECT>Bill of rights of members of labor organizations.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a)(1) <E T="03">Equal rights.</E> Every member of a labor organization shall have equal rights and privileges within such organization to nominate candidates, to vote in elections or referendums of the labor organization, to attend membership meetings and to participate in the deliberations and voting upon the business of such meetings, subject to reasonable rules and regulations in such organization's constitution and bylaws.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Freedom of speech and assembly.</E> Every member of any labor organization shall have the right to meet and assemble freely with other members; and to express any views, arguments or opinions; and to express at meetings of the labor organization his views upon candidates in an election of the labor organization or upon any business properly before the meeting, subject to the organization's established and reasonable rules pertaining to the conduct of meetings: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That nothing herein shall be construed to impair the right of a labor organization to adopt and enforce reasonable rules as to the responsibility of every member toward the organization as an institution and to his refraining from conduct that would interfere with its performance of its legal or contractual obligations.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Dues, initiation fees, and assessments.</E> Except in the case of a federation of national or international labor organizations, the rates of dues and initiation fees payable by members of any labor organization in effect on the date this section is published shall not be increased, and no general or special assessment shall be levied upon such members, except:</P>
                <P>(i) In the case of a local organization, (A) by majority vote by secret ballot of the members in good standing voting at a general or special membership meeting, after reasonable notice of the intention to vote upon such question, or (B) by majority vote of the members in good standing voting in a membership referendum conducted by secret ballot; or</P>

                <P>(ii) In the case of a labor organization, other than a local labor organization or a federation of national or international labor organizations, (A) by majority vote of the delegates voting at a regular convention, or at a special convention of such labor organization held upon not less than 30 days written notice to the principal office of each local or constituent labor organization entitled to such notice, or (B) by majority vote of the members in good standing of such labor organization voting in a membership referendum conducted by secret ballot, or (C) by majority vote of the members of the executive board or similar governing body of such labor organization, pursuant to express authority contained in the constitution and bylaws of such labor organization: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That such action on the part of the executive board or similar governing body shall be effective only until the next regular convention of such labor organization.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Protection of the right to sue.</E> No labor organization shall limit the right of any member thereof to institute an action in any court, or in a proceeding before any administrative agency, irrespective of whether or not the labor organization or its officers are named as defendants or respondents in such action or proceedings, or the right of any <PRTPAGE P="220"/>member of a labor organization to appear as a witness in any judicial, administrative, or legislative proceeding, or to petition any legislature or to communicate with any legislator: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That any such member may be required to exhaust reasonable hearing procedures (but not to exceed a 4-month lapse of time) within such organization, before instituting legal or administrative proceedings against such organizations or any officer thereof.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Safeguards against improper disciplinary action.</E> No member of any labor organization may be fined, suspended, expelled, or otherwise disciplined, except for nonpayment of dues by such organization or by any officer thereof unless such member has been (i) served with written specific charges; (ii) given a reasonable time to prepare his defense; (iii) afforded a full and fair hearing.</P>
                <P>(b) Any provision of the constitution and bylaws of any labor organization which is inconsistent with the provisions of this section shall not be a defense to any proceeding instituted against the labor organization under this part or under the CSRA or FSA.</P>
                <P>(c) Nothing contained in this section shall limit the rights and remedies of any member of a labor organization under any State or Federal law or before any court or other tribunal, or under the constitution and bylaws of any labor organization.</P>
                <P>(d) It shall be the duty of the secretary or corresponding principal officer of each labor organization, in the case of a local labor organization, to forward a copy of each agreement made by such labor organization with an agency, Department or activity to any employee who requests such a copy and whose rights as such employee are directly affected by such agreement, and in the case of a labor organization other than a local labor organization, to forward a copy of any such agreement to each constituent unit which has members directly affected by such agreement; and such officer shall maintain at the principal office of the labor organization of which he is an officer, copies of any such agreement made or received by such labor organization, which copies shall be available for inspection by any member or by any employee whose rights are affected by such agreement. An employee's rights under this paragraph shall be enforceable in the same manner as the rights of a member.</P>

Such notice may be included with the required notice of local union elections. Where a union newspaper is used to provide notice, the notice must be conspicuously placed on the front page of the newspaper, or the front page should have a conspicuous reference to the inside page where the notice appears, so that the inclusion of the notice in a particular issue is readily apparent to each member.</P>
                <P>(b) A labor organization may demonstrate compliance with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section by showing that another labor organization provided an appropriate notice to all of its members during the necessary time frame.</P>

                <P>(d) If a labor organization has a Web site, the site must contain a conspicuous link to Union Member Rights and Officer Responsibilities under the Civil Service Reform Act or, alternatively, to the labor organization's own notice prepared in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
