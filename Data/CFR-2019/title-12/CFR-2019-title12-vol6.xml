      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, January 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="viii"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

              <P>(a) In connection with an application for deposit insurance for a U.S. branch or depository institution subsidiary of a foreign bank that has been determined to be subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision by the appropriate Federal banking agency, as defined in section 3(q) of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1813(q)), the foreign bank shall provide binding written commitments (including a consent to U.S. jurisdiction and designation of agent for service, acceptable to the FDIC) to the following terms:</P>
              <P>(1) The FDIC will be provided with any information about the foreign bank and its affiliates located outside of the United States that the FDIC requests to determine:</P>
              <P>(i) The relationship between the U.S. branch or depository institution subsidiary and its affiliates; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The effect of such relationship on such U.S. branch or depository institution subsidiary;</P>
              <P>(2) The FDIC will be allowed to examine the affairs of any office, agency, branch or affiliate of the foreign bank located in the United States and will be provided any information requested to determine:</P>

              <P>(ii) The effect of such relationship on such U.S. branch or depository institution subsidiary.</P>
              <P>(3) The FDIC will not process a deposit insurance application for any U.S. branch or depository institution subsidiary of a foreign bank if the foreign bank fails to provide the written commitments, consent to U.S. jurisdiction, and designation of agent for service required by this section.</P>
              <P>(b) The FDIC will consider the existence and extent of any prohibition or restrictions, if any, on its ability to utilize the commitments, consent to U.S. jurisdiction, and designation of agent for service required by this section, in determining whether to grant or deny a deposit insurance application for the U.S. branch or depository institution subsidiary of the foreign bank. In addition, the FDIC may consider any additional assurances or commitments provided by the foreign bank, including that it will cooperate and assist the FDIC, without limitation, by seeking to obtain waivers and exemptions from applicable confidentiality or secrecy restrictions or requirements to enable the foreign bank or its affiliates to make information about the foreign bank and its affiliates located outside of the United States available to the FDIC for review.</P>
              <P>(c) The foreign bank's commitments, consent to U.S. jurisdiction, and designation of agent for service shall be signed by an officer of the foreign bank who has been so authorized by the foreign bank's board of directors and in all instances will be executed in a manner acceptable to the FDIC and shall be included with the branch or depository institution application for insurance. Any documents that are not in English shall be accompanied by an English translation.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Pledge of assets.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> A foreign bank that has an insured branch must pledge assets for the benefit of the FDIC or its designee(s). Whenever the FDIC is obligated under section 11(f) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1821(f)) to pay the insured deposits of an insured branch, the assets pledged under this section must become the property of the FDIC and be used to the extent necessary to protect the Deposit Insurance Fund.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Amount of assets to be pledged.</E> (1) For a newly insured branch, a foreign bank must pledge assets equal to at least 5 percent of the liabilities of the branch, based on the branch's projection of its liabilities at the end of each of the first three years of operations. For all other insured branches, a foreign bank must pledge assets equal to the appropriate percentage applicable to the insured branch, as determined by reference to the risk-based assessment schedule contained in this paragraph, of the insured branch's average liabilities for the last 30 days of the most recent calendar quarter. <SU>4</SU>

              <FTNT>
                <P>
                  <SU>4</SU> This average must be computed by using the sum of the close of business figures for the 30 calendar days of the most recent calendar quarter, ending with and including the last day of the calendar quarter, divided by 30. For days on which the branch is closed, however, balances from the previous business day are to be used in determining its average liabilities. In determining its average liabilities, the insured branch may exclude liabilities to other offices, agencies, branches, and wholly owned subsidiaries of the foreign bank. The value of the pledged assets must be computed based on the lesser of the principal amount (par value) or market value of <PRTPAGE/>such assets at the time of the original pledge and thereafter as of the last day of the most recent calendar quarter.</P>

              <P>The appropriate asset pledge percentage will be determined based on the supervisory risk subgroup and asset maintenance level applicable to the insured branch.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Supervisory risk factors.</E> For purposes of this section, within each asset maintenance group, each institution will be assigned to one of three subgroups based on consideration by the FDIC of supervisory evaluations provided by the primary federal regulator for the insured branch. The supervisory evaluations include the results of examination findings by the primary federal regulator, as well as other information the primary federal regulator determines to be relevant. In addition, the FDIC will take into consideration such other information (such as state examination findings, if appropriate) as it determines to be relevant to the financial condition and the risk posed to the Deposit Insurance Fund. The three supervisory subgroups are:</P>
              <P>(i) Subgroup “A”. This subgroup consists of financially sound institutions with only a few minor weaknesses;</P>
              <P>(ii) Subgroup “B”. This subgroup consists of institutions that demonstrate weaknesses which, if not corrected, could result in significant deterioration of the institution and increased risk of loss to the deposit insurance fund; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Subgroup “C”. This subgroup consists of institutions that pose a substantial probability of loss to the deposit insurance fund.</P>
              <P>(4) The FDIC may require a foreign bank to pledge additional assets or to compute its pledge on a daily basis whenever the FDIC determines that the condition of the foreign bank or the insured branch is such that the assets pledged under this section will not adequately protect the deposit insurance fund. In requiring a foreign bank to pledge additional assets, the FDIC will consult with the primary regulator for the insured branch. Among the factors to be considered in imposing these requirements are the concentration of risk to any one borrower or group of related borrowers, the concentration of transfer risk related to any one country, including the country in which the foreign bank's head office is located or any other factor the FDIC determines is relevant.</P>
              <P>(5) Each insured branch must separately comply with the requirements of this section. A foreign bank which has more than one insured branch in a state may, however, treat all of its insured branches in the same state as one entity and will designate one insured branch to be responsible for compliance with this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Depository.</E> A foreign bank must place pledged assets for safekeeping at any depository which is located in any state. However, a depository may not be an affiliate of the foreign bank whose insured branch is seeking to use the depository. A foreign bank must obtain the FDIC's prior written approval of the depository selected, and such approval may be revoked and dismissal of the depository required whenever the depository does not fulfill any one of its obligations under the pledge agreement. A foreign bank shall appoint and constitute the depository as its attorney in fact for the sole purpose of transferring title to pledged assets to the FDIC as may be required to effectuate the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="20"/>
              </P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Assets that may be pledged.</E> (1) This paragraph sets forth the kinds of assets that may be pledged to satisfy the requirements of this section. A foreign bank shall be deemed to have pledged any such assets for the benefit of the FDIC or its designee at such time as any such asset is placed with the depository. The FDIC reserves the right to require the substitution of pledged assets with other assets deemed acceptable to the FDIC.</P>
              <P>(2) A foreign bank may pledge the kinds of assets set forth in this paragraph (d)(2), provided that: Such assets are denominated in United States dollars; such assets are investment grade, as that term is defined in § 347.202(r); and such assets are highly liquid, as that term is defined in § 347.202(l). Furthermore, for the purposes of calculating the amount of assets required to be pledged under paragraph (b) of this section, the assets that are eligible for pledging under this paragraph (d)(2) must be discounted at the rates set forth in Table 1 to § 347.209.</P>
              <P>(i) Cash;</P>
              <P>(ii) Treasury bills, interest bearing bonds, notes, debentures, or other direct obligations of or obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States or any agency thereof;</P>
              <P>(iii) Obligations of United States government-sponsored enterprises;</P>
              <P>(iv) Negotiable certificates of deposit that are payable in the United States and that are issued by any state bank, national bank, state or federal savings association, or branch of a foreign bank which has executed a valid waiver of offset agreement or similar debt instruments that are payable in the United States and that are issued by any agency of a foreign bank which has executed a valid waiver of offset agreement; provided, that the maturity of any certificate or issuance is not greater than one year; and provided further, that the issuing branch or agency of a foreign bank is not an affiliate of the pledging bank or from the same country as the pledging bank's domicile;</P>
              <P>(v) Obligations of the African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development;</P>

              <P>(e) <E T="03">Pledge agreement.</E> A foreign bank shall not pledge any assets unless a pledge agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the FDIC has been executed by the foreign bank and the depository.

              <P>(1) <E T="03">Original pledge.</E> The foreign bank shall place with the depository assets of the kind described in paragraph (d) of this section, having an aggregate value in the amount as required pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Additional assets required to be pledged.</E> Whenever the foreign bank is required to pledge additional assets for the benefit of the FDIC or its designees pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section, it shall deliver (within two business days after the last day of the most <PRTPAGE P="21"/>recent calendar quarter, unless otherwise ordered) additional assets of the kind described in paragraph (d) of this section, having an aggregate value in the amount required by the FDIC.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Substitution of assets.</E> The foreign bank, at any time, may substitute any assets for pledged assets, and, upon such substitution, the depository shall promptly release any such assets to the foreign bank; provided, that:</P>
              <P>(i) The foreign bank pledges assets of the kind described in paragraph (d) of this section having an aggregate value not less than the value of the pledged assets for which they are substituted and certified as such by the foreign bank; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The FDIC has not by written notification to the foreign bank, a copy of which shall be provided to the depository, suspended or terminated the foreign bank's right of substitution.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Delivery of other documents.</E> Concurrently with the pledge of any assets, the foreign bank will deliver to the depository all documents and instruments necessary or advisable to effectuate the transfer of title to any such assets and thereafter, from time to time, at the request of the FDIC, deliver to the depository any such additional documents or instruments. The foreign bank shall provide copies of all such documents described in this paragraph (e)(4) to the appropriate regional director concurrently with their delivery to the depository.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Acceptance and safekeeping responsibilities of the depository.</E> (i) The depository will accept and hold any assets pledged by the foreign bank pursuant to the pledge agreement for safekeeping free and clear of any lien, charge, right of offset, credit, or preference in connection with any claim the depository may assert against the foreign bank and shall designate any such assets as a special pledge for the benefit of the FDIC or its designee. The depository shall not accept the pledge of any such assets unless, concurrently with such pledge, the foreign bank delivers to the depository the documents and instruments necessary for the transfer of title thereto as provided in this part.</P>
              <P>(ii) The depository shall hold any such assets separate from all other assets of the foreign bank or the depository. Such assets may be held in book-entry form but must at all times be segregated on the records of the depository and clearly identified as assets subject to the pledge agreement.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Reporting requirements of the insured branch and the depository.</E> (i) Initial reports. Upon the original pledge of assets as provided in paragraph (e)(1) of this section:</P>
              <P>(A) The depository shall provide to the foreign bank and to the appropriate FDIC regional director a written report in the form of a receipt identifying each asset pledged and specifying in reasonable detail with respect to each such asset the complete title, interest rate, series, serial number (if any), principal amount (par value), maturity date and call date; and</P>
              <P>(B) The foreign bank shall provide to the appropriate regional director a written report certified as correct by the foreign bank which sets forth the value of each pledged asset and the aggregate value of all such assets, and which states that the aggregate value of all such assets is at least equal to the amount required pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section and that all such assets are of the kind described in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Quarterly reports.</E> Within ten calendar days after the end of the most recent calendar quarter:</P>
              <P>(A) The depository shall provide to the appropriate regional director a written report specifying in reasonable detail with respect to each asset currently pledged (including any asset pledged to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)(4) of this section and identified as such), as of two business days after the end of the most recent calendar quarter, the complete title, interest rate, series, serial number (if any), principal amount (par value), maturity date, and call date, provided, that if no substitution of any asset has occurred during the reporting period, the reporting need only specify that no substitution of assets has occurred; and</P>

              <P>(B) The foreign bank shall provide as of two business days after the end of the most recent calendar quarter to the appropriate regional director a written report certified as correct by the foreign bank which sets forth the <PRTPAGE P="22"/>value of each pledged asset and the aggregate value of all such assets, which states that the aggregate value of all such assets is at least equal to the amount required pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section and that all such assets are of the kind described in paragraph (d) of this section, and which states the average of the liabilities of each insured branch of the foreign bank computed in the manner and for the period prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Additional reports.</E> The foreign bank shall, from time to time, as may be required, provide to the appropriate regional director a written report in the form specified containing the information requested with respect to any asset then currently pledged.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Access to assets.</E> With respect to any asset pledged pursuant to the pledge agreement, the depository will provide representatives of the FDIC or the foreign bank with access (during regular business hours of the depository and at the location where any such asset is held, without other limitation or qualification) to all original instruments, documents, books, and records evidencing or pertaining to any such asset.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Release upon the order of the FDIC.</E> The depository shall release to the foreign bank any pledged assets, as specified in a written notification of the appropriate regional director, upon the terms and conditions provided in such notification, including without limitation the waiver of any requirement that any assets be pledged by the foreign bank in substitution of any released assets.</P>
              <P>(9) <E T="03">Release to the FDIC.</E> Whenever the FDIC is obligated under section 11(f) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to pay insured deposits of an insured branch, the FDIC by written certification shall so inform the depository; and the depository, upon receipt of such certification, shall thereupon promptly release and transfer title to any pledged assets to the FDIC or release such assets to the foreign bank, as specified in the certification. Upon release and transfer of title to all pledged assets specified in the certification, the depository shall be discharged from any further obligation under the pledge agreement.</P>
              <P>(10) <E T="03">Interest earned on assets.</E> The foreign bank may retain any interest earned with respect to the assets currently pledged unless the FDIC by written notice prohibits retention of interest by the foreign bank, in which case the notice shall specify the disposition of any such interest.</P>
              <P>(11) <E T="03">Expenses of agreement.</E> The FDIC shall not be required to pay any fees, costs, or expenses for services provided by the depository to the foreign bank pursuant to, or in connection with, the pledge agreement.</P>
              <P>(12) <E T="03">Substitution of depository.</E> The depository may resign, or the foreign bank may discharge the depository, from its duties and obligations under the pledge agreement by giving at least 60 days' written notice thereof to the other party and to the appropriate regional director. The FDIC, upon 30 days' written notice to the foreign bank and the depository, may require the foreign bank to dismiss the depository if the FDIC in its discretion determines that the depository is in breach of the pledge agreement. The depository shall continue to function as such until the appointment of a successor depository becomes effective and the depository has released to the successor depository the pledged assets and documents and instruments to effectuate transfer of title in accordance with the written instructions of the foreign bank as approved by the FDIC. The appointment by the foreign bank of a successor depository shall not be effective until:</P>
              <P>(i) The FDIC has approved in writing the successor depository; and</P>
              <P>(ii) A pledge agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the FDIC has been executed.</P>
              <P>(13) <E T="03">Waiver of terms.</E> The FDIC may by written order waive compliance by the foreign bank or the depository with any term or condition of the pledge agreement.<PRTPAGE P="23"/>

              <SUBJECT>Asset maintenance.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) An insured branch of a foreign bank shall maintain on a daily basis eligible assets in an amount not less than 106 percent of the preceding quarter's average book value of the insured branch's liabilities or, in the case of a newly-established insured branch, the estimated book value of its liabilities at the end of the first full quarter of operation, exclusive of liabilities due to the foreign bank's head office, other branches, agencies, offices, or wholly owned subsidiaries. The Director of the Division of Supervision and Consumer Protection or his designee may impose a computation of total liabilities on a daily basis in those instances where it is found necessary for supervisory purposes. The FDIC Board of Directors, after consulting with the insured branch's primary regulator, may require that a higher ratio of eligible assets be maintained if the financial condition of the insured branch warrants such action. Among the factors which will be considered in requiring a higher ratio of eligible assets are the concentration of risk to any one borrower or group of related borrowers, the concentration of transfer risk to any one country, including the country in which the foreign bank's head office is located or any other factor the FDIC determines is relevant. Eligible assets shall be payable in United States dollars.</P>
              <P>(b) In determining eligible assets for the purposes of compliance with paragraph (a) of this section, the insured branch shall exclude the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Any asset due from the foreign bank's head office, or its other branches, agencies, offices or affiliates;</P>
              <P>(2) Any asset classified “Value Impaired,” to the extent of the required Allocated Transfer Risk Reserves or equivalent write down, or “Loss” in the most recent state or federal examination report;</P>
              <P>(3) Any deposit of the insured branch in a bank unless the bank has executed a valid waiver of offset agreement;</P>
              <P>(4) Any asset not supported by sufficient credit information to allow a review of the asset's credit quality, as determined at the most recent state or federal examination, as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Whether an asset has sufficient credit information will be a function of the size of the borrower and the location within the foreign bank of the responsibility for authorizing and monitoring extensions of credit to the borrower. For large, well known companies, when credit responsibility is located in an office of the foreign bank outside the insured branch, the insured branch must have adequate documentation to show that the asset is of good quality and is being supervised adequately by the foreign bank. In such cases, copies of periodic memoranda that include an analysis of the borrower's recent financial statements and a report on recent developments in the borrower's operations and borrowing relationships with the foreign bank generally would constitute sufficient information. For other borrowers, periodic memoranda must be supplemented by information such as copies of recent financial statements, recent correspondence concerning the borrower's financial condition and repayment history, credit terms and collateral, data on any guarantors, and where necessary, the status of any corrective measures being employed;</P>

              <P>(ii) Subsequent to the determination that an asset lacks sufficient credit information, an insured branch may not <PRTPAGE P="24"/>include the amount of that asset among eligible assets until the FDIC determines that sufficient documentation exists. Such a determination may be made either at the next federal examination, or upon request of the insured branch, by the appropriate regional director;</P>
              <P>(5) Any asset not in the insured branch's actual possession unless the insured branch holds title to such asset and the insured branch maintains records sufficient to enable independent verification of the insured branch's ownership of the asset, as determined at the most recent state or federal examination;</P>
              <P>(6) Any intangible asset;</P>
              <P>(7) Any other asset not considered bankable by the FDIC.</P>
              <P>(c) A foreign bank which has more than one insured branch in a state may treat all of its insured branches in the same state as one entity for purposes of compliance with paragraph (a) of this section and shall designate one insured branch to be responsible for maintaining the records of the insured branches' compliance with this section.</P>
              <P>(d) The average book value of the insured branch's liabilities for a quarter shall be, at the insured branch's option, either an average of the balances as of the close of business for each day of the quarter or an average of the balances as of the close of business on each Wednesday during the quarter. Quarters end on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31 of any given year. For days on which the insured branch is closed, balances from the previous business day are to be used. Calculations of the average book value of the insured branch's liabilities for a quarter shall be retained by the insured branch until the next federal examination.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Frequency of on-site examination.</E> Each branch or agency of a foreign bank shall be examined on-site at least once during each 12-month period (beginning on the date the most recent examination of the office ended) by:</P>
              <P>(1) The FRB;</P>
              <P>(2) The FDIC, if an insured branch;</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">18-month cycle for certain small institutions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Mandatory standards.</E> The FDIC may conduct a full-scope, on-site examination at least once during each 18-month period, rather than each 12-month period as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, if the insured branch:</P>
              <P>(i) Has total assets of less than $3 billion;</P>
              <P>(ii) Has received a composite ROCA supervisory rating (which rates risk management, operational controls, compliance, and asset quality) of 1 or 2 at its most recent examination;</P>
              <P>(iii) Satisfies the requirement of either the following paragraph (b)(iii)(A) or (B):</P>
              <P>(A) The foreign bank's most recently reported capital adequacy position consists of, or is equivalent to, Tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios of at least 6 percent and 10 percent, respectively, on a consolidated basis; or</P>
              <P>(B) The insured branch has maintained on a daily basis, over the past three quarters, eligible assets in an amount not less than 108 percent of the preceding quarter's average third party liabilities (determined consistent with applicable federal and state law) and sufficient liquidity is currently available to meet its obligations to third parties;</P>
              <P>(iv) Is not subject to a formal enforcement action or order by the FRB, FDIC, or the OCC; and</P>
              <P>(v) Has not experienced a change in control during the preceding 12-month period in which a full-scope, on-site examination would have been required but for this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Discretionary standards.</E> In determining whether an insured branch that meets the standards of paragraph (b)(1) of this section should not be eligible for an 18-month examination cycle pursuant to this paragraph (b), the FDIC may consider additional factors, including whether:</P>

              <P>(i) Any of the individual components of the ROCA supervisory rating of an insured branch is rated “3” or worse;<PRTPAGE P="25"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) The results of any off-site monitoring indicate a deterioration in the condition of the insured branch;</P>
              <P>(iii) The size, relative importance, and role of a particular insured branch when reviewed in the context of the foreign bank's entire U.S. operations otherwise necessitate an annual examination; and</P>
              <P>(iv) The condition of the parent foreign bank gives rise to such a need.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Authority to conduct more frequent examinations.</E> Nothing in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section limits the authority of the FDIC to examine any insured branch as frequently as it deems necessary.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Scope.</E> A foreign bank operating an insured state branch which desires to engage in or continue to engage in any type of activity that is not permissible for a federal branch, pursuant to the National Bank Act (12 U.S.C. 21 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) or any other federal statute, regulation, official bulletin or circular, written order or interpretation, or decision of a court of competent jurisdiction, must file a written application for permission to conduct such activity with the FDIC.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Exceptions.</E> If the FDIC has already determined, pursuant to part 362 of this chapter, “Activities and Investment of Insured State Banks,” that an activity does not present a significant risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund, no application is required under paragraph (a) of this section for a foreign bank operating an insured branch to engage or continue to engage in the same activity.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Agency activities.</E> A foreign bank operating an insured state branch is not required to submit an application pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section to engage in or continue engaging in an activity conducted as agent if the activity is:</P>
              <P>(1) permissible agency activity for a state-chartered bank located in the state which the state-licensed insured branch of the foreign bank is located;</P>
              <P>(2) permissible agency activity for a state-licensed branch of a foreign bank located in that state; and</P>

              <P>(2) In the case of an application to initially engage in an activity, as opposed to an application to continue to conduct an activity, the insured state branch shall not commence the activity until it has been approved in writing by the FDIC pursuant to this part and the FRB, and any and all conditions imposed in such approvals have been satisfied.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Divestiture or cessation.</E> (1) If an application for permission to continue to conduct an activity is not approved by the FDIC or the FRB, the applicant shall submit a plan of divestiture or cessation of the activity to the appropriate regional director.</P>
              <P>(2) A foreign bank operating an insured state branch which elects not to apply to the FDIC for permission to continue to conduct an activity which is rendered impermissible by any change in statute, regulation, official bulletin or circular, written order or interpretation, or decision of a court of competent jurisdiction shall submit a plan of divestiture or cessation to the appropriate regional director.</P>
              <P>(3) All plans of divestitures or cessation required by this paragraph must be completed within one year from the date of the disapproval, or within such shorter period as the FDIC may direct.</P>

              <P>A foreign bank may operate any state branch as a noninsured branch whenever the foreign bank has entered into an agreement with the FRB to accept at that branch only those deposits as would be permissible for a corporation organized under section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 611 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) and implementing rules and regulations administered by the FRB (12 CFR 211).</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Deposit activities not requiring insurance.</E> A State branch will not be considered to be engaged in domestic retail deposit activity that requires the foreign bank parent to establish an insured U.S. bank subsidiary if the State branch accepts initial deposits only in an amount of less than an amount equal to the SMDIA that are derived solely from the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Individuals who are not citizens or residents of the United States at the time of the initial deposit;</P>
              <P>(2) Individuals who:</P>
              <P>(i) Are not citizens of the United States;</P>
              <P>(ii) Are residents of the United States; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Are employed by a foreign bank, foreign business, foreign government, or recognized international organization;</P>
              <P>(3) Persons (including immediate family members of natural persons) to whom the branch or foreign bank (including any affiliate thereof) has extended credit or provided other nondeposit banking services within the past twelve months or has entered into a written agreement to provide such services within the next twelve months;</P>
              <P>(4) Foreign businesses, large United States businesses, and persons from whom an Edge or agreement corporation may accept deposits under 12 CFR 211.6(a)(1);</P>
              <P>(5) Any governmental unit, including the United States government, any state government, any foreign government and any political subdivision or agency of any of the foregoing, and recognized international organizations;</P>
              <P>(6) Persons who are depositing funds in connection with the issuance of a financial instrument by the branch for the transmission of funds or the transmission of such funds by any electronic means; and</P>
              <P>(7) Any other depositor, but only if:</P>

              <P>(i) The branch's average deposits under this paragraph (a)(7) do not exceed one percent of the branch's average total deposits, as calculated under paragraph (a)(7)(ii) if this section (<E T="03">de minimis</E> exception).</P>
              <P>(ii) For purposes of calculating this exception:</P>
              <P>(A) The branch's average deposits under this paragraph and the average total deposits must be computed by summing the close of business figures for each of the last 30 calendar days, ending with and including the last day of the calendar quarter, and dividing the resulting sum by 30;</P>
              <P>(B) For days on which the branch is closed, balances from the last previous business day are to be used;</P>
              <P>(C) The branch may exclude deposits in the branch of other offices, branches, agencies or wholly owned subsidiaries of the bank to determine its average deposits;</P>
              <P>(D) The branch must not solicit deposits from the general public by advertising, display of signs, or similar activity designed to attract the attention of the general public; and</P>

              <P>(E) A foreign bank that has more than one state branch in the same state may aggregate deposits in such branches (excluding deposits of other branches, agencies or wholly owned subsidiaries of the bank) for the purpose of this paragraph (a)(7).<PRTPAGE P="27"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Application for an exemption.</E> (1) Whenever a foreign bank proposes to accept at a State branch initial deposits of less than an amount equal to the SMDIA and such deposits are not otherwise exempted under paragraph (a) of this section, the foreign bank may apply to the FDIC for consent to operate the branch as a noninsured branch. The Board of Directors may exempt the branch from the insurance requirement if the branch is not engaged in domestic retail deposit activities requiring insurance protection. The Board of Directors will consider the size and nature of depositors and deposit accounts, the importance of maintaining and improving the availability of credit to all sectors of the United States economy, including the international trade finance sector of the United States economy, whether the exemption would give the foreign bank an unfair competitive advantage over United States banking organizations, and any other relevant factors in making this determination.</P>
              <P>(2) Procedures for applications under this section are set out in § 303.186.</P>
              <P>(c) Transition period. A noninsured state branch may maintain a retail deposit lawfully accepted prior to April 1, 1996 pursuant to regulations in effect prior to July 1, 1998:</P>
              <P>(1) If the deposit qualifies pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of this section; or</P>
              <P>(2) If the deposit does not qualify pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, in the case of a time deposit, no later than the first maturity date of the time deposit after April 1, 1996.</P>

This acknowledgment shall be retained by the branch so long as the depositor maintains any deposit with the branch. This provision applies to any negotiable certificates of deposit made in a branch on or after July 6, 1989, as well as to any renewals of such deposits which become effective on or after July 6, 1989.</P>

              <P>(1) The borrower is unable to service the existing loan according to its terms and is a resident of a foreign country in which there is a generalized inability of public and private sector obligors to meet their external debt obligations on a timely basis because of a lack of, or restraints on the availability of, needed foreign exchange in the country; and</P>
              <P>(2) Either:</P>

              <SUBJECT>Allocated transfer risk reserve.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Establishment of Allocated Transfer Risk Reserve.</E> A banking institution shall establish an allocated transfer risk reserve (ATRR) for specified international assets when required by the FDIC in accordance with this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Procedures and standards</E>—(1) <E T="03">Joint agency determination.</E> At least annually, the federal banking agencies shall determine jointly, based on the standards set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Which international assets subject to transfer risk warrant establishment of an ATRR;</P>
              <P>(ii) The amount of the ATRR for the specified assets; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Whether an ATRR established for specified assets may be reduced.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Standards for requiring ATRR</E>—(i) <E T="03">Evaluation of assets.</E> The federal banking agencies shall apply the following criteria in determining whether an ATRR is required for particular international assets:</P>
              <P>(A) Whether the quality of a banking institution's assets has been impaired by a protracted inability of public or private obligors in a foreign country to make payments on their external indebtedness as indicated by such factors, among others, as whether:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Such obligors have failed to make full interest payments on external indebtedness; or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Such obligors have failed to comply with the terms of any restructured indebtedness; or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) A foreign country has failed to comply with any International Monetary Fund or other suitable adjustment program; or</P>
              <P>(B) Whether no definite prospects exist for the orderly restoration of debt service.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Determination of amount of ATRR.</E> (A) In determining the amount of the ATRR, the federal banking agencies shall consider:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The length of time the quality of the asset has been impaired;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Recent actions taken to restore debt service capability;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Prospects for restored asset quality; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) Such other factors as the federal banking agencies may consider relevant to the quality of the asset.</P>
              <P>(B) The initial year's provision for the ATRR shall be ten percent of the principal amount of each specified international asset, or such greater or lesser percentage determined by the federal banking agencies. Additional provision, if any, for the ATRR in subsequent years shall be fifteen percent of the principal amount of each specified international asset, or such greater or lesser percentage determined by the federal banking agencies.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">FDIC notification.</E> Based on the joint agency determinations under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the FDIC shall notify each banking institution holding assets subject to an ATRR:</P>
              <P>(i) Of the amount of the ATRR to be established by the institution for specified international assets; and</P>
              <P>(ii) That an ATRR established for specified assets may be reduced.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Accounting treatment of ATRR</E>—(1) <E T="03">Charge to current income.</E> A banking institution shall establish an ATRR by a charge to current income and the <PRTPAGE P="29"/>amounts so charged shall not be included in the banking institution's capital or surplus.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Separate accounting.</E> A banking institution shall account for an ATRR separately from the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses, and shall deduct the ATRR from “gross loans and leases” to arrive at “net loans and leases.” The ATRR must be established for each asset subject to the ATRR in the percentage amount specified.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Consolidation.</E> A banking institution shall establish an ATRR, as required, on a consolidated basis. For banks, consolidation should be in accordance with the procedures and tests of significance set forth in the instructions for preparation of Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (FFIEC Nos. 031, 032, 033 and 034).</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Alternative accounting treatment.</E> A banking institution need not establish an ATRR if it writes down in the period in which the ATRR is required, or has written down in prior periods, the value of the specified international assets in the requisite amount for each such asset. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(4), international assets may be written down by a charge to the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses or a reduction in the principal amount of the asset by application of interest payments or other collections on the asset; provided, that only those international assets that may be charged to the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles may be written down by a charge to the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses. However, the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses must be replenished in such amount necessary to restore it to a level which adequately provides for the estimated losses inherent in the banking institution's loan and lease portfolio.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Reduction of ATRR.</E> A banking institution may reduce an ATRR when notified by the FDIC or, at any time, by writing down such amount of the international asset for which the ATRR was established.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Restrictions on fees for restructured international loans.</E> No banking institution shall charge, in connection with the restructuring of an international loan, any fee exceeding the administrative cost of the restructuring unless it amortizes the amount of the fee exceeding the administrative cost over the effective life of the loan.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Accounting treatment.</E> Subject to paragraph (a) of this section, banking institutions shall account for fees on international loans in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Procedures.</E> The format, content and reporting and filing dates of the reports required under paragraph (a) of this section shall be determined jointly by the federal banking agencies. The requirements to be prescribed by the federal banking agencies may include changes to existing forms (such as revisions to the Country Exposure Report, Form FFIEC No. 009) or such other requirements as the federal banking agencies deem appropriate. The federal banking agencies also may determine to exempt from the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section banking institutions that, in the federal banking agencies' judgment, have <E T="03">de minimis</E> holdings of international assets.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Reservation of Authority.</E> Nothing contained in this subpart shall preclude the FDIC from requiring from a banking institution such additional or more frequent information on the institution's holdings of international assets as the agency may consider necessary.<PRTPAGE P="30"/>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Authority.</E> This part is issued under the provisions of the Depository Institution Management Interlocks Act (Interlocks Act) (12 U.S.C. 3201 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), as amended.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The purpose of the Interlocks Act and this part is to foster competition by generally prohibiting a management official from serving two nonaffiliated depository organizations in situations where the management interlock likely would have an anticompetitive effect.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Scope.</E> This part applies to management officials of FDIC-supervised institutions and their affiliates.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Other definitions and rules of construction.</SUBJECT>
            <P>For purposes of this part, the following definitions apply:</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Affiliate.</E> (1) The term affiliate has the meaning given in section 202 of the Interlocks Act (12 U.S.C. 3201). For purposes of section 202, shares held by an individual include shares held by members of his or her immediate family. “Immediate family” means spouse, mother, father, child, grandchild, sister, brother or any of their spouses, whether or not any of their shares are held in trust.</P>
            <P>(2) For purposes of section 202(3)(B) of the Interlocks Act (12 U.S.C. 3201(3)(B)), an affiliate relationship involving an FDIC-supervised institution based on common ownership does not exist if the FDIC determines, after giving the affected persons the opportunity to respond, that the asserted affiliation was established in order to avoid the prohibitions of the Interlocks Act and does not represent a true commonality of interest between the depository organizations. In making this determination, the FDIC considers, among other things, whether a person, including members of his or her immediate family whose shares are necessary to constitute the group, owns a nominal percentage of the shares of one of the organizations and the percentage is substantially disproportionate to that person's ownership of shares in the other organization.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Area median income</E> means:</P>
            <P>(1) The median family income for the metropolitan statistical area (MSA), if a depository organization is located in an MSA; or</P>
            <P>(2) The statewide nonmetropolitan median family income, if a depository organization is located outside an MSA.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Community</E> means a city, town, or village, and contiguous or adjacent cities, towns, or villages.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Contiguous or adjacent cities, towns, or villages</E> means cities, towns, or villages whose borders touch each other or whose borders are within 10 road miles of each other at their closest points. The property line of an office located in an unincorporated city, town, or village is the boundary line of that city, town, or village for the purpose of this definition.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Depository holding company</E> means a bank holding company or a savings and loan holding company (as more fully defined in section 202 of the Interlocks Act (12 U.S.C. 3201)) having its principal office located in the United States.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Depository institution</E> means a commercial bank (including a private bank), a savings bank, a trust company, a savings and loan association, a building and loan association, a homestead association, a cooperative bank, an industrial bank, or a credit union, chartered under the laws of the United States and having a principal office located in the United States. Additionally, a United States office, including a branch or agency, of a foreign commercial bank is a depository institution.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Depository institution affiliate</E> means a depository institution that is <PRTPAGE P="31"/>an affiliate of a depository organization.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Depository organization</E> means a depository institution or a depository holding company.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">FDIC-supervised institution</E> means either an insured state nonmember bank or a State savings association.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Low- and moderate-income areas</E> means census tracts (or, if an area is not in a census tract, block numbering areas delineated by the United States Bureau of the Census) where the median family income is less than 100 percent of the area median income.</P>
            <P>(k) <E T="03">Management official.</E> (1) The term <E T="03">management official</E> means:</P>
            <P>(i) A director;</P>
            <P>(ii) An advisory or honorary director of a depository institution with total assets of $100 million or more;</P>
            <P>(iii) A senior executive officer as that term is defined in 12 CFR 303.101(b).</P>
            <P>(iv) A branch manager;</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Exemption.</E> The FDIC may by agency order exempt an interlock from the prohibitions in § 348.3 if the FDIC finds that the interlock would not result in a monopoly or substantial lessening of competition and would not present safety and soundness concerns.</P>

A change in circumstances may include an increase in asset size of an organization, a change in the delineation of the RMSA or community, the establishment of an office, an increase in the aggregate deposits of the depository organization, or an acquisition, merger, consolidation, or reorganization of the ownership structure of a depository organization that causes a previously permissible interlock to become prohibited.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Transition period.</E> A management official described in paragraph (a) of <PRTPAGE P="34"/>this section may continue to serve the FDIC-supervised institution involved in the interlock for 15 months following the date of the change in circumstances.

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Authority.</E> This subpart is issued by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) under section 4s(e) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 6s(e)), section 15F(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78o-10(e)), and section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1818).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> Section 4s of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 6s) and section 15F of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78o-10) require the FDIC to establish capital and margin requirements for any FDIC-insured state-chartered bank that is not a member of the Federal Reserve System or FDIC-insured state-chartered savings association that is registered as a swap dealer, major swap participant, security-based swap dealer, or major security-based swap participant with respect to all non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps. This subpart implements section 4s of the Commodity Exchange Act and section 15F of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by defining terms used in the statutes and related terms, establishing <PRTPAGE P="35"/>capital and margin requirements, and explaining the statutes' requirements.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Scope.</E> This subpart establishes minimum capital and margin requirements for each covered swap entity subject to this subpart with respect to all non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps. This subpart applies to any non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap entered into by a covered swap entity on or after the relevant compliance date set forth in paragraph (e) of this section. Nothing in this subpart is intended to prevent a covered swap entity from collecting margin in amounts greater than are required under this subpart.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Exemptions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Swaps.</E> The requirements of this part (except for § 45.12) shall not apply to a non-cleared swap if the counterparty:</P>
              <P>(i) Qualifies for an exception from clearing under section 2(h)(7)(A) of the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (7 U.S.C. 2(h)(7)(A)) and implementing regulations;</P>
              <P>(ii) Qualifies for an exemption from clearing under a rule, regulation, or order that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission issued pursuant to its authority under section 4(c)(1) of the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (7 U.S.C. 6(c)(1)) concerning cooperative entities that would otherwise be subject to the requirements of section 2(h)(1)(A) of the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (7 U.S.C. 2(h)(1)(A)); or</P>
              <P>(iii) Satisfies the criteria in section 2(h)(7)(D) of the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (7 U.S.C. 2(h)(7)(D)) and implementing regulations.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Security-based swaps.</E> The requirements of this part (except for § 349.12) shall not apply to a non-cleared security-based swap if the counterparty:</P>
              <P>(i) Qualifies for an exception from clearing under section 3C(g)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c-3(g)(1)) and implementing regulations; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Satisfies the criteria in section 3C(g)(4) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c-3(g)(4)) and implementing regulations.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Compliance dates.</E> Covered swap entities shall comply with the minimum margin requirements of this subpart on or before the following dates for non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps entered into on or after the following dates:</P>
              <P>(1) September 1, 2016 with respect to the requirements in § 349.3 for initial margin and § 349.4 for variation margin for any non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps, where both:</P>
              <P>(i) The covered swap entity combined with all its affiliates; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Its counterparty combined with all its affiliates, have an average daily aggregate notional amount of non-cleared swaps, non-cleared security-based swaps, foreign exchange forwards and foreign exchange swaps for March, April and May 2016 that exceeds $3 trillion, where such amounts are calculated only for business days; and</P>
              <P>(iii) In calculating the amounts in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, an entity shall count the average daily aggregate notional amount of a non-cleared swap, a non-cleared security-based swap, a foreign exchange forward or a foreign exchange swap between the entity and an affiliate only one time, and shall not count a swap or security-based swap that is exempt pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) March 1, 2017 with respect to the requirements in § 349.4 for variation margin for any other covered swap entity with respect to non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps entered into with any other counterparty.</P>

              <P>(2) If a covered swap entity's counterparty changes its status such that a non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap with that counterparty becomes subject to less strict margin requirements under this subpart (such as if the counterparty's status changes from a financial end user with material swaps exposure to a <PRTPAGE P="37"/>financial end user without material swaps exposure), then the covered swap entity may comply with the less strict margin requirements for any non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap entered into with that counterparty after the counterparty changes its status as well as for any outstanding non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap entered into after the applicable compliance date in paragraph (e) of this section and before the counterparty changed its status.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Netting arrangements.</E> (1) For purposes of calculating and complying with the initial margin requirements of § 349.3 using an initial margin model as described in § 349.8, or with the variation margin requirements of § 349.4, a covered swap entity may net non-cleared swaps or non-cleared security-based swaps in accordance with this subsection.</P>
              <P>(2) To the extent that one or more non-cleared swaps or non-cleared security-based swaps are executed pursuant to an eligible master netting agreement between a covered swap entity and its counterparty that is a swap entity or financial end user, a covered swap entity may calculate and comply with the applicable requirements of this subpart on an aggregate net basis with respect to all non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps governed by such agreement, subject to paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3)(i) Except as permitted in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, if an eligible master netting agreement covers non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps entered into on or after the applicable compliance date set forth in § 349.1(e) or (g), all the non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps covered by that agreement are subject to the requirements of this subpart and included in the aggregate netting portfolio for the purposes of calculating and complying with the margin requirements of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(ii) An eligible master netting agreement may identify one or more separate netting portfolios that independently meet the requirements in paragraph (1) of the definition of “Eligible master netting agreement” in § 349.2 and to which collection and posting of margin applies on an aggregate net basis separate from and exclusive of any other non-cleared swaps or non-cleared security-based swaps covered by the eligible master netting agreement. Any such netting portfolio that contains any non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap entered into on or after the applicable compliance date set forth in § 349.1(e) or (g) is subject to the requirements of this subpart. Any such netting portfolio that contains only non-cleared swaps or non-cleared security-based swaps entered into before the applicable compliance date is not subject to the requirements of this subpart.</P>

              <P>(4) If a covered swap entity cannot conclude after sufficient legal review with a well-founded basis that the netting agreement described in this section meets the definition of eligible master netting agreement set forth in § 349.2, the covered swap entity must treat the non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security based swaps covered by the agreement on a gross basis for the purposes of calculating and complying with the requirements of this subpart to collect margin, but the covered swap entity may net those non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section for the purposes of calculating and complying with the requirements of this subpart to post margin.<PRTPAGE P="44"/>

              <P>(a) A covered swap entity that posts any collateral other than for variation margin with respect to a non-cleared swap or a non-cleared security-based swap shall require that all funds or other property other than variation margin provided by the covered swap entity be held by one or more custodians that are not the covered swap entity or counterparty and not affiliates of the covered swap entity or the counterparty.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Standardized amounts.</E> Unless a covered swap entity's initial margin model conforms to the requirements of this section, the covered swap entity shall calculate the amount of initial margin required to be collected or posted for one or more non-cleared swaps or non-cleared security-based swaps with a given counterparty pursuant to § 349.3 on a daily basis pursuant to appendix A of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Use of initial margin models.</E> A covered swap entity may calculate the amount of initial margin required to be collected or posted for one or more non-cleared swaps or non-cleared security-based swaps with a given counterparty pursuant to § 349.3 on a daily basis using an initial margin model only if the initial margin model meets the requirements of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Requirements for initial margin model.</E> (1) A covered swap entity must obtain the prior written approval of <PRTPAGE P="48"/>the FDIC before using any initial margin model to calculate the initial margin required in this subpart.</P>
              <P>(2) A covered swap entity must demonstrate that the initial margin model satisfies all of the requirements of this section on an ongoing basis.</P>
              <P>(3) A covered swap entity must notify the FDIC in writing 60 days prior to:</P>
              <P>(i) Extending the use of an initial margin model that the FDIC has approved under this section to an additional product type;</P>
              <P>(ii) Making any change to any initial margin model approved by the FDIC under this section that would result in a material change in the covered swap entity's assessment of initial margin requirements; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Making any material change to modeling assumptions used by the initial margin model.</P>
              <P>(4) The FDIC may rescind its approval of the use of any initial margin model, in whole or in part, or may impose additional conditions or requirements if the FDIC determines, in its sole discretion, that the initial margin model no longer complies with this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Quantitative requirements.</E> (1) The covered swap entity's initial margin model must calculate an amount of initial margin that is equal to the potential future exposure of the non-cleared swap, non-cleared security-based swap or netting portfolio of non-cleared swaps or non-cleared security-based swaps covered by an eligible master netting agreement. Potential future exposure is an estimate of the one-tailed 99 percent confidence interval for an increase in the value of the non-cleared swap, non-cleared security-based swap or netting portfolio of non-cleared swaps or non-cleared security-based swaps due to an instantaneous price shock that is equivalent to a movement in all material underlying risk factors, including prices, rates, and spreads, over a holding period equal to the shorter of ten business days or the maturity of the non-cleared swap, non-cleared security-based swap or netting portfolio.</P>
              <P>(2) All data used to calibrate the initial margin model must be based on an equally weighted historical observation period of at least one year and not more than five years and must incorporate a period of significant financial stress for each broad asset class that is appropriate to the non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps to which the initial margin model is applied.</P>
              <P>(3) The covered swap entity's initial margin model must use risk factors sufficient to measure all material price risks inherent in the transactions for which initial margin is being calculated. The risk categories must include, but should not be limited to, foreign exchange or interest rate risk, credit risk, equity risk, and commodity risk, as appropriate. For material exposures in significant currencies and markets, modeling techniques must capture spread and basis risk and must incorporate a sufficient number of segments of the yield curve to capture differences in volatility and imperfect correlation of rates along the yield curve.</P>
              <P>(4) In the case of a non-cleared cross-currency swap, the covered swap entity's initial margin model need not recognize any risks or risk factors associated with the fixed, physically-settled foreign exchange transaction associated with the exchange of principal embedded in the non-cleared cross-currency swap. The initial margin model must recognize all material risks and risk factors associated with all other payments and cash flows that occur during the life of the non-cleared cross-currency swap.</P>

              <P>(5) The initial margin model may calculate initial margin for a non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap or a netting portfolio of non-cleared swaps or non-cleared security-based swaps covered by an eligible master netting agreement. It may reflect offsetting exposures, diversification, and other hedging benefits for non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps that are governed by the same eligible master netting agreement by incorporating empirical correlations within the following broad risk categories, provided the covered swap entity validates and demonstrates the reasonableness of its process for modeling and measuring hedging benefits: Commodity, credit, <PRTPAGE P="49"/>equity, and foreign exchange or interest rate. Empirical correlations under an eligible master netting agreement may be recognized by the initial margin model within each broad risk category, but not across broad risk categories.</P>
              <P>(6) If the initial margin model does not explicitly reflect offsetting exposures, diversification, and hedging benefits between subsets of non-cleared swaps or non-cleared security-based swaps within a broad risk category, the covered swap entity must calculate an amount of initial margin separately for each subset within which such relationships are explicitly recognized by the initial margin model. The sum of the initial margin amounts calculated for each subset of non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps within a broad risk category will be used to determine the aggregate initial margin due from the counterparty for the portfolio of non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps within the broad risk category.</P>
              <P>(7) The sum of the initial margin amounts calculated for each broad risk category will be used to determine the aggregate initial margin due from the counterparty.</P>
              <P>(8) The initial margin model may not permit the calculation of any initial margin collection amount to be offset by, or otherwise take into account, any initial margin that may be owed or otherwise payable by the covered swap entity to the counterparty.</P>
              <P>(9) The initial margin model must include all material risks arising from the nonlinear price characteristics of option positions or positions with embedded optionality and the sensitivity of the market value of the positions to changes in the volatility of the underlying rates, prices, or other material risk factors.</P>
              <P>(10) The covered swap entity may not omit any risk factor from the calculation of its initial margin that the covered swap entity uses in its initial margin model unless it has first demonstrated to the satisfaction of the FDIC that such omission is appropriate.</P>
              <P>(11) The covered swap entity may not incorporate any proxy or approximation used to capture the risks of the covered swap entity's non-cleared swaps or non-cleared security-based swaps unless it has first demonstrated to the satisfaction of the FDIC that such proxy or approximation is appropriate.</P>
              <P>(12) The covered swap entity must have a rigorous and well-defined process for re-estimating, re-evaluating, and updating its internal margin model to ensure continued applicability and relevance.</P>
              <P>(13) The covered swap entity must review and, as necessary, revise the data used to calibrate the initial margin model at least annually, and more frequently as market conditions warrant, to ensure that the data incorporate a period of significant financial stress appropriate to the non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps to which the initial margin model is applied.</P>
              <P>(14) The level of sophistication of the initial margin model must be commensurate with the complexity of the non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps to which it is applied. In calculating an initial margin collection amount, the initial margin model may make use of any of the generally accepted approaches for modeling the risk of a single instrument or portfolio of instruments.</P>
              <P>(15) The FDIC may in its sole discretion require a covered swap entity using an initial margin model to collect a greater amount of initial margin than that determined by the covered swap entity's initial margin model if the FDIC determines that the additional collateral is appropriate due to the nature, structure, or characteristics of the covered swap entity's transaction(s), or is commensurate with the risks associated with the transaction(s).</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Periodic review.</E> A covered swap entity must periodically, but no less frequently than annually, review its initial margin model in light of developments in financial markets and modeling technologies, and enhance the initial margin model as appropriate to ensure that the initial margin model continues to meet the requirements for approval in this section.<PRTPAGE P="50"/>
              </P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Control, oversight, and validation mechanisms.</E> (1) The covered swap entity must maintain a risk control unit that reports directly to senior management and is independent from the business trading units.</P>
              <P>(2) The covered swap entity's risk control unit must validate its initial margin model prior to implementation and on an ongoing basis. The covered swap entity's validation process must be independent of the development, implementation, and operation of the initial margin model, or the validation process must be subject to an independent review of its adequacy and effectiveness. The validation process must include:</P>
              <P>(i) An evaluation of the conceptual soundness of (including developmental evidence supporting) the initial margin model;</P>
              <P>(ii) An ongoing monitoring process that includes verification of processes and benchmarking by comparing the covered swap entity's initial margin model outputs (estimation of initial margin) with relevant alternative internal and external data sources or estimation techniques. The benchmark(s) must address the chosen model's limitations. When applicable, the covered swap entity should consider benchmarks that allow for non-normal distributions such as historical and Monte Carlo simulations. When applicable, validation shall include benchmarking against observable margin standards to ensure that the initial margin required is not less than what a derivatives clearing organization or a clearing agency would require for similar cleared transactions; and</P>
              <P>(iii) An outcomes analysis process that includes backtesting the initial margin model. This analysis must recognize and compensate for the challenges inherent in back-testing over periods that do not contain significant financial stress.</P>
              <P>(3) If the validation process reveals any material problems with the initial margin model, the covered swap entity must promptly notify the FDIC of the problems, describe to the FDIC any remedial actions being taken, and adjust the initial margin model to ensure an appropriately conservative amount of required initial margin is being calculated.</P>
              <P>(4) The covered swap entity must have an internal audit function independent of business-line management and the risk control unit that at least annually assesses the effectiveness of the controls supporting the covered swap entity's initial margin model measurement systems, including the activities of the business trading units and risk control unit, compliance with policies and procedures, and calculation of the covered swap entity's initial margin requirements under this subpart. At least annually, the internal audit function must report its findings to the covered swap entity's board of directors or a committee thereof.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Documentation.</E> The covered swap entity must adequately document all material aspects of its initial margin model, including the management and valuation of the non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps to which it applies, the control, oversight, and validation of the initial margin model, any review processes and the results of such processes.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Escalation procedures.</E> The covered swap entity must adequately document internal authorization procedures, including escalation procedures, that require review and approval of any change to the initial margin calculation under the initial margin model, demonstrable analysis that any basis for any such change is consistent with the requirements of this section, and independent review of such demonstrable analysis and approval.</P>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Initial margin threshold amount.</E> For purposes of calculating the amount of initial margin to be collected from an affiliate counterparty in accordance with § 349.3(a) or calculating the amount of initial margin that would have been posted to an affiliate counterparty in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the initial margin threshold amount is an aggregate credit exposure of $20 million resulting from all non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps between the covered swap entity and that affiliate. For purposes of this calculation, an entity shall not count a non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap that is exempt pursuant to § 349.1(d).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Variation margin.</E> A covered swap entity shall collect and post variation margin with respect to a non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap with any counterparty that is an affiliate as provided in § 349.4.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Custodian for non-cash collateral.</E> To the extent that a covered swap entity collects initial margin required by § 349.3(a) from an affiliate with respect to any non-cleared swap or non-cleared <PRTPAGE P="54"/>security-based swap in the form of collateral other than cash collateral, the custodian for such collateral may be the covered swap entity or an affiliate of the covered swap entity.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Model holding period and netting</E>—(1) <E T="03">Model holding period.</E> For any non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap (or netting portfolio) between a covered swap entity and an affiliate that would be subject to the clearing requirements of section 2(h)(1)(A) of the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 or section 3C(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 but for an exemption under section 2(h)(7)(C)(iii) or (D) or section 4(c)(1) of the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 or regulations of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission or section 3C(g)(4) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the covered swap entity's initial margin model calculation as described in § 349.8(d)(1) may use a holding period equal to the shorter of five business days or the maturity of the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap (or netting portfolio).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Netting arrangements.</E> Any netting portfolio that contains any non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap with a model holding period equal to the shorter of five business days or the maturity of the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section must be identified and separate from any other netting portfolio for purposes of calculating and complying with the initial margin requirements of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Standardized amounts.</E> If a covered swap entity's initial margin model does not conform to the requirements of § 349.8, the covered swap entity shall calculate the amount of initial margin required to be collected for one or more non-cleared swaps or non-cleared security-based swaps with a given affiliate counterparty pursuant to section § 349.3 on a daily basis pursuant to Appendix A with the gross initial margin multiplied by 0.7.</P>

              <EXTRACT>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Risk Disclosure Statement</HD>
                <P>Retail forex transactions involve the leveraged trading of contracts denominated in foreign currency with an FDIC-supervised insured depository institution as your counterparty. Because of the leverage and the other risks disclosed here, you can rapidly lose all of the funds or property you give the FDIC-supervised insured depository institution as margin for such trading and you may lose more than you pledge as margin.</P>
                <P>Your FDIC-supervised insured depository institution is prohibited from applying losses that you experience on retail forex transactions on any funds or property of yours other than funds or property that you have given or pledged as margin for retail forex transactions.</P>
                <P>You should be aware of and carefully consider the following points before determining whether such trading is appropriate for you.</P>
                <P>(1) Trading is a not on a regulated market or exchange—your FDIC-supervised insured depository institution is your trading counterparty and has conflicting interests. The retail forex transaction you are entering into is not conducted on an interbank market, nor is it conducted on a futures exchange subject to regulation as a designated contract market by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The foreign currency trades you transact are trades with your FDIC-supervised insured depository institution as the counterparty. When you sell, the FDIC-supervised insured depository institution is the buyer. When you buy, the FDIC-supervised insured depository institution is the seller. As a result, when you lose money trading, your FDIC-supervised insured depository institution is making money on such trades, in addition to any fees, commissions, or spreads the FDIC-supervised insured depository institution may charge.</P>
                <P>(2) An electronic trading platform for retail foreign currency transactions is not an exchange. It is an electronic connection for accessing your FDIC-supervised insured depository institution. The terms of availability of such a platform are governed only by your contract with your FDIC-supervised insured depository institution. Any trading platform that you may use to enter into off-exchange foreign currency transactions is only connected to your FDIC-supervised insured depository institution. You are accessing that trading platform only to transact with your FDIC-supervised insured depository institution. You are not trading with any other entities or customers of the FDIC-supervised insured depository institution by accessing such platform. The availability and operation of any such platform, including the consequences of the unavailability of the trading platform for any reason, is governed only by the terms of your account agreement with the FDIC-supervised insured depository institution.</P>

                <P>(3) You may be able to offset or liquidate any trading positions only through your banking entity because the transactions are not made on an exchange or regulated contract market, and your FDIC-supervised insured depository institution may set its own prices. Your ability to close your transactions or offset positions is limited to what <PRTPAGE P="60"/>your FDIC-supervised insured depository institution will offer to you, as there is no other market for these transactions. Your FDIC-supervised insured depository institution may offer any prices it wishes, including prices derived from outside sources or not in its discretion. Your FDIC-supervised insured depository institution may establish its prices by offering spreads from third party prices, but it is under no obligation to do so or to continue to do so. Your FDIC-supervised insured depository institution may offer different prices to different customers at any point in time on its own terms. The terms of your account agreement alone govern the obligations your FDIC-supervised insured depository institution has to you to offer prices and offer offset or liquidating transactions in your account and make any payments to you. The prices offered by your FDIC-supervised insured depository institution may or may not reflect prices available elsewhere at any exchange, interbank, or other market for foreign currency.</P>
                <P>(4) Paid solicitors may have undisclosed conflicts. The FDIC-supervised insured depository institution may compensate introducing brokers for introducing your account in ways that are not disclosed to you. Such paid solicitors are not required to have, and may not have, any special expertise in trading, and may have conflicts of interest based on the method by which they are compensated. You should thoroughly investigate the manner in which all such solicitors are compensated and be very cautious in granting any person or entity authority to trade on your behalf. You should always consider obtaining dated written confirmation of any information you are relying on from your FDIC-supervised insured depository institution in making any trading or account decisions.</P>
                <P>(5) Retail forex transactions are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.</P>
                <P>(6) Retail forex transactions are not a deposit in, or guaranteed by, an FDIC-supervised insured depository institution.</P>
                <P>(7) Retail forex transactions are subject to investment risks, including possible loss of all amounts invested.</P>
                <P>Finally, you should thoroughly investigate any statements by any FDIC-supervised insured depository institution that minimize the importance of, or contradict, any of the terms of this risk disclosure. These statements may indicate sales fraud.</P>
                <P>This brief statement cannot, of course, disclose all the risks and other aspects of trading off-exchange foreign currency with an FDIC-supervised insured depository institution.</P>

              <P>(ii) The aggregate value of the outstanding ownership interests held by the banking entity shall be the aggregate fair market value of all investments in and capital contributions made to the covered fund by the banking entity, divided by the value of all investments in and capital contributions made to that covered fund by all entities, as of the last day of each calendar quarter (all measured without regard to committed funds not yet called for investment).

              <P>(iii) For securitization transactions completed prior to the compliance date of such implementing regulations (or as to which such implementing regulations do not apply), the aggregate value of the outstanding ownership interests in the covered fund shall be the fair market value of the assets transferred to the issuing entity of the securitization and any other assets otherwise held by the issuing entity at such time, determined in a manner that is consistent with its determination of the fair market value of those assets for financial statement purposes.</P>

              <P>(iv) For purposes of the calculation under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, the valuation methodology used to calculate the fair market value of the ownership interests must be the same for both the ownership interests <PRTPAGE P="97"/>held by a banking entity and the ownership interests held by all others in the covered fund in the same manner and according to the same standards.</P>

              <P>(a) The prohibition contained in § 351.10(a)(1) does not apply to the ownership by a banking entity of an interest in, or sponsorship of, any issuer if:</P>
              <P>(1) The issuer was established, and the interest was issued, before May 19, 2010;</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix A to Part 351—Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements for Covered Trading Activities</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Purpose</HD>

              <P>a. This appendix sets forth reporting and recordkeeping requirements that certain banking entities must satisfy in connection with the restrictions on proprietary trading set forth in subpart B (“proprietary trading restrictions”). Pursuant to § 351.20(d), this appendix generally applies to a banking entity that, together with its affiliates and subsidiaries, has significant trading assets and liabilities. These entities are required to (i) furnish periodic reports to the FDIC regarding a variety of quantitative measurements of their covered trading activities, which vary depending on the scope and size of covered trading activities, and (ii) create and <PRTPAGE P="106"/>maintain records documenting the preparation and content of these reports. The requirements of this appendix must be incorporated into the banking entity's internal compliance program under § 351.20 and Appendix B.</P>
              <P>b. The purpose of this appendix is to assist banking entities and the FDIC in:</P>
              <P>(i) Better understanding and evaluating the scope, type, and profile of the banking entity's covered trading activities;</P>
              <P>(ii) Monitoring the banking entity's covered trading activities;</P>
              <P>(iii) Identifying covered trading activities that warrant further review or examination by the banking entity to verify compliance with the proprietary trading restrictions;</P>
              <P>(iv) Evaluating whether the covered trading activities of trading desks engaged in market making-related activities subject to § 351.4(b) are consistent with the requirements governing permitted market making-related activities;</P>
              <P>(v) Evaluating whether the covered trading activities of trading desks that are engaged in permitted trading activity subject to §§ 351.4, 351.5, or 351.6(a)-(b) (i.e., underwriting and market making-related related activity, risk-mitigating hedging, or trading in certain government obligations) are consistent with the requirement that such activity not result, directly or indirectly, in a material exposure to high-risk assets or high-risk trading strategies;</P>
              <P>(vi) Identifying the profile of particular covered trading activities of the banking entity, and the individual trading desks of the banking entity, to help establish the appropriate frequency and scope of examination by the FDIC of such activities; and</P>
              <P>(vii) Assessing and addressing the risks associated with the banking entity's covered trading activities.</P>

              <P>c. The quantitative measurements that must be furnished pursuant to this appendix are <E T="03">not</E> intended to serve as a dispositive tool for the identification of permissible or impermissible activities.</P>
              <P>d. In order to allow banking entities and the Agencies to evaluate the effectiveness of these metrics, banking entities must collect and report these metrics for all trading desks beginning on the dates established in § 351.20 of the final rule. The Agencies will review the data collected and revise this collection requirement as appropriate based on a review of the data collected prior to September 30, 2015.</P>
              <P>e. In addition to the quantitative measurements required in this appendix, a banking entity may need to develop and implement other quantitative measurements in order to effectively monitor its covered trading activities for compliance with section 13 of the BHC Act and this part and to have an effective compliance program, as required by § 351.20 and Appendix B to this part. The effectiveness of particular quantitative measurements may differ based on the profile of the banking entity's businesses in general and, more specifically, of the particular trading desk, including types of instruments traded, trading activities and strategies, and history and experience (e.g., whether the trading desk is an established, successful market maker or a new entrant to a competitive market). In all cases, banking entities must ensure that they have robust measures in place to identify and monitor the risks taken in their trading activities, to ensure that the activities are within risk tolerances established by the banking entity, and to monitor and examine for compliance with the proprietary trading restrictions in this part.</P>
              <P>f. On an ongoing basis, banking entities must carefully monitor, review, and evaluate all furnished quantitative measurements, as well as any others that they choose to utilize in order to maintain compliance with section 13 of the BHC Act and this part. All measurement results that indicate a heightened risk of impermissible proprietary trading, including with respect to otherwise-permitted activities under §§ 351.4 through 351.6(a) and (b), or that result in a material exposure to high-risk assets or high-risk trading strategies, must be escalated within the banking entity for review, further analysis, explanation to the FDIC, and remediation, where appropriate. The quantitative measurements discussed in this appendix should be helpful to banking entities in identifying and managing the risks related to their covered trading activities.</P>

              <P>i. <E T="03">Description:</E> For purposes of this appendix, Risk and Position Limits are the constraints that define the amount of risk that a trading desk is permitted to take at a point in time, as defined by the banking entity for a specific trading desk. Usage represents the portion of the trading desk's limits that are accounted for by the current activity of the desk. Risk and position limits and their usage are key risk management tools used to control and monitor risk taking and include, but are not limited, to the limits set out in § 351.4 and § 351.5. A number of the metrics that are described below, including “Risk Factor Sensitivities” and “Value-at-Risk and Stress Value-at-Risk,” relate to a trading desk's risk and position limits and are useful in evaluating and setting these limits in the broader context of the trading desk's overall activities, particularly for the market making activities under § 351.4(b) and hedging activity under § 351.5. Accordingly, the limits required under § 351.4(b)(2)(iii) and § 351.5(b)(1)(i) must meet the applicable requirements under § 351.4(b)(2)(iii) and § 351.5(b)(1)(i) and also must include appropriate metrics for the trading desk limits including, at a minimum, the “Risk Factor Sensitivities” and “Value-at-Risk and Stress Value-at-Risk” metrics except to the extent any of the “Risk Factor Sensitivities” or “Value-at-Risk and Stress Value-at-Risk” metrics are demonstrably ineffective for measuring and monitoring the risks of a trading desk based on the types of positions traded by, and risk exposures of, that desk.</P>
              <P>ii. <E T="03">General Calculation Guidance:</E> Risk and Position Limits must be reported in the format used by the banking entity for the purposes of risk management of each trading desk. Risk and Position Limits are often expressed in terms of risk measures, such as VaR and Risk Factor Sensitivities, but may also be expressed in terms of other observable criteria, such as net open positions. When criteria other than VaR or Risk Factor Sensitivities are used to define the Risk and Position Limits, both the value of the Risk and Position Limits and the value of the variables used to assess whether these limits have been reached must be reported.</P>
              <P>iii. <E T="03">Calculation Period:</E> One trading day.</P>
              <P>iv. <E T="03">Measurement Frequency:</E> Daily.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Risk Factor Sensitivities</HD>
              <P>i. <E T="03">Description:</E> For purposes of this appendix, Risk Factor Sensitivities are changes in a trading desk's Comprehensive Profit and Loss that are expected to occur in the event of a change in one or more underlying variables that are significant sources of the trading desk's profitability and risk.</P>
              <P>ii. <E T="03">General Calculation Guidance:</E> A banking entity must report the Risk Factor Sensitivities that are monitored and managed as part of the trading desk's overall risk management policy. The underlying data and methods used to compute a trading desk's Risk Factor Sensitivities will depend on the specific function of the trading desk and the internal risk management models employed. The number and type of Risk Factor Sensitivities that are monitored and managed by a trading desk, and furnished to the FDIC, will depend on the explicit risks assumed by the trading desk. In general, however, reported Risk Factor Sensitivities must be sufficiently granular to account for a preponderance of the expected price variation in the trading desk's holdings.</P>

              <P>A. Trading desks must take into account any relevant factors in calculating Risk Factor Sensitivities, including, for example, the following with respect to particular asset classes:<PRTPAGE P="108"/>

              <P>• <E T="03">Commodity derivative positions:</E> risk factors with respect to the related commodities set out in 17 CFR 20.2, the maturity of the positions, volatility and/or correlation sensitivities (expressed in a manner that demonstrates any significant non-linearities), and the maturity profile of the positions;</P>
              <P>• <E T="03">Credit positions:</E> risk factors with respect to credit spreads that are sufficiently granular to account for specific credit sectors and market segments, the maturity profile of the positions, and risk factors with respect to interest rates of all relevant maturities;</P>
              <P>• <E T="03">Credit-related derivative positions:</E> risk factor sensitivities, for example credit spreads, shifts (parallel and non-parallel) in credit spreads—volatility, and/or correlation sensitivities (expressed in a manner that demonstrates any significant non-linearities), and the maturity profile of the positions;</P>
              <P>• <E T="03">Equity derivative positions:</E> risk factor sensitivities such as equity positions, volatility, and/or correlation sensitivities (expressed in a manner that demonstrates any significant non-linearities), and the maturity profile of the positions;</P>
              <P>• <E T="03">Equity positions:</E> risk factors for equity prices and risk factors that differentiate between important equity market sectors and segments, such as a small capitalization equities and international equities;</P>
              <P>• <E T="03">Foreign exchange derivative positions:</E> risk factors with respect to major currency pairs and maturities, exposure to interest rates at relevant maturities, volatility, and/or correlation sensitivities (expressed in a manner that demonstrates any significant non-linearities), as well as the maturity profile of the positions; and</P>
              <P>• <E T="03">Interest rate positions, including interest rate derivative positions:</E> risk factors with respect to major interest rate categories and maturities and volatility and/or correlation sensitivities (expressed in a manner that demonstrates any significant non-linearities), and shifts (parallel and non-parallel) in the interest rate curve, as well as the maturity profile of the positions.</P>
              <P>B. The methods used by a banking entity to calculate sensitivities to a common factor shared by multiple trading desks, such as an equity price factor, must be applied consistently across its trading desks so that the sensitivities can be compared from one trading desk to another.</P>

              <P>i. <E T="03">Description:</E> For purposes of this appendix, Value-at-Risk (“VaR”) is the commonly used percentile measurement of the risk of future financial loss in the value of a given set of aggregated positions over a specified period of time, based on current market conditions. For purposes of this appendix, Stress Value-at-Risk (“Stress VaR”) is the percentile measurement of the risk of future financial loss in the value of a given set of aggregated positions over a specified period of time, based on market conditions during a period of significant financial stress.</P>
              <P>ii. <E T="03">General Calculation Guidance:</E> Banking entities must compute and report VaR and Stress VaR by employing generally accepted standards and methods of calculation. VaR should reflect a loss in a trading desk that is expected to be exceeded less than one percent of the time over a one-day period. For those banking entities that are subject to regulatory capital requirements imposed by a Federal banking agency, VaR and Stress VaR must be computed and reported in a manner that is consistent with such regulatory capital requirements. In cases where a trading desk does not have a standalone VaR or Stress VaR calculation but is part of a larger aggregation of positions for which a VaR or Stress VaR calculation is performed, a VaR or Stress VaR calculation that includes only the trading desk's holdings must be performed consistent with the VaR or Stress VaR model and methodology used for the larger aggregation of positions.</P>

              <P>i. <E T="03">Description:</E> For purposes of this appendix, Comprehensive Profit and Loss Attribution is an analysis that attributes the daily fluctuation in the value of a trading desk's positions to various sources. First, the daily profit and loss of the aggregated positions is divided into three categories: (i) profit and loss attributable to a trading desk's existing positions that were also positions held by the trading desk as of the end of the prior day (“existing positions”); (ii) profit and loss attributable to new positions resulting from the current day's trading activity (“new positions”); and (iii) residual profit and loss that cannot be specifically attributed to existing positions or new positions. The sum of (i), (ii), and (iii) must equal the trading desk's comprehensive profit and loss at each point in time. In addition, profit and loss measurements must calculate volatility of comprehensive profit and loss (i.e., the standard deviation of the trading desk's one-day profit and loss, in dollar terms) for the reporting period for at least a 30-, 60- and 90-day lag period, from the end of the reporting period, and any other period that the banking entity deems necessary to meet the requirements of the rule.</P>

              <P>A. The comprehensive profit and loss associated with existing positions must reflect changes in the value of these positions on the applicable day. The comprehensive profit <PRTPAGE P="109"/>and loss from existing positions must be further attributed, as applicable, to changes in (i) the specific Risk Factors and other factors that are monitored and managed as part of the trading desk's overall risk management policies and procedures; and (ii) any other applicable elements, such as cash flows, carry, changes in reserves, and the correction, cancellation, or exercise of a trade.</P>
              <P>B. The comprehensive profit and loss attributed to new positions must reflect commissions and fee income or expense and market gains or losses associated with transactions executed on the applicable day. New positions include purchases and sales of financial instruments and other assets/liabilities and negotiated amendments to existing positions. The comprehensive profit and loss from new positions may be reported in the aggregate and does not need to be further attributed to specific sources.</P>
              <P>C. The portion of comprehensive profit and loss that cannot be specifically attributed to known sources must be allocated to a residual category identified as an unexplained portion of the comprehensive profit and loss. Significant unexplained profit and loss must be escalated for further investigation and analysis.</P>
              <P>ii. <E T="03">General Calculation Guidance:</E> The specific categories used by a trading desk in the attribution analysis and amount of detail for the analysis should be tailored to the type and amount of trading activities undertaken by the trading desk. The new position attribution must be computed by calculating the difference between the prices at which instruments were bought and/or sold and the prices at which those instruments are marked to market at the close of business on that day multiplied by the notional or principal amount of each purchase or sale. Any fees, commissions, or other payments received (paid) that are associated with transactions executed on that day must be added (subtracted) from such difference. These factors must be measured consistently over time to facilitate historical comparisons.</P>

Inventory Aging must include two schedules, an asset-aging schedule and a liability-aging schedule. Each schedule must record the value of assets or liabilities held over all holding periods. For derivatives, other than options, and interest rate derivatives, value means gross notional value, for options, value means delta adjusted notional value and, for interest rate derivatives, value means 10-year bond equivalent value.</P>

              <P>i. <E T="03">Description:</E> For purposes of this appendix, the Customer-Facing Trade Ratio is a ratio comparing (i) the transactions involving a counterparty that is a customer of the trading desk to (ii) the transactions involving a counterparty that is not a customer of the trading desk. A trade count based ratio must be computed that records the number of transactions involving a counterparty that is a customer of the trading desk and the number of transactions involving a counterparty that is not a customer of the trading desk. A value based ratio must be computed that records the value of transactions involving a counterparty that is a customer of the trading desk and the value of transactions involving a counterparty that is not a customer of the trading desk.</P>
              <P>ii. <E T="03">General Calculation Guidance:</E> For purposes of calculating the Customer-Facing Trade Ratio, a counterparty is considered to be a customer of the trading desk if the counterparty is a market participant that makes use of the banking entity's market making-related services by obtaining such services, responding to quotations, or entering into a continuing relationship with respect to such services. However, a trading desk or other organizational unit of another <PRTPAGE P="110"/>banking entity would not be a client, customer, or counterparty of the trading desk if the other entity has trading assets and liabilities of $50 billion or more as measured in accordance with § 351.20(d)(1) unless the trading desk documents how and why a particular trading desk or other organizational unit of the entity should be treated as a client, customer, or counterparty of the trading desk. Transactions conducted anonymously on an exchange or similar trading facility that permits trading on behalf of a broad range of market participants would be considered transactions with customers of the trading desk. For derivatives, other than options, and interest rate derivatives, value means gross notional value, for options, value means delta adjusted notional value, and for interest rate derivatives, value means 10-year bond equivalent value.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Overview</HD>
              <P>Section 351.20(c) requires certain banking entities to establish, maintain, and enforce an enhanced compliance program that includes the requirements and standards in this Appendix as well as the minimum written policies and procedures, internal controls, management framework, independent testing, training, and recordkeeping provisions outlined in § 351.20. This Appendix sets forth additional minimum standards with respect to the establishment, oversight, maintenance, and enforcement by these banking entities of an enhanced internal compliance program for ensuring and monitoring compliance with the prohibitions and restrictions on proprietary trading and covered fund activities and investments set forth in section 13 of the BHC Act and this part.</P>
              <P>a. This compliance program must:</P>
              <P>1. Be reasonably designed to identify, document, monitor, and report the permitted trading and covered fund activities and investments of the banking entity; identify, monitor and promptly address the risks of these covered activities and investments and potential areas of noncompliance; and prevent activities or investments prohibited by, or that do not comply with, section 13 of the BHC Act and this part;</P>
              <P>2. Establish and enforce appropriate limits on the covered activities and investments of the banking entity, including limits on the size, scope, complexity, and risks of the individual activities or investments consistent with the requirements of section 13 of the BHC Act and this part;</P>
              <P>3. Subject the effectiveness of the compliance program to periodic independent review and testing, and ensure that the entity's internal audit, corporate compliance and internal control functions involved in review and testing are effective and independent;</P>
              <P>4. Make senior management, and others as appropriate, accountable for the effective implementation of the compliance program, and ensure that the board of directors and chief executive officer (or equivalent) of the banking entity review the effectiveness of the compliance program; and</P>
              <P>5. Facilitate supervision and examination by the Agencies of the banking entity's permitted trading and covered fund activities and investments.</P>

              <P>
                <E T="03">3. Authorized risks, instruments, and products.</E> The banking entity must implement and enforce limits and internal controls for each trading desk that are reasonably designed to ensure that trading activity is conducted in conformance with section 13 of the BHC Act and this part and with the banking entity's written policies and procedures. The banking entity must establish and enforce risk limits appropriate for the activity of each trading desk. These limits should be based on probabilistic and non-probabilistic measures of potential loss (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> Value-at-Risk and notional exposure, respectively), and measured under normal and stress market conditions. At a minimum, these internal controls must monitor, establish and enforce limits on:</P>

Analysis and quantitative measurements.</E> The banking entity must perform robust analysis and quantitative measurement of its trading activities that is reasonably designed to ensure that the trading activity of each trading desk is consistent with the banking entity's compliance program; monitor and assist in the identification of potential and actual prohibited proprietary trading activity; and prevent the occurrence of prohibited proprietary trading. Analysis and models used to determine, measure and limit risk must be rigorously tested and be reviewed by management responsible for trading activity to ensure that trading activities, limits, strategies, and hedging activities do not understate the risk and exposure to the banking entity or allow prohibited proprietary trading. This review should include periodic and independent back-testing and revision of activities, limits, strategies and hedging as appropriate to contain risk and ensure compliance. In addition to the quantitative measurements reported by any banking entity subject to Appendix A to this part, each banking entity must develop and implement, to the extent appropriate to facilitate compliance with this part, additional quantitative measurements specifically tailored to the particular risks, practices, and strategies of its trading desks. The banking entity's analysis and quantitative measurements must incorporate the quantitative measurements reported by the banking entity pursuant to Appendix A (if applicable) and include, at a minimum, the following:</P>
              <P>i. Internal controls and written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure the accuracy and integrity of quantitative measurements;</P>
              <P>ii. Ongoing, timely monitoring and review of calculated quantitative measurements;</P>
              <P>iii.

              <P>iv. Immediate review and compliance investigation of the trading desk's activities, escalation to senior management with oversight responsibilities for the applicable trading desk, timely notification to the FDIC, appropriate remedial action (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> divesting of impermissible positions, cessation of impermissible activity, disciplinary actions), and documentation of the investigation findings and remedial action taken when quantitative measurements or other information, considered together with the facts and circumstances, or findings of internal audit, independent testing or other review suggest a reasonable likelihood that the trading desk has violated any part of section 13 of the BHC Act or this part.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">6. Other Compliance Matters.</E> In addition to the requirements specified above, the banking entity's compliance program must:</P>
              <P>i. Identify activities of each trading desk that will be conducted in reliance on exemptions contained in §§ 351.4 through 351.6, including an explanation of:</P>
              <P>A. How and where in the organization the activity occurs; and</P>
              <P>B. Which exemption is being relied on and how the activity meets the specific requirements for reliance on the applicable exemption;</P>
              <P>ii. Include an explanation of the process for documenting, approving and reviewing actions taken pursuant to the liquidity management plan, where in the organization this activity occurs, the securities permissible for liquidity management, the process for ensuring that liquidity management activities are not conducted for the purpose of prohibited proprietary trading, and the process for ensuring that securities purchased as part of the liquidity management plan are highly liquid and conform to the requirements of this part;</P>

              </P>
              <P>A. Assets whose values cannot be externally priced or, where valuation is reliant on pricing models, whose model inputs cannot be externally validated;</P>
              <P>B. Assets whose changes in value cannot be adequately mitigated by effective hedging;</P>
              <P>C. New products with rapid growth, including those that do not have a market history;</P>

              <P>iv. Establish responsibility for compliance with the reporting and recordkeeping requirements of subpart B and § 351.20; and</P>
              <P>v. Establish policies for monitoring and prohibiting potential or actual material conflicts of interest between the banking entity and its clients, customers, or counterparties.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">7. Remediation of violations.</E> The banking entity's compliance program must be reasonably designed and established to effectively monitor and identify for further analysis any trading activity that may indicate potential violations of section 13 of the BHC Act and this part and to prevent actual violations of section 13 of the BHC Act and this part.

            <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) One purpose of this part is to implement the spirit of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (the Rehabilitation Act) as amended by section 119 of the Rehabilitation, Comprehensive Services, and Developmental Disabilities Amendments of 1978 and the Workforce Investment Act of 1998. Section 504 prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in programs and activities conducted by a federal executive agency. Although the FDIC does not believe that Congress contemplated coverage of non-appropriated, independent regulatory agencies such as the FDIC, the FDIC has chosen to promulgate this final regulation to ensure that, to the extent practicable, persons with disabilities are provided with equal access to FDIC programs and activities.</P>
            <P>(b) This part is also intended to implement section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act as amended. Section 508 requires each federal agency or department to ensure that the electronic and information technology they procure allows individuals with disabilities access to that technology comparable to the access of those who are not disabled, unless the agency would incur an undue burden.</P>

            <P>(ii) Discussing with FDIC representatives matters related to the repayment <PRTPAGE P="117"/>of debts which they previously owed to such bank, prior to its failure or purchase by another bank under FDIC supervision;</P>
            <P>(6) Seeking employment with the FDIC;</P>
            <P>(b) This regulation governs the conduct of FDIC personnel in their interaction with employees of insured banks and employees of other state or federal agencies while discharging the FDIC's statutory obligations as insurer and/or receiver of financial institutions. It does not apply to financial institutions insured by the FDIC.</P>
            <P>(c) Although application for employment and employment with the FDIC are programs and activities of the FDIC for purposes of this regulation, they shall be governed only by the standards set forth in § 352.6 of this part.</P>

            <P>(1) The FDIC shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford an individual with a disability an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, the FDIC programs or activities.</P>
            <P>(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the FDIC shall give primary consideration to any reasonable requests of the individual with a disability.</P>
            <P>(ii) The FDIC need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.</P>
            <P>(2) Where the FDIC communicates by telephone, it shall use telecommunications devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems with hearing impaired participants and beneficiaries.</P>
            <P>(b) The FDIC shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, facilities and EIT. Interested persons may obtain such information by calling, writing or visiting the FDIC Office of Minority and Women Inclusion (OMWI), located at 3501 Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22226.

            <SUBJECT>Compliance procedures.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> Paragraph (b) of this section applies to employment complaints. The remaining sections concern complaints alleging disability discrimination in FDIC programs or activities and denial of technology access.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Employment complaints.</E> The FDIC shall process complaints alleging employment discrimination on the basis of disability according to the procedures established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR parts 1614 and 1630 pursuant to section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791).</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Informal process.</E> A complainant shall first exhaust informal administrative procedures before filing a formal complaint alleging disability discrimination in FDIC programs or activities, or a denial of technology access. The FDIC's Office of Minority and Women Inclusion shall be responsible for coordinating implementation of this section. An aggrieved individual initiates the process by filing an informal complaint with OMWI within 180 calendar days from the date of the alleged disability discrimination or denial of access to electronic information technology. An informal complaint with respect to any FDIC program or activity must include a written statement containing the individual's name and address which describes the FDIC's action in sufficient detail to inform the FDIC of the nature and date of the alleged violation of these regulations. An informal complaint for denial of technology access must clearly identify the individual and the manner in which the EIT was inaccessible. All informal complaints shall be signed by the complainant or one authorized to do so on his or her behalf. Informal complaints filed on behalf of third parties shall describe or identify (by name if possible) the alleged victim of discrimination or denial of technology access. During the informal resolution process, OMWI has 30 days to attempt a resolution of the matter. If the aggrieved individual elects to participate in mediation, the period for attempting informal resolution will be extended for an additional 60 calendar days. If the matter is not resolved informally, the individual will be provided written notice of the right to file a formal complaint. All complaints should be sent to the FDIC's Office of Minority and Women Inclusion, 3501 Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22226.</P>
            <P>(d) If the FDIC receives a complaint over which it does not have jurisdiction, it shall promptly notify the complainant and shall make reasonable efforts to refer the complainant to the appropriate government entity.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Formal complaints.</E> The individual must file a written formal complaint within 15 calendar days after receiving the notice of a right to file a formal complaint. Formal complaints must be filed with the FDIC Chairman or the OMWI Director. Within 120 days of the receipt of such a complaint for which it has jurisdiction, the FDIC shall notify the complainant of the results of the investigation in a letter containing—</P>
            <P>(1) A finding regarding the alleged violations;</P>
            <P>(2) A description of a remedy for each violation found; and</P>
            <P>(3) A notice of the right to appeal.</P>
            <P>(f) Appeals of the findings or remedies must be filed by the complainant within 30 days of receipt from the FDIC of the letter required by § 352.10 (e). The FDIC may extend this time for good cause.</P>
            <P>(g) Timely appeals shall be accepted and processed by the FDIC Chairman or OMWI Director.</P>
            <P>(h) The FDIC Chairman or ODEO Director shall notify the complainant of the results of the appeal within 60 days of the receipt of the request. If the FDIC Chairman or OMWI Director determines that additional information is needed from the complainant, he or she shall have 60 days from the date of receipt of the additional information to make a determination on the appeal.</P>

            <P>(i) The time limits set forth in (e) and (h) above may be extended for an individual case when the FDIC Chairman or OMWI Director determines that there is good cause, based on the particular circumstances of that case.<PRTPAGE P="120"/>
            </P>
            <P>(j) The FDIC may delegate its authority for conducting complaint investigations to other federal agencies or independent contractors, except that the authority for making the final determination may not be delegated.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Suspicious activity reports required.</E> A bank shall file a suspicious activity report with the appropriate federal law enforcement agencies and the Department of the Treasury, in accordance with the form's instructions, by sending a completed suspicious activity report to FinCEN in the following circumstances:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Insider abuse involving any amount.</E> Whenever the bank detects any known or suspected federal criminal violation, or pattern of criminal violations, committed or attempted against the bank or involving a transaction or transactions conducted through the bank, where the bank believes it was either an actual or potential victim of a criminal violation, or series of criminal violations, or that the bank was used to facilitate a criminal transaction, and the bank has a substantial basis for identifying one of the bank's directors, officers, employees, agents, or other institution-affiliated parties as having committed or aided in the commission of the criminal violation, regardless of the amount involved in the violation;</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Transactions aggregating $5,000 or more where a suspect can be identified.</E> Whenever the bank detects any known or suspected federal criminal violation, or pattern of criminal violations, committed or attempted against the bank or involving a transaction or transactions conducted through the bank, and involving or aggregating $5,000 or more in funds or other assets, where the bank believes it was either an actual or potential victim of a criminal violation, or series of criminal violations, or that the bank was used to facilitate a criminal transaction, and the bank has a substantial basis for identifying a possible suspect or group of suspects. If it is determined prior to filing this report that the identified suspect or group of suspects has used an “alias”, then information regarding the true identity of the suspect or group of suspects, as well as alias identifiers, such as driver's license or social <PRTPAGE P="121"/>security numbers, addresses and telephone numbers, must be reported;</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Transactions aggregating $25,000 or more regardless of potential suspects.</E> Whenever the bank detects any known or suspected federal criminal violation, or pattern of criminal violations, committed or attempted against the bank or involving a transaction or transactions conducted through the bank, involving or aggregating $25,000 or more in funds or other assets, where the bank believes it was either an actual or potential victim of a criminal violation, or series of criminal violations, or that the bank was used to facilitate a criminal transaction, even though the bank has no substantial basis for identifying a possible suspect or group of suspects; or</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Transactions aggregating $5,000 or more that involve potential money laundering or violations of the Bank Secrecy Act.</E> Any transaction (which for purposes of this paragraph (a)(4) means a deposit, withdrawal, transfer between accounts, exchange of currency, loan, extension of credit, purchase or sale of any stock, bond, certificate of deposit, or other monetary instrument or investment security, or any other payment, transfer, or delivery by, through, or to a financial institution, by whatever means effected) conducted or attempted by, at or through the bank and involving or aggregating $5,000 or more in funds or other assets, if the bank knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect that:</P>
            <P>(i) The transaction involves funds derived from illegal activities or is intended or conducted in order to hide or disguise funds or assets derived from illegal activities (including, without limitation, the ownership, nature, source, location, or control of such funds or assets) as part of a plan to violate or evade any federal law or regulation or to avoid any transaction reporting requirement under federal law;</P>
            <P>(ii) The transaction is designed to evade any regulations promulgated under the Bank Secrecy Act; or</P>
            <P>(iii) The transaction has no business or apparent lawful purpose or is not the sort of transaction in which the particular customer would normally be expected to engage, and the bank knows of no reasonable explanation for the transaction after examining the available facts, including the background and possible purpose of the transaction.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Time for reporting.</E> (1) A bank shall file the suspicious activity report no later than 30 calendar days after the date of initial detection of facts that may constitute a basis for filing a suspicious activity report. If no suspect was identified on the date of detection of the incident requiring the filing, a bank may delay filing a suspicious activity report for an additional 30 calendar days to identify a suspect. In no case shall reporting be delayed more than 60 calendar days after the date of initial detection of a reportable transaction.</P>
            <P>(2) In situations involving violations requiring immediate attention, such as when a reportable violation is ongoing, the bank shall immediately notify, by telephone, an appropriate law enforcement authority and the appropriate FDIC regional office (Division of Supervision and Consumer Protection (DSC)) in addition to filing a timely report.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Reports to state and local authorities.</E> A bank is encouraged to file a copy of the suspicious activity report with state and local law enforcement agencies where appropriate.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Exemptions.</E> (1) A bank need not file a suspicious activity report for a robbery or burglary committed or attempted, that is reported to appropriate law enforcement authorities.</P>
            <P>(2) A bank need not file a suspicious activity report for lost, missing, counterfeit, or stolen securities if it files a report pursuant to the reporting requirements of 17 CFR 240.17f-1.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Retention of records.</E> A bank shall maintain a copy of any suspicious activity report filed and the original or business record equivalent of any supporting documentation for a period of five years from the date of filing the suspicious activity report. Supporting documentation shall be identified and maintained by the bank as such, and shall be deemed to have been filed with the suspicious activity report. A bank must make all supporting documentation available to appropriate law enforcement authorities upon request.<PRTPAGE P="122"/>
            </P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Notification to board of directors.</E> The management of a bank shall promptly notify its board of directors, or a committee thereof, of any report filed pursuant to this section. The term “board of directors” includes the managing official of an insured state-licensed branch of a foreign bank for purposes of this part.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Confidentiality of suspicious activity reports.</E> Suspicious activity reports are confidential. Any bank subpoenaed or otherwise requested to disclose a suspicious activity report or the information contained in a suspicious activity report shall decline to produce the suspicious activity report or to provide any information that would disclose that a suspicious activity report has been prepared or filed citing this part, applicable law (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> 31 U.S.C. 5318(g)), or both, and notify the appropriate FDIC regional office (Division of Supervision and Consumer Protection (DSC)).</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Safe harbor.</E> The safe harbor provisions of 31 U.S.C. 5318(g), which exempts any bank that makes a disclosure of any possible violation of law or regulation from liability under any law or regulation of the United States, or any constitution, law or regulation of any state or political subdivision, cover all reports of suspected or known criminal violations and suspicious activities to law enforcement and financial institution supervisory authorities, including supporting documentation, regardless of whether such reports are filed pursuant to this part or are filed on a voluntary basis.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> Section 13(k)(5) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1823(k)(5)) provides that the FDIC shall consider proposals for financial assistance for eligible insured savings associations before grounds exist for appointment of a conservator or receiver for such member. One of the criteria for eligibility is that an institution's offices are located in an economically depressed region as determined by the FDIC.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Economically depressed regions.</E> (1) For the purpose of determining “economically depressed regions”, the FDIC will determine whether an institution qualifies as being located in an “economically depressed region” on a case-by-case basis. That determination will be based on four criteria:</P>
            <P>(i) High unemployment rates;</P>
            <P>(ii) Significant declines in non-farm employment;</P>
            <P>(iii) High delinquency rates of real estate assets at insured depository institutions; and</P>
            <P>(iv) Evidence indicating declining real estate values.</P>
            <P>(2) In addition, the FDIC will also consider relevant information from institutions regarding their geographic market area, as well as information on whether that market is “economically depressed”.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Scope.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) This part limits and/or prohibits, in certain circumstances, the ability of insured depository institutions, their subsidiaries and affiliated depository institution holding companies to enter into contracts to pay and to make golden parachute and indemnification <PRTPAGE P="123"/>payments to institution-affiliated parties (IAPs).</P>

            <P>(b) The limitations on golden parachute payments apply to troubled insured depository institutions which seek to enter into contracts to pay or to make golden parachute payments to their IAPs. The limitations also apply to depository institution holding companies which are troubled and seek to enter into contracts to pay or to make golden parachute payments to their IAPs as well as healthy holding companies which seek to enter into contracts to pay or to make golden parachute payments to IAPs of a troubled insured depository institution subsidiary. A “golden parachute payment” is generally considered to be any payment to an IAP which is contingent on the termination of that person's employment and is received when the insured depository institution making the payment is troubled or, if the payment is being made by an affiliated holding company, either the holding company itself or the insured depository institution employing the IAP, is troubled. The definition of golden parachute payment does not include payments pursuant to qualified retirement plans, nonqualified <E T="03">bona fide</E> deferred compensation plans, nondiscriminatory severance pay plans, other types of common benefit plans, state statutes and death benefits. Certain limited exceptions to the golden parachute payment prohibition are provided for in cases involving the hiring of a white knight and unassisted changes in control. A procedure is also set forth whereby an institution or IAP can request permission to make what would otherwise be a prohibited golden parachute payment.</P>
            <P>(c) The limitations on indemnification payments apply to all insured depository institutions, their subsidiaries and affiliated depository institution holding companies regardless of their financial health. Generally, this part prohibits insured depository institutions, their subsidiaries and affiliated holding companies from indemnifying an IAP for that portion of the costs sustained with regard to an administrative or civil enforcement action commenced by any federal banking agency which results in a final order or settlement pursuant to which the IAP is assessed a civil money penalty, removed from office, prohibited from participating in the affairs of an insured depository institution or required to cease and desist from or take an affirmative action described in section 8(b) (12 U.S.C. 1818(b)) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act). However, there are exceptions to this general prohibition. First, an institution or holding company may purchase commercial insurance to cover such expenses, except judgments and penalties. Second, the institution or holding company may advance legal and other professional expenses to an IAP directly (except for judgments and penalties) if its board of directors makes certain specific findings and the IAP agrees in writing to reimburse the institution if it is ultimately determined that the IAP violated a law, regulation or other fiduciary duty.</P>

            <P>(1) An IAP voluntarily elects to defer all or a portion of the reasonable compensation, wages or fees paid for services rendered which otherwise would have been paid to such party at the time the services were rendered (including a plan that provides for the <PRTPAGE P="124"/>crediting of a reasonable investment return on such elective deferrals) and the insured depository institution or depository institution holding company either:</P>

            <P>(ii) Segregates or otherwise sets aside assets in a trust which may only be used to pay plan and other benefits, except that the assets of such trust may be available to satisfy claims of the institution's or holding company's creditors in the case of insolvency; or</P>
            <P>(2) An insured depository institution or depository institution holding company establishes a nonqualified deferred compensation or supplemental retirement plan, other than an elective deferral plan described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section:</P>
            <P>(i) Primarily for the purpose of providing benefits for certain IAPs in excess of the limitations on contributions and benefits imposed by sections 415, 401(a)(17), 402(g) or any other applicable provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 415, 401(a)(17), 402(g)); or</P>

            <P>(a) An insured depository institution or depository institution holding company may agree to make or may make a golden parachute payment if and to the extent that:</P>
            <P>(1) The appropriate federal banking agency, with the written concurrence of the Corporation, determines that such a payment or agreement is permissible; or</P>
            <P>(2) Such an agreement is made in order to hire a person to become an IAP either at a time when the insured depository institution or depository institution holding company satisfies or in an effort to prevent it from imminently satisfying any of the criteria set forth in § 359.1(f)(1)(ii), and the institution's appropriate federal banking agency and the Corporation consent in writing to the amount and terms of the golden parachute payment. Such consent by the FDIC and the institution's appropriate federal banking agency shall not improve the IAP's position in the event of the insolvency of the institution since such consent can neither bind a receiver nor affect the provability of receivership claims. In the event that the institution is placed into receivership or conservatorship, the FDIC and/or the institution's appropriate federal banking agency shall not be obligated to pay the promised golden parachute and the IAP shall not be accorded preferential treatment on the basis of such prior approval; or</P>

            <P>(3) Such a payment is made pursuant to an agreement which provides for a reasonable severance payment, not to exceed twelve months salary, to an IAP <PRTPAGE P="128"/>in the event of a change in control of the insured depository institution; <E T="03">provided, however,</E> that an insured depository institution or depository institution holding company shall obtain the consent of the appropriate federal banking agency prior to making such a payment and this paragraph (a)(3) shall not apply to any change in control of an insured depository institution which results from an assisted transaction as described in section 13 of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1823) or the insured depository institution being placed into conservatorship or receivership; and</P>
            <P>(4) An insured depository institution, depository institution holding company or IAP making a request pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section shall demonstrate that it does not possess and is not aware of any information, evidence, documents or other materials which would indicate that there is a reasonable basis to believe, at the time such payment is proposed to be made, that:</P>
            <P>(i) The IAP has committed any fraudulent act or omission, breach of trust or fiduciary duty, or insider abuse with regard to the depository institution or depository institution holding company that has had or is likely to have a material adverse effect on the institution or holding company;</P>
            <P>(ii) The IAP is substantially responsible for the insolvency of, the appointment of a conservator or receiver for, or the troubled condition, as defined by applicable regulations of the appropriate federal banking agency, of the insured depository institution, depository institution holding company or any insured depository institution subsidiary of such holding company;</P>
            <P>(iii) The IAP has materially violated any applicable federal or state banking law or regulation that has had or is likely to have a material effect on the insured depository institution or depository institution holding company; and</P>
            <P>(iv) The IAP has violated or conspired to violate section 215, 656, 657, 1005, 1006, 1007, 1014, 1032, or 1344 of title 18 of the United States Code, or section 1341 or 1343 of such title affecting a federally insured financial institution as defined in title 18 of the United States Code.</P>
            <P>(b) In making a determination under paragraphs (a) (1) through (3) of this section, the appropriate federal banking agency and the Corporation may consider:</P>
            <P>(1) Whether, and to what degree, the IAP was in a position of managerial or fiduciary responsibility;</P>
            <P>(2) The length of time the IAP was affiliated with the insured depository institution or depository institution holding company, and the degree to which the proposed payment represents a reasonable payment for services rendered over the period of employment; and</P>
            <P>(3) Any other factors or circumstances which would indicate that the proposed payment would be contrary to the intent of section 18(k) of the Act or this part.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Permissible indemnification payments.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) An insured depository institution or depository institution holding company may make or agree to make reasonable indemnification payments to an IAP with respect to an administrative proceeding or civil action initiated by any federal banking agency if:</P>
            <P>(1) The insured depository institution's or depository institution holding company's board of directors, in good faith, determines in writing after due investigation and consideration that the institution-affiliated party acted in good faith and in a manner he/she believed to be in the best interests of the institution;</P>
            <P>(2) The insured depository institution's or depository institution holding company's board of directors, respectively, in good faith, determines in writing after due investigation and consideration that the payment of such expenses will not materially adversely affect the institution's or holding company's safety and soundness;</P>
            <P>(3) The indemnification payments do not constitute prohibited indemnification payments as that term is defined in § 359.1(l); and</P>

            <P>(4) The IAP agrees in writing to reimburse the insured depository institution or depository institution holding company, to the extent not covered by payments from insurance or bonds purchased pursuant to § 359.1(l)(2), for that <PRTPAGE P="129"/>portion of the advanced indemnification payments which subsequently become prohibited indemnification payments, as defined in § 359.1(l)</P>

            <P>(b) An IAP requesting indemnification payments shall not participate in any way in the board's discussion and approval of such payments; <E T="03">provided, however,</E> that such IAP may present his/her request to the board and respond to any inquiries from the board concerning his/her involvement in the circumstances giving rise to the administrative proceeding or civil action.</P>
            <P>(c) In the event that a majority of the members of the board of directors are named as respondents in an administrative proceeding or civil action and request indemnification, the remaining members of the board may authorize independent legal counsel to review the indemnification request and provide the remaining members of the board with a written opinion of counsel as to whether the conditions delineated in paragraph (a) of this section have been met. If independent legal counsel opines that said conditions have been met, the remaining members of the board of directors may rely on such opinion in authorizing the requested indemnification.</P>
            <P>(d) In the event that all of the members of the board of directors are named as respondents in an administrative proceeding or civil action and request indemnification, the board shall authorize independent legal counsel to review the indemnification request and provide the board with a written opinion of counsel as to whether the conditions delineated in paragraph (a) of this section have been met. If independent legal counsel opines that said conditions have been met, the board of directors may rely on such opinion in authorizing the requested indemnification.</P>

In the case of savings associations and savings association holding companies, such written requests shall be submitted to the OTS regional office where the institution or holding company, respectively, is located. In cases where only the prior consent of the institution's primary federal regulator is required and that agency is not the FDIC, a written request satisfying the requirements of this section shall be submitted to the primary federal regulator as described in this section.</P>

            <P>The provisions of this part, or any consent or approval granted under the provisions of this part by the FDIC (in its corporate capacity), shall not in any way bind any receiver of a failed insured depository institution. Any consent or approval granted under the provisions of this part by the FDIC or any other federal banking agency shall not in any way obligate such agency or receiver to pay any claim or obligation pursuant to any golden parachute, severance, indemnification or other agreement. Claims for employee welfare benefits or other benefits which are contingent, even if otherwise vested, when the FDIC is appointed as receiver for any depository institution, including any contingency for termination of employment, are not provable claims or actual, direct compensatory damage claims against such receiver. Nothing in this part may be construed to permit the payment of salary or any liability or legal expense of any IAP contrary to 12 U.S.C. 1828(k)(3).<PRTPAGE P="130"/>

            <SUBJECT>Federal Home Loan banks as secured creditors.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of federal or state law or any other provisions of these regulations, the receiver of a borrower from a Federal Home Loan Bank shall recognize the priority of any security interest granted to a Federal Home Loan Bank by any member of any Federal Home Loan Bank or any affiliate of any such member, whether such security interest is in specifically designated assets or a blanket interest in all assets or categories of assets, over the claims and rights of any other party (including any receiver, conservator, trustee or similar party having rights of a lien creditor) other than claims and rights that</P>
            <P>(1) Would be entitled to priority under otherwise applicable law; and</P>
            <P>(2) Are held by actual bona fide purchasers for value or by actual secured parties that are secured by actual perfected security interests.</P>
            <P>(b) If the receiver rather than the Bank shall have possession of any collateral consisting of notes, securities, other instruments, chattel paper or cash securing advances of the Bank, the receiver shall, upon request by the Bank, promptly deliver possession of such collateral to the Bank or its designee.</P>

            <P>(c) In the event that a receiver is appointed for any member of a Federal <PRTPAGE P="131"/>Home Loan Bank, the following procedures shall apply:</P>
            <P>(1) The receiver and the Bank shall immediately seek and develop a mutually agreeable plan for the payment of any advances made by the Bank to such borrower or for the servicing, foreclosure upon and liquidation of the collateral securing any such advances, taking into account the nature and amount of such collateral, the markets in which such collateral is normally traded or sold and other relevant factors.</P>
            <P>(2) In the event that the receiver and the Bank shall not, in good faith, be able to develop such a mutually agreeable plan, or, in the interim, the Bank in good faith reasonably concludes that the value of such collateral is decreasing, because of interest rate or other market changes, at such a rate that to delay liquidation or other exercise of the Bank's rights as a secured party for the development of a mutually agreeable plan could reasonably cause the value of such collateral to decrease to an amount that is insufficient to satisfy the Bank's claim in full, the Bank may, at any time thereafter if permitted to do so by the terms of the advances or other security agreement with such borrower or otherwise by applicable law, proceed to foreclose upon, sell, lease or otherwise dispose of such collateral (or any portion thereof), or otherwise exercise its rights as a secured party, provided that the Bank acts in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner and otherwise in accordance with applicable law.</P>
            <P>(3) The foregoing provisions of this paragraph (c) shall not apply in the event that a purchase and assumption transaction is entered into regarding any such member.</P>
            <P>(d) The Bank's rights pursuant to the second sentence of section 10(d) of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act shall not be affected or diminished by any provisions of state law that may be applicable to a security interest in property of the member.</P>
            <P>(e) The receiver for a borrower from a Federal Home Loan Bank shall allow a claim for a prepayment fee by the Bank if, and only if:</P>
            <P>(1) The claim is made pursuant to a written contract that provides for a prepayment fee, provided, however, that such prepayment fee allowed by the receiver shall not exceed the present value of the loss attributable to the difference between the contract rate of the secured borrowing and the reinvestment rate then available to the Bank; and</P>
            <P>(2) The indebtedness owed to the Bank by such borrower is secured by sufficient collateral in which a perfected security interest in favor of the Bank exists or as to which the Bank's security interest is entitled to priority under section 306(d) of the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987 (CEBA) (12 U.S.C. 1430(e), footnote (1), or otherwise so that the aggregate of the outstanding principal on the advances secured by such collateral, the accrued but unpaid interest thereon and the prepayment fee applicable to such advances can be paid in full from the amounts realized from such collateral. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(2), the adequacy of such collateral shall be determined as of the date such prepayment fees shall be due and payable under the terms of the written contract providing therefor.</P>

            <P>(5) Claims of governmental units for unpaid taxes, other than Federal income taxes, except to the extent subordinated pursuant to applicable law; but no other claim of a governmental unit shall have a priority higher than that of a general creditor under paragraph (a)(6) of this section;</P>

            <P>(7) Claims other than those that have accrued and become unconditionally fixed on or before the date of default, including claims for interest after the date of default on claims under paragraph (a)(6) of this section, <E T="03">Provided</E> that any claim based on an agreement for accelerated, stipulated, or liquidated damages, which claim did not accrue prior to the date of default, shall be considered as not having accrued and become unconditionally fixed on or before the date of default;</P>

            <P>(9) Claims that have been subordinated in whole or in part to general creditor claims, which shall be given the priority specified in the written instruments that evidence such claims; and</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Authority and purpose.</E> Sections 11(e) (8) through (10) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1821(e) (8) through (10), provide special rules for the treatment of qualified financial contracts of an insured depository institution for which the FDIC is appointed conservator or receiver, including rules describing the manner in which qualified financial contracts may be transferred or closed out. Section 11(e)(8)(D)(i) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1821(e)(8)(D)(i), grants the Corporation authority to determine by regulation whether any agreement, other than those identified within section 11(e)(8)(D), should be recognized as qualified financial contracts under the statute. The purpose of this section is to identify additional agreements which the Corporation has determined to be qualified financial contracts.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Repurchase agreements.</E> The following agreements shall be deemed “repurchase agreements” under section 11(e)(8)(D)(v) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (12 U.S.C. 1821(e)(8)(D)(v)): A repurchase agreement on qualified foreign government securities is an agreement or combination of agreements (including master agreements) which provides for the transfer of securities that are direct obligations of, or that are fully guaranteed by, the central governments (as set forth at 12 CFR 324.2 (definition of sovereign exposure), as may be amended from time to time) of the OECD-based group of countries (as generally discussed in 12 CFR 324.32) against the transfer of funds by the transferee of such securities with a simultaneous agreement by such transferee to transfer to the transferor thereof securities as described above, at a date certain not later than one year after such transfers or on demand, against the transfer of funds.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Swap agreements.</E> The following agreements shall be deemed “swap agreements” under section 11(e)(8)(D)(vi) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (12 U.S.C. 1821(e)(8)(D)(vi)): A spot foreign exchange agreement is any agreement providing for or effecting the purchase or sale of one currency in exchange for another currency (or a unit of account established by an intergovernmental organization such as the European Currency Unit) with a maturity date of two days or less after the agreement has been entered into, and includes short-dated transactions such as tomorrow/next day and same day/tomorrow transactions.</P>

            <P>(2) <E T="03">Financial asset</E> means cash or a contract or instrument that conveys to one entity a contractual right to receive cash or another financial instrument from another entity.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Investor</E> means a person or entity that owns an obligation issued by an issuing entity.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Issuing entity</E> means an entity that owns a financial asset or financial assets transferred by the sponsor and issues obligations supported by such asset or assets. Issuing entities may include, but are not limited to, corporations, partnerships, trusts, and limited liability companies and are commonly referred to as special purpose vehicles or special purpose entities. To the extent a securitization is structured as a multi-step transfer, the term issuing entity would include both the issuer of the obligations and any intermediate entities that may be a transferee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Specified GSE or an entity established or guaranteed by a Specified GSE shall not constitute an issuing entity.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Monetary default</E> means a default in the payment of principal or interest when due following the expiration of any cure period.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Obligation</E> means a debt or equity (or mixed) beneficial interest or security that is primarily serviced by the cash flows of one or more financial assets or financial asset pools, either fixed or revolving, that by their terms convert into cash within a finite time period, or upon the disposition of the underlying financial assets, and by any rights or other assets designed to assure the servicing or timely distributions of proceeds to the security holders issued by an issuing entity. The term may include beneficial interests in a grantor trust, common law trust or similar issuing entity to the extent that such interests satisfy the criteria set forth in the preceding sentence, but does not include LLC interests, partnership interests, common or preferred equity, or similar instruments evidencing ownership of the issuing entity.</P>

            <P>(8) <E T="03">Securitization</E> means the issuance by an issuing entity of obligations for which the investors are relying on the cash flow or market value characteristics and the credit quality of transferred financial assets (together with any external credit support permitted by this section) to repay the obligations.</P>

The term “servicer” does not include a trustee for the issuing entity or the holders of obligations that makes allocations or distributions to holders of the obligations if the trustee receives such allocations or distributions from <PRTPAGE P="135"/>a servicer and the trustee does not otherwise perform the functions of a servicer.</P>

            <P>(iv) Any federal or state sponsored mortgage finance agency.</P>
            <P>(11) <E T="03">Sponsor</E> means a person or entity that organizes and initiates a securitization by transferring financial assets, either directly or indirectly, including through an affiliate, to an issuing entity, whether or not such person owns an interest in the issuing entity or owns any of the obligations issued by the issuing entity.</P>
            <P>(12) <E T="03">Transfer</E> means:</P>

            <P>(B) The documents creating the securitization shall require that payment of principal and interest on the securitization obligation must be primarily based on the performance of financial assets that are transferred to the issuing entity and, except for interest rate or currency mismatches between the financial assets and the obligations, shall not be contingent on market or credit events that are independent of such financial assets. The securitization may not be an unfunded securitization or a synthetic transaction.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Requirements applicable only to securitizations in which the financial assets include any residential mortgage loans:</E>

            <P>(A) The capital structure of the securitization shall be limited to no more than six credit tranches and cannot include “sub-tranches,” grantor trusts or other structures. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the most senior credit tranche may include time-based sequential pay or planned amortization and companion sub-tranches; and</P>
            <P>(B) The credit quality of the obligations cannot be enhanced at the issuing entity or pool level through external credit support or guarantees. However, the credit quality of the obligations may be enhanced by credit support or guarantees provided by Specified GSEs and the temporary payment of principal and/or interest may be supported by liquidity facilities, including facilities designed to permit the temporary payment of interest following appointment of the FDIC as conservator or receiver. Individual financial assets transferred into a securitization may be guaranteed, insured or otherwise benefit from credit support at the loan level through mortgage and similar insurance or guarantees, including by private companies, agencies or other governmental entities, or government-sponsored enterprises, and/or through co-signers or other guarantees.</P>

The documents shall require that such information and its disclosure, at a minimum, shall comply with the requirements of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation AB, 17 CFR 229.1100 through 1123 (to the extent then in effect) or any successor disclosure requirements for public issuances, even if the obligations are issued in a private placement or are not otherwise required to be registered.

            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Requirements applicable only to securitizations in which the financial assets include any residential mortgage loans:</E>
            </P>
            <P>(A) Prior to issuance of obligations, sponsors shall disclose loan level information about the financial assets including, but not limited to, loan type, loan structure (for example, fixed or adjustable, resets, interest rate caps, balloon payments, etc.), maturity, interest rate and/or Annual Percentage Rate, and location of property; and</P>

            </P>

            <P>(A) Servicing and other agreements must provide servicers with authority, subject to contractual oversight by any master servicer or oversight advisor, if any, to mitigate losses on financial assets consistent with maximizing the net present value of the financial asset. Servicers shall have the authority to modify assets to address reasonably foreseeable default, and to take other action to maximize the value and minimize losses on the securitized financial assets. The documents shall require that the servicers apply industry best practices for asset management and servicing. The documents shall require the servicer to act for the benefit of all investors, and not for the benefit of any particular class of investors, that the servicer maintain records of its actions to permit full review by the trustee or other representative of the investors and that the servicer must commence action to mitigate losses no later than ninety (90) days after an asset first becomes delinquent unless all delinquencies have been cured, <E T="03">provided</E> that this requirement shall not be deemed to require that the documents include any provision concerning loss mitigation that requires any action that may conflict with the requirements of Regulation X (12 CFR part 1024), as Regulation X may be amended or modified from time to time.</P>
            <P>(B) The servicing agreement shall not require a primary servicer to advance delinquent payments of principal and interest for more than three payment periods, unless financing or reimbursement facilities are available, which may include, but are not limited to, the obligations of the master servicer or issuing entity to fund or reimburse the primary servicer, or alternative reimbursement facilities. Such “financing or reimbursement facilities” under this paragraph shall not be dependent for repayment on foreclosure proceeds.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Compensation.</E> The following requirements apply only to securitizations in which the financial assets include any residential mortgage loans. Compensation to parties involved in the securitization of such financial assets must be structured to provide incentives for sustainable credit and the long-term performance of the financial assets and securitization as follows:</P>
            <P>(i) The documents shall require that any fees or other compensation for services payable to credit rating agencies or similar third-party evaluation companies shall be payable, in part, over the five (5) year period after the first issuance of the obligations based on the performance of surveillance services and the performance of the financial assets, with no more than sixty (60) percent of the total estimated compensation due at closing; and</P>

            <P>(ii) The documents shall provide that compensation to servicers shall include incentives for servicing, including payment for loan restructuring or other <PRTPAGE P="138"/>loss mitigation activities, which maximizes the net present value of the financial assets. Such incentives may include payments for specific services, and actual expenses, to maximize the net present value or a structure of incentive fees to maximize the net present value, or any combination of the foregoing that provides such incentives.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Origination and retention requirements</E>—(i) <E T="03">Requirements applicable to all securitizations.</E> (A) Prior to the applicable compliance date for regulations required under Section 15G of the Securities Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78a <E T="03">et seq.,</E> added by Section 941(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the documents creating the securitization shall require that the sponsor retain an economic interest in a material portion, defined as not less than five (5) percent, of the credit risk of the financial assets. This retained interest may be either in the form of an interest of not less than five (5) percent in each of the credit tranches sold or transferred to the investors or in a representative sample of the securitized financial assets equal to not less than five (5) percent of the principal amount of the financial assets at transfer. This retained interest may not be sold, pledged or hedged, except for the hedging of interest rate or currency risk, during the term of the securitization.</P>

            <P>(B) For any securitization that closes upon or following the applicable compliance date for regulations required under Section 15G of the Securities Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78a <E T="03">et seq.,</E> added by Section 941(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the documents creating the securitization shall instead require retention of an economic interest in the credit risk of the financial assets in accordance with such regulations, including the restrictions on sale, pledging and hedging set forth therein.</P>

            <P>(C) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(5)(i)(A) of this section, for any securitization that closes following ________ November 24, 2015 and prior to the applicable compliance date for regulations required under Section 15G of the Securities Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78a <E T="03">et seq.,</E> added by Section 941(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, at the option of the sponsor, the requirements of paragraph (b)(5)(i)(B) of this section may be satisfied if (in lieu of the requirement set forth in paragraph (b)(5)(i)(A) of this section) the documents creating the securitization require retention of an economic interest in the credit risk of the financial assets in accordance with the requirements of the Section 15G regulations as though such regulations were then in effect.</P>

            </P>
            <P>(A) The documents shall require the establishment of a reserve fund equal to at least five (5) percent of the cash proceeds of the securitization payable to the sponsor to cover the repurchase of any financial assets required for breach of representations and warranties. The balance of such fund, if any, shall be released to the sponsor one year after the date of issuance.</P>

            <P>(B) The documents shall include a representation that the assets shall have been originated in all material respects in compliance with statutory, regulatory, and originator underwriting standards in effect at the time of origination. The documents shall include a representation that the mortgages included in the securitization were underwritten at the fully indexed rate, based upon the borrowers' ability to repay the mortgage according to its terms, and rely on documented income and comply with all existing supervisory guidance governing the underwriting of residential mortgages, including the Interagency Guidance on Non-Traditional Mortgage Products, October 5, 2006, and the Interagency Statement on Subprime Mortgage Lending, July 10, 2007, and such other or additional regulations or guidance applicable to insured depository institutions at the time of loan origination.

            <P>(c) <E T="03">Other requirements.</E> (1) The transaction should be an arms length, bona fide securitization transaction. The documents shall require that the obligations issued in a securitization shall not be predominantly sold to an affiliate (other than a wholly-owned subsidiary consolidated for accounting and capital purposes with the sponsor) or insider of the sponsor;</P>
            <P>(2) The securitization agreements are in writing, approved by the board of directors of the bank or its loan committee (as reflected in the minutes of a meeting of the board of directors or committee), and have been, continuously, from the time of execution in the official record of the bank;</P>
            <P>(3) The securitization was entered into in the ordinary course of business, not in contemplation of insolvency and with no intent to hinder, delay or defraud the bank or its creditors;</P>
            <P>(4) The transfer was made for adequate consideration;</P>
            <P>(5) The transfer and/or security interest was properly perfected under the UCC or applicable state law;</P>
            <P>(6) The transfer and duties of the sponsor as transferor must be evidenced in a separate agreement from its duties, if any, as servicer, custodian, paying agent, credit support provider or in any capacity other than the transferor; and</P>
            <P>(7) The documents shall require that the sponsor separately identify in its financial asset data bases the financial assets transferred into any securitization and maintain an electronic or paper copy of the closing documents for each securitization in a readily accessible form, a current list of all of its outstanding securitizations and issuing entities, and the most recent Form 10-K, if applicable, or other periodic financial report for each securitization and issuing entity. The documents shall provide that to the extent serving as servicer, custodian or paying agent for the securitization, the sponsor shall not comingle amounts received with respect to the financial assets with its own assets except for the time, not to exceed two business days, necessary to clear any payments received. The documents shall require that the sponsor shall make these records readily available for review by the FDIC promptly upon written request.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Safe harbor</E>—(1) <E T="03">Participations.</E> With respect to transfers of financial assets made in connection with participations, the FDIC as conservator or receiver shall not, in the exercise of its statutory authority to disaffirm or repudiate contracts, reclaim, recover, or recharacterize as property of the institution or the receivership any such transferred financial assets, provided that such transfer satisfies the conditions for sale accounting treatment under generally accepted accounting principles, except for the “legal isolation” condition that is addressed by this section. The foregoing paragraph shall apply to a last-in, first-out participation, provided that the transfer of a portion of the financial asset satisfies the conditions for sale accounting treatment under generally accepted accounting principles that would have applied to such portion if it had met the definition of a “participating interest,” except for the “legal isolation” condition that is addressed by this section.</P>

            <P>(iii) Any obligations issued under open commitments up to the maximum amount of such commitments as of the date of adoption of this rule if one or more obligations were issued under such commitments on or before December 31, 2010, the FDIC as conservator or receiver shall not, in the exercise of its statutory authority to disaffirm or repudiate contracts, reclaim, recover, or recharacterize as property of the institution or the receivership the transferred financial assets notwithstanding that the transfer of such financial assets does not satisfy all conditions for sale accounting treatment under generally accepted accounting principles as effective for reporting periods after November 15, 2009, provided that such transfer satisfied the conditions for <PRTPAGE P="140"/>sale accounting treatment under generally accepted accounting principles in effect for reporting periods before November 15, 2009, except for the “legal isolation” condition that is addressed by this paragraph and the transaction otherwise satisfied the provisions of § 360.6 in effect prior to the effective date of this regulation.</P>

            <P>(4) <E T="03">For securitization not meeting sale accounting requirements.</E> With respect to any securitization for which transfers of financial assets were made after December 31, 2010, or from a master trust or revolving trust established after adoption of this rule or from any open commitments that do not meet the requirements of paragraph (d)(2) or (d)(3) of this section, and which complies with the requirements applicable to that securitization as set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, but where the transfer does not satisfy the conditions for sale accounting treatment set forth by generally accepted accounting principles in effect for reporting periods after November 15, 2009:</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Monetary default.</E> If at any time after appointment, the FDIC as conservator or receiver is in a monetary default under a securitization due to its failure to pay or apply collections from the financial assets received by it in accordance with the securitization documents, whether as servicer or otherwise, and remains in monetary default for ten (10) business days after actual delivery of a written notice to the FDIC pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section requesting the exercise of contractual rights because of such monetary default, the FDIC hereby consents pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1821(e)(13)(C) and 12 U.S.C. 1825(b)(2) to the exercise of any contractual rights in accordance with the documents governing such securitization, including but not limited to taking possession of the financial assets and exercising self-help remedies as a secured creditor under the transfer agreements, provided no involvement of the receiver or conservator is required other than such consents, waivers, or execution of transfer documents as may be reasonably requested in the ordinary course of business in order to facilitate the exercise of such contractual rights. Such consent shall not waive or otherwise deprive the FDIC or its assignees of any seller's interest or other obligation or interest issued by the issuing entity and held by the FDIC or its assignees, but shall serve as full satisfaction of the obligations of the insured depository institution in conservatorship or receivership and the FDIC as conservator or receiver for all amounts due.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Repudiation.</E> If the FDIC as conservator or receiver provides a written notice of repudiation of the securitization agreement pursuant to which the financial assets were transferred, and the FDIC does not pay damages, defined in this paragraph, within ten (10) business days following the effective date of the notice, the FDIC hereby consents pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1821(e)(13)(C) and 12 U.S.C. 1825(b)(2) to the exercise of any contractual rights in accordance with the documents governing such securitization, including but not limited to taking possession of the financial assets and exercising self-help remedies as a secured creditor under the transfer agreements, provided no involvement of the receiver or conservator is required other than such consents, waivers, or execution of transfer documents as may be reasonably requested in the ordinary course <PRTPAGE P="141"/>of business in order to facilitate the exercise of such contractual rights. For purposes of this paragraph, the damages due shall be in an amount equal to the par value of the obligations outstanding on the date of appointment of the conservator or receiver, less any payments of principal received by the investors through the date of repudiation, plus unpaid, accrued interest through the date of repudiation in accordance with the contract documents to the extent actually received through payments on the financial assets received through the date of repudiation. Upon payment of such repudiation damages, all liens or claims on the financial assets created pursuant to the securitization documents shall be released. Such consent shall not waive or otherwise deprive the FDIC or its assignees of any seller's interest or other obligation or interest issued by the issuing entity and held by the FDIC or its assignees, but shall serve as full satisfaction of the obligations of the insured depository institution in conservatorship or receivership and the FDIC as conservator or receiver for all amounts due.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Effect of repudiation.</E> If the FDIC repudiates or disaffirms a securitization agreement, it shall not assert that any interest payments made to investors in accordance with the securitization documents before any such repudiation or disaffirmance remain the property of the conservatorship or receivership.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Consent to certain actions.</E> Prior to repudiation or, in the case of a monetary default referred to in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, prior to the effectiveness of the consent referred to therein, the FDIC as conservator or receiver consents pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1821(e)(13)(C) to the making of, or if serving as servicer, shall make, the payments to the investors to the extent actually received through payments on the financial assets (but in the case of repudiation, only to the extent supported by payments on the financial assets received through the date of the giving of notice of repudiation) in accordance with the securitization documents, and, subject to the FDIC's rights to repudiate such agreements, consents to any servicing activity required in furtherance of the securitization or, if acting as servicer the FDIC as receiver or conservator shall perform such servicing activities in accordance with the terms of the applicable servicing agreements, with respect to the financial assets included in securitizations that meet the requirements applicable to that securitization as set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Notice for consent.</E> Any party requesting the FDIC's consent as conservator or receiver under 12 U.S.C. 1821(e)(13)(C) and 12 U.S.C. 1825(b)(2) pursuant to paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section shall provide notice to the Deputy Director, Division of Resolutions and Receiverships, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 550 17th Street, NW., F-7076, Washington, DC 20429-0002, and a statement of the basis upon which such request is made, and copies of all documentation supporting such request, including without limitation a copy of the applicable agreements and of any applicable notices under the contract.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Contemporaneous requirement.</E> The FDIC will not seek to avoid an otherwise legally enforceable agreement that is executed by an insured depository institution in connection with a securitization or in the form of a participation solely because the agreement does not meet the “contemporaneous” requirement of 12 U.S.C. 1821(d)(9), 1821(n)(4)(I), or 1823(e).</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Limitations.</E> The consents set forth in this section do not act to waive or relinquish any rights granted to the FDIC in any capacity, pursuant to any other applicable law or any agreement or contract except as specifically set forth herein. Nothing contained in this section alters the claims priority of the securitized obligations.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">No waiver.</E> Except as specifically set forth herein, this section does not authorize, and shall not be construed as authorizing the waiver of the prohibitions in 12 U.S.C. 1825(b)(2) against levy, attachment, garnishment, foreclosure, or sale of property of the FDIC, nor does it authorize nor shall it be construed as authorizing the attachment of any involuntary lien upon the property of the FDIC. Nor shall this <PRTPAGE P="142"/>section be construed as waiving, limiting or otherwise affecting the rights or powers of the FDIC to take any action or to exercise any power not specifically mentioned, including but not limited to any rights, powers or remedies of the FDIC regarding transfers or other conveyances taken in contemplation of the institution's insolvency or with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud the institution or the creditors of such institution, or that is a fraudulent transfer under applicable law.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Method for determining deposit and other liability account balances at a failed insured depository institution.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The purpose of this section is to describe the process the FDIC will use to determine deposit and other liability account balances for insurance coverage and receivership purposes at a failed insured depository institution.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> (1) The <E T="03">FDIC Cutoff Point</E> means the point in time the FDIC establishes after it has been appointed receiver of a failed insured depository <PRTPAGE P="143"/>institution and takes control of the failed institution.</P>
            <P>(2) The <E T="03">Applicable Cutoff Time</E> for a specific type of deposit account transaction means the <E T="03">earlier</E> of either the failed institution's normal cutoff time for that specific type of transaction or the <E T="03">FDIC Cutoff Point.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Close-of-Business Account Balance</E> means the closing end-of-day ledger balance of a deposit or other liability account on the day of failure of an insured depository institution determined by using the <E T="03">Applicable Cutoff Times.</E> This balance may be adjusted to reflect steps taken by the receiver to ensure that funds are not received by or removed from the institution after the <E T="03">FDIC Cutoff Point.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(4) A <E T="03">sweep account</E> is an account held pursuant to a contract between an insured depository institution and its customer involving the pre-arranged, automated transfer of funds from a deposit account to either another account or investment vehicle located within the depository institution (<E T="03">internal sweep account</E>), or an investment vehicle located outside the depository institution (<E T="03">external sweep account</E>).</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Principles.</E> (1) In making deposit insurance determinations and in determining the value and nature of claims against the receivership on the institution's date of failure, the FDIC, as insurer and receiver, will treat deposits and other liabilities of the failed institution according to the ownership and nature of the underlying obligations based on end-of-day ledger balances for each account using, except as expressly provided otherwise in this section, the depository institution's normal posting procedures.</P>
            <P>(2) In its role as receiver of a failed insured depository institution, in order to ensure the proper distribution of the failed institution's assets under the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1821(d)(11)) as of the FDIC Cutoff Point, the FDIC will use its best efforts to take all steps necessary to stop the generation, via transactions or transfers coming from or going outside the institution, of new liabilities or extinguishing existing liabilities for the depository institution.</P>
            <P>(3) End-of-day ledger balances are subject to corrections for posted transactions that are inconsistent with the above principles.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Determining closing day balances.</E> (1) In determining account balances for insurance coverage and receivership purposes at a failed insured depository institution, the FDIC will use <E T="03">Close-of-Business Account Balances.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(2) A check posted to the <E T="03">Close-of-Business Account Balance</E> but not collected by the depository institution will be included as part of the balance, subject to the correction of errors and omissions and adjustments for uncollectible items that the FDIC may make in its role as receiver of the failed depository institution.</P>
            <P>(3) In determining <E T="03">Close-of-Business Account Balances</E> involving sweep accounts:</P>
            <P>(i) For internal sweep accounts, the FDIC will determine the ownership of the funds and the nature of the receivership claim based on the records established and maintained by the institution for that specific account or investment vehicle as of the closing day end-of-day ledger balance. (For example, if a sweep account entails the daily transfer of funds from a demand deposit account to a Eurodollar account at a foreign branch of the insured depository institution, if the institution should fail on that day, the FDIC would treat the funds swept to the Eurodollar account, as reflected on the institution's end-of-day records, as an unsecured general creditor's claim against the receivership.);</P>
            <P>(ii) For external sweep accounts, the FDIC will treat swept funds consistent with their status in the end-of-day ledger balances of the depository institution and the external entity, as long as the transfer of funds is completed prior to the Applicable Cutoff Time. (For example, if funds held in connection with a money market sweep account are wired from a customer's deposit account at the insured depository institution to the mutual fund prior to the Applicable Cutoff Time, if the institution should fail on that day, the FDIC would recognize that sweep transaction as completed for claims and receivership purposes.);</P>

            <P>(iii) For repurchase agreement sweep accounts, where, as a result of the <PRTPAGE P="144"/>sweep transaction, the customer becomes either the legal owner of identified assets subject to repurchase or obtains a perfected security interest in those assets, the FDIC will recognize, for receivership purposes, the customer's ownership interest or security interest in the assets.</P>

            <P>(4) For deposit insurance and receivership purposes in connection with the failure of an insured depository institution, the FDIC will determine the rights of the depositor or other liability holder as of the point the <E T="03">Close-of-Business Account Balance</E> is calculated.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Disclosure requirements.</E> Beginning July 1, 2009, in all new sweep account contracts, in renewals of existing sweep account contracts and within sixty days after July 1, 2009, and no less than annually thereafter, institutions must prominently disclose in writing to sweep account customers whether their swept funds are deposits within the meaning of 12 U.S.C. 1813(l). If the funds are not deposits, the institution must further disclose the status such funds would have if the institution failed—for example, general creditor status or secured creditor status. Such disclosures must be consistent with how the institution reports such funds on its quarterly Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income or Thrift Financial Reports. The disclosure requirements imposed under this provision do not apply to sweep accounts where: The transfers are within a single account, or a sub-account; or the sweep account involves only deposit-to-deposit sweeps, such as zero-balance accounts, unless the sweep results in a change in the customer's insurance coverage.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Large-bank deposit insurance determination modernization.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose and scope.</E> This section is intended to allow the deposit and other operations of a large insured depository institution (defined as a “Covered Institution”) to continue functioning on the day following failure. It also is intended to permit the FDIC to fulfill its legal mandates regarding the resolution of failed insured institutions to provide liquidity to depositors promptly, enhance market discipline, ensure equitable treatment of depositors at different institutions and reduce the FDIC's costs by preserving the franchise value of a failed institution.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> (1) A <E T="03">covered Institution</E> means an insured depository institution which, based on items as defined in Reports of Income and Condition or Thrift Financial Reports filed with the applicable federal regulator, has at least $2 billion in deposits and at least either:</P>
            <P>(i) 250,000 deposit accounts; or</P>
            <P>(ii) $20 billion in total assets, regardless of the number of deposit accounts.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Deposits, number of deposit accounts and total assets</E> are as defined in the instructions for the filing of Reports of Income and Condition and Thrift Financial Reports, as applicable to the insured depository institution for determining whether it qualifies as a covered institution. A foreign deposit means an uninsured deposit liability maintained in a foreign branch of an insured depository institution. An <E T="03">international banking facility deposit</E> is as defined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in Regulation D (12 CFR § 204.8(a)(2)). A <E T="03">demand deposit account, NOW account, money market deposit account, savings deposit account and time deposit account</E> are as defined in the instructions for the filing of Reports of Income and Condition and Thrift Financial Reports.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Sweep account arrangements</E> consist of a deposit account linked to an interest-bearing investment vehicle whereby funds are swept to and from the deposit account according to prearranged rules, usually on a daily basis, where the sweep investment vehicle is not a deposit and is reflected on the books and records of the <E T="03">Covered Institution.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Automated credit account arrangements</E> consist of a deposit account into which funds are automatically credited from an interest-bearing investment vehicle where the funds in the interest-bearing investment vehicle were not invested by prearranged rules.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Non-covered institution</E> means an insured depository institution that does not meet the definition of a covered institution.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Provisional hold</E> means an effective restriction on access to some or all of <PRTPAGE P="145"/>a deposit or other liability account after the failure of an insured depository institution.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Posting and removing provisional holds.</E> (1) A covered institution shall have in place an automated process for implementing a provisional hold on deposit accounts, foreign deposit accounts and sweep and automated credit account arrangements immediately following the determination of the close-of-business account balances, as defined in § 360.8(b)(3), at the failed covered institution.</P>
            <P>(2) The system requirements under paragraph (c)(1) must have the capability of placing the provisional holds prescribed under that provision no later than 9 a.m. local time the day following the FDIC cutoff point, as defined in § 360.8(b)(1).</P>
            <P>(3) Pursuant to instructions to be provided by the FDIC, a covered institution must notify the FDIC of the person(s) responsible for producing the standard data download and administering provisional holds, both while the functionality is being constructed and on an on-going basis.</P>
            <P>(4) For deposit accounts held in domestic offices of an insured depository institution, the provisional hold algorithm must be designed to exempt accounts below a specific account balance threshold, as determined by the FDIC. The account balance threshold could be any amount, including zero. For accounts above the account balance threshold determined by the FDIC, the algorithm must be designed to calculate and place a hold equal to the dollar amount of funds in excess of the account balance threshold multiplied by the provisional hold percentage determined by the FDIC. The provisional hold percentage could be any amount, from zero to one hundred percent. The account balance threshold as well as the provisional hold percentage could vary for the following four categories, as the covered institution customarily defines consumer accounts:</P>
            <P>(i) Consumer demand deposit, NOW and money market deposit accounts;</P>
            <P>(ii) Other consumer deposit accounts (time deposit and savings accounts, excluding NOW and money market deposit accounts);</P>
            <P>(iii) Non-consumer demand deposit, NOW and money market deposit accounts; and</P>
            <P>(iv) Other non-consumer deposit accounts (time deposit and savings accounts, excluding NOW and money market deposit accounts).</P>

            <P>(5) For deposit accounts held in foreign offices of an insured depository institution, other than those connected to a sweep or automated credit arrangement, the provisional hold algorithm will apply a provisional hold percentage to the entire account balance. For deposit accounts held in foreign offices the provisional hold percentage may differ from that applied to deposit accounts. Also, the provisional hold percentage would not vary by account category (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, consumer versus non-consumer and transaction versus non-transaction) as is the case with deposit accounts.</P>

            <P>(6) For international banking facility deposits, other than those connected to a sweep or automated credit arrangements, the provisional hold algorithm will apply a provisional hold percentage to the entire account balance. For IBF deposits the provisional hold percentage may differ from that applied to deposit or foreign deposit accounts. Also, the provisional hold percentage would not vary by account category (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, consumer versus non-consumer, and transaction versus non-transaction) as is the case with deposit accounts.</P>
            <P>(7) For the interest-bearing investment vehicle of a sweep arrangement, the provisional hold algorithm must be designed with the capability to place a provisional hold on the interest-bearing investment vehicle with possibly a different account balance threshold and a different hold percentage according to the type of interest-bearing investment vehicle.</P>

            <P>(8) For the interest-bearing investment vehicle of an automated credit account arrangement, the provisional hold algorithm must be designed with the capability to place a provisional hold on the interest-bearing investment vehicle with possibly a different account balance threshold and a different hold percentage according to the type of interest-bearing investment vehicle.<PRTPAGE P="146"/>
            </P>
            <P>(9) A covered institution may submit a request to the FDIC, using the address indicated in § 360.9(g): to develop a provisional hold process involving memo holds or alternative account mechanisms; or to exempt from the provisional hold requirements of this section those account systems servicing a relatively small number of accounts where the manual application of provisional holds is feasible. Such requests may be in the form of a letter and must include a justification for the request and address the relative effectiveness of the alternative for posting provisional holds in the event of failure. The FDIC will consider such requests on a case-by-case basis in light of the objectives of this section.</P>
            <P>(10) The automated process for provisional holds required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section must include the capability of removing provisional holds in batch mode and, during the same processing cycle, applying debits, credits or additional holds on the deposit or other accounts from which the provisional holds were removed, as determined by the FDIC. The FDIC will provide files listing the accounts subject to: removal of provisional holds or additional holds (file format as specified in appendix A); application of debits or credits (file format as specified in appendix B); and application of additional holds (file format as specified in appendix A). In addition to the batch process used to remove provisional holds, the Covered Institution is required to have in place a mechanism for manual removal of provisional holds on a case-by-case basis.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Providing a standard data format for generating deposit account and customer data.</E> (1) A covered institution must have in place practices and procedures for providing the FDIC in a standard format upon the close of any day's business with required depositor and customer data for all deposit accounts held in domestic and foreign offices and interest-bearing investment accounts connected with sweep and automated credit arrangements. Such standard data files are to be created through a mapping of pre-existing data elements and internal institution codes into standard data formats. Deposit account and customer data provided must be current as of the close of business for that day.</P>
            <P>(2) The requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall be provided in five separate files, as indicated in the appendices C through G to this part 360.</P>
            <P>(3) Upon request by the FDIC, a covered institution must submit the data required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section to the FDIC, in a manner prescribed by the FDIC.</P>

            <P>(4) In providing the data required under paragraph (d)(1) of this section to the FDIC, the <E T="03">Covered Institution</E> must be able to reconcile the total deposit balances and the number of deposit accounts to the institution's subsidiary system control totals.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Implementation requirements.</E> (1) A covered institution must comply with the requirements of this section no later than February 18, 2010.</P>
            <P>(2) An insured depository institution not within the definition of a covered institution on the effective date of this section must comply with the requirements of this section no later than eighteen months following the end of the second calendar quarter for which it meets the criteria for a covered institution.</P>
            <P>(3) Upon the merger of two or more non-covered institutions, if the resulting institution meets the criteria for a covered institution, that covered institution must comply with the requirements of this section no later than eighteen months after the effective date of the merger.</P>
            <P>(4) Upon the merger of two or more covered institutions, the merged institution must comply with the requirements of this section within eighteen months following the effective date of the merger. This provision, however, does not supplant any preexisting implementation date requirement, in place prior to the date of the merger, for the individual covered institution(s) involved in the merger.</P>

            <P>(5) Upon the merger of one or more covered institutions with one or more non-covered institutions, the merged institution(s) must comply with the requirements of this section within eighteen months following the effective date of the merger. This provision, <PRTPAGE P="147"/>however, does not supplant any preexisting implementation date requirement for the individual covered institution(s) involved in the merger.</P>
            <P>(6) Notwithstanding the general requirements of this paragraph (e), on a case-by-case basis, the FDIC may accelerate, upon notice, the implementation timeframe of all or part of the requirements of this section for a covered institution that: Has a composite rating of 3, 4, or 5 under the Uniform Financial Institution's Rating System, or in the case of an insured branch of a foreign bank, an equivalent rating; is undercapitalized, as defined under the prompt corrective action provisions of 12 CFR part 324; or is determined by the appropriate Federal banking agency or the FDIC in consultation with the appropriate Federal banking agency to be experiencing a significant deterioration of capital or significant funding difficulties or liquidity stress, notwithstanding the composite rating of the institution by its appropriate Federal banking agency in its most recent report of examination. In implementing this paragraph (e)(6), the FDIC must consult with the covered institution's primary federal regulator and consider the: Complexity of the institution's deposit systems and operations, extent of the institution's asset quality difficulties, volatility of the institution's funding sources, expected near-term changes in the institution's capital levels, and other relevant factors appropriate for the FDIC to consider in its roles as insurer and possible receiver of the institution.</P>
            <P>(7) Notwithstanding the general requirements of this paragraph (e), a covered institution may request, by letter, that the FDIC extend the deadline for complying with the requirements of this section. A request for such an extension is subject to the FDIC's rules of general applicability under 12 CFR. 303.251.</P>
            <P>(f) A covered institution may apply to the FDIC for an exemption from the requirements of this § 360.9 if it has a high concentration of deposits incidental to credit card operations. The FDIC will consider such applications on a case-by-case basis in light of the objectives of this section.</P>
            <P>(g) Requests for exemptions from the requirements of this section, for flexibility in the use of provisional holds or for extensions of the implementation requirements of this section and the submission of point-of-contact information should be submitted in writing to: Office of the Director, Division of Resolutions and Receiverships, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 550 17th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20429-0002.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Testing requirements.</E> Covered institutions must provide appropriate assistance to the FDIC in its testing of the systems required by this section. The FDIC will provide testing details to covered institutions through the issuance of subsequent procedures and/or guidelines.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Resolution plans required for insured depository institutions with $50 billion or more in total assets.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Scope and purpose.</E> This section requires each insured depository institution with $50 billion or more in total assets to submit periodically to the FDIC a plan for the resolution of such institution in the event of its failure. This section also establishes the rules and requirements regarding the submission and content of a resolution plan as well as procedures for review by the FDIC of a resolution plan. This section requires a covered insured depository institution to submit a resolution plan that should enable the FDIC, as receiver, to resolve the institution under Sections 11 and 13 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (“FDI Act”), 12 U.S.C. 1821 and 1823, in a manner that ensures that depositors receive access to their insured deposits within one business day of the institution's failure (two business days if the failure occurs on a day other than Friday), maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of its assets and minimizes the amount of any loss realized by the creditors in the resolution. This rule is intended to ensure that the FDIC has access to all of the material information it needs to resolve efficiently a covered insured depository institution in the event of its failure.<PRTPAGE P="148"/>

Identify key personnel tasked with managing core business lines and deposit activities and the CIDI's branch organization.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Critical Services.</E> Identify critical services and providers of critical services. Provide a mapping of critical services to material entities and core business lines. Describe the CIDI's strategy for continuing critical services in the event of the CIDI's failure.

            <P>(vii) <E T="03">Least Costly Resolution Method.</E> Describe how the strategies for the separation of the CIDI and its subsidiaries from its parent company's organization and sale or disposition of deposit franchise, core business lines and major assets can be demonstrated to be the least costly to the Deposit Insurance Fund of all possible methods for resolving the CIDI.</P>
            <P>(viii) <E T="03">Asset Valuation and Sales.</E> Provide a detailed description of the processes the CIDI employs for:</P>

            <P>(B) Assessing the feasibility of the CIDI's plans, under baseline, adverse and severely adverse economic condition scenarios for executing any sales, divestitures, restructurings, recapitalizations, or similar actions contemplated in the CIDI's resolution plan; and</P>
            <P>(C) Assessing the impact of any sales, divestitures, restructurings, recapitalizations, or other similar actions on the value, funding and operations of the CIDI and its core business lines.</P>
            <P>(ix) <E T="03">Major Counterparties.</E> Identify the major counterparties of the CIDI and describe the interconnections, interdependencies and relationships with such major counterparties.

            </P>
            <P>(i) Each resolution plan submitted shall be credible. A resolution plan is credible if its strategies for resolving the CIDI, and the detailed information required by this section, are well-founded and based on information and data related to the CIDI that are observable or otherwise verifiable and employ reasonable projections from current and historical conditions within the broader financial markets.</P>
            <P>(ii) After receiving a resolution plan, the FDIC shall determine whether the submitted plan satisfies the minimum informational requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section; and either acknowledge acceptance of the plan for review or return the resolution plan if the FDIC determines that it is incomplete or that substantial additional information is required to facilitate review of the resolution plan.</P>
            <P>(iii) If the FDIC determines that a resolution plan is informationally incomplete or that additional information is necessary to facilitate review of the plan, the FDIC shall inform the CIDI in writing of the area(s) in which the plan is informationally incomplete or with respect to which additional information is required.</P>
            <P>(iv) The CIDI shall resubmit an informationally complete resolution plan or such additional information as requested to facilitate review of the resolution plan no later than 30 days after receiving the notice described in paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section, or such other time period as the FDIC may determine.</P>
            <P>(v) Upon acceptance of a resolution plan as informationally complete, the FDIC will review the resolution plan in consultation with the appropriate Federal banking agency for the CIDI and its parent company. If, after consultation with the appropriate Federal banking agency for the CIDI, the FDIC determines that the resolution plan of a CIDI submitted is not credible, the FDIC shall notify the CIDI in writing of such determination. Any notice provided under this paragraph shall identify the aspects of the resolution plan that the FDIC determines to be deficient.</P>

            <P>(vi) Within 90 days of receiving a notice of deficiencies issued pursuant to the preceding paragraph, or such shorter or longer period as the FDIC may determine, a CIDI shall submit a revised resolution plan to the FDIC that addresses the deficiencies identified by <PRTPAGE P="153"/>the FDIC and discusses in detail the revisions made to address such deficiencies.</P>
            <P>(vii) Upon its own initiative or a written request by a CIDI, the FDIC may extend any time period under this section. Each extension request shall be in writing and shall describe the basis and justification for the request.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Implementation Matters.</E> (1) In order to allow evaluation of the resolution plan, each CIDI must provide the FDIC such information and access to such personnel of the CIDI as the FDIC determines is necessary to assess the credibility of the resolution plan and the ability of the CIDI to implement the resolution plan. The FDIC will rely to the fullest extent possible on examinations conducted by or on behalf of the appropriate Federal banking agency for the relevant company.</P>
            <P>(2) Within a reasonable period of time, as determined by the FDIC, following its Initial Submission Date, the CIDI shall demonstrate its capability to produce promptly, in a time frame and format acceptable to the FDIC, the information and data underlying its resolution plan. The FDIC shall consult with the appropriate Federal banking agency for the CIDI before finding that the CIDI's capability to produce the information and data underlying its resolution plan is unacceptable.</P>
            <P>(3) Notwithstanding the general requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, on a case-by-case basis, the FDIC may extend, on its own initiative or upon written request, the implementation and updating time frames for all or part of the requirements of this section.</P>
            <P>(4) FDIC may, on its own initiative or upon written request, exempt a CIDI from one or more of the requirements of this section.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">No limiting effect on FDIC.</E> No resolution plan provided pursuant to this section shall be binding on the FDIC as supervisor, deposit insurer or receiver for a CIDI or otherwise require the FDIC to act in conformance with such plan.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Form of Resolution Plans; Confidential Treatment of Resolution Plans.</E> (1) Each resolution plan of a CIDI shall be divided into a Public Section and a Confidential Section. Each CIDI shall segregate and separately identify the Public Section from the Confidential Section. The Public Section shall consist of an executive summary of the resolution plan that describes the business of the CIDI and includes, to the extent material to an understanding of the CIDI:</P>
            <P>(i) The names of material entities;</P>
            <P>(ii) A description of core business lines;</P>
            <P>(iii) Consolidated financial information regarding assets, liabilities, capital and major funding sources;</P>

            <P>(xi) A description, at a high level, of the CIDI's resolution strategy, covering such items as the range of potential purchasers of the CIDI, its material entities and core business lines.</P>
            <P>(2) The confidentiality of resolution plans shall be determined in accordance with applicable exemptions under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552(b)) and the FDIC's Disclosure of Information Rules (12 CFR part 309).</P>
            <P>(3) Any CIDI submitting a resolution plan or related materials pursuant to this section that desires confidential treatment of the information submitted pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4) and the FDIC's Disclosure of Information Rules (12 CFR part 309) and related policies may file a request for confidential treatment in accordance with those rules.</P>
            <P>(4) To the extent permitted by law, information comprising the Confidential Section of a resolution plan will be treated as confidential.</P>

            <P>(5) To the extent permitted by law, the submission of any nonpublicly available data or information under <PRTPAGE P="154"/>this section shall not constitute a waiver of, or otherwise affect, any privilege arising under Federal or state law (including the rules of any Federal or state court) to which the data or information is otherwise subject. Privileges that apply to resolution plans and related materials are protected pursuant to Section 18(x) of the FDI Act, 12 U.S.C. 1828(x).</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 360.11</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Records of failed insured depository institutions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply—</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Failed insured depository institution</E> is an insured depository institution for which the FDIC has been appointed receiver pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1821(c)(1).</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Insured depository institution</E> has the same meaning as provided by 12 U.S.C. 1813(c)(2).</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Records</E> means any reasonably accessible document, book, paper, map, photograph, microfiche, microfilm, computer or electronically-created record generated or maintained by an insured depository institution in the course of and necessary to its transaction of business.</P>
            <P>(i) Examples of records include, without limitation, board or committee meeting minutes, contracts to which the insured depository institution was a party, deposit account information, employee and employee benefits information, general ledger and financial reports or data, litigation files, and loan documents.</P>
            <P>(ii) Records do not include:</P>
            <P>(A) Multiple copies of records; or</P>
            <P>(B) Examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of the FDIC or any agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of insured depository institutions.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Determination of records.</E> In determining whether particular documentary material obtained from a failed insured depository institution is a record for purposes of 12 U.S.C. 1821(d)(15)(D), the FDIC in its discretion will consider the following factors:</P>
            <P>(1) Whether the documentary material related to the business of the insured depository institution,</P>
            <P>(2) Whether the documentary material was generated or maintained as records in the regular course of the business of the insured depository institution in accordance with its own recordkeeping practices and procedures or pursuant to standards established by its regulators,</P>
            <P>(3) Whether the documentary material is needed by the FDIC to carry out its receivership function, and</P>
            <P>(4) The expected evidentiary needs of the FDIC.</P>
            <P>(c) The FDIC's determination that documentary material from a failed insured depository institution constitutes records is solely for the purpose of identifying that documentary material that must be maintained pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1821(d)(15)(D) and shall not bear on the discoverability or admissibility of such documentary material in any court, tribunal or other adjudicative proceeding, nor on whether such documentary material is subject to release under the Freedom of Information Act, the Privacy Act or other law.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Destruction of records.</E> (1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, after the end of the six-year period beginning on the date the FDIC is appointed as receiver of a failed insured depository institution, the FDIC may destroy any records of an institution which the FDIC, in its discretion, determines to be unnecessary unless directed not to do so by a court of competent jurisdiction or governmental agency, prohibited by law, or subject to a legal hold imposed by the FDIC.</P>
            <P>(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the FDIC may destroy records of a failed insured depository institution which are at least 10 years old as of the date on which the FDIC is appointed as the receiver of such institution in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section at any time after such appointment is final, without regard to the six-year period of limitation contained in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Transfer of records.</E> If the FDIC transfers records to a third party in <PRTPAGE P="155"/>connection with a transaction involving the purchase and assumption of assets and liabilities of an insured depository institution, the recordkeeping requirements of 12 U.S.C. 1821(d)(15)(D), and paragraph (d) of this section shall be satisfied if the transferee agrees that it will not destroy such records for at least six years from the date the FDIC was appointed as receiver of such failed insured depository institution unless otherwise notified in writing by the FDIC.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Policies and procedures.</E> The FDIC may establish policies and procedures with respect to the retention and destruction of records that are consistent with this section.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix C to Part 360—Deposit File Structure</HD>

            <P>This is the structure for the data file to provide deposit data to the FDIC. If data or information are not maintained or do not apply, a null value in the appropriate field should be indicated. The file will be in a tab-or pipe-delimited ASCII format. Each file name will contain the institution's FDIC Certificate Number, an indication that it is a deposit file type and the date of the extract. The files will be encrypted using an FDIC-supplied algorithm. The FDIC will transmit to the covered institution the encryption algorithm over FDIC<E T="03">connect.</E>
            </P>
            <P>The total deposit balances and the number of deposit accounts in each deposit file must be reconciled to the subsidiary system control totals.</P>
            <P>The FDIC intends to fully utilize a covered institution's understanding of its customers and the data maintained around deposit accounts. Should additional information be available to the covered institution to help the FDIC more quickly complete its insurance determination process, it may add this information to the end of this data file. Should additional data elements be provided, a complete data dictionary for these elements must be supplied along with a description of how this information could be best used to establish account ownership or insurance category.</P>
            <P>The deposit data elements provide information specific to deposit account balances and account data. The sequencing of these elements, their physical data structures and the field data format and field length must be provided to the FDIC along with the data structures identified below.</P>

            <P>A header record will also be required at the beginning of this file. This record will contain the number of accounts to be included in this file, the maximum number of characters contained in largest account title <PRTPAGE P="157"/>field maintained within the deposit file and the maximum number of characters contained in largest address field maintained within the deposit file.
            </P>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>Each record must contain the account title/name and current account statement mailing address. Fields 17-33 relate to the account name and address information. Some systems provide for separate fields for account title/name, street address, city, state, ZIP, and country, all of which are parsed out. Others systems may simply provide multiple lines for name, street address, city, state, ZIP, with no distinction. Populate fields that best fit the system's data, either fields 17-27 or fields 28-33.</P>

            <P>This is the structure of the data file to provide information to the FDIC on funds residing in investment vehicles linked to each non-closed deposit account or sub-account: (1) Involved in sweep activity where the sweep investment vehicle is not a deposit and is reflected on the books and records of the covered institution or (2) which accepts automated credits. A single record should be used for each instance where funds affiliated with the deposit account are held in an alternative investment vehicle. For any alternative investment vehicle, a separate account may or may not exist. If an account <PRTPAGE P="163"/>exists for the investment vehicle, it should be noted in the record. If no account exists, then a null value for the Sweep/Automated Credit Account Identifiers should be provided, but the remainder of the data fields defined below should be populated.</P>

            <P>For data provided in the Sweep/Automated Credit Account File, the total account balances and the number of accounts must be reconciled to subsidiary system control totals. The file will be in a tab- or pipe-delimited ASCII format. The files will be encrypted using an FDIC-supplied algorithm. The FDIC will transmit the encryption algorithm over FDIC<E T="03">connect.</E>

            <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix G to Part 360—Deposit-Customer Join File Structure</HD>

            <P>This is the structure of the data file to provide to the FDIC information necessary to link the records in the deposit and customer files. If data or information are not maintained or do not apply, a null value in the appropriate field should be indicated. The file will be in a tab- or pipe-delimited ASCII format. Each file name will contain the institution's FDIC Certificate Number, an indication that it is a join file type and the date of the extract. The files will be encrypted using an FDIC-supplied algorithm. The FDIC will transmit the encryption algorithm over FDIC<E T="03">connect.</E>
            </P>
            <P>The deposit-customer join file will have one or more records for each deposit account, depending on the number of relationships to each account. A simple individual account, for example, will be associated with only one record in the deposit-customer join file indicating the owner of the account. A joint account with two owners will be associated with two records in the deposit-customer join file, one for each owner. The deposit-customer join file will contain other records associated with a deposit account to designate, among other things, beneficiaries, custodians, trustees and agents. This methodology allows the FDIC to know all of the possible relationships for an individual account and also whether a single customer is involved in many accounts.</P>

            <P>A covered institution must provide deposit data using separate deposit, sweep/automated credit, hold, customer, and deposit-customer join files. The simplest file structure involves providing one of each file. This basic file format is shown in Figure 1.</P>

            </GPH>
            <P>Multiple combinations of deposit, sweep/automated credit, hold, customer, and deposit-customer join files are permissible, but only in the following circumstances:</P>
            <P>1. Each separate deposit file must have companion sweep/automated credit and hold files covering the same deposit accounts.</P>
            <P>2. A single customer file may be submitted covering customers affiliated with deposit accounts in one or more deposit files as long as the customer file contains information on all of the customers affiliated with the deposit files.</P>
            <P>3. Several customer files may be submitted as long as each separate customer file contains information on all of the customers affiliated with the associated deposit files.</P>
            <P>Figure 2 shows a permissible file configuration using a single Customer File affiliated with Deposit File A and Deposit File B. As required, Deposit File A has a companion Sweep/Automated Credit File A and Hold File A. The same is true for Deposit File B.</P>
            <P>Another permissible combination of files is shown in Figure 3, which is a variation of the basic data file structure shown in Figure 1.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Purpose and scope.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) This subpart, along with the notice and application procedures in subpart G of part 303 of this chapter, implements the provisions of section 24 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1831a) that restrict and prohibit insured State banks and their subsidiaries from engaging in activities and investments that are not permissible for national banks and their subsidiaries. The phrase “activity permissible for a national bank” means any activity authorized for national banks under any statute including the National Bank Act (12 U.S.C. 21 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), as well as activities recognized as permissible for a national bank in regulations, official circulars, bulletins, orders or written interpretations issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).</P>
              <P>(b) This subpart does not cover the following activities:</P>
              <P>(1) Activities conducted other than “as principal,” defined for purposes of this subpart as activities conducted as agent for a customer, conducted in a brokerage, custodial, advisory, or administrative capacity, or conducted as trustee, or in any substantially similar capacity. For example, this subpart does not cover acting solely as agent for the sale of insurance, securities, real estate, or travel services; nor does it cover acting as trustee, providing personal financial planning advice, or safekeeping services;</P>
              <P>(2) Interests in real estate in which the real property is used or intended in good faith to be used within a reasonable time by an insured State bank or its subsidiaries as offices or related facilities for the conduct of its business or future expansion of its business or used as public welfare investments of a type permissible for national banks; and</P>

              <P>(3) Equity investments acquired in connection with debts previously contracted (DPC) if the insured State bank does not hold the property for speculation and takes only such actions as would be permissible for a national bank's DPC. The bank must dispose of the property within the shorter of the period set by Federal law for national banks or the period allowed under State law. For real estate, national banks may not hold DPC for more than 10 years. For equity securities, national banks must generally divest <PRTPAGE P="174"/>DPC as soon as possible consistent with obtaining a reasonable return.</P>
              <P>(c) A subsidiary of an insured state bank may not engage in real estate investment activities that are not permissible for a subsidiary of a national bank unless the bank does so through a subsidiary of which the bank is a majority owner, is in compliance with applicable capital standards, and the FDIC has determined that the activity poses no significant risk to the appropriate deposit insurance fund. This subpart provides standards for majority-owned subsidiaries of insured state banks engaging in real estate investment activities that are not permissible for a subsidiary of a national bank.</P>
              <P>(d) The FDIC intends to allow insured State banks and their subsidiaries to undertake only safe and sound activities and investments that do not present significant risks to the Deposit Insurance Fund and that are consistent with the purposes of Federal deposit insurance and other applicable law. This subpart does not authorize any insured State bank to make investments or to conduct activities that are not authorized or that are prohibited by either State or Federal law.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Activities of insured State banks.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Equity investments</E>—(1) <E T="03">Prohibited equity investments.</E> No insured State bank may directly or indirectly acquire or retain as principal any equity investment of a type that is not permissible for a national bank unless one of the exceptions in paragraph (a)(2) of this section applies.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Exceptions</E>— (i) <E T="03">Equity investment in majority-owned subsidiaries.</E> An insured State bank may acquire or retain an equity investment in a subsidiary of which the bank is a majority owner, provided that the subsidiary is engaging in activities that are allowed pursuant to the provisions of or by application under § 362.4(b).</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Investments in qualified housing projects.</E> An insured State bank may invest as a limited partner in a partnership, or as a noncontrolling interest holder of a limited liability company, the sole purpose of which is to invest in the acquisition, rehabilitation, or new construction of a qualified housing project, provided that the bank's aggregate investment (including legally binding commitments) does not exceed, when made, 2 percent of total assets as of the date of the bank's most recent consolidated report of condition prior to making the investment. For the purposes of this paragraph (a)(2)(ii), <E T="03">Aggregate investment</E> means the total book value of the bank's investment in the real estate calculated in accordance with the instructions for the preparation of the consolidated report of condition. <E T="03">Qualified housing project</E> means residential real estate intended to primarily benefit lower income persons throughout the period of the bank's investment including any project that has received an award of low income housing tax credits under section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 42) (such as a reservation or allocation of credits) from a State or local housing credit agency. A residential real estate project that does not qualify for the tax credit under section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code will qualify under this exception if 50 percent or more of the housing units are to be occupied by lower income persons. A project will be considered residential despite the fact that some portion of the total square footage of the project is utilized for commercial purposes, provided that such commercial use is not the primary purpose of the project. <E T="03">Lower income</E> has the same meaning as “low income” and “moderate income” as defined for the purposes of § 345.12(n) (1) and (2) of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Grandfathered investments in common or preferred stock; shares of investment companies</E>— (A) <E T="03">General.</E> An insured State bank that is located in a State which as of September 30, 1991, authorized investment in:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>)(<E T="03">i</E>) Common or preferred stock listed on a national securities exchange (listed stock); or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) Shares of an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) (registered shares); and</P>

The FDIC is not precluded from taking any appropriate action or imposing additional requirements with respect to the activity if the facts and circumstances warrant such action. If changes to the management or business plan of the company at any time result in material changes to the nature of the company's business or the manner in which its business is conducted, the insured State bank shall advise the appropriate regional director (DSC) in writing within 10 business days after such change.

Such a majority-owned subsidiary may:</P>

The fact that prior consent is not required by this subpart does not preclude the FDIC from taking any appropriate action with respect to the activity if the facts and circumstances warrant such action.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Lease criteria</E>—(A) <E T="03">Capital lease.</E> The lease must qualify as a capital lease as to the lessor under generally accepted accounting principles.</P>

              <P>(7) <E T="03">Acquiring and retaining adjustable rate and money market preferred stock and similar instruments.</E> The FDIC has determined it does not present a significant risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund for a majority-owned subsidiary of an insured State bank to engage in any activity permissible for an insured State bank under § 362.3(b)(2)(iii), so long as instruments held under this paragraph, paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(C) of this section, and § 362.3(b)(2)(iii) in the aggregate do not exceed the limit set by § 362.3(b)(2)(iii). A majority-owned subsidiary may conduct this activity without first obtaining the FDIC's consent, provided that the bank meets and continues to meet the applicable capital standards as prescribed by the appropriate Federal banking agency.

              <P>(a) This subpart, along with the notice and application procedures in subpart H of part 303 of this chapter, implements the provisions of section 28(a) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1831e(a)) that restrict and prohibit insured state savings associations and their service corporations from engaging in activities and investments of a type that are not permissible for a Federal savings association and their service corporations. This subpart also implements the provision of section 28(d) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1831e(d)) that restricts state and federal savings associations from investing in certain corporate debt securities. The phrase “activity permissible for a Federal savings association” means any activity authorized for a Federal savings association under any statute including the Home Owners' Loan Act (HOLA) (12 U.S.C. 1464 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), as well as activities recognized as permissible for a Federal savings association in regulations issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) or in bulletins, orders or written interpretations issued by the OCC, or by the former Office of Thrift Supervision until modified, terminated, set aside, or superseded by the OCC.</P>
              <P>(b) This subpart does not cover the following activities:</P>
              <P>(1) Activities conducted by the insured state savings association other than “as principal”, defined for purposes of this subpart as activities conducted as agent for a customer, conducted in a brokerage, custodial, advisory, or administrative capacity, or conducted as trustee, or in any substantially similar capacity. For example, this subpart does not cover acting solely as agent for the sale of insurance, securities, real estate, or travel services; nor does it cover acting as trustee, providing personal financial planning advice, or safekeeping services.</P>
              <P>(2) Interests in real estate in which the real property is used or intended in good faith to be used within a reasonable time by an insured savings association or its service corporations as offices or related facilities for the conduct of its business or future expansion of its business or used as public welfare investments of a type and in an amount permissible for Federal savings associations.</P>
              <P>(3) Equity investments acquired in connection with debts previously contracted (DPC) if the insured savings association or its service corporation takes only such actions as would be permissible for a Federal savings association's or its service corporation's DPC holdings.</P>

              <P>(c) The FDIC intends to allow insured state savings associations and their service corporations to undertake only safe and sound activities and investments that do not present significant risks to the Deposit Insurance Fund <PRTPAGE P="188"/>and that are consistent with the purposes of Federal deposit insurance and other applicable law. This subpart does not authorize any insured state savings association to make investments or conduct activities that are not authorized or that are prohibited by either Federal or state law.</P>

              <P>(ii) Of a type permissible for a Federal savings association, but in an amount exceeding the investment limits applicable to Federal savings associations, if the insured state savings association obtains the FDIC's prior consent. Consent will be given only if the FDIC determines that the amount of the investment in a service corporation engaged in such activities does not present a significant risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund. Applications should be filed in accordance with § 303.141 of this chapter and will be processed under § 303.142(b) of this chapter. Approvals granted under § 303.142(b) of this chapter may be made subject to any conditions or restrictions found by the FDIC to be necessary to protect the Deposit Insurance Fund from significant risk, to prevent unsafe or unsound practices, and/or to ensure that the activity is consistent with the purposes of Federal deposit insurance and other applicable law.</P>

This section shall not <PRTPAGE P="189"/>be read to require the divestiture of any asset (including a nonresidential real estate loan), if the asset was acquired prior to August 9, 1989; however, any activity conducted with such asset must be conducted in accordance with this subpart. On and after July 21, 2012, an insured savings association directly or through a subsidiary (other than, in the case of a mutual savings association, a subsidiary that is a qualified affiliate), shall not acquire or retain a corporate debt security unless the savings association, prior to acquiring the security and periodically thereafter, determines that the issuer of the security has adequate capacity to meet all financial commitments under the security for the projected life of the security. Saving associations have until January 1, 2013 to come into compliance with this treatment of corporate debt securities.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Exceptions</E>—(i) <E T="03">Consent obtained through application.</E> An insured state savings association that meets and continues to meet the applicable capital standards set by the appropriate Federal banking agency may directly conduct activities prohibited by paragraph (b)(1) of this section if the savings association obtains the FDIC's prior consent.

This subpart also implements the statutory Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) (12 U.S.C. 2901 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) requirement set forth in subsection (4)(l)(2) of the Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(l)(2)), which is applicable to state nonmember banks that commence new activities through a financial subsidiary or directly or indirectly acquire control of a company engaged in an activity under section 46(a).</P>

For purposes of this subpart, activities conducted other than “as principal” are defined as activities conducted as agent for a customer, conducted in a brokerage, custodial, advisory, or administrative capacity, or conducted as trustee, or in any substantially similar capacity. For example, this subpart does not cover acting solely as agent for the sale of insurance, securities, real estate, or travel services; nor does it cover acting as trustee, providing personal financial planning advice, or safekeeping services.</P>

            <P>36. Modifications of Guidelines</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Introduction</HD>
            <P>Congress added section 36, “Early Identification of Needed Improvements in Financial Management” (section 36), to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act) in 1991.</P>
            <P>The FDIC Board of Directors adopted 12 CFR part 363 of its rules and regulations (the Rule) to implement those provisions of section 36 that require rulemaking. The FDIC also approved these “Guidelines and Interpretations” (the Guidelines) and directed that they be published with the Rule to facilitate a better understanding of, and full compliance with, the provisions of section 36.</P>
            <P>Although not contained in the Rule itself, some of the guidance offered restates or refers to statutory requirements of section 36 and is therefore mandatory. If that is the case, the statutory provision is cited.</P>
            <P>Furthermore, upon adopting the Rule, the FDIC reiterated its belief that every insured depository institution, regardless of its size or charter, should have an annual audit of its financial statements performed by an independent public accountant, and should establish an audit committee comprised entirely of outside directors.</P>
            <P>The following Guidelines reflect the views of the FDIC concerning the interpretation of section 36. The Guidelines are intended to assist insured depository institutions (institutions), their boards of directors, and their advisors, including their independent public accountants and legal counsel, and to clarify section 36 and the Rule. It is recognized that reliance on the Guidelines may result in compliance with section 36 and the Rule which may vary from institution to institution. Terms which are not explained in the Guidelines have the meanings given them in the Rule, the FDI Act, or professional accounting and auditing literature.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Scope of Rule and Definitions (§ 363.1)</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Measuring Total Assets.</E> To determine whether this part applies, an institution should use total assets as reported on its most recent Report of Condition (Call Report) or Thrift Financial Report (TFR), the date of which coincides with the end of its preceding fiscal year. If its fiscal year ends on a date other than the end of a calendar quarter, it should use its Call Report or TFR for the quarter end immediately preceding the end of its fiscal year.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Insured Branches of Foreign Banks.</E> Unlike other institutions, insured branches of foreign banks are not separately incorporated or capitalized. To determine whether this part applies, an insured branch should measure claims on non-related parties reported on its Report of Assets and Liabilities of U.S. Branches and Agencies of Foreign Banks (form FFIEC 002).</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Compliance by Holding Company Subsidiaries.</E> Audited consolidated financial statements and other reports or notices required by this part that are submitted by a holding company for any subsidiary institution should be accompanied by a cover letter identifying all subsidiary institutions subject to part 363 that are included in the holding company's submission. When submitting a Part 363 Annual Report, the cover letter should identify all subsidiary institutions subject to part 363 included in the consolidated financial statements and state whether the other annual report requirements (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> management's statement of responsibilities, management's assessment of compliance with designated safety and soundness laws and regulations, and, if applicable, management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and the independent public accountant's attestation report on management's internal control assessment) are being satisfied for these institutions at the holding company level or at the institution level. An institution filing holding company consolidated financial statements as permitted by § 363.1(b)(1) also may report on changes in its independent public accountant on a holding company basis. An institution that does not meet the criteria in § 363.1(b)(2) must satisfy the remaining provisions of this part on an individual institution basis and maintain its own audit committee. Subject to the criteria in §§ 363.1(b)(1) and (2), a multi-tiered holding company may satisfy all of the requirements of this part at the top-tier or any mid-tier holding company level.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Comparable Services and Functions.</E> Services and functions will be considered “comparable” to those required by this part if the holding company:</P>
            <P>(a) Prepares reports used by the subsidiary institution to meet the requirements of this part;</P>
            <P>(b) Has an audit committee that meets the requirements of this part appropriate to its largest subsidiary institution; and</P>

            <P>(c) Prepares and submits management's assessment of compliance with the Designated Laws and Regulations defined in guideline <PRTPAGE P="203"/>7A and, if applicable, management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on information concerning the relevant activities and operations of those subsidiary institutions within the scope of the Rule.</P>
            <P>4A. <E T="03">Financial Statements Prepared for Regulatory Reporting Purposes.</E> (a) As set forth in § 363.3(c) of this part, “financial reporting,” at a minimum, includes both financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for the insured depository institution or its holding company and financial statements prepared for regulatory reporting purposes. More specifically, financial statements prepared for regulatory reporting purposes include the schedules equivalent to the basic financial statements that are included in an insured depository institution's or its holding company's appropriate regulatory report (for example, Schedules RC, RI, and RI-A in the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Call Report) for an insured bank; and Schedules SC and SO, and the Summary of Changes in Equity Capital section in Schedule SI in the Thrift Financial Report (TFR) for an insured thrift institution). For recognition and measurement purposes, financial statements prepared for regulatory reporting purposes shall conform to generally accepted accounting principles and section 37 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.</P>
            <P>(b) Financial statements prepared for regulatory reporting purposes do not include regulatory reports prepared by a non-bank subsidiary of a holding company or an institution. For example, if a bank holding company or an insured depository institution owns an insurance subsidiary, financial statements prepared for regulatory reporting purposes would not include any regulatory reports that the insurance subsidiary is required to submit to its appropriate insurance regulatory agency.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Annual Reporting Requirements (§ 363.2)</HD>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Annual Financial Statements.</E> Each institution (other than an insured branch of a foreign bank) should prepare comparative annual consolidated financial statements (balance sheets and statements of income, changes in equity capital, and cash flows, with accompanying footnote disclosures) in accordance with GAAP for each of its two most recent fiscal years. Statements for the earlier year may be presented on an unaudited basis if the institution was not subject to this part for that year and audited statements were not prepared.</P>
            <P>5A. <E T="03">Institutions Merged Out of Existence.</E> An institution that is merged out of existence after the end of its fiscal year, but before the deadline for filing its Part 363 Annual Report (120 days after the end of its fiscal year for an institution that is neither a public company nor a subsidiary of a public company that meets the criterion specified in § 363.1(b)(1), and 90 days after the end of its fiscal year for an institution that is a public company or a subsidiary of a public company that meets the criterion specified in § 363.1(b)(1)), is not required to file a Part 363 Annual Report for the last fiscal year of its existence.</P>
            <P>6. <E T="03">Holding Company Statements.</E> Subject to the criterion specified in § 363.1(b)(1), subsidiary institutions may file copies of their holding company's audited financial statements filed with the SEC or prepared for their FR Y-6 Annual Report under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 to satisfy the audited financial statements requirement of § 363.2(a).</P>
            <P>7. <E T="03">Insured Branches of Foreign Banks.</E> An insured branch of a foreign bank should satisfy the financial statements requirement by filing one of the following for each of its two most recent fiscal years:</P>
            <P>(a) Audited balance sheets, disclosing information about financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk;</P>
            <P>(b) Schedules RAL and L of form FFIEC 002, prepared and audited on the basis of the instructions for its preparation; or</P>
            <P>(c) With written approval of the appropriate Federal banking agency, consolidated financial statements of the parent bank.</P>
            <P>7A. <E T="03">Compliance with Designated Laws and Regulations.</E> The designated laws and regulations are the Federal laws and regulations concerning loans to insiders and the Federal and, if applicable, State laws and regulations concerning dividend restrictions (the Designated Laws and Regulations). Table 1 to this Appendix A lists the designated Federal laws and regulations pertaining to insider loans and dividend restrictions (but not the State laws and regulations pertaining to dividend restrictions) that are applicable to each type of institution.</P>
            <P>8. <E T="03">Management Report.</E> Management should perform its own investigation and review of compliance with the Designated Laws and Regulations and, if required, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Management should maintain records of its determinations and assessments until the next Federal safety and soundness examination, or such later date as specified by the FDIC or the appropriate Federal banking agency. Management should provide in its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, or supplementally, sufficient information to enable the accountant to report on its assertions. The management report of an insured branch of a foreign bank should be signed by the branch's managing official if the branch does not have a chief executive officer or a chief accounting or financial officer.</P>
            <P>8A. <E T="03">Management's Reports on Internal Control over Financial Reporting under Part 363 and Section 404 of SOX.</E> An institution with $1 <PRTPAGE P="204"/>billion or more in total assets as of the beginning of its fiscal year that is subject to both part 363 and the SEC's rules implementing section 404 of SOX (as well as a public holding company permitted under the holding company exception in § 363.1(b)(2) to file an internal control report on behalf of one or more subsidiary institutions with $1 billion or more in total assets) can choose either of the following two options for filing management's report on internal control over financial reporting.</P>
            <P>(i) Management can prepare two separate reports on the institution's or the holding company's internal control over financial reporting to satisfy the FDIC's part 363 requirements and the SEC's section 404 requirements; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Management can prepare a single report on internal control over financial reporting provided that it satisfies all of the FDIC's part 363 requirements and all of the SEC's section 404 requirements.</P>
            <P>8B. <E T="03">Internal Control Reports and Part 363 Annual Reports for Acquired Businesses.</E> Generally, the FDIC expects management's and the related independent public accountant's report on an institution's internal control over financial reporting to include controls at an institution in its entirety, including all of its consolidated entities. However, it may not always be possible for management to conduct an assessment of the internal control over financial reporting of an acquired business in the period between the consummation date of the acquisition and the due date of management's internal control assessment.</P>
            <P>(a) In such instances, the acquired business's internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting may be excluded from management's assessment report and the accountant's attestation report on internal control over financial reporting. However, the FDIC expects management's assessment report to identify the acquired business, state that the acquired business is excluded, and indicate the significance of this business to the institution's consolidated financial statements. Notwithstanding management's exclusion of the acquired business's internal control from its assessment, management should disclose any material change to the institution's internal control over financial reporting due to the acquisition of this business. Also, management may not omit the assessment of the acquired business's internal control from more than one annual part 363 assessment report on internal control over financial reporting. When the acquired business's internal control over financial reporting is excluded from management's assessment, the independent public accountant may likewise exclude this acquired business's internal control over financial reporting from the accountant's evaluation of internal control over financial reporting.</P>
            <P>(b) If the acquired business is or has a consolidated subsidiary that is an insured depository institution subject to part 363 and the institution is not merged out of existence before the deadline for filing its Part 363 Annual Report (120 days after the end of its fiscal year for an institution that is neither a public company nor a subsidiary of a public company that meets the criterion specified in § 363.1(b)(1), and 90 days after the end of its fiscal year for an institution that is a public company or a subsidiary of public company that meets the criterion specified in § 363.1(b)(1)), the acquired institution must continue to comply with all of the applicable requirements of part 363, including filing its Part 363 Annual Report.</P>
            <P>8C. <E T="03">Management's Disclosure of Noncompliance with the Designated Laws and Regulations.</E> Management's disclosure of noncompliance, if any, with the Designated Laws and Regulations should separately indicate the number of instances or frequency of noncompliance with the Federal laws and regulations pertaining to insider loans and the Federal (and, if applicable, State) laws and regulations pertaining to dividend restrictions. The disclosure is not required to specifically identify by name the individuals (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> officers or directors) who were responsible for or were the subject of any such noncompliance. However, the disclosure should include appropriate qualitative and quantitative information to describe the nature, type, and severity of the noncompliance and the dollar amount of the insider loan(s) or dividend(s) involved. Similar instances of noncompliance may be aggregated as to number of instances and quantified as to the dollar amounts or the range of dollar amounts of insider loans and/or dividends for which noncompliance occurred. Management may also wish to describe any corrective actions taken in response to the instances of noncompliance as well any controls or procedures that are being developed or that have been developed and implemented to prevent or detect and correct future instances of noncompliance on a timely basis.</P>
            <P>9. <E T="03">Safeguarding of Assets.</E> “Safeguarding of assets,” as the term relates to internal control policies and procedures regarding financial reporting and which has precedent in accounting and auditing literature, should be encompassed in the management report and the independent public accountant's attestation discussed in guideline 18. Testing the existence of and compliance with internal controls on the management of assets, including loan underwriting and documentation, represents a reasonable implementation of section 36. The FDIC expects such internal controls to be encompassed by the assertion in the management report, but the term “safeguarding of assets” need not be specifically <PRTPAGE P="205"/>stated. The FDIC does not require the accountant to attest to the adequacy of safeguards, but does require the accountant to determine whether safeguarding policies exist.<SU>15</SU>
              <FTREF/>
            </P>
            <FTNT>
              <P>
                <SU>15</SU> It is management's responsibility to establish policies concerning underwriting and asset management and to make credit decisions. The auditor's role is to test compliance with management's policies relating to financial reporting.</P>
            </FTNT>
            <P>10. <E T="03">Standards for Internal Control.</E> The management of each insured depository institution with $1 billion or more in total assets as of the beginning of its fiscal year should base its assessment of the effectiveness of the institution's internal control over financial reporting on a suitable, recognized control framework established by a body of experts that followed due-process procedures, including the broad distribution of the framework for public comment. In addition to being available to users of management's reports, a framework is suitable only when it:</P>
            <P>• Is free from bias;</P>
            <P>• Permits reasonably consistent qualitative and quantitative measurements of an institution's internal control over financial reporting;</P>
            <P>• Is sufficiently complete so that those relevant factors that would alter a conclusion about the effectiveness of an institution's internal control over financial reporting are not omitted; and</P>
            <P>• Is relevant to an evaluation of internal control over financial reporting.</P>
            <P>In the United States, <E T="03">Internal Control—Integrated Framework,</E> including its addendum on safeguarding assets, which was published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and is known as the COSO report, provides a suitable and recognized framework for purposes of management's assessment. Other suitable frameworks have been published in other countries or may be developed in the future. Such other suitable frameworks may be used by management and the institution's independent public accountant in assessments, attestations, and audits of internal control over financial reporting.</P>
            <P>11. <E T="03">Service Organizations.</E> Although service organizations should be considered in determining if internal control over financial reporting is effective, an institution's independent public accountant, its management, and its audit committee should exercise independent judgment concerning that determination. Onsite reviews of service organizations may not be necessary to prepare the report required by the Rule, and the FDIC does not intend that the Rule establish any such requirement.</P>
            <P>12. [Reserved]</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Role of Independent Public Accountant (§ 363.3)</HD>
            <P>13. <E T="03">General Qualifications.</E> To provide audit and attest services to insured depository institutions, an independent public accountant should be registered or licensed to practice as a public accountant, and be in good standing, under the laws of the State or other political subdivision of the United States in which the home office of the institution (or the insured branch of a foreign bank) is located. As required by section 36(g)(3)(A)(i), the accountant must agree to provide copies of any working papers, policies, and procedures relating to services performed under this part.</P>
            <P>14. [Reserved]</P>
            <P>15. <E T="03">Peer Review Guidelines.</E> The following peer review guidelines are acceptable:</P>
            <P>(a) The external peer review should be conducted by an organization independent of the accountant or firm being reviewed, as frequently as is consistent with professional accounting practices;</P>
            <P>(b) The peer review (other than a PCAOB inspection) should be generally consistent with AICPA Peer Review Standards; and</P>
            <P>(c) The review should include, if available, at least one audit on an insured depository institution or consolidated depository institution holding company.</P>
            <P>16. [Reserved]</P>
            <P>17. <E T="03">Information to be Provided to the Independent Public Accountant.</E> Attention is directed to section 36(h) which requires institutions to provide specified information to their accountants. An institution also should provide its accountant with copies of any notice that the institution's capital category is being changed or reclassified under section 38 of the FDI Act, and any correspondence from the appropriate Federal banking agency concerning compliance with this part.</P>
            <P>18. <E T="03">Attestation Report and Management Letters.</E> The independent public accountant should provide the institution with any management letter and, if applicable, an internal control attestation report (as required by section 36(c)(1)) at the conclusion of the audit. The independent public accountant's attestation report on internal control over financial reporting must specifically include a statement as to regulatory reporting. If a holding company subsidiary relies on its holding company's management report to satisfy the Part 363 Annual Report requirements, the accountant may attest to and report on the management's assertions in one report, without reporting separately on each subsidiary covered by the Rule. The FDIC has determined that management letters are exempt from public disclosure.</P>
            <P>18A. <E T="03">Internal Control Attestation Standards for Independent Auditors.</E> (a) § 363.3(b) provides <PRTPAGE P="206"/>that the independent public accountant's attestation and report on management's assertion concerning the effectiveness of an institution's internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting shall be made in accordance with generally accepted standards for attestation engagements or the PCAOB's auditing standards, if applicable. The standards that should be followed by the institution's independent public accountant concerning internal control over financial reporting for institutions with $1 billion or more in total assets can be summarized as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) For an insured institution that is neither a public company nor a subsidiary of a public company, its independent public accountant need only follow the AICPA's attestation standards.</P>
            <P>(2) For an insured institution that is a public company that is required to comply with the auditor attestation requirement of section 404 of SOX, its independent public accountant should follow the PCAOB's auditing standards.</P>
            <P>(3) For an insured institution that is a public company but is not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirement of section 404 of SOX, its independent public accountant is not required to follow the PCAOB's auditing standards. In this case, the accountant need only follow the AICPA's attestation standards.</P>
            <P>(4) For an insured institution that is a subsidiary of a public company that is required to comply with the auditor attestation requirement of section 404 of SOX, but is not itself a public company, the institution and its independent public accountant have flexibility in complying with the internal control requirements of part 363. If the conditions specified in § 363.1(b)(2) are met, management and the independent public accountant may choose to report on internal control over financial reporting at the consolidated holding company level. In this situation, the independent public accountant's work would be performed for the public company in accordance with the PCAOB's auditing standards. Alternatively, the institution may choose to comply with the internal control reporting requirements of part 363 at the institution level and its independent public accountant could follow the AICPA's attestation standards.</P>
            <P>(b) If an independent public accountant need only follow the AICPA's attestation standards, the accountant and the insured institution may instead agree to have the internal control attestation performed under the PCAOB's auditing standards.</P>
            <P>19. <E T="03">Reviews with Audit Committee and Management.</E> The independent public accountant should meet with the institution's audit committee to review the accountant's reports required by this part before they are filed. It also may be appropriate for the accountant to review its findings with the institution's board of directors and management.</P>
            <P>20. <E T="03">Notice of Termination.</E> The notice of termination required by § 363.3(c) should state whether the independent public accountant agrees with the assertions contained in any notice filed by the institution under § 363.4(d), and whether the institution's notice discloses all relevant reasons for the accountant's termination. Subject to the criterion specified in § 363.1(b)(1) regarding compliance with the audited financial statements requirement at the holding company level, the independent public accountant for an insured depository institution that is a public company and files reports with its appropriate Federal banking agency, or is a subsidiary of a public company that files reports with the SEC, may submit the letter it furnished to management to be filed with the institution's or the holding company's current report (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> SEC Form 8-K) concerning a change in accountant to satisfy the notice requirements of § 363.3(c). Alternatively, if the independent public accountant confirms that management has filed a current report (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> SEC Form 8-K) concerning a change in accountant that satisfies the notice requirements of § 363.4(d) and includes an independent public accountant's letter that satisfies the requirements of § 363.3(c), the independent public accountant may rely on the current report (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> SEC Form 8-K) filed with the FDIC by management concerning a change in accountant to satisfy the notice requirements of § 363.3(c).</P>
            <P>21. <E T="03">Reliance on Internal Auditors.</E> Nothing in this part or this Appendix is intended to preclude the ability of the independent public accountant to rely on the work of an institution's internal auditor.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Filing and Notice Requirements (§ 363.4)</HD>
            <P>22. [Reserved]</P>
            <P>23. <E T="03">Notification of Late Filing.</E> (a) An institution's submission of a written notice of late filing does not cure the requirement to timely file the Part 363 Annual Report or other reports or notices required by § 363.4. An institution's failure to timely file is considered an apparent violation of part 363.</P>

            <P>(b) If the late filing notice submitted pursuant to § 363.4(e) relates only to a portion of a Part 363 Annual Report or any other report or notice, the insured depository institution should file the other components of the report or notice within the prescribed filing period together with a cover letter that indicates which components of its Part 363 Annual Report or other report or notice are omitted. An institution may combine the written late filing notice and the cover letter into a single notice that is submitted together with the other components of the report or notice that are being timely filed.<PRTPAGE P="207"/>
            </P>
            <P>24. <E T="03">Public Availability.</E> Each institution's Part 363 Annual Report should be available for public inspection at its main and branch offices no later than 15 days after it is filed with the FDIC. Alternatively, an institution may elect to mail one copy of its Part 363 Annual Report to any person who requests it. The Part 363 Annual Report should remain available to the public until the Part 363 Annual Report for the next year is available. An institution may use its Part 363 Annual Report under this part to meet the annual disclosure statement required by 12 CFR 350.3, if the institution satisfies all other requirements of 12 CFR Part 350.</P>

            <P>26. <E T="03">Notices Concerning Accountants.</E> With respect to any selection, change, or termination of an independent public accountant, an institution's management and audit committee should be familiar with the notice requirements in § 363.4(d) and guideline 20, and management should send a copy of any notice required under § 363.4(d) to the independent public accountant when it is filed with the FDIC. An insured depository institution that is a public company and files reports required under the Federal securities laws with its appropriate Federal banking agency, or is a subsidiary of a public company that files such reports with the SEC, may use its current report (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> SEC Form 8-K) concerning a change in accountant to satisfy the notice requirements of § 363.4(d) subject to the criterion of § 363.1(b)(1) regarding compliance with the audited financial statements requirement at the holding company level.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Audit Committees (§ 363.5)</HD>
            <P>27. <E T="03">Composition.</E> The board of directors of each institution should determine whether each existing or potential audit committee member meets the requirements of section 36 and this part. To do so, the board of directors should maintain an approved set of written criteria for determining whether a director who is to serve on the audit committee is an outside director (as defined in § 363.5(a)(3)) and is independent of management. At least annually, the board of each institution should determine whether each existing or potential audit committee member is an outside director. In addition, at least annually, the board of an institution with $1 billion or more in total assets as of the beginning of its fiscal year should determine whether all existing and potential audit committee members are “independent of management of the institution” and the board of an institution with total assets of $500 million or more but less than $1 billion as of the beginning of its fiscal year should determine whether the majority of all existing and potential audit committee members are “independent of management of the institution.” The minutes of the board of directors should contain the results of and the basis for its determinations with respect to each existing and potential audit committee member. Because an insured branch of a foreign bank does not have a separate board of directors, the FDIC will not apply the audit committee requirements to such branch. However, any such branch is encouraged to make a reasonable good faith effort to see that similar duties are performed by persons whose experience is generally consistent with the Rule's requirements for an institution the size of the insured branch.</P>
            <P>28. <E T="03">“Independent of Management” Considerations.</E> It is not possible to anticipate, or explicitly provide for, all circumstances that might signal potential conflicts of interest in, or that might bear on, an outside director's relationship to an insured depository institution and whether the outside director should be deemed “independent of management.” When assessing an outside director's relationship with an institution, the board of directors should consider the issue not merely from the standpoint of the director himself or herself, but also from the standpoint of persons or organizations with which the director has an affiliation. These relationships can include, but are not limited to, commercial, banking, consulting, charitable, and family relationships. To assist boards of directors in fulfilling their responsibility to determine whether existing and potential members of the audit committee are “independent of management,” paragraphs (a) through (d) of this guideline provide guidance for making this determination.</P>
            <P>(a) If an outside director, either directly or indirectly, owns or controls, or has owned or controlled within the preceding fiscal year, 10 percent or more of any outstanding class of voting securities of the institution, the institution's board of directors should determine, and document its basis and rationale for such determination, whether such ownership of voting securities would interfere with the outside director's exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of an audit committee member, including the ability to evaluate objectively the propriety of management's accounting, internal control, and reporting policies and practices. Notwithstanding the criteria set forth in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this guideline, if the board of directors determines that such ownership of voting securities would interfere with the outside director's exercise of independent judgment, the outside director will not be considered “independent of management.”</P>

            <P>(b) The following list sets forth additional criteria that, at a minimum, a board of directors should consider when determining whether an outside director is “independent of management.” The board of directors may conclude that additional criteria are also <PRTPAGE P="208"/>relevant to this determination in light of the particular circumstances of its institution. Accordingly, an outside director will not be considered “independent of management” if: (1) The director serves, or has served within the last three years, as a consultant, advisor, promoter, underwriter, legal counsel, or trustee of or to the institution or its affiliates.</P>
            <P>(2) The director has been, within the last three years, an employee of the institution or any of its affiliates or an immediate family member is, or has been within the last three years, an executive officer of the institution or any of its affiliates.</P>
            <P>(3) The director has participated in the preparation of the financial statements of the institution or any of its affiliates at any time during the last three years.</P>
            <P>(4) The director has received, or has an immediate family member who has received, during any twelve-month period within the last three years, more than $100,000 in direct and indirect compensation from the institution, its subsidiaries, and its affiliates for consulting, advisory, or other services other than director and committee fees and pension or other forms of deferred compensation for prior service (provided such compensation is not contingent in any way on continued service). Direct compensation also would not include compensation received by the director for former service as an interim chairman or interim chief executive officer.</P>
            <P>(5) The director or an immediate family member is a current partner of a firm that performs internal or external auditing services for the institution or any of its affiliates; the director is a current employee of such a firm; the director has an immediate family member who is a current employee of such a firm and who participates in the firm's audit, assurance, or tax compliance practice; or the director or an immediate family member was within the last three years (but no longer is) a partner or employee of such a firm and personally worked on the audit of the insured depository institution or any of its affiliates within that time.</P>
            <P>(6) The director or an immediate family member is, or has been within the last three years, employed as an executive officer of another entity where any of the present executive officers of the institution or any of its affiliates at the same time serves or served on that entity's compensation committee.</P>
            <P>(7) The director is a current employee, or an immediate family member is a current executive officer, of an entity that has made payments to, or received payments from, the institution or any of its affiliates for property or services in an amount which, in any of the last three fiscal years, exceeds the greater of $200 thousand, or 5 percent of such entity's consolidated gross revenues. This would include payments made by the institution or any of its affiliates to not-for-profit entities where the director is an executive officer or where an immediate family member of the director is an executive officer.</P>
            <P>(8) For purposes of paragraph (b) of this guideline:</P>
            <P>(i) An “immediate family member” includes a person's spouse, parents, children, siblings, mothers- and fathers-in-law, sons- and daughters-in-law, brothers- and sisters-in-law, and anyone (other than domestic employees) who shares such person's home.</P>
            <P>(ii) The term affiliate of, or a person affiliated with, a specified person, means a person or entity that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control with, the person specified.</P>
            <P>(iii) The term indirect compensation for consulting, advisory, or other services includes the acceptance of a fee for such services by a director's immediate family member or by an organization in which the director is a partner or principal that provides accounting, consulting, legal, investment banking, or financial advisory services to the institution, any of its subsidiaries, or any of its affiliates.</P>
            <P>(iv) The terms direct and indirect compensation and payments do not include payments such as dividends arising solely from investments in the institution's equity securities, provided the same per share amounts are paid to all shareholders of that class; interest income from investments in the institution's deposit accounts and debt securities; loans from the institution that conform to all regulatory requirements applicable to such loans except that interest payments or other fees paid in association with such loans would be considered payments; and payments under non-discretionary charitable contribution matching programs.</P>
            <P>(c) An insured depository institution that is a public company and a listed issuer (as defined in Rule 10A-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act)), or is a subsidiary of a public company that meets the criterion specified in § 363.1(b)(1) and is a listed issuer, may choose to use the definition of audit committee member independence set forth in the listing standards applicable to the public institution or its public company parent for purposes of determining whether an outside director is “independent of management.”</P>

            <P>(d) All other insured depository institutions may choose to use the definition of audit committee member independence set forth in the listing standards of a national securities exchange that is registered with the SEC pursuant to section 6 of the Exchange Act or a national securities association that is registered with the SEC pursuant to section 15A(a) of the Exchange Act for <PRTPAGE P="209"/>purposes of determining whether an outside director is “independent of management.”</P>
            <P>29. [Reserved]</P>
            <P>30. <E T="03">Holding Company Audit Committees.</E> (a) When an insured depository institution satisfies the requirements for the holding company exception specified in §§ 363.1(b)(1) and (2), the audit committee requirement of this part may be satisfied by the audit committee of the top-tier or any mid-tier holding company. Members of the audit committee of the holding company should meet all the membership requirements applicable to the largest subsidiary depository institution subject to part 363 and should perform all the duties of the audit committee of a subsidiary institution subject to part 363, even if the holding company directors are not directors of the institution.</P>
            <P>(b) When an insured depository institution subsidiary with total assets of $1 billion or more as of the beginning of its fiscal year does not meet the requirements for the holding company exception specified in §§ 363.1(b)(1) and (2) or maintains its own separate audit committee to satisfy the requirements of this part, the members of the audit committee of the top-tier or any mid-tier holding company may serve on the audit committee of the subsidiary institution if they are otherwise independent of management of the subsidiary institution, and, if applicable, meet any other requirements for a large subsidiary institution covered by this part.</P>
            <P>(c) When an insured depository institution with total assets of $500 million or more but less than $1 billion as of the beginning of its fiscal year does not meet the requirements for the holding company exception specified in §§ 363.1(b)(1) and (2) or maintains its own separate audit committee to satisfy the requirements of this part, the members of the audit committee of the top-tier or any mid-tier holding company may serve on the audit committee of the subsidiary institution provided a majority of the institution's audit committee members are independent of management of the subsidiary institution.</P>
            <P>(d) Officers and employees of a top-tier or any mid-tier holding company may not serve on the audit committee of a subsidiary institution subject to part 363.</P>
            <P>31. <E T="03">Duties.</E> The audit committee should perform all duties determined by the institution's board of directors and it should maintain minutes and other relevant records of its meetings and decisions. The duties of the audit committee should be appropriate to the size of the institution and the complexity of its operations, and, at a minimum, should include the appointment, compensation, and oversight of the independent public accountant; reviewing with management and the independent public accountant the basis for their respective reports issued under §§ 363.2(a) and (b) and §§ 363.3(a) and (b); reviewing and satisfying itself as to the independent public accountant's compliance with the required qualifications for independent public accountants set forth in §§ 363.3(f) and (g) and guidelines 13 through 16; ensuring that audit engagement letters comply with the provisions of § 363.5(c) before engaging an independent public accountant; being familiar with the notice requirements in § 363.4(d) and guideline 20 regarding the selection, change, or termination of an independent public accountant; and ensuring that management sends a copy of any notice required under § 363.4(d) to the independent public accountant when it is filed with the FDIC. Appropriate additional duties could include:</P>
            <P>(a) Reviewing with management and the independent public accountant the scope of services required by the audit, significant accounting policies, and audit conclusions regarding significant accounting estimates;</P>
            <P>(b) Reviewing with management and the accountant their assessments of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, and the resolution of identified material weaknesses and significant deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, including the prevention or detection of management override or compromise of the internal control system;</P>
            <P>(c) Reviewing with management the institution's compliance with the Designated Laws and Regulations identified in guideline 7A;</P>
            <P>(d) Discussing with management and the independent public accountant any significant disagreements between management and the independent public accountant; and</P>
            <P>(e) Overseeing the internal audit function.</P>
            <P>32. <E T="03">Banking or Related Financial Management Expertise.</E> At least two members of the audit committee of a large institution shall have “banking or related financial management expertise” as required by section 36(g)(1)(C)(i). This determination is to be made by the board of directors of the insured depository institution. A person will be considered to have such required expertise if the person has significant executive, professional, educational, or regulatory experience in financial, auditing, accounting, or banking matters as determined by the board of directors. Significant experience as an officer or member of the board of directors or audit committee of a financial services company would satisfy these criteria. A person who has the attributes of an “audit committee financial expert” as set forth in the SEC's rules would also satisfy these criteria.</P>
            <P>33. <E T="03">Large Customers.</E> Any individual or entity (including a controlling person of any such entity) which, in the determination of the board of directors, has such significant direct or indirect credit or other relationships with the institution, the termination <PRTPAGE P="210"/>of which likely would materially and adversely affect the institution's financial condition or results of operations, should be considered a “large customer” for purposes of § 363.5(b).</P>
            <P>34. <E T="03">Access to Counsel.</E> The audit committee should be able to retain counsel at its discretion without prior permission of the institution's board of directors or its management. Section 36 does not preclude advice from the institution's internal counsel or regular outside counsel. It also does not require retaining or consulting counsel, but if the committee elects to do either, it also may elect to consider issues affecting the counsel's independence. Such issues would include whether to retain or consult only counsel not concurrently representing the institution or any affiliate, and whether to place limitations on any counsel representing the institution concerning matters in which such counsel previously participated personally and substantially as outside counsel to the committee.</P>

            </P>
            <P>(a) When an insured depository institution's total assets as of the beginning of its fiscal year are $500 million or more for the first time and it thereby becomes subject to part 363, no regulatory action will be taken if the institution (1) develops and approves a set of written criteria for determining whether a director who is to serve on the audit committee is an outside director and is independent of management and (2) forms or restructures its audit committee to comply with § 363.5(a)(2) by the end of that fiscal year.</P>
            <P>(b) When an insured depository institution's total assets as of the beginning of its fiscal year are $1 billion or more for the first time, no regulatory action will be taken if the institution forms or restructures its audit committee to comply with § 363.5(a)(1) by the end of that fiscal year, provided that the composition of its audit committee meets the requirements specified in § 363.5(a)(2) at the beginning of that fiscal year, if such requirements were applicable.</P>
            <P>(c) When an insured depository institution's total assets as of the beginning of its fiscal year are $3 billion or more for the first time, no regulatory action will be taken if the institution forms or restructures its audit committee to comply with § 363.5(b) by the end of that fiscal year, provided that the composition of its audit committee meets the requirements specified in § 363.5(a)(1) at the beginning of that fiscal year, if such requirements were applicable.</P>

            <P>1. <E T="03">General.</E> The reporting scenarios, illustrative management reports, and the cover letter (when complying at the holding company level) in Appendix B to part 363 are intended to assist managements of insured depository institutions in complying with the annual reporting requirements of § 363.2 and guideline 3, <E T="03">Compliance by Holding Company Subsidiaries,</E> of Appendix A to part 363. However, use of the illustrative management reports and cover letter is not required. The managements of insured depository institutions are encouraged to tailor the wording of their management reports and cover letters <PRTPAGE P="212"/>to fit their particular circumstances, especially when reporting on material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting or noncompliance with designated laws and regulations. Terms that are not explained in Appendix B have the meanings given them in part 363, the FDI Act, or professional accounting and auditing literature. Instructions to the preparer of the management reports are shown in brackets within the illustrative reports.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Reporting Scenarios for Institutions that are Holding Company Subsidiaries.</E> (a) Subject to the criteria specified in § 363.1(b), an insured depository institution that is a subsidiary of a holding company has flexibility in satisfying the reporting requirements of part 363. When reporting at the holding company level, the management report, or the individual components thereof, should identify those subsidiary institutions that are subject to part 363 and the extent to which they are included in the scope of the management report or a component of the report. The following reporting scenarios reflect how an insured depository institution that meets the criteria set forth in § 363.1(b) could satisfy the annual reporting requirements of § 363.2. Other reporting scenarios are possible.</P>
            <P>(i) An institution that is a subsidiary of a holding company may satisfy the requirements for audited financial statements; management's statement of responsibilities; management's assessment of the institution's compliance with the Federal laws and regulations pertaining to insider loans and the Federal and, if applicable, State laws and regulations pertaining to dividend restrictions; management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, if applicable; and the independent public accountant's attestation on management's assertion as to the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, if applicable, at the insured depository institution level.</P>
            <P>(ii) An institution that is a subsidiary of a holding company may satisfy the requirements for audited financial statements; management's statement of responsibilities; management's assessment of the institution's compliance with the Federal laws and regulations pertaining to insider loans and the Federal and, if applicable, State laws and regulations pertaining to dividend restrictions; management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, if applicable; and the independent public accountant's attestation on management's assertion as to the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, if applicable, at the holding company level.</P>
            <P>(iii) An institution that is a subsidiary of a holding company may satisfy the requirement for audited financial statements at the holding company level and may satisfy the requirements for management's statement of responsibilities; management's assessment of the institution's compliance with the Federal laws and regulations pertaining to insider loans and the Federal and, if applicable, State laws and regulations pertaining to dividend restrictions; management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, if applicable; and the independent public accountant's attestation on management's assertion as to the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, if applicable, at the insured depository institution level.</P>
            <P>(iv) An institution that is a subsidiary of a holding company may satisfy the requirements for audited financial statements; management's statement of responsibilities; and management's assessment of the institution's compliance with the Federal laws and regulations pertaining to insider loans and the Federal and, if applicable, State laws and regulations pertaining to dividend restrictions at the insured depository institution level and may satisfy the requirements for the assessment by management of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, if applicable; and the independent public accountant's attestation on management's assertion as to the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, if applicable, at the holding company level.</P>

            <P>(b) For an institution with total assets of $1 billion or more as of the beginning of its fiscal year, the assessment by management of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and the independent public accountant's attestation on management's assertion as to the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, if applicable, must both be performed at the same level, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> either at the insured depository institution level or at the holding company level.</P>

            <P>(c) Financial statements prepared for regulatory reporting purposes encompass the schedules equivalent to the basic financial statements in an institution's appropriate regulatory report, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> the bank Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Call Report) and the Thrift Financial Report (TFR). Guideline 4A in Appendix A to part 363 identifies the schedules equivalent to the basic financial statements in the Call Report and TFR. When internal control assessments and attestations are performed at the holding company level, the FDIC believes that holding companies have flexibility in interpreting “financial reporting” as it relates to “regulatory reporting” and has not objected to several reporting approaches employed by holding companies to cover “regulatory reporting.” Certain holding companies have had management's assessment and the accountant's attestation cover the schedules equivalent to the basic financial statements <PRTPAGE P="213"/>that are included in the appropriate regulatory report, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> Call Report and the TFR, of each subsidiary institution subject to part 363. Other holding companies have had management's assessment and the accountant's attestation cover the schedules equivalent to the basic financial statements that are included in the holding company's year-end regulatory report (FR Y-9C report) to the Federal Reserve Board.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Introduction</HD>
            <P>i. Section 39 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act <SU>1</SU> (FDI Act) requires each Federal banking agency (collectively, the agencies) to establish certain safety and soundness standards by regulation or by guidelines for all insured depository institutions. Under section 39, the agencies must establish three types of standards: (1) Operational and managerial standards; (2) compensation standards; and (3) such standards relating to asset quality, earnings, and stock valuation as they determine to be appropriate.</P>
            <P>ii. Section 39(a) requires the agencies to establish operational and managerial standards relating to: (1) Internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems, in accordance with section 36 of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1831m); (2) loan documentation; (3) credit underwriting; (4) interest rate exposure; (5) asset growth; and (6) compensation, fees, and benefits, in accordance with subsection (c) of section 39. Section 39(b) requires the agencies to establish standards relating to asset quality, earnings, and stock valuation that the agencies determine to be appropriate.</P>
            <P>iii. Section 39(c) requires the agencies to establish standards prohibiting as an unsafe and unsound practice any compensatory arrangement that would provide any executive officer, employee, director, or principal shareholder of the institution with excessive compensation, fees or benefits and any compensatory arrangement that could lead to material financial loss to an institution. Section 39(c) also requires that the agencies establish standards that specify when compensation is excessive.</P>
            <P>iv. If an agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard established by guidelines under subsection (a) or (b) of section 39, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. In the event that an institution fails to submit an acceptable plan within the time allowed by the agency or fails in any material respect to implement an accepted plan, the agency must, by order, require the institution to correct the deficiency. The agency may, and in some cases must, take other supervisory actions until the deficiency has been corrected.</P>
            <P>v. The agencies have adopted amendments to their rules and regulations to establish deadlines for submission and review of compliance plans.<SU>2</SU>
            </P>
            <P>vi. The following Guidelines set out the safety and soundness standards that the agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. The agencies believe that the standards adopted in these Guidelines serve this end without dictating how institutions must be managed and operated. These standards are designed to identify potential safety and soundness concerns and ensure that action is taken to address those concerns before they pose a risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Preservation of Existing Authority</HD>
            <P>Neither section 39 nor these Guidelines in any way limits the authority of the agencies to address unsafe or unsound practices, violations of law, unsafe or unsound conditions, or other practices. Action under section 39 and these Guidelines may be taken independently of, in conjunction with, or in addition to any other enforcement action available to the agencies. Nothing in these Guidelines limits the authority of the FDIC pursuant to section 38(i)(2)(F) of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1831o) and part 324 of title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations.</P>

            <P>4. <E T="03">Director</E> shall have the meaning described in 12 CFR 215.2(d).<SU>3</SU>

            <P>4. Demonstrate appropriate administration and monitoring of a loan; and</P>

            <P>2. Consider the nature of the markets in which loans will be made;</P>
            <P>3.

            <P>2. Provide for periodic reporting to management and the board of directors regarding interest rate risk with adequate information for management and the board of directors to assess the level of risk.</P>
            <P>F. <E T="03">Asset growth.</E> An institution's asset growth should be prudent and consider:</P>
            <P>1. The source, volatility and use of the funds that support asset growth;</P>
            <P>2. Any increase in credit risk or interest rate risk as a result of growth; and</P>
            <P>3. The effect of growth on the institution's capital.</P>
            <P>G. <E T="03">Asset quality.</E> An insured depository institution should establish and maintain a system that is commensurate with the institution's size and the nature and scope of its operations to identify problem assets and prevent deterioration in those assets. The institution should:<PRTPAGE P="225"/>

            <P>I. <E T="03">Compensation, fees and benefits.</E> An institution should maintain safeguards to prevent the payment of compensation, fees, and benefits that are excessive or that could lead to material financial loss to the institution.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Prohibition on Compensation That Constitutes an Unsafe and Unsound Practice</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Excessive Compensation</HD>
            <P>Excessive compensation is prohibited as an unsafe and unsound practice.

            <P>2. The compensation history of the individual and other individuals with comparable expertise at the institution;</P>

            <P>4. Comparable compensation practices at comparable institutions, based upon such factors as asset size, geographic location, and the complexity of the loan portfolio or other assets;</P>
            <P>5. For postemployment benefits, the projected total cost and benefit to the institution;</P>
            <P>6. Any connection between the individual and any fraudulent act or omission, breach of trust or fiduciary duty, or insider abuse with regard to the institution; and</P>
            <P>7. Any other factors the agencies determine to be relevant.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Introduction</HD>
            <P>The Interagency Guidelines Establishing Information Security Standards (Guidelines) set forth standards pursuant to section 39 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1831p-1, and sections 501 and 505(b), 15 U.S.C. 6801 and 6805(b), of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. These Guidelines address standards for developing and implementing administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity of customer information. These Guidelines also address standards with respect to the proper disposal of consumer information pursuant to sections 621 and 628 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681s and 1681w).</P>
            <P>A. <E T="03">Scope.</E> The Guidelines apply to customer information maintained by or on behalf of, and to the disposal of consumer information by or on the behalf of, entities over which the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has authority. Such entities, referred to as “insured depository institution” or “institution” are banks insured by the FDIC (other than members of the Federal Reserve System), state savings associations insured by the FDIC, insured state branches of foreign banks, and any subsidiaries of such entities (except brokers, dealers, persons providing insurance, investment companies, and investment advisers).</P>
            <P>B. <E T="03">Preservation of Existing Authority.</E> Neither section 39 nor these Guidelines in any way limit the authority of the FDIC to address unsafe or unsound practices, violations of law, unsafe or unsound conditions, or other practices. The FDIC may take action under section 39 and these Guidelines independently of, in conjunction with, or in addition to, any other enforcement action available to the FDIC.</P>
            <P>C. <E T="03">Definitions.</E> 1. Except as modified in the Guidelines, or unless the context otherwise requires, the terms used in these Guidelines have the same meanings as set forth in sections 3 and 39 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813 and 1831p-1).</P>
            <P>2. For purposes of the Guidelines, the following definitions apply:</P>
            <P>a. <E T="03">Board of directors</E>, in the case of a branch or agency of a foreign bank, means the managing official in charge of the branch or agency.</P>
            <P>b. <E T="03">Consumer Information</E> means any record about an individual, whether in paper, electronic, or other form, that is a consumer report or is derived from a consumer report and that is maintained or otherwise possessed by or on behalf of the institution for a business purpose. Consumer information also means a compilation of such records. The term does not include any record that does not personally identify an individual.</P>
            <P>i. <E T="03">Examples:</E> (1) <E T="03">Consumer information</E> includes:</P>
            <P>(A) A consumer report that an institution obtains;</P>
            <P>(B) information from a consumer report that the institution obtains from its affiliate after the consumer has been given a notice and has elected not to opt out of that sharing;</P>
            <P>(C) information from a consumer report that the institution obtains about an individual who applies for but does not receive a loan, including any loan sought by an individual for a business purpose;</P>
            <P>(D) information from a consumer report that the institution obtains about an individual who guarantees a loan (including a loan to a business entity); or</P>
            <P>(E) information from a consumer report that the institution obtains about an employee or prospective employee.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Consumer information</E> does not include:</P>
            <P>(A) aggregate information, such as the mean score, derived from a group of consumer reports; or</P>
            <P>(B) blind data, such as payment history on accounts that are not personally identifiable, that may be used for developing credit scoring models or for other purposes.</P>
            <P>c. <E T="03">Consumer report</E> has the same meaning as set forth in the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. 1681a(d).</P>
            <P>d. <E T="03">Customer</E> means any customer of the institution as defined in § 332.3(h) of this chapter.</P>
            <P>e. <E T="03">Customer information</E> means any record containing nonpublic personal information, as defined in § 332.3(n) of this chapter, about a customer, whether in paper, electronic, or other form, that is maintained by or on behalf of the institution.</P>
            <P>f. <E T="03">Customer information systems</E> means any methods used to access, collect, store, use, transmit, protect, or dispose of customer information.</P>
            <P>g. <E T="03">Service provider</E> means any person or entity that maintains, processes, or otherwise is permitted access to customer information or consumer information through its provision of services directly to the institution.</P>

            <P>4. Ensure the proper disposal of customer information and consumer information.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Development and Implementation of Information Security Program</HD>
            <P>A. <E T="03">Involve the Board of Directors.</E> The board of directors or an appropriate committee of the board of each insured depository institution shall:</P>
            <P>1. Approve the institution's written information security program; and</P>
            <P>2. Oversee the development, implementation, and maintenance of the institution's information security program, including assigning specific responsibility for its implementation and reviewing reports from management.</P>
            <P>B. <E T="03">Assess Risk.</E>
            </P>
            <P>Each institution shall:</P>
            <P>1. Identify reasonably foreseeable internal and external threats that could result in unauthorized disclosure, misuse, alteration, or destruction of customer information or customer information systems.</P>
            <P>2. Assess the likelihood and potential damage of these threats, taking into consideration the sensitivity of customer information.</P>
            <P>3. Assess the sufficiency of policies, procedures, customer information systems, and other arrangements in place to control risks.</P>

            <P>1. Design its information security program to control the identified risks, commensurate with the sensitivity of the information as well as the complexity and scope of the institution's activities. Each institution must consider whether the following security measures are appropriate for the institution and, if so, adopt those measures the institution concludes are appropriate:</P>
            <P>a. Access controls on customer information systems, including controls to authenticate and permit access only to authorized individuals and controls to prevent employees from providing customer information to unauthorized individuals who may seek to obtain this information through fraudulent means.</P>
            <P>b. Access restrictions at physical locations containing customer information, such as buildings, computer facilities, and records storage facilities to permit access only to authorized individuals;</P>
            <P>c. Encryption of electronic customer information, including while in transit or in storage on networks or systems to which unauthorized individuals may have access;</P>
            <P>d. Procedures designed to ensure that customer information system modifications are consistent with the institution's information security program;</P>
            <P>e. Dual control procedures, segregation of duties, and employee background checks for employees with responsibilities for or access to customer information;</P>

            <P>2. Train staff to implement the institution's information security program.</P>
            <P>3. Regularly test the key controls, systems and procedures of the information security program. The frequency and nature of such tests should be determined by the institution's risk assessment. Tests should be conducted or reviewed by independent third parties or staff independent of those that develop or maintain the security programs.</P>
            <P>4. Develop, implement, and maintain, as part of its information security program, appropriate measures to properly dispose of customer information and consumer information in accordance with each of the requirements of this paragraph III.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Supplement A to Appendix B to Part 364 Interagency Guidance on Response Programs for Unauthorized Access to Customer Information and Customer Notice</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background</HD>
            <P>This Guidance <SU>1</SU> interprets section 501(b) of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) and the Interagency Guidelines Establishing Information Security Standards (the Security Guidelines) <SU>2</SU> and describes response programs, including customer notification procedures, that a financial institution should develop and implement to address unauthorized access to or use of customer information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to a customer. The scope of, and definitions of terms used in, this Guidance are identical to those of the Security Guidelines. For example, the term “customer information” is the same term used in the Security Guidelines, and means any record containing nonpublic personal information about a customer, whether in paper, electronic, or other form, maintained by or on behalf of the institution.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Interagency Security Guidelines</HD>
            <P>Section 501(b) of the GLBA required the Agencies to establish appropriate standards for financial institutions subject to their jurisdiction that include administrative, technical, and physical safeguards, to protect the security and confidentiality of customer information. Accordingly, the Agencies issued Security Guidelines requiring every financial institution to have an information security program designed to:</P>
            <P>1. Ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information;</P>
            <P>2. Protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information; and</P>
            <P>3. Protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Risk Assessment and Controls</HD>
            <P>1. The Security Guidelines direct every financial institution to assess the following risks, among others, when developing its information security program:</P>
            <P>a. Reasonably foreseeable internal and external threats that could result in unauthorized disclosure, misuse, alteration, or destruction of customer information or customer information systems;</P>
            <P>b. The likelihood and potential damage of threats, taking into consideration the sensitivity of customer information; and</P>
            <P>c. The sufficiency of policies, procedures, customer information systems, and other arrangements in place to control risks.<SU>3</SU>
            </P>

            <P>2. Following the assessment of these risks, the Security Guidelines require a financial institution to design a program to address the identified risks. The particular security measures an institution should adopt will depend upon the risks presented by the complexity and scope of its business. At a minimum, the financial institution is required to consider the specific security measures enumerated in the Security Guidelines,<SU>4</SU> and <PRTPAGE P="229"/>adopt those that are appropriate for the institution, including:</P>
            <P>a. Access controls on customer information systems, including controls to authenticate and permit access only to authorized individuals and controls to prevent employees from providing customer information to unauthorized individuals who may seek to obtain this information through fraudulent means;</P>
            <P>b. Background checks for employees with responsibilities for access to customer information; and</P>
            <P>c. Response programs that specify actions to be taken when the financial institution suspects or detects that unauthorized individuals have gained access to customer information systems, including appropriate reports to regulatory and law enforcement agencies.<SU>5</SU>
            </P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Service Providers</HD>
            <P>The Security Guidelines direct every financial institution to require its service providers by contract to implement appropriate measures designed to protect against unauthorized access to or use of customer information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customers.<SU>6</SU>
            </P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Response Program</HD>
            <P>Millions of Americans, throughout the country, have been victims of identity theft.<SU>7</SU> Identity thieves misuse personal information they obtain from a number of sources, including financial institutions, to perpetrate identity theft. Therefore, financial institutions should take preventative measures to safeguard customer information against attempts to gain unauthorized access to the information. For example, financial institutions should place access controls on customer information systems and conduct background checks for employees who are authorized to access customer information.<SU>8</SU> However, every financial institution should also develop and implement a risk-based response program to address incidents of unauthorized access to customer information in customer information systems <SU>9</SU> that occur nonetheless. A response program should be a key part of an institution's information security program.<SU>10</SU> The program should be appropriate to the size and complexity of the institution and the nature and scope of its activities.</P>
            <P>In addition, each institution should be able to address incidents of unauthorized access to customer information in customer information systems maintained by its domestic and foreign service providers. Therefore, consistent with the obligations in the Guidelines that relate to these arrangements, and with existing guidance on this topic issued by the Agencies,<SU>11</SU> an institution's contract with its service provider should require the service provider to take appropriate actions to address incidents of unauthorized access to the financial institution's customer information, including notification to the institution as soon as possible of any such incident, to enable the institution to expeditiously implement its response program.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Components of a Response Program</HD>
            <P>1. At a minimum, an institution's response program should contain procedures for the following:</P>
            <P>a. Assessing the nature and scope of an incident, and identifying what customer information systems and types of customer information have been accessed or misused;</P>

            <P>b. Notifying its primary Federal regulator as soon as possible when the institution becomes aware of an incident involving unauthorized access to or use of <E T="03">sensitive</E> customer information, as defined below;</P>
            <P>c. Consistent with the Agencies' Suspicious Activity Report (“SAR”) regulations,<SU>12</SU> notifying appropriate law enforcement authorities, in addition to filing a timely SAR in situations involving Federal criminal violations requiring immediate attention, such as when a reportable violation is ongoing;</P>
            <P>d. Taking appropriate steps to contain and control the incident to prevent further unauthorized access to or use of customer information, for example, by monitoring, freezing, or closing affected accounts, while preserving records and other evidence; <SU>13</SU> and</P>
            <P>e. Notifying customers when warranted.</P>
            <P>2. Where an incident of unauthorized access to customer information involves customer information systems maintained by an institution's service providers, it is the responsibility of the financial institution to notify the institution's customers and regulator. However, an institution may authorize or contract with its service provider to notify the institutions' customers or regulator on its behalf.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Customer Notice</HD>

            <P>Financial institutions have an affirmative duty to protect their customers' information against unauthorized access or use. Notifying customers of a security incident involving the unauthorized access or use of the customer's information in accordance with the standard set forth below is a key part of that duty. Timely notification of customers is important to manage an institution's reputation risk. Effective notice also may reduce an institution's legal risk, assist in maintaining good customer relations, and enable the institution's customers to take steps to protect themselves against the consequences of identity theft. When customer notification is warranted, an institution may not forgo notifying its customers of an incident because the institution believes that it <PRTPAGE P="230"/>may be potentially embarrassed or inconvenienced by doing so.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Standard for Providing Notice</HD>
            <P>When a financial institution becomes aware of an incident of unauthorized access to sensitive customer information, the institution should conduct a reasonable investigation to promptly determine the likelihood that the information has been or will be misused. If the institution determines that misuse of its information about a customer has occurred or is reasonably possible, it should notify the affected customer as soon as possible. Customer notice may be delayed if an appropriate law enforcement agency determines that notification will interfere with a criminal investigation and provides the institution with a written request for the delay. However, the institution should notify its customers as soon as notification will no longer interfere with the investigation.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Sensitive Customer Information</HD>

            <P>Under the Guidelines, an institution must protect against unauthorized access to or use of customer information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. Substantial harm or inconvenience is most likely to result from improper access to <E T="03">sensitive customer information</E> because this type of information is most likely to be misused, as in the commission of identity theft. For purposes of this Guidance, <E T="03">sensitive customer information</E> means a customer's name, address, or telephone number, in conjunction with the customer's social security number, driver's license number, account number, credit or debit card number, or a personal identification number or password that would permit access to the customer's account. <E T="03">Sensitive customer information</E> also includes any combination of components of customer information that would allow someone to log onto or access the customer's account, such as user name or password or password and account number.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Affected Customers</HD>
            <P>If a financial institution, based upon its investigation, can determine from its logs or other data precisely which customers' information has been improperly accessed, it may limit notification to those customers with regard to whom the institution determines that misuse of their information has occurred or is reasonably possible. However, there may be situations where the institution determines that a group of files has been accessed improperly, but is unable to identify which specific customers' information has been accessed. If the circumstances of the unauthorized access lead the institution to determine that misuse of the information is reasonably possible, it should notify all customers in the group.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Content of Customer Notice</HD>
            <P>1. Customer notice should be given in a clear and conspicuous manner. The notice should describe the incident in general terms and the type of customer information that was the subject of unauthorized access or use. It also should generally describe what the institution has done to protect the customers' information from further unauthorized access. In addition, it should include a telephone number that customers can call for further information and assistance.<SU>14</SU> The notice also should remind customers of the need to remain vigilant over the next twelve to twenty-four months, and to promptly report incidents of suspected identify theft to the institution. The notice should include the following additional items, when appropriate:</P>
            <P>a. A recommendation that the customer review account statements and immediately report any suspicious activity to the institution;</P>
            <P>b. A description of fraud alerts and an explanation of how the customer may place a fraud alert in the customer's consumer reports to put the customer's creditors on notice that the customer may be a victim of fraud;</P>
            <P>c. A recommendation that the customer periodically obtain credit reports from each nationwide credit reporting agency and have information relating to fraudulent transactions deleted;</P>
            <P>d. An explanation of how the customer may obtain a credit report free of charge; and</P>
            <P>e. Information about the availability of the FTC's online guidance regarding steps a consumer can take to protect against identity theft. The notice should encourage the customer to report any incidents of identity theft to the FTC, and should provide the FTC's Web site address and toll-free telephone number that customers may use to obtain the identity theft guidance and report suspected incidents of identity theft.<SU>15</SU>
            </P>
            <P>2. The Agencies encourage financial institutions to notify the nationwide consumer reporting agencies prior to sending notices to a large number of customers that include contact information for the reporting agencies.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Delivery of Customer Notice</HD>

            <P>Customer notice should be delivered in any manner designed to ensure that a customer can reasonably be expected to receive it. For example, the institution may choose to contact all customers affected by telephone or by mail, or by electronic mail for those customers for whom it has a valid email address <PRTPAGE P="231"/>and who have agreed to receive communications electronically.
            </P>

              <P>The agencies' regulations require that each insured depository institution adopt and maintain a written policy that establishes appropriate limits and standards for all extensions of credit that are secured by liens on or interests in real estate or made for the purpose of financing the construction of a building or other improvements. <SU>5</SU>

                <P>
                  <SU>5</SU> The agencies have adopted a uniform rule on real estate lending. See 12 CFR part 365 (FDIC); 12 CFR part 208, subpart C (FRB); 12 CFR part 34, subpart D (OCC); and 12 CFR 563.100-101 (OTS).</P>
              </FTNT>
              <P>Each institution's policies must be comprehensive, and consistent with safe and sound lending practices, and must ensure that the institution operates within limits and according to standards that are reviewed and approved at least annually by the board of directors. Real estate lending is an integral part of many institutions' business plans and, when undertaken in a prudent manner, will not be subject to examiner criticism.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Loan Portfolio Management Considerations</HD>
              <P>The lending policy should contain a general outline of the scope and distribution of the institution's credit facilities and the manner in which real estate loans are made, serviced, and collected. In particular, the institution's policies on real estate lending should:</P>
              <P>• Identify the geographic areas in which the institution will consider lending.</P>
              <P>• Establish a loan portfolio diversification policy and set limits for real estate loans by type and geographic market (e.g., limits on higher risk loans).</P>

              <P>• Identify appropriate terms and conditions by type of real estate loan.<PRTPAGE P="233"/>
              </P>
              <P>• Establish loan origination and approval procedures, both generally and by size and type of loan.</P>
              <P>• Establish prudent underwriting standards that are clear and measurable, including loan-to-value limits, that are consistent with these supervisory guidelines.</P>
              <P>• Establish review and approval procedures for exception loans, including loans with loan-to-value percentages in excess of supervisory limits.</P>
              <P>• Establish loan administration procedures, including documentation, disbursement, collateral inspection, collection, and loan review.</P>
              <P>• Establish real estate appraisal and evaluation programs.</P>

              <P>• Require that management monitor the loan portfolio and provide timely and adequate reports to the board of directors.
              </P>
              <P>The institution should consider both internal and external factors in the formulation of its loan policies and strategic plan. Factors that should be considered include:</P>
              <P>• The size and financial condition of the institution.</P>
              <P>• The expertise and size of the lending staff.</P>
              <P>• The need to avoid undue concentrations of risk.</P>
              <P>• Compliance with all real estate related laws and regulations, including the Community Reinvestment Act, anti-discrimination laws, and for savings associations, the Qualified Thrift Lender test.</P>
              <P>• Market conditions.
              </P>
              <P>The institution should monitor conditions in the real estate markets in its lending area so that it can react quickly to changes in market conditions that are relevant to its lending decisions. Market supply and demand factors that should be considered include:</P>
              <P>• Demographic indicators, including population and employment trends.</P>
              <P>• Zoning requirements.</P>
              <P>• Current and projected vacancy, construction, and absorption rates.</P>

              </P>
              <P>The lending policies should reflect the level of risk that is acceptable to the board of directors and provide clear and measurable underwriting standards that enable the institution's lending staff to evaluate these credit factors. The underwriting standards should address:</P>
              <P>• The maximum loan amount by type of property.</P>
              <P>• Maximum loan maturities by type of property.</P>

                  <SU>2</SU> A loan-to-value limit has not been established for permanent mortgage or home equity loans on owner-occupied, 1- to 4-family residential property. However, for any such loan with a loan-to-value ratio that equals or exceeds 90 percent at origination, an institution should require appropriate credit enhancement in the form of either mortgage insurance or readily marketable collateral.</TNOTE>
              </GPOTABLE>
              <P>The supervisory loan-to-value limits should be applied to the underlying property that collateralizes the loan. For loans that fund multiple phases of the same real estate project (e.g., a loan for both land development and construction of an office building), the appropriate loan-to-value limit is the limit applicable to the final phase of the project funded by the loan; however, loan disbursements should not exceed actual development or construction outlays. In situations where a loan is fully cross-collateralized by two or more properties or is secured by a collateral pool of two or more properties, the appropriate maximum loan amount under supervisory loan-to-value limits is the sum of the value of each property, less senior liens, multiplied by the appropriate loan-to-value limit for each property. To ensure that collateral margins remain within the supervisory limits, lenders should redetermine conformity whenever collateral substitutions are made to the collateral pool.</P>
              <P>In establishing internal loan-to-value limits, each lender is expected to carefully consider the institution-specific and market factors listed under “Loan Portfolio Management Considerations,” as well as any other relevant factors, such as the particular subcategory or type of loan. For any subcategory of loans that exhibits greater credit risk than the overall category, a lender should consider the establishment of an internal loan-to-value limit for that subcategory that is lower than the limit for the overall category.</P>
              <P>The loan-to-value ratio is only one of several pertinent credit factors to be considered when underwriting a real estate loan. Other credit factors to be taken into account are highlighted in the “Underwriting Standards” section above. Because of these other factors, the establishment of these supervisory limits should not be interpreted to mean that loans at these levels will automatically be considered sound.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Loans in Excess of the Supervisory Loan-to-Value Limits</HD>
              <P>The agencies recognize that appropriate loan-to-value limits vary not only among categories of real estate loans but also among individual loans. Therefore, it may be appropriate in individual cases to originate or purchase loans with loan-to-value ratios in excess of the supervisory loan-to-value limits, based on the support provided by other credit factors. Such loans should be identified in the institution's records, and their aggregate amount reported at least quarterly to the institution's board of directors. (See additional reporting requirements described under “Exceptions to the General Policy.”)</P>
              <P>The aggregate amount of all loans in excess of the supervisory loan-to-value limits should not exceed 100 percent of total capital. <SU>2</SU>
                <FTREF/> Moreover, within the aggregate limit, total loans for all commercial, agricultural, multifamily or other non-1-to-4 family residential properties should not exceed 30 percent of total capital. An institution will come under increased supervisory scrutiny as the total of such loans approaches these levels.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Excluded Transactions</HD>

              <P>The agencies also recognize that there are a number of lending situations in which other factors significantly outweigh the need to apply the supervisory loan-to-value limits. These include:<PRTPAGE P="235"/>
              </P>
              <P>• Loans guaranteed or insured by the U.S. government or its agencies, provided that the amount of the guaranty or insurance is at least equal to the portion of the loan that exceeds the supervisory loan-to-value limit.</P>
              <P>• Loans backed by the full faith and credit of a state government, provided that the amount of the assurance is at least equal to the portion of the loan that exceeds the supervisory loan-to-value limit.</P>
              <P>• Loans guaranteed or insured by a state, municipal or local government, or an agency thereof, provided that the amount of the guaranty or insurance is at least equal to the portion of the loan that exceeds the supervisory loan-to-value limit, and provided that the lender has determined that the guarantor or insurer has the financial capacity and willingness to perform under the terms of the guaranty or insurance agreement.</P>
              <P>• Loans that are to be sold promptly after origination, without recourse, to a financially responsible third party.</P>
              <P>• Loans that are renewed, refinanced, or restructured without the advancement of new funds or an increase in the line of credit (except for reasonable closing costs), or loans that are renewed, refinanced, or restructured in connection with a workout situation, either with or without the advancement of new funds, where consistent with safe and sound banking practices and part of a clearly defined and well-documented program to achieve orderly liquidation of the debt, reduce risk of loss, or maximize recovery on the loan.</P>
              <P>• Loans that facilitate the sale of real estate acquired by the lender in the ordinary course of collecting a debt previously contracted in good faith.</P>
              <P>• Loans for which a lien on or interest in real property is taken as additional collateral through an abundance of caution by the lender (e.g., the institution takes a blanket lien on all or substantially all of the assets of the borrower, and the value of the real property is low relative to the aggregate value of all other collateral).</P>
              <P>• Loans, such as working capital loans, where the lender does not rely principally on real estate as security and the extension of credit is not used to acquire, develop, or construct permanent improvements on real property.</P>
              <P>• Loans for the purpose of financing permanent improvements to real property, but not secured by the property, if such security interest is not required by prudent underwriting practice.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Exceptions to the General Lending Policy</HD>
              <P>Some provision should be made for the consideration of loan requests from creditworthy borrowers whose credit needs do not fit within the institution's general lending policy. An institution may provide for prudently underwritten exceptions to its lending policies, including loan-to-value limits, on a loan-by-loan basis. However, any exceptions from the supervisory loan-to-value limits should conform to the aggregate limits on such loans discussed above.</P>
              <P>The board of directors is responsible for establishing standards for the review and approval of exception loans. Each institution should establish an appropriate internal process for the review and approval of loans that do not conform to its own internal policy standards. The approval of any such loan should be supported by a written justification that clearly sets forth all of the relevant credit factors that support the underwriting decision. The justification and approval documents for such loans should be maintained as a part of the permanent loan file. Each institution should monitor compliance with its real estate lending policy and individually report exception loans of a significant size to its board of directors.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Supervisory Review of Real Estate Lending Policies and Practices</HD>
              <P>The real estate lending policies of institutions will be evaluated by examiners during the course of their examinations to determine if the policies are consistent with safe and sound lending practices, these guidelines, and the requirements of the regulation. In evaluating the adequacy of the institution's real estate lending policies and practices, examiners will take into consideration the following factors:</P>
              <P>• The nature and scope of the institution's real estate lending activities.</P>
              <P>• The size and financial condition of the institution.</P>
              <P>• The quality of the institution's management and internal controls.</P>
              <P>• The expertise and size of the lending and loan administration staff.</P>
              <P>• Market conditions.</P>
              <P>Lending policy exception reports will also be reviewed by examiners during the course of their examinations to determine whether the institutions' exceptions are adequately documented and appropriate in light of all of the relevant credit considerations. An excessive volume of exceptions to an institution's real estate lending policy may signal a weakening of its underwriting practices, or may suggest a need to revise the loan policy.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix A to Subpart B of Part 365—Examples of Mortgage Loan Originator Activities</HD>
              <P>This Appendix provides examples to aid in the understanding of activities that would cause an employee of an insured State nonmember bank to fall within or outside the definition of mortgage loan originator. The examples in this appendix are not all inclusive. They illustrate only the issue described and do not illustrate any other issues that may arise under this subpart. For purposes of the examples below, the term “loan” refers to a residential mortgage loan.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Taking a loan application.</E> The following examples illustrate when an employee takes, or does not take, a loan application.</P>
              <P>(1) Taking an application includes: receiving information provided in connection with a request for a loan to be used to determine whether the consumer qualifies for a loan, even if the employee:</P>
              <P>(i) Has received the consumer's information indirectly in order to make an offer or negotiate a loan;</P>
              <P>(ii) Is not responsible for verifying information;</P>
              <P>(iii) Is inputting information into an online application or other automated system on behalf of the consumer; or</P>
              <P>(iv) Is not engaged in approval of the loan, including determining whether the consumer qualifies for the loan.</P>
              <P>(2) Taking an application does not include any of the following activities performed solely or in combination:</P>
              <P>(i) Contacting a consumer to verify the information in the loan application by obtaining documentation, such as tax returns or payroll receipts;</P>
              <P>(ii) Receiving a loan application through the mail and forwarding it, without review, to loan approval personnel;</P>
              <P>(iii) Assisting a consumer who is filling out an application by clarifying what type of information is necessary for the application or otherwise explaining the qualifications or criteria necessary to obtain a loan product;</P>
              <P>(iv) Describing the steps that a consumer would need to take to provide information to be used to determine whether the consumer qualifies for a loan or otherwise explaining the loan application process;</P>
              <P>(v) In response to an inquiry regarding a prequalified offer that a consumer has received from a bank, collecting only basic identifying information about the consumer and forwarding the consumer to a mortgage loan originator; or</P>
              <P>(vi) Receiving information in connection with a modification to the terms of an existing loan to a borrower as part of the bank's loss mitigation efforts when the borrower is reasonably likely to default.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Offering or negotiating terms of a loan.</E> The following examples are designed to illustrate when an employee offers or negotiates terms of a loan, and conversely, what does not constitute offering or negotiating terms of a loan.</P>
              <P>(1) Offering or negotiating the terms of a loan includes:</P>
              <P>(i) Presenting a loan offer to a consumer for acceptance, either verbally or in writing, including, but not limited to, providing a disclosure of the loan terms after application under the Truth in Lending Act, even if:</P>
              <P>(A) Further verification of information is necessary;</P>
              <P>(B) The offer is conditional;</P>
              <P>(C) Other individuals must complete the loan process; or</P>
              <P>(D) Only the rate approved by the bank's loan approval mechanism function for a specific loan product is communicated without authority to negotiate the rate.</P>
              <P>(ii) Responding to a consumer's request for a lower rate or lower points on a pending loan application by presenting to the consumer a revised loan offer, either verbally or in writing, that includes a lower interest rate or lower points than the original offer.</P>
              <P>(2) Offering or negotiating terms of a loan does not include solely or in combination:</P>

              <P>(i) Providing general explanations or descriptions in response to consumer queries regarding qualification for a specific loan product, such as explaining loan terminology (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> debt-to-income ratio); lending policies (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the loan-to-value ratio policy of the insured State nonmember bank); or product-related services;</P>
              <P>(ii) In response to a consumer's request, informing a consumer of the loan rates that are publicly available, such as on the insured State nonmember bank's Web site, for specific types of loan products without communicating to the consumer whether qualifications are met for that loan product;</P>

              <P>(iii) Collecting information about a consumer in order to provide the consumer with information on loan products for which the consumer generally may qualify, without presenting a specific loan offer to the consumer for acceptance, either verbally or in writing;<PRTPAGE P="243"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iv) Arranging the loan closing or other aspects of the loan process, including communicating with a consumer about those arrangements, provided that communication with the consumer only verifies loan terms already offered or negotiated;</P>
              <P>(v) Providing a consumer with information unrelated to loan terms, such as the best days of the month for scheduling loan closings at the bank;</P>
              <P>(vi) Making an underwriting decision about whether the consumer qualifies for a loan;</P>
              <P>(vii) Explaining or describing the steps or process that a consumer would need to take in order to obtain a loan offer, including qualifications or criteria that would need to be met without providing guidance specific to that consumer's circumstances; or</P>
              <P>(viii) Communicating on behalf of a mortgage loan originator that a written offer, including disclosures provided pursuant to the Truth in Lending Act, has been sent to a consumer without providing any details of that offer.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Offering or negotiating a loan for compensation or gain.</E> The following examples illustrate when an employee does or does not offer or negotiate terms of a loan “for compensation or gain.”</P>
              <P>(1) Offering or negotiating terms of a loan for compensation or gain includes engaging in any of the activities in paragraph (b)(1) of this Appendix in the course of carrying out employment duties, even if the employee does not receive a referral fee or commission or other special compensation for the loan.</P>
              <P>(2) Offering or negotiating terms of a loan for compensation or gain does not include engaging in a seller-financed transaction for the employee's personal property that does not involve the insured State nonmember bank.</P>

            <P>(b) Exclusion is a serious action to be imposed when there exists a preponderance of the evidence that a contractor has violated one or more of the causes set forth in § 367.6.

The FDIC shall not solicit offers from, award contracts to, extend or modify existing contracts, award task orders under existing contracts, or consent to subcontracts with such contractors. Excluded contractors are also prohibited from conducting business with FDIC as agents or representatives of other contractors. <E T="03">Provided however,</E> that these limitations do not become effective upon the notification of the contractor that there is a possible cause to exclude under § 367.13.

            <P>(2) Identification of the event(s), circumstance(s), or condition(s) that indicate that there is adequate evidence to believe a cause for suspension exists, described in sufficient detail to put the contractor on notice of the basis for the suspension, recognizing that the conduct of ongoing investigations and legal proceedings, including criminal proceedings, place limitations on the evidence that can be released;</P>

            <P>(d) Failure to respond to the notice shall be deemed an admission of the existence of the cause(s) for suspension and/or exclusion set forth in the notice <PRTPAGE P="254"/>and an acceptance of the period of exclusion proposed therein. In such circumstances, the FDIC may proceed to a final decision without further proceedings.</P>

            <P>(a) Standard of proof:</P>

            <P>(2) A suspension must be based on a finding that the cause(s) for suspension is established by adequate evidence in the administrative record of the case.</P>
            <P>(b) The administrative record consists of the portion of any information, reports, documents or other evidence identified and relied upon in the Notice of Possible Cause to Exclude, the Notice of Suspension and/or supplemental notices, if any, together with any material portions of the contractor's response. When additional proceedings are necessary to determine disputed material facts, the Ethics Counselor shall base the decision on the facts as found, together with any information and argument submitted by the contractor and any other information in the administrative record.</P>
            <P>(c) In actions based upon a conviction, judgment, a final enforcement action by a federal financial institution regulatory agency, or in which all facts and circumstances material to the exclusion action have been finally adjudicated in another forum, the Ethics Counselor may exclude a contractor without regard to the procedures set out in §§ 367.13 and 367.14.

            <P>(2) Set forth the effect of the exclusion action and the effective dates of that action;</P>
            <P>(3) Refer the contractor to its procedural rights of review and reconsideration under § 367.20; and</P>

            <P>(e) If the FDIC Ethics Counselor decides that a period of exclusion is not warranted, the Notice of Possible Cause to Exclude may be withdrawn or the proceeding may be otherwise terminated.

            <P>(2) If legal or administrative proceedings are not initiated within 12 months after the date of the suspension notice, the suspension shall be terminated unless a representative of the <PRTPAGE P="255"/>Department of Justice requests its extension in writing. In such cases, the suspension may be extended for an additional six months. In no event may a suspension be imposed for more than 18 months, unless such proceedings have been initiated within that period.</P>
            <P>(3) FDIC shall notify the Department of Justice of an impending termination of a suspension at least 30 days before the 12-month period expires to give the Department of Justice an opportunity to request an extension.</P>

            <P>(3) Exclusion for causes other than the mandatory bars in 12 CFR 366.4(a) generally should not exceed three years, but where circumstances warrant, a longer period of exclusion may be imposed.</P>
            <P>(4) The Ethics Counselor may extend an existing exclusion for an additional period if the Ethics Counselor determines that an extension is necessary to protect the integrity of the FDIC contracting program and the public interest. However, an exclusion may not be extended solely on the basis of the facts and circumstances upon which the initial exclusion action was based.

            <P>Prior to the execution of a transaction recommended to a non-institutional customer, a bank that is a government securities broker or dealer <PRTPAGE P="257"/>shall make reasonable efforts to obtain information concerning:</P>
            <P>(a) The customer's financial status;</P>
            <P>(b) The customer's tax status;</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 368.100</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Obligations concerning institutional customers.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) As a result of broadened authority provided by the Government Securities Act Amendments of 1993 (15 U.S.C. 78o-3 and 78o-5), the FDIC is adopting sales practice rules for the government securities market, a market with a particularly broad institutional component. Accordingly, the FDIC believes it is appropriate to provide further guidance to banks on their suitability obligations when making recommendations to institutional customers.</P>
            <P>(b) The FDIC's suitability rule (§ 368.4) is fundamental to fair dealing and is intended to promote ethical sales practices and high standards of professional conduct. Banks' responsibilities include having a reasonable basis for recommending a particular security or strategy, as well as having reasonable grounds for believing the recommendation is suitable for the customer to whom it is made. Banks are expected to meet the same high standards of competence, professionalism, and good faith regardless of the financial circumstances of the customer.</P>
            <P>(c) In recommending to a customer the purchase, sale, or exchange of any government security, the bank shall have reasonable grounds for believing that the recommendation is suitable for the customer upon the basis of the facts, if any, disclosed by the customer as to the customer's other security holdings and financial situation and needs.</P>
            <P>(d) The interpretation in this section concerns only the manner in which a bank determines that a recommendation is suitable for a particular institutional customer. The manner in which a bank fulfills this suitability obligation will vary, depending on the nature of the customer and the specific transaction. Accordingly, the interpretation in this section deals only with guidance regarding how a bank may fulfill customer-specific suitability obligations under § 368.4. <SU>1</SU>
              <FTREF/>
            </P>
            <FTNT>
              <P>

                <SU>1</SU> The interpretation in this section does not address the obligation related to suitability that requires that a bank have “ * * * a ‘reasonable basis’ to believe that the recommendation could be suitable for at least some customers.” <E T="03">In the Matter of the Application of F.J. Kaufman and Company of Virginia and Frederick J. Kaufman, Jr.,</E> 50 SEC 164 (1989).</P>
            </FTNT>
            <P>(e) While it is difficult to define in advance the scope of a bank's suitability obligation with respect to a specific institutional customer transaction recommended by a bank, the FDIC has identified certain factors that may be relevant when considering compliance with § 368.4. These factors are not intended to be requirements or the only factors to be considered but are offered merely as guidance in determining the scope of a bank's suitability obligations.</P>

            <P>(f) The two most important considerations in determining the scope of a bank's suitability obligations in making recommendations to an institutional customer are the customer's capability to evaluate investment risk independently and the extent to which the customer is exercising independent judgement in evaluating a bank's recommendation. A bank must determine, based on the information available to it, the customer's capability to evaluate investment risk. In some cases, the bank may conclude that the customer is not capable of making independent investment decisions in general. In other cases, the institutional customer may have general capability, but may not be able to understand a particular type of instrument or its risk. This is more likely to arise with relatively new types of instruments, or those with significantly different risk or volatility characteristics than other investments generally made by the institution. If a customer is either generally not capable of evaluating investment risk or lacks sufficient capability to evaluate the particular product, the scope of a bank's customer-specific obligations under § 368.4 would not be diminished by the fact that the bank was <PRTPAGE P="258"/>dealing with an institutional customer. On the other hand, the fact that a customer initially needed help understanding a potential investment need not necessarily imply that the customer did not ultimately develop an understanding and make an independent investment decision.</P>
            <P>(g) A bank may conclude that a customer is exercising independent judgement if the customer's investment decision will be based on its own independent assessment of the opportunities and risks presented by a potential investment, market factors and other investment considerations. Where the bank has reasonable grounds for concluding that the institutional customer is making independent investment decisions and is capable of independently evaluating investment risk, then a bank's obligations under § 368.4 for a particular customer are fulfilled. <SU>2</SU>
              <FTREF/> Where a customer has delegated decision-making authority to an agent, such as an investment advisor or a bank trust department, the interpretation in this section shall be applied to the agent.</P>
            <FTNT>
              <P>
                <SU>2</SU> See footnote 1 in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
            </FTNT>
            <P>(h) A determination of capability to evaluate investment risk independently will depend on an examination of the customer's capability to make its own investment decisions, including the resources available to the customer to make informed decisions. Relevant considerations could include:</P>
            <P>(1) The use of one or more consultants, investment advisers, or bank trust departments;</P>
            <P>(2) The general level of experience of the institutional customer in financial markets and specific experience with the type of instruments under consideration;</P>
            <P>(3) The customer's ability to understand the economic features of the security involved;</P>
            <P>(4) The customer's ability to independently evaluate how market developments would affect the security; and</P>
            <P>(5) The complexity of the security or securities involved.</P>
            <P>(i) A determination that a customer is making independent investment decisions will depend on the nature of the relationship that exists between the bank and the customer. Relevant considerations could include:</P>
            <P>(1) Any written or oral understanding that exists between the bank and the customer regarding the nature of the relationship between the bank and the customer and the services to be rendered by the bank;</P>
            <P>(2) The presence or absence of a pattern of acceptance of the bank's recommendations;</P>
            <P>(3) The use by the customer of ideas, suggestions, market views and information obtained from other government securities brokers or dealers or market professionals, particularly those relating to the same type of securities; and</P>
            <P>(4) The extent to which the bank has received from the customer current comprehensive portfolio information in connection with discussing recommended transactions or has not been provided important information regarding its portfolio or investment objectives.</P>
            <P>(j) Banks are reminded that these factors are merely guidelines that will be utilized to determine whether a bank has fulfilled its suitability obligation with respect to a specific institutional customer transaction and that the inclusion or absence of any of these factors is not dispositive of the determination of suitability. Such a determination can only be made on a case-by-case basis taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances of a particular bank/customer relationship, assessed in the context of a particular transaction.</P>

            <P>(k) For purposes of the interpretation in this section, an institutional customer shall be any entity other than a natural person. In determining the applicability of the interpretation in this section to an institutional customer, the FDIC will consider the dollar value of the securities that the institutional customer has in its portfolio and/or under management. While the interpretation in this section is potentially applicable to any institutional customer, the guidance contained in this section is more appropriately applied to an institutional customer with at least $10 <PRTPAGE P="259"/>million invested in securities in the aggregate in its portfolio and/or under management.</P>

            <P>(1) Whether covered interstate branches were formerly part of a failed or failing depository institution;</P>
            <P>(2) Whether covered interstate branches were acquired under circumstances where there was a low loan-to-deposit ratio because of the nature of the acquired institution's business or loan portfolio;</P>

            <SUBJECT>Sanctions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> If the FDIC determines that a bank is not reasonably helping to meet the credit needs of the communities served by the bank in the host state, and that the bank's statewide loan-to-deposit ratio is less than 50 percent of the host state loan-to-deposit ratio, the FDIC:</P>
            <P>(1) May order that a bank's covered interstate branch or branches be closed unless the bank provides reasonable assurances to the satisfaction of the FDIC, after an opportunity for public comment, that the bank has an acceptable plan under which the bank will reasonably help to meet the credit needs of the communities served by the bank in the host state; and</P>
            <P>(2) Will not permit the bank to open a new branch in the host state that would be considered to be a covered interstate branch unless the bank provides reasonable assurances to the satisfaction of the FDIC, after an opportunity for public comment, that the bank will reasonably help to meet the credit needs of the community that the new branch will serve.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose and scope.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Unless otherwise provided in this part, each “covered institution” (defined in § 370.2(a)) is required to implement the information technology system and recordkeeping capabilities needed to calculate the amount of deposit insurance coverage available for each deposit account in the event of its failure. Doing so will improve the FDIC's ability to fulfill its statutory mandates to pay deposit insurance as soon as possible after a covered institution's failure and to resolve a covered institution at the least cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Information technology system requirements.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A covered institution must configure its information technology system to be capable of performing the functions set forth in paragraph (b) of this section within 24 hours after the appointment of the FDIC as receiver. To the extent that a covered institution does not maintain its deposit account records in the manner prescribed under § 370.4(a) but instead in the manner prescribed under § 370.4(b) or (c), the covered institution's information technology system must be able to perform the functions set forth in paragraph (b) of this section upon input by the FDIC of additional information collected from account holders after failure of the covered institution.</P>
            <P>(b) Each covered institution's information technology system must be capable of:</P>

            <P>(3) Is determined by the appropriate federal banking agency or the FDIC in consultation with the appropriate federal banking agency to be experiencing a significant deterioration of capital or significant funding difficulties or liquidity stress, notwithstanding the composite rating of the covered institution by its appropriate federal banking agency in its most recent report of examination.</P>
            <P>(b) In implementing this section, the FDIC must consult with the covered institution's appropriate federal banking agency and consider the complexity of the covered institution's deposit system and operations, extent of the covered institution's asset quality difficulties, volatility of the institution's funding sources, expected near-term changes in the covered institution's capital levels, and other relevant factors appropriate for the FDIC to consider in its role as insurer of the covered institution.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Revolving pool securitizations.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Revolving pool securitization</E> means an issuing entity that is established to issue on multiple issuance dates more than one series, class, subclass, or tranche of asset-backed securities that are collateralized by a common pool of securitized assets that will change in composition over time, and that does not monetize excess interest and fees from its securitized assets.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Seller's interest</E> means an ABS interest or ABS interests:</P>
              <P>(1) Collateralized by the securitized assets and servicing assets owned or held by the issuing entity, other than the following that are not considered a component of seller's interest:</P>
              <P>(i) Servicing assets that have been allocated as collateral only for a specific series in connection with administering the revolving pool securitization, such as a principal accumulation or interest reserve account; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Assets that are not eligible under the terms of the securitization transaction to be included when determining whether the revolving pool securitization holds aggregate securitized assets in specified proportions to aggregate outstanding investor ABS interests issued; and</P>
              <P>(2) That is <E T="03">pari passu</E> with each series of investor ABS interests issued, or partially or fully subordinated to one or more series in identical or varying amounts, with respect to the allocation of all distributions and losses with respect to the securitized assets prior to early amortization of the revolving securitization (as specified in the securitization transaction documents); and</P>
              <P>(3) That adjusts for fluctuations in the outstanding principal balance of the securitized assets in the pool.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">General requirement.</E> A sponsor satisfies the risk retention requirements of § 373.3 with respect to a securitization transaction for which the issuing entity is a revolving pool securitization if the sponsor maintains a seller's interest of not less than 5 percent of the aggregate unpaid principal balance of all outstanding investor ABS interests in the issuing entity.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Measuring the seller's interest.</E> In measuring the seller's interest for purposes of meeting the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section:</P>
              <P>(1) The unpaid principal balance of the securitized assets for the numerator of the 5 percent ratio shall not include assets of the types excluded from the definition of seller's interest in paragraph (a) of this section;</P>
              <P>(2) The aggregate unpaid principal balance of outstanding investor ABS interests in the denominator of the 5 percent ratio may be reduced by the amount of funds held in a segregated principal accumulation account for the repayment of outstanding investor ABS interests, if:</P>
              <P>(i) The terms of the securitization transaction documents prevent funds in the principal accumulation account from being applied for any purpose other than the repayment of the unpaid principal of outstanding investor ABS interests; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Funds in that account are invested only in the types of assets in which funds held in an eligible horizontal cash reserve account pursuant to § 373.4 are permitted to be invested;</P>
              <P>(3) If the terms of the securitization transaction documents set minimum required seller's interest as a proportion of the unpaid principal balance of outstanding investor ABS interests for one or more series issued, rather than as a proportion of the aggregate outstanding investor ABS interests in all outstanding series combined, the percentage of the seller's interest for each such series must, when combined with the percentage of any minimum seller's interest set by reference to the aggregate outstanding investor ABS interests, equal at least 5 percent;</P>
              <P>(4) The 5 percent test must be determined and satisfied at the closing of each issuance of ABS interests to investors by the issuing entity, and</P>

              <P>(i) At least monthly at a seller's interest measurement date specified under the securitization transaction documents, until no ABS interest in the issuing entity is held by any person not a wholly-owned affiliate of the sponsor; or<PRTPAGE P="308"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) If the revolving pool securitization fails to meet the 5 percent test as of any date described in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, and the securitization transaction documents specify a cure period, the 5 percent test must be determined and satisfied within the earlier of the cure period, or one month after the date described in paragraph (c)(4)(i).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Measuring outstanding investor ABS interests.</E> In measuring the amount of outstanding investor ABS interests for purposes of this section, ABS interests held for the life of such ABS interests by the sponsor or its wholly-owned affiliates may be excluded.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Holding and retention of the seller's interest; legacy trusts.</E> (1) Notwithstanding § 373.12(a), the seller's interest, and any offsetting horizontal retention interest retained pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section, must be retained by the sponsor or by one or more wholly-owned affiliates of the sponsor, including one or more depositors of the revolving pool securitization.</P>
              <P>(2) If one revolving pool securitization issues collateral certificates representing a beneficial interest in all or a portion of the securitized assets held by that securitization to another revolving pool securitization, which in turn issues ABS interests for which the collateral certificates are all or a portion of the securitized assets, a sponsor may satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section by retaining the seller's interest for the assets represented by the collateral certificates through either of the revolving pool securitizations, so long as both revolving pool securitizations are retained at the direction of the same sponsor or its wholly-owned affiliates.</P>
              <P>(3) If the sponsor retains the seller's interest associated with the collateral certificates at the level of the revolving pool securitization that issues those collateral certificates, the proportion of the seller's interest required by paragraph (b) of this section retained at that level must equal the proportion that the principal balance of the securitized assets represented by the collateral certificates bears to the principal balance of the securitized assets in the revolving pool securitization that issues the ABS interests, as of each measurement date required by paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Offset for pool-level excess funding account.</E> The 5 percent seller's interest required on each measurement date by paragraph (c) of this section may be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the balance, as of such date, of an excess funding account in the form of a segregated account that:</P>
              <P>(1) Is funded in the event of a failure to meet the minimum seller's interest requirements or other requirement to maintain a minimum balance of securitized assets under the securitization transaction documents by distributions otherwise payable to the holder of the seller's interest;</P>
              <P>(2) Is invested only in the types of assets in which funds held in a horizontal cash reserve account pursuant to § 373.4 are permitted to be invested; and</P>
              <P>(3) In the event of an early amortization, makes payments of amounts held in the account to holders of investor ABS interests in the same manner as payments to holders of investor ABS interests of amounts received on securitized assets.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Combined seller's interests and horizontal interest retention.</E> The 5 percent seller's interest required on each measurement date by paragraph (c) of this section may be reduced to a percentage lower than 5 percent to the extent that, for all series of investor ABS interests issued after the applicable effective date of this § 373.5, the sponsor, or notwithstanding § 373.12(a) a wholly-owned affiliate of the sponsor, retains, at a minimum, a corresponding percentage of the fair value of ABS interests issued in each series, in the form of one or more of the horizontal residual interests meeting the requirements of paragraphs (h) or (i).</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Residual ABS interests in excess interest and fees.</E> The sponsor may take the offset described in paragraph (g) of this section for a residual ABS interest in excess interest and fees, whether certificated or uncertificated, in a single or multiple classes, subclasses, or tranches, that meets, individually or in the aggregate, the requirements of this paragraph (h);<PRTPAGE P="309"/>
              </P>
              <P>(1) Each series of the revolving pool securitization distinguishes between the series' share of the interest and fee cash flows and the series' share of the principal repayment cash flows from the securitized assets collateralizing the revolving pool securitization, which may according to the terms of the securitization transaction documents, include not only the series' ratable share of such cash flows but also excess cash flows available from other series;</P>
              <P>(2) The residual ABS interest's claim to any part of the series' share of the interest and fee cash flows for any interest payment period is subordinated to all accrued and payable interest due on the payment date to more senior ABS interests in the series for that period, and further reduced by the series' share of losses, including defaults on principal of the securitized assets collateralizing the revolving pool securitization (whether incurred in that period or carried over from prior periods) to the extent that such payments would have been included in amounts payable to more senior interests in the series;</P>
              <P>(3) The revolving pool securitization continues to revolve, with one or more series, classes, subclasses, or tranches of asset-backed securities that are collateralized by a common pool of assets that change in composition over time; and</P>
              <P>(4) For purposes of taking the offset described in paragraph (g) of this section, the sponsor determines the fair value of the residual ABS interest in excess interest and fees, and the fair value of the series of outstanding investor ABS interests to which it is subordinated and supports using the fair value measurement framework under GAAP, as of:</P>
              <P>(i) The closing of the securitization transaction issuing the supported ABS interests; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The seller's interest measurement dates described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, except that for these periodic determinations the sponsor must update the fair value of the residual ABS interest in excess interest and fees for the numerator of the percentage ratio, but may at the sponsor's option continue to use the fair values determined in (h)(4)(i) for the outstanding investor ABS interests in the denominator.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Offsetting eligible horizontal residual interest.</E> The sponsor may take the offset described in paragraph (g) of this section for ABS interests that would meet the definition of eligible horizontal residual interests in § 373.2 but for the sponsor's simultaneous holding of subordinated seller's interests, residual ABS interests in excess interests and fees, or a combination of the two, if:</P>
              <P>(1) The sponsor complies with all requirements of paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section for its holdings of subordinated seller's interest, and paragraph (h) for its holdings of residual ABS interests in excess interests and fees, as applicable;</P>
              <P>(2) For purposes of taking the offset described in paragraph (g) of this section, the sponsor determines the fair value of the eligible horizontal residual interest as a percentage of the fair value of the outstanding investor ABS interests in the series supported by the eligible horizontal residual interest, determined using the fair value measurement framework under GAAP:</P>
              <P>(i) As of the closing of the securitization transaction issuing the supported ABS interests; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Without including in the numerator of the percentage ratio any fair value based on:</P>
              <P>(A) The subordinated seller's interest or residual ABS interest in excess interest and fees;</P>
              <P>(B) the interest payable to the sponsor on the eligible horizontal residual interest, if the sponsor is including the value of residual ABS interest in excess interest and fees pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section in taking the offset in paragraph (g) of this section; and,</P>

              <P>(C) the principal payable to the sponsor on the eligible horizontal residual interest, if the sponsor is including the value of the seller's interest pursuant to paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section and distributions on that seller's interest are available to reduce charge-offs that would otherwise be allocated to reduce principal payable to the offset eligible horizontal residual interest.<PRTPAGE P="310"/>
              </P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Specified dates.</E> A sponsor using data about the revolving pool securitization's collateral, or ABS interests previously issued, to determine the closing-date percentage of a seller's interest, residual ABS interest in excess interest and fees, or eligible horizontal residual interest pursuant to this § 373.5 may use such data prepared as of specified dates if:</P>
              <P>(1) The sponsor describes the specified dates in the disclosures required by paragraph (k) of this section; and</P>

              <SUBJECT>Recoupment of compensation from senior executives and directors.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Substantially responsible.</E> The Corporation, as receiver of a covered financial company, may file an action to recover from any current or former senior executive or director substantially responsible for the failed condition of the covered financial company any compensation received during the 2-year period preceding the date on which the Corporation was appointed as the receiver of the covered financial company, except that, in the case of <PRTPAGE P="346"/>fraud, no time limit shall apply. A senior executive or director shall be deemed to be substantially responsible for the failed condition of a covered financial company that is placed into receivership under the orderly liquidation authority of the Dodd-Frank Act if he or she:</P>
              <P>(1) Failed to conduct his or her responsibilities with the degree of skill and care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances, and</P>
              <P>(2) As a result, individually or collectively, caused a loss to the covered financial company that materially contributed to the failure of the covered financial company under the facts and circumstances.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Presumptions.</E> The following presumptions shall apply for purposes of assessing whether a senior executive or director is substantially responsible for the failed condition of a covered financial company:</P>
              <P>(1) It shall be presumed that a senior executive or director is substantially responsible for the failed condition of a covered financial company that is placed into receivership under the orderly liquidation authority of the Dodd-Frank Act under any of the following circumstances:</P>
              <P>(i) The senior executive or director served as the chairman of the board of directors, chief executive officer, president, chief financial officer, or in any other similar role regardless of his or her title if in this role he or she had responsibility for the strategic, policymaking, or company-wide operational decisions of the covered financial company prior to the date that it was placed into receivership under the orderly liquidation authority of the Dodd-Frank Act;</P>
              <P>(ii) The senior executive or director is adjudged liable by a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction for having breached his or her duty of loyalty to the covered financial company;</P>
              <P>(iii) The senior executive was removed from the management of the covered financial company under 12 U.S.C. 5386(4); or</P>
              <P>(iv) The director was removed from the board of directors of the covered financial company under 12 U.S.C. 5386(5).</P>
              <P>(2) The presumption under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section may be rebutted by evidence that the senior executive or director conducted his or her responsibilities with the degree of skill and care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances. The presumptions under paragraphs (b)(1)(ii), (b)(1)(iii) and (b)(1)(iv) of this section may be rebutted by evidence that the senior executive or director did not cause a loss to the covered financial company that materially contributed to the failure of the covered financial company under the facts and circumstances.</P>
              <P>(3) The presumptions do not apply to:</P>
              <P>(i) A senior executive hired by the covered financial company during the two years prior to the Corporation's appointment as receiver to assist in preventing further deterioration of the financial condition of the covered financial company; or</P>
              <P>(ii) A director who joined the board of directors of the covered financial company during the two years prior to the Corporation's appointment as receiver under an agreement or resolution to assist in preventing further deterioration of the financial condition of the covered financial company.</P>
              <P>(4) Notwithstanding that the presumption does not apply under paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section, the Corporation as receiver still may pursue recoupment of compensation from a senior executive or director in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) or (ii) if they are substantially responsible for the failed condition of the covered financial company.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Savings Clause.</E> Nothing in this section shall limit or impair any rights of the Corporation as receiver under other applicable law, including any rights under title II of the Dodd-Frank Act to pursue any other claims or causes of action it may have against senior executives and directors of the covered financial company for losses they cause to the covered financial company in the same or separate actions.</P>

              <P>(3) The FDIC retains the authority to establish other policies restricting asset sales. Neither 12 U.S.C. 5390(r) nor this section in any way limits the authority of the FDIC to establish policies prohibiting the sale of assets to prospective purchasers who have injured the respective covered financial company, or to other prospective purchasers, such as certain employees or contractors of the FDIC, or individuals who are not in compliance with the terms of any debt or duty owed to the FDIC in any of its capacities.

              <P>(b) All payments under paragraphs (a)(4) and (a)(5) of this section shall be adjusted for inflation in the same manner that claims under 11 U.S.C. 507(a)(1)(4) are adjusted for inflation by the Judicial Conference of the United States pursuant to 11 U.S.C. 104.</P>

              <P>(c) All unsecured claims of any category or priority described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(10) of this section shall be paid in full or provision made for such payment before any claims of lesser priority are paid.

              <P>(1) Holders of long-term senior debt who have a claim entitled to priority of payment at the level set out under 12 U.S.C. 5390(b)(1)(E);</P>
              <P>(2) Holders of subordinated debt who have a claim entitled to priority of payment at the level set out under 12 U.S.C. 5390(b)(1)(F);</P>
              <P>(3) Shareholders, members, general partners, limited partners, or other persons who have a claim entitled to priority of payment at the level set out under 12 U.S.C. 5390 (b)(1)(H); or</P>
              <P>(4) Other holders of claims entitled to priority of payment at the level set out under 12 U.S.C. 5390(b)(1)(E) unless the Corporation, through the affirmative vote of a majority the members of the Board of Directors then serving, and in its sole discretion, specifically determines that additional payments or credit amounts to such holders are necessary and meet all of the requirements under 12 U.S.C. 5390(b)(4), (d)(4), or (h)(5)(E), as applicable. The authority of the Board to make the foregoing determination cannot be delegated.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Approval of enhanced creditor protection conditions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Protocol compliance.</E> (1) Unless the FDIC determines otherwise based on <PRTPAGE P="393"/>the specific facts and circumstances, a covered QFC is deemed to comply with this part if it is amended by the universal protocol or the U.S. protocol.</P>
            <P>(2) A covered QFC will be deemed to be amended by the universal protocol for purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section notwithstanding the covered QFC being amended by one or more Country Annexes, as the term is defined in the universal protocol.</P>
            <P>(3) For purposes of paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section:</P>
            <P>(i) The universal protocol means the ISDA 2015 Universal Resolution Stay Protocol, including the Securities Financing Transaction Annex and Other Agreements Annex, published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc., as of May 3, 2016, and minor or technical amendments thereto;</P>
            <P>(ii) The U.S. protocol means a protocol that is the same as the universal protocol other than as provided in paragraphs (a)(3)(ii)(A) through (F) of this section.</P>
            <P>(A) The provisions of Section 1 of the attachment to the universal protocol may be limited in their application to covered entities, covered banks, and covered FSIs and may be limited with respect to resolutions under the Identified Regimes, as those regimes are identified by the universal protocol;</P>
            <P>(B) The provisions of Section 2 of the attachment to the universal protocol may be limited in their application to covered entities, covered banks, and covered FSIs;</P>
            <P>(C) The provisions of Section 4(b)(i)(A) of the attachment to the universal protocol must not apply with respect to U.S. special resolution regimes;</P>
            <P>(D) The provisions of Section 4(b) of the attachment to the universal protocol may only be effective to the extent that the covered QFCs affected by an adherent's election thereunder would continue to meet the requirements of this part;</P>
            <P>(E) The provisions of Section 2(k) of the attachment to the universal protocol must not apply; and</P>
            <P>(F) The U.S. protocol may include minor and technical differences from the universal protocol and differences necessary to conform the U.S. protocol to the differences described in paragraphs (a)(3)(ii)(A) through (E) of this section.</P>
            <P>(iii) Amended by the universal protocol or the U.S. protocol, with respect to covered QFCs between adherents to the protocol, includes amendments through incorporation of the terms of the protocol (by reference or otherwise) into the covered QFC; and</P>
            <P>(iv) The attachment to the universal protocol means the attachment that the universal protocol identifies as “ATTACHMENT to the ISDA 2015 UNIVERSAL RESOLUTION STAY PROTOCOL.”</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Proposal of enhanced creditor protection conditions.</E> (1) A covered FSI may request that the FDIC approve as compliant with the requirements of §§ 382.3 and 382.4 proposed provisions of one or more forms of covered QFCs, or proposed amendments to one or more forms of covered QFCs, with enhanced creditor protection conditions.</P>
            <P>(2) Enhanced creditor protection conditions means a set of limited exemptions to the requirements of § 382.4(b) of this part that is different than that of § 382.4(d), (f), and (h).</P>
            <P>(3) A covered FSI making a request under paragraph (b)(1) of this section must provide</P>
            <P>(i) An analysis of the proposal that addresses each consideration in paragraph (d) of this section;</P>
            <P>(ii) A written legal opinion verifying that proposed provisions or amendments would be valid and enforceable under applicable law of the relevant jurisdictions, including, in the case of proposed amendments, the validity and enforceability of the proposal to amend the covered QFCs; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Any other relevant information that the FDIC requests.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">FDIC approval.</E> The FDIC may approve, subject to any conditions or commitments the FDIC may set, a proposal by a covered FSI under paragraph (b) of this section if the proposal, as compared to a covered QFC that contains only the limited exemptions in § 382.4(d), (f), and (h) or that is amended as provided under paragraph (a) of this section, would promote the safety and <PRTPAGE P="394"/>soundness of covered FSIs by mitigating the potential destabilizing effects of the resolution of a global significantly important banking entity that is an affiliate of the covered FSI to at least the same extent.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Considerations.</E> In reviewing a proposal under this section, the FDIC may consider all facts and circumstances related to the proposal, including:</P>
            <P>(1) Whether, and the extent to which, the proposal would reduce the resiliency of such covered FSIs during distress or increase the impact on U.S. financial stability were one or more of the covered FSIs to fail;</P>
            <P>(2) Whether, and the extent to which, the proposal would materially decrease the ability of a covered FSI, or an affiliate of a covered FSI, to be resolved in a rapid and orderly manner in the event of the financial distress or failure of the entity that is required to submit a resolution plan;</P>
            <P>(3) Whether, and the extent to which, the set of conditions or the mechanism in which they are applied facilitates, on an industry-wide basis, contractual modifications to remove impediments to resolution and increase market certainty, transparency, and equitable treatment with respect to the default rights of non-defaulting parties to a covered QFC;</P>
            <P>(4) Whether, and the extent to which, the proposal applies to existing and future transactions;</P>
            <P>(5) Whether, and the extent to which, the proposal would apply to multiple forms of QFCs or multiple covered FSIs;</P>
            <P>(6) Whether the proposal would permit a party to a covered QFC that is within the scope of the proposal to adhere to the proposal with respect to only one or a subset of covered FSIs;</P>
            <P>(7) With respect to a supported party, the degree of assurance the proposal provides to the supported party that the material payment and delivery obligations of the covered affiliate credit enhancement and the covered direct QFC it supports will continue to be performed after the covered affiliate support provider enters a receivership, insolvency, liquidation, resolution, or similar proceeding;</P>
            <P>(8) The presence, nature, and extent of any provisions that require a covered affiliate support provider or transferee to meet conditions other than material payment or delivery obligations to its creditors;</P>
            <P>(9) The extent to which the supported party's overall credit risk to the direct party may increase if the enhanced creditor protection conditions are not met and the likelihood that the supported party's credit risk to the direct party would decrease or remain the same if the enhanced creditor protection conditions are met; and</P>
            <P>(10) Whether the proposal provides the counterparty with additional default rights or other rights.</P>

            <P>(c) <E T="03">Exclusion of certain contracts.</E> Notwithstanding § 382.2 of this part, a covered FSI is not required to conform the following types of contracts or agreements to the requirements of this part:</P>

            <P>(ii) Was issued prior to January 1, 2018.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Exemption by order.</E> The FDIC may exempt by order one or more covered FSI(s) from conforming one or more contracts or types of contracts to one or more of the requirements of this part after considering:</P>
            <P>(1) The potential impact of the exemption on the ability of the covered FSI(s), or affiliates of the covered FSI(s), to be resolved in a rapid and orderly manner in the event of the financial distress or failure of the entity that is required to submit a resolution plan;</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 390.100</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>What does this subpart do?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) This subpart explains the FDIC's procedures for processing applications, notices, or filings (applications) under parts 390 and 391 for State savings associations. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, §§ 390.103 through 390.110 and §§ 390.126 through 390.135 apply whenever an FDIC regulation requires any person (you) to file an application with the FDIC. Sections 390.111 through 390.125, however, only apply when a FDIC regulation incorporates the procedures in those sections or where otherwise required by the FDIC.</P>

              <P>(b) This subpart does not apply to any of the following:<PRTPAGE P="398"/>
              </P>
              <P>(1) An application related to a transaction under section 13(c) or (k) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1823(c) or (k).</P>
              <P>(2) A request for reconsideration, modification, or appeal of a final FDIC action.</P>
              <P>(3) A request related to litigation, an enforcement proceeding, a supervisory directive or supervisory agreement. Such requests include a request seeking approval under, modification of, or termination of an order issued under subparts C or D, a supervisory agreement, a supervisory directive, a consent merger agreement or a document negotiated in settlement of an enforcement matter or other litigation, unless an applicable FDIC regulation specifically requires an application under this subpart.</P>
              <P>(4) An application filed under a FDIC regulation that prescribes other application processing procedures and time frames for the approval of applications.</P>
              <P>(c) If a FDIC regulation for a specific type of application prescribes some application processing procedures, or time frames, the FDIC will apply this subpart to the extent necessary to process the application. For example, if a FDIC regulation for a specific type of application does not identify time periods for the processing of an application, the time periods in this subpart apply.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Guidelines relating to nondiscrimination in lending.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Fair housing and equal opportunity in home financing is a policy of the United States established by Federal statutes and Presidential orders and proclamations. In furtherance of the Federal civil rights laws and the economical home financing purposes of the statutes administered by the FDIC, the FDIC has adopted, in this subpart, nondiscrimination regulations that, among other things, prohibit arbitrary refusals to consider loan applications on the basis of the age or location of a dwelling, and prohibit discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status (having one or more children under the age of 18), marital status, age (provided the person has the capacity to contract), or national origin in fixing the amount, interest rate, duration, application procedures, collection or enforcement procedures, or other terms or conditions of housing related loans. Such discrimination is also prohibited in the purchase of loans and securities. This <PRTPAGE P="410"/>section provides supplementary guidelines to aid savings associations in developing and implementing nondiscriminatory lending policies. Each State savings association should reexamine its underwriting standards at least annually in order to ensure equal opportunity.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Loan underwriting standards.</E> The basic purpose of the FDIC's nondiscrimination regulations is to require that every applicant be given an equal opportunity to obtain a loan. Each loan applicant's creditworthiness should be evaluated on an individual basis without reference to presumed characteristics of a group. The use of lending standards which have no economic basis and which are discriminatory in effect is a violation of law even in the absence of an actual intent to discriminate. However, a standard which has a discriminatory effect is not necessarily improper if its use achieves a genuine business need which cannot be achieved by means which are not discriminatory in effect or less discriminatory in effect.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Discriminatory practices</E>— (1) <E T="03">Discrimination on the basis of sex or marital status.</E> The Civil Rights Act of 1968 and the National Housing Act prohibit discrimination in lending on the basis of sex. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act, in addition to this prohibition, forbids discrimination on the basis of marital status. Refusing to lend to, requiring higher standards of creditworthiness of, or imposing different requirements on, members of one sex or individuals of one marital status, is discrimination based on sex or marital status. Loan underwriting decisions must be based on an applicant's credit history and present and reasonably foreseeable economic prospects, rather than on the basis of assumptions regarding comparative differences in creditworthiness between married and unmarried individuals, or between men and women.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Discrimination on the basis of language.</E> Requiring fluency in the English language as a prerequisite for obtaining a loan may be a discriminatory practice based on national origin.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Income of husbands and wives.</E> A practice of discounting all or part of either spouse's income where spouses apply jointly is a violation of section 527 of the National Housing Act. As with other income, when spouses apply jointly for a loan, the determination as to whether a spouse's income qualifies for credit purposes should depend upon a reasonable evaluation of his or her past, present, and reasonably foreseeable economic circumstances. Information relating to child-bearing intentions of a couple or an individual may not be requested.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Supplementary income.</E> Lending standards which consider as effective only the non-overtime income of the primary wage-earner may result in discrimination because they do not take account of variations in employment patterns among individuals and families. The FDIC favors loan underwriting which reasonably evaluates the credit worthiness of each applicant based on a realistic appraisal of his or her own past, present, and foreseeable economic circumstances. The determination as to whether primary income or additional income qualifies as effective for credit purposes should depend upon whether such income may reasonably be expected to continue through the early period of the mortgage risk. Automatically discounting other income from bonuses, overtime, or part-time employment, will cause some applicants to be denied financing without a realistic analysis of their credit worthiness. Since statistics show that minority group members and low- and moderate-income families rely more often on such supplemental income, the practice may be racially discriminatory in effect, as well as artificially restrictive of opportunities for home financing.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Applicant's prior history.</E> Loan decisions should be based upon a realistic evaluation of all pertinent factors respecting an individual's creditworthiness, without giving undue weight to any one factor. The State savings association should, among other things, take into consideration that:</P>
              <P>(i) In some instances, past credit difficulties may have resulted from discriminatory practices;</P>

              <P>(ii) A policy favoring applicants who previously owned homes may perpetuate prior discrimination;<PRTPAGE P="411"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) A current, stable earnings record may be the most reliable indicator of credit-worthiness, and entitled to more weight than factors such as educational level attained;</P>
              <P>(iv) Job or residential changes may indicate upward mobility; and</P>
              <P>(v) Preferring applicants who have done business with the lender can perpetuate previous discriminatory policies.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Income level or racial composition of area.</E> Refusing to lend or lending on less favorable terms in particular areas because of their racial composition is unlawful. Refusing to lend, or offering less favorable terms (such as interest rate, downpayment, or maturity) to applicants because of the income level in an area can discriminate against minority group persons.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Age and location factors.</E> Sections 390.142-390.144 prohibit loan denials based upon the age or location of a dwelling. These restrictions are intended to prohibit use of unfounded or unsubstantiated assumptions regarding the effect upon loan risk of the age of a dwelling or the physical or economic characteristics of an area. Loan decisions should be based on the present market value of the property offered as security (including consideration of specific improvements to be made by the borrower) and the likelihood that the property will retain an adequate value over the term of the loan. Specific factors which may negatively affect its short-range future value (up to 3-5 years) should be clearly documented. Factors which in some cases may cause the market value of a property to decline are recent zoning changes or a significant number of abandoned homes in the immediate vicinity of the property. However, not all zoning changes will cause a decline in property values, and proximity to abandoned buildings may not affect the market value of a property because of rehabilitation programs or affirmative lending programs, or because the cause of abandonment is unrelated to high risk. Proper underwriting considerations include the condition and utility of the improvements, and various physical factors such as street conditions, amenities such as parks and recreation areas, availability of public utilities and municipal services, and exposure to flooding and land faults. However, arbitrary decisions based on age or location are prohibited, since many older, soundly constructed homes provide housing opportunities which may be precluded by an arbitrary lending policy.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Fair Housing Act (title VIII, Civil Rights Act of 1968, as amended).</E> State savings associations, must comply with all regulations promulgated by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to implement the Fair Housing Act, found at 24 CFR part 100 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> except that they shall use the Equal Housing Lender logo and poster prescribed by FDIC regulations at §§ 390.145 and 390.146 rather than the Equal Housing Opportunity logo and poster required by 24 CFR parts 109 and 110.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Marketing practices.</E> State savings associations should review their advertising and marketing practices to ensure that their services are available without discrimination to the community they serve. Discrimination in lending is not limited to loan decisions and underwriting standards; a State savings association does not meet its obligations to the community or implement its equal lending responsibility if its marketing practices and business relationships with developers and real estate brokers improperly restrict its clientele to segments of the community. A review of marketing practices could begin with an examination of an association's loan portfolio and applications to ascertain whether, in view of the demographic characteristics and credit demands of the community in which the institution is located, it is adequately serving the community on a nondiscriminatory basis. The FDIC will systematically review marketing practices where evidence of discrimination in lending is discovered.</P>

                <P>• Establish a loan portfolio diversification policy and set limits for real estate loans by type and geographic market (e.g., limits on higher risk loans).<PRTPAGE P="416"/>

                    <SU>3</SU> A loan-to-value limit has not been established for permanent mortgage or home equity loans on owner-occupied, 1- to 4-family residential property. However, for any such loan with a loan-to-value ratio that equals or exceeds 90 percent at origination, an institution should require appropriate credit enhancement in the form of either mortgage insurance or readily marketable collateral.</P>
                </FTNT>
                <P>The supervisory loan-to-value limits should be applied to the underlying property that collateralizes the loan. For loans that fund multiple phases of the same real estate project (e.g., a loan for both land development and construction of an office building), the appropriate loan-to-value limit is the limit applicable to the final phase of the project funded by the loan; however, loan disbursements should not exceed actual development or construction outlays. In situations where a loan is fully cross-collateralized by two or more properties or is secured by a collateral pool of two or more properties, the appropriate maximum loan amount under supervisory loan-to-value limits is the sum of the value of each property, less senior liens, multiplied by the appropriate loan-to-value limit for each property. To ensure that collateral margins remain within the supervisory limits, lenders should redetermine conformity whenever collateral substitutions are made to the collateral pool.</P>
                <P>In establishing internal loan-to-value limits, each lender is expected to carefully consider the institution-specific and market factors listed under “Loan Portfolio Management Considerations,” as well as any other relevant factors, such as the particular subcategory or type of loan. For any subcategory of loans that exhibits greater credit risk than the overall category, a lender should consider the establishment of an internal loan-to-value limit for that subcategory that is lower than the limit for the overall category.</P>
                <P>The loan-to-value ratio is only one of several pertinent credit factors to be considered when underwriting a real estate loan. Other credit factors to be taken into account are highlighted in the “Underwriting Standards” section above. Because of these other factors, the establishment of these supervisory limits should not be interpreted to mean that loans at these levels will automatically be considered sound.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Loans in Excess of the Supervisory Loan-to-Value Limits</HD>

                <P>The agencies recognize that appropriate loan-to-value limits vary not only among categories of real estate loans but also among individual loans. Therefore, it may be appropriate in individual cases to originate or purchase loans with loan-to-value ratios in excess of the supervisory loan-to-value limits, based on the support provided by other credit factors. Such loans should be identified in the institutions' records, and their aggregate amount reported at least quarterly to the institution's board of directors. (<E T="03">See</E> additional reporting requirements described under “Exceptions to the General Policy.”) The aggregate amount of all loans in excess of the supervisory loan-to-value limits should not exceed 100 percent of total capital.<SU>4</SU>

                  <FTREF/> Moreover, within the aggregate limit, total loans for all commercial, agricultural, multifamily or other non-1- to 4-family residential properties should not exceed 30 percent of total capital. An institution will come under increased supervisory <PRTPAGE P="418"/>scrutiny as the total of such loans approaches these levels.</P>

For insured state non-member banks, the term “total capital” is defined at 12 CFR 324.2. For national banks, the term “total capital” is defined at 12 CFR 3.2. For state savings associations, the term “total capital” is defined at 12 CFR 324.2.</P>
                </FTNT>
                <P>In determining the aggregate amount of such loans, institutions should: (a) Include all loans secured by the same property if any one of those loans exceeds the supervisory loan-to-value limits; and (b) include the recourse obligation of any such loan sold with recourse. Conversely, a loan should no longer be reported to the directors as part of aggregate totals when reduction in principal or senior liens, or additional contribution of collateral or equity (e.g., improvements to the real property securing the loan), bring the loan-to-value ratio into compliance with supervisory limits.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Excluded Transactions</HD>
                <P>The agencies also recognize that there are a number of lending situations in which other factors significantly outweigh the need to apply the supervisory loan-to-value limits.</P>
                <P>These include:</P>
                <P>• Loans guaranteed or insured by the U.S. government or its agencies, provided that the amount of the guaranty or insurance is at least equal to the portion of the loan that exceeds the supervisory loan-to-value limit.</P>

                <P>• Loans that are to be sold promptly after origination, without recourse, to a financially responsible third party.</P>
                <P>• Loans that are renewed, refinanced, or restructured without the advancement of new funds or an increase in the line of credit (except for reasonable closing costs), or loans that are renewed, refinanced, or restructured in connection with a workout situation, either with or without the advancement of new funds, where consistent with safe and sound banking practices and part of a clearly defined and well-documented program to achieve orderly liquidation of the debt, reduce risk of loss, or maximize recovery on the loan.</P>
                <P>• Loans that facilitate the sale of real estate acquired by the lender in the ordinary course of collecting a debt previously contracted in good faith.</P>
                <P>• Loans for which a lien on or interest in real property is taken as additional collateral through an abundance of caution by the lender (e.g., the institution takes a blanket lien on all or substantially all of the assets of the borrower, and the value of the real property is low relative to the aggregate value of all other collateral).</P>
                <P>• Loans, such as working capital loans, where the lender does not rely principally on real estate as security and the extension of credit is not used to acquire, develop, or construct permanent improvements on real property.</P>
                <P>• Loans for the purpose of financing permanent improvements to real property, but not secured by the property, if such security interest is not required by prudent underwriting practice.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Exceptions to the General Lending Policy</HD>
                <P>Some provision should be made for the consideration of loan requests from creditworthy borrowers whose credit needs do not fit within the institution's general lending policy. An institution may provide for prudently underwritten exceptions to its lending policies, including loan-to-value limits, on a loan-by-loan basis. However, any exceptions from the supervisory loan-to-value limits should conform to the aggregate limits on such loans discussed above.</P>
                <P>The board of directors is responsible for establishing standards for the review and approval of exception loans. Each institution should establish an appropriate internal process for the review and approval of loans that do not conform to its own internal policy standards. The approval of any such loan should be supported by a written justification that clearly sets forth all of the relevant credit factors that support the underwriting decision. The justification and approval documents for such loans should be maintained as a part of the permanent loan file. Each institution should monitor compliance with its real estate lending policy and individually report exception loans of a significant size to its board of directors.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Authority and scope.</E> This subpart is issued by the FDIC pursuant to 12 U.S.C. sections 1831m; 1831n(a)(2); 1831p-1;1464(v)(1). It applies to all State savings associations regulated by the FDIC.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Records and reports—general</E>—(1) <E T="03">Records.</E> Each State savings association <PRTPAGE P="428"/>and its affiliates shall maintain accurate and complete records of all business transactions. Such records shall support and be readily reconcilable to any regulatory reports submitted to the FDIC and financial reports prepared in accordance with GAAP. The records shall be maintained in the United States and be readily accessible for examination and other supervisory purposes within 5 business days upon request by the FDIC, at a location acceptable to the FDIC.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Reports.</E> For purposes of examination by and regulatory reports to the FDIC and compliance with this section, all State savings associations shall use such forms and follow such regulatory reporting requirements as the FDIC may require by regulation or otherwise.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Regulatory reports.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Definition and scope.</E> This section applies to all regulatory reports, as defined herein. A regulatory report is any report that the FDIC prepares, or is submitted to, or is used by the FDIC, to determine compliance with its rules and regulations, and to evaluate the safe and sound condition and operation of State savings associations. Regulatory reports are regulatory documents, not accounting documents.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Regulatory reporting requirements</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The instructions to regulatory reports are referred to as “regulatory reporting requirements.” Regulatory reporting requirements include, but are not limited to, the accounting instructions, guidance contained in FDIC regulations, financial institution letters, manuals, bulletins, examination handbooks, and safe and sound practices. Regulatory reporting requirements are not limited to the minimum requirements under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) because of the special supervisory, regulatory, and economic policy needs served by such reports. Regulatory reporting by State savings associations that purports to comply with GAAP shall incorporate the GAAP that best reflects the underlying economic substance of the transaction at issue. Regulatory reporting requirements shall, at a minimum:</P>
              <P>(i) Incorporate GAAP whenever GAAP is the referenced accounting instruction for regulatory reports to the Federal banking agencies;</P>
              <P>(ii) Incorporate safe and sound practices contained in FDIC regulations, financial institution letters, bulletins, examination handbooks, manuals, and instructions to regulatory reports; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Incorporate additional safety and soundness requirements more stringent than GAAP, as the FDIC may prescribe.</P>
              <P>(2) Exceptions. Regulatory reporting requirements that are not consistent with GAAP, if any, are not required to be reflected in the audited financial statements, including financial statements contained in securities filings submitted to the FDIC pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or subpart W and 12 CFR part 192.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Compliance.</E> When the FDIC determines that a State savings association's regulatory reports did not conform to regulatory reporting requirements in previous reporting periods, the association shall correct its regulatory reports in accordance with the directions of the FDIC.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Audit of State savings associations.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The FDIC may require, at any time, an independent audit of the financial statements of, or the application of procedures agreed upon by the FDIC to a State savings association, by qualified independent public accountants when needed for any safety and soundness reason identified by the FDIC.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Audits required for safety and soundness purposes.</E> The FDIC requires an independent audit for safety and soundness purposes:</P>
              <P>(1) If a State savings association has received a composite rating of 3, 4 or 5, as defined at § 390.101(c).</P>
              <P>(2) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Procedures.</E> (1) When the FDIC requires an independent audit because such an audit is needed for safety and soundness purposes, the FDIC shall determine whether the audit was conducted and filed in a manner satisfactory to the FDIC.<PRTPAGE P="429"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) The FDIC may waive the independent audit requirement described at paragraph (b)(1) of this section, if the FDIC determines that an audit would not provide further information on safety and soundness issues relevant to the examination rating.</P>
              <P>(3) When the FDIC requires the application of procedures agreed upon by the FDIC for safety and soundness purposes, the FDIC shall identify the procedures to be performed. The FDIC shall also determine whether the agreed upon procedures were conducted and filed in a manner satisfactory to the FDIC.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Qualifications for independent public accountants.</E> The audit shall be conducted by an independent public accountant who:</P>
              <P>(1) Is registered or licensed to practice as a public accountant, and is in good standing, under the laws of the state or other political subdivision of the United States in which the State savings association's or holding company's principal office is located;</P>
              <P>(2) Agrees in the engagement letter to provide the FDIC with access to and copies of any work papers, policies, and procedures relating to the services performed;</P>
              <P>(3)(i) Is in compliance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' (AICPA) Code of Professional Conduct; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Meets the independence requirements and interpretations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and its staff; and</P>
              <P>(4) Has received, or is enrolled in, a peer review program that meets guidelines acceptable to the FDIC.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Voluntary audits.</E> When a State savings association obtains an independent audit voluntarily, it must be performed by an independent public accountant who satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (d)(1), (2), and (3)(i) of this section.</P>

              <P>(a) No State savings association may, without application to and approval by the FDIC:</P>
              <P>(1) Combine with any insured depository institution, if the acquiring or resulting institution is to be a State savings association; or</P>
              <P>(2) Assume liability to pay any deposit made in, any insured depository institution.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) No State savings association may, without notifying the FDIC, as provided in paragraph (h)(1) of this section:</P>
              <P>(i) Combine with another insured depository institution where a State savings association is not the resulting institution; or</P>
              <P>(ii) In the case of a State savings association that meets the conditions for expedited treatment under § 390.101, convert, directly or indirectly, to a national or state bank.</P>
              <P>(2) A State savings association that does not meet the conditions for expedited treatment under § 390.101 may not, directly or indirectly, convert to a national or state bank without prior application to and approval of FDIC, as provided in paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section.</P>

              <P>(c) No State savings association may make any transfer (excluding transfers <PRTPAGE P="430"/>subject to paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section) without notice or application to the FDIC, as provided in paragraph (h)(2) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “transfer” means purchases or sales of assets or liabilities in bulk not made in the ordinary course of business including, but not limited to, transfers of assets or savings account liabilities, purchases of assets, and assumptions of deposit accounts or other liabilities, and combinations with a depository institution other than an insured depository institution.</P>
              <P>(d)(1) In determining whether to confer approval for a transaction under paragraphs (a), (b)(2), or (c) of this section, the FDIC shall take into account the following:</P>
              <P>(i) The capital level of any resulting State savings association;</P>
              <P>(ii) The financial and managerial resources of the constituent institutions;</P>
              <P>(iii) The future prospects of the constituent institutions;</P>
              <P>(iv) The convenience and needs of the communities to be served;</P>
              <P>(v) The conformity of the transaction to applicable law, regulation, and supervisory policies;</P>
              <P>(vi) Factors relating to the fairness of and disclosure concerning the transaction, including, but not limited to:</P>
              <P>(A) <E T="03">Equitable treatment.</E> The transaction should be equitable to all concerned—savings account holders, borrowers, creditors and stockholders (if any) of each State savings association—giving proper recognition of and protection to their respective legal rights and interests. The transaction will be closely reviewed for fairness where the transaction does not appear to be the result of arms' length bargaining or, in the case of a stock State savings association, where controlling stockholders are receiving different consideration from other stockholders. No finder's or similar fee should be paid to any officer, director, or controlling person of a State savings association which is a party to the transaction.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Full disclosure.</E> The filing should make full disclosure of all written or oral agreements or understandings by which any person or company will receive, directly or indirectly, any money, property, service, release of pledges made, or other thing of value, whether tangible or intangible, in connection with the transaction.</P>
              <P>(C) <E T="03">Compensation to officers.</E> Compensation, including deferred compensation, to officers, directors and controlling persons of the disappearing State savings association by the resulting institution or an affiliate thereof should not be in excess of a reasonable amount, and should be commensurate with their duties and responsibilities. The filing should fully justify the compensation to be paid to such persons. The transaction will be particularly scrutinized where any of such persons is to receive a material increase in compensation above that paid by the disappearing State savings association prior to the commencement of negotiations regarding the proposed transaction. An increase in compensation in excess of the greater of 15% or $10,000 gives rise to presumptions of unreasonableness and sale of control. In the case of such an increase, evidence sufficient to rebut such presumptions should be submitted.</P>
              <P>(D) <E T="03">Advisory boards.</E> Advisory board members should be elected for a term not exceeding one year. No advisory board fees should be paid to salaried officers or employees of the resulting State savings association. The filing should describe and justify the duties and responsibilities and any compensation paid to any advisory board of the resulting State savings association that consists of officers, directors or controlling persons of the disappearing institution, particularly if the disappearing institution experienced significant supervisory problems prior to the transaction. No advisory board fees should exceed the director fees paid by the resulting State savings association. Advisory board fees that are in excess of 115 percent of the director fees paid by the disappearing State savings association prior to commencement of negotiations regarding the transaction give rise to presumptions of unreasonableness and sale of control unless sufficient evidence to rebut such presumptions is submitted. Rebuttal evidence is not required if:<PRTPAGE P="431"/>
              </P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The advisory board fees do not exceed the fee that advisory board members of the resulting institution receive for each monthly meeting attended or $150, whichever is greater; or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The advisory board fees do not exceed $100 per meeting attended for disappearing State savings associations with assets greater than $10,000,000 or $50 per meeting attended for disappearing State savings associations with assets of $10,000,000 or less, based on a schedule of 12 meetings per year.</P>
              <P>(E) The accounting and tax treatment of the transaction; and</P>
              <P>(F) Fees paid and professional services rendered in connection with the transaction.</P>
              <P>(2) In conferring approval of a transaction under paragraph (a) of this section, the FDIC also will consider the competitive impact of the transaction, including whether:</P>
              <P>(i) The transaction would result in a monopoly, or would be in furtherance of any monopoly or conspiracy to monopolize or to attempt to monopolize the State savings association business in any part of the United States; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The effect of the transaction on any section of the country may be substantially to lessen competition, or tend to create a monopoly, or in any other manner would be in restraint of trade, unless the FDIC finds that the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the communities to be served.</P>
              <P>(3) Applications and notices filed under this section shall be upon forms prescribed by the FDIC.</P>
              <P>(4) Applications filed under paragraph (a) of this section must be processed in accordance with the time frames set forth in §§ 390.127 through 390.135, provided that the period for review may be extended only if the FDIC determines that the applicant has failed to furnish all requested information or that the information submitted is substantially inaccurate, in which case the review period may be extended for up to 30 days.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> A State savings association may enter into an employment contract with its officers and other employees only in accordance with the requirements of this section. All employment contracts shall be in writing and shall be approved specifically by a State savings association's board of directors. A State savings association shall not enter into an employment contract with any of its officers or other employees if such contract would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. The making of such an employment contract would be an unsafe or unsound practice if such contract could lead to material financial loss or damage to the State savings association or could interfere materially with the exercise by the members of its board of directors of their duty or discretion provided by law, charter, bylaw or regulation as to the employment or termination of employment of an officer or employee of the State savings association. This may occur, depending upon the circumstances of the case, where an employment contract provides for an excessive term.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Required provisions.</E> Each employment contract shall provide that:</P>
              <P>(1) The State savings association's board of directors may terminate the officer or employee's employment at any time, but any termination by the State savings association's board of directors other than termination for cause, shall not prejudice the officer or employee's right to compensation or other benefits under the contract. The officer or employee shall have no right to receive compensation or other benefits for any period after termination for cause. Termination for cause shall include termination because of the officer or employee's personal dishonesty, incompetence, willful misconduct, breach of fiduciary duty involving personal profit, intentional failure to perform stated duties, willful violation of any law, rule, or regulation (other than traffic violations or similar offenses) or final cease-and-desist order, or material breach of any provision of the contract.</P>
              <P>(2) If the officer or employee is suspended and/or temporarily prohibited from participating in the conduct of the State savings association's affairs by a notice served under section 8(e)(3) or (g)(1) of Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1818(e)(3) and (g)(1)), the State savings association's obligations under the contract shall be suspended as of the date of service unless stayed by appropriate proceedings. If the charges in the notice are dismissed, the State savings association may in its discretion:</P>
              <P>(i) Pay the officer or employee all or part of the compensation withheld while its contract obligations were suspended; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Reinstate (in whole or in part) any of its obligations which were suspended.</P>
              <P>(3) If the officer or employee is removed and/or permanently prohibited from participating in the conduct of the State savings association's affairs by an order issued under section 8 (e)(4) or (g)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1818 (e)(4) or (g)(1)), all obligations of the State savings association under the contract shall terminate as of the effective date of the order, but vested rights of the contracting parties shall not be affected.</P>

              <P>(4) If the State savings association is in default (as defined in section 3(x)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act), all obligations under the contract shall terminate as of the date of default, but this paragraph (b)(4) shall not affect any vested rights of the contracting parties: <E T="03">Provided,</E> that this paragraph (b)(4) need not be included in an employment contract if prior written approval is secured from the FDIC.</P>
              <P>(5)(i) All obligations under the contract shall be terminated, except to the extent determined that continuation of the contract is necessary of the continued operation of the State savings association</P>

              <P>(A) By the FDIC, at the time the FDIC enters into an agreement to provide assistance to or on behalf of the <PRTPAGE P="435"/>State savings association under the authority contained in 13(c) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act; or</P>
              <P>(B) By the FDIC, at the time the FDIC approves a supervisory merger to resolve problems related to operation of the State savings association or when the State savings association is determined by the FDIC to be in an unsafe or unsound condition.</P>
              <P>(ii) Any rights of the parties that have already vested, however, shall not be affected by such action.</P>

For purposes of this section, an employee pension plan is defined in section 3(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. The prospective obligation or liability of a plan sponsor to each plan participant shall be stated in or determinable from the plan, and, for a defined benefit plan, shall also be based upon an actuarial estimate of future experience under the plan.</P>

              <P>(1) Any such increase shall be for a period and amount determined by the sponsor's board of directors, but in no event shall it exceed the annual increase in the Consumer Price Index published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics; and</P>
              <P>(2) No increase shall be granted unless:</P>
              <P>(i) Anticipated charges to net income for future periods have first been found by such board of directors to be reasonable and are documented by appropriate resolution and supporting analysis; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The increase will not reduce the State savings association's regulatory capital below its regulatory capital requirement.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Termination.</E> The plan shall permit the sponsor's board of directors and its successors to terminate such plan. Notice of intent to terminate shall be filed with the FDIC at least 60 days prior to the proposed termination date.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Records.</E> Each State savings association maintaining a plan not subject to recordkeeping and reporting requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, and the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, shall establish and maintain records containing the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Plan description;</P>

              <P>(E) State the prohibition on the payment of dividends or interest at 12 U.S.C. 1828(b) and, in the case of subordinated debt securities, state the prohibition on the payment of principal and interest at 12 U.S.C. 1831o(h);</P>
              <P>(F) For subordinated debt securities, state or refer to a document stating the terms under which the State savings association may prepay the obligation; and</P>
              <P>(G) State or refer to a document stating that the State savings association must obtain FDIC approval before the voluntarily prepayment of principal on subordinated debt securities, the acceleration of payment of principal on subordinated debt securities, or the voluntarily redemption of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock (other than scheduled redemptions), if the State savings association is undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized as described in subpart H of part 324 of this chapter, fails to meet the regulatory capital requirements in part 324, or would fail to meet any of these standards following the payment.</P>
              <P>(ii) A State savings association must include such additional statements as the FDIC may prescribe for certificates, purchase agreements, indentures, and other related documents.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Maturity requirements.</E> Covered securities must have an original weighted average maturity or original weighted average period to required redemption of at least five years.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Mandatory prepayment.</E> Subordinated debt securities and related documents may not provide events of default or contain other provisions that could result in a mandatory prepayment of principal, other than events of default that:</P>
              <P>(i) Arise from the State savings association's failure to make timely payment of interest or principal;</P>
              <P>(ii) Arise from its failure to comply with reasonable financial, operating, and maintenance covenants of a type that are customarily included in indentures for publicly offered debt securities; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Relate to bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, or similar events.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Indenture.</E> (i) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, a State savings association must use an indenture for subordinated debt securities. If the aggregate amount of subordinated debt securities publicly offered (excluding sales in a non-public offering as defined in § 390.413 and sold in any consecutive 12-month or 36-month period exceeds $5,000,000 or $10,000,000 respectively (or such lesser amount <PRTPAGE P="438"/>that the Securities and Exchange Commission shall establish by rule or regulation under 15 U.S.C. 77ddd), the indenture must provide for the appointment of a trustee other than the State savings association or an affiliate of the State savings association (as defined at § 390.283) and for collective enforcement of the security holders' rights and remedies.</P>
              <P>(ii) A State savings association is not required to use an indenture if the subordinated debt securities are sold only to accredited investors, as that term is defined in 15 U.S.C. 77d(6). A State savings association must have an indenture that meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section in place before any debt securities for which an exemption from the indenture requirement is claimed, are transferred to any non-accredited investor. If a State savings association relies on this exemption from the indenture requirement, it must place a legend on the debt securities indicating that an indenture must be in place before the debt securities are transferred to any non-accredited investor.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">FDIC review.</E> (1) The FDIC will review notices and applications under §§ 390.126 through 390.135.</P>
              <P>(2) In reviewing notices and applications under this section, the FDIC will consider whether:</P>
              <P>(i) The issuance of the covered securities is authorized under applicable laws and regulations and is consistent with the State savings association's charter and bylaws.</P>
              <P>(ii) The State savings association is at least adequately capitalized under subpart H of part 324 of this chapter and meets the regulatory capital requirements in part 324.</P>
              <P>(iii) The State savings association is or will be able to service the covered securities.</P>
              <P>(iv) The covered securities are consistent with the requirements of this section.</P>
              <P>(v) The covered securities and related transactions sufficiently transfer risk from the Deposit Insurance Fund.</P>
              <P>(vi) The FDIC has no objection to the issuance based on the State savings association's overall policies, condition, and operations.</P>
              <P>(3) The FDIC approval or non-objection is conditioned upon no material changes to the information disclosed in the application or notice submitted to the FDIC. The FDIC may impose such additional requirements or conditions as it may deem necessary to protect purchasers, the State savings association, or the Deposit Insurance Fund.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Amendments.</E> If a State savings association amends the covered securities or related documents following the completion of the FDIC's review, it must obtain the FDIC's approval or non-objection under this section before it may include the amended securities in supplementary capital.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Sale of covered securities.</E> The State savings association must complete the sale of covered securities within one year after the FDIC's approval or non-objection under this section. A State savings association may request an extension of the offering period by filing a written request with the FDIC. The State savings association must demonstrate good cause for the extension and file the request at least 30 days before the expiration of the offering period or any extension of the offering period.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Reports.</E> A State savings association must file the following information with the FDIC within 30 days after the State savings association completes the sale of covered securities includable as supplementary capital. If the State savings association filed its application or notice following the completion of the sale, it must submit this information with its application or notice:</P>
              <P>(1) A written report indicating the number of purchasers, the total dollar amount of securities sold, the net proceeds received by the State savings association from the issuance, and the amount of covered securities, net of all expenses, to be included as supplementary capital;</P>
              <P>(2) Three copies of an executed form of the securities and a copy of any related documents governing the issuance or administration of the securities; and</P>

              <P>(3) A certification by the appropriate executive officer indicating that the State savings association complied <PRTPAGE P="439"/>with all applicable laws and regulations in connection with the offering, issuance, and sale of the securities.</P>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Immediate issuance of final directive.</E> If the FDIC finds it necessary in order to carry out the purposes of section 38 of the FDI Act, the FDIC may, without providing the notice prescribed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, issue a directive requiring a State savings association or any company that controls a State savings association immediately to take actions or to follow proscriptions described in section 38 that are within the FDIC's discretion to require or impose under section 38 of the FDI Act, including section 38(e)(5), (f)(2), (f)(3), or (f)(5). A State savings association or company that is subject to such an immediately effective directive may submit a written appeal of the directive to the FDIC. Such an appeal must be received by the FDIC within 14 calendar days of the issuance of the directive, unless the FDIC permits a longer period. The FDIC shall consider any such appeal, if filed in a timely matter, within 60 days of receiving the appeal. During such period of review, the directive shall remain in effect unless the FDIC, in its sole discretion, stays the effectiveness of the directive.</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Response to notice</E>—(1) <E T="03">Time for response.</E> A State savings association or company may file a written response to a notice of intent to issue a directive within the time period set by the FDIC. The date shall be at least 14 calendar days from the date of the notice unless the FDIC determines that a shorter period is appropriate in light of the financial condition of the State savings association or other relevant circumstances.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Content of response.</E> The response should include:</P>
              <P>(i) An explanation why the action proposed by the FDIC is not an appropriate exercise of discretion under section 38;</P>
              <P>(ii) Any recommended modification of the proposed directive; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Any other relevant information, mitigating circumstances, documentation, or other evidence in support of the position of the State savings association or company regarding the proposed directive.</P>

              <P>(1) Issue the directive as proposed or in modified form;</P>

              <P>(e) <E T="03">Failure to file response.</E> Failure by a State savings association or company to file with the FDIC, within the specified time period, a written response to a proposed directive shall constitute a waiver of the opportunity to respond and shall constitute consent to the issuance of the directive.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Request for modification or rescission of directive.</E> Any State savings association or company that is subject to a directive under this subpart, upon a change in circumstances, request in writing that the FDIC reconsider the terms of the directive, and may propose that the directive be rescinded or modified. Unless otherwise ordered by the FDIC, the directive shall continue in place while such request is pending before the FDIC.</P>

          <P>(a) This regulation of the Export-Import Bank (the Bank) implements executive orders which govern the classification, declassification, and safeguarding of national security information and material of the United States. This regulation is based on Executive Order 12356, National Security Information, April 2, 1982 (3 CFR, 1982 Comp. p. 166) (hereafter referred to as the <E T="03">Order</E>), Information Security Oversight Directive No. 1, June 25, 1982 (32 CFR part 2001) (hereafter referred to as the <E T="03">Directive</E>), and National Security Decision Directive 84, “Safeguarding National Security Information,” signed by the President on March 11, 1983 (hereafter referred to as <E T="03">NSDD 84</E>). Violation of the provisions of part 403 may result in the imposition of administrative penalties, and civil and criminal penalties under applicable law. Executive Order 12356 prescribes a uniform system for classifying, declassifying, and safeguarding national security information. It recognizes that it is essential that the public be informed concerning the activities of the Government, but that the interests of the United States and its citizens require that certain information concerning the national defense and foreign relations be protected against unauthorized disclosure. Information may not be classified under the Order unless its disclosure reasonably could be expected to cause damage to the national security.</P>
          <P>(b) For the purposes of the Order, the Directive and these guidelines, the following terms shall have the meanings specified below:</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Information</E> means any information or material, regardless of its physical form or characteristics, that is owned by, produced by or for, or is under the control of the United States Government.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">National security information</E> means information that has been determined pursuant to this Order or any predecessor order to require protection against unauthorized disclosure and that is so designated.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Foreign government information</E> means: (i) Information provided by a foreign government or governments, an international organization of governments, or any element thereof with the expectation, expressed or implied, that <PRTPAGE P="476"/>the information, the source of the information, or both, are to be held in confidence; or</P>
          <P>(ii) Information produced by the United States pursuant to or as a result of a joint arrangement with a foreign government or governments or an international organization of governments, or any element thereof, requiring that the information, the arrangement, or both, are to be held in confidence.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">National security</E> means the national defense or foreign relations of the United States.</P>
          <P>(5) <E T="03">Confidential source</E> means any individual or organization that has provided, or that may reasonably be expected to provide, information to the United States on matters pertaining to the national security with the expectation, expressed or implied, that the information or relationship, or both, be held in confidence.</P>
          <P>(6) <E T="03">Original classification</E> means an initial determination that information requires, in the interest of national security, protection against unauthorized disclosure, together with a classification designation signifying the level of protection required.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Responsibilities.</SUBJECT>
          <P>In the carrying out of security procedures, responsibility falls on all personnel generally and on certain personnel in a more particular manner.</P>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Individual.</E> Each employee of the Bank having access to classified material has an individual responsibility to protect such information. Classified information should be secured in approved equipment or facilities whenever it is not under the direct control of the employee.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Office and Division Heads.</E> These officials have the additional responsibility of a continuing review for ascertaining that security procedures are properly observed by the personnel comprising their respective offices.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Security Officer.</E> (1) The Security Officer has the responsibility for developing, inspecting, and advising on procedures and controls for safeguarding classified material originating in, received by, in transit through, or in custody of the Bank; the training and orientation of employees; the carrying out of inspections; and the destruction of obsolete and non-record material.</P>
          <P>(2) The Security Officer shall be responsible for disseminating written material and conducting oral briefings to inform Bank personnel of the Order, Directive, and regulations. An explanation of the practical application of these procedures and the underlying policy objectives thereof shall be emphasized.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Security Committee.</E> (1) This Committee consists of the General Counsel, as Chairperson, the Security Officer, and other Bank employees, as designated by the President and Chairman (hereinafter referred to as the <E T="03">Chairman)</E> and is responsible for the implementation and enforcement of the Order and the Directive. This Committee will act on all matters with respect to the Bank's administration of these regulations.</P>
          <P>(2) All suggestions and complaints regarding the Bank's Information Security Program, including those regarding over-classification, failure to declassify, or delay in declassifying, not otherwise provided for herein, shall be referred to the Security Committee for review.</P>
          <P>(3) The Security Committee shall have responsibility for recommending to the Chairman appropriate administrative action to correct abuse or violation of these regulations or of any provision of the Order or Directive thereunder, including but not limited to notification by warning letter, formal suspension without pay, and removal. Upon receipt of such a recommendation, the Chairman shall make a decision and advise the Security Committee of this action.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 403.3</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Classification principles and authority.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Classification Principles.</E> (1) Except as provided in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, the Order provides the only basis for classifying national security information. Information held by the Bank will be made available to the public to the extent possible consistent with the need to protect the national defense or foreign relations, as required by the interests of the United <PRTPAGE P="477"/>States and its citizens. Accordingly, security classification shall be applied only to protect the national security.</P>
          <P>(2) Before a classification determination is made, each item of information that may require protection shall be identified exactly. This requires identification of that specific information, disclosure of which could affect the national security. When there is reasonable doubt about the need to classify, the information should be safeguarded as if it were confidential until a final determination is made by an authorized classifier as to its classification. The final determination must be made within thirty (30) days.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Classification Designations.</E> Information which requires protection against unauthorized disclosure in the interest of national security (<E T="03">classified information</E>) shall be classified at one of the following three levels:</P>
          <P>(1) TOP SECRET shall be applied only to information, the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security.</P>
          <P>(2) SECRET shall be applied only to information, the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause serious damage to the national security.</P>
          <P>(3) CONFIDENTIAL shall be applied to information, the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause damage to the national security.</P>
          <FP>Except as provided by statute, no other terms, such as <E T="03">SENSITIVE, OFFICIAL BUSINESS ONLY, AGENCY, BUSINESS, ADMINISTRATIVELY,</E> etc., shall be used within the Bank in conjunction with any of the three classification levels defined above.</FP>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Original Classification Authority and Criteria.</E> (1) The Bank's authority to assign original classification to any document is limited as follows and is nondelegable:</P>

          <P>(2) A determination to classify information shall be made by an original classification authority when the information concerns one or more of categories (i) through (x) of this paragraph, and when the unauthorized disclosure of the information, either by itself or in the context of other information, reasonably could be expected to cause damage to the national security. Information shall be considered for classification if it concerns:</P>
          <P>(i) Military plans, weapons, or operations;</P>
          <P>(ii) The vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems, installations, projects, or plans relating to the national security;</P>
          <P>(iii) Foreign government information;</P>
          <P>(iv) Intelligence activities (including special activities), or intelligence sources or methods;</P>
          <P>(v) Foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States;</P>
          <P>(vi) Scientific, technological, or economic matters relating to the national security;</P>
          <P>(vii) United States Government programs for safeguarding nuclear materials or facilities;</P>
          <P>(viii) Cryptology;</P>
          <P>(ix) A confidential source; or</P>
          <P>(x) Other categories of information that are related to the national security and that require protection against unauthorized disclosure as determined by the President of the United States, by the Chairman or by other officials who have been delegated original classification authority by the President. Recommendations concerning the need to designate additional categories of information that may be considered for classification shall be forwarded through the Security Officer to the Chairman for determination. Such a determination shall be reported to the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office.</P>

          <P>(3) Information that is determined to concern one or more of the above categories shall be classified when an original classification authority also determines that its unauthorized disclosure, either by itself or in the context of other information, reasonably could be expected to cause damage to <PRTPAGE P="478"/>the national security. Accordingly, certain information which would otherwise be unclassified may require classification when associated with other unclassified or classified information. Classification on this basis shall be supported by a written explanation that, at a minimum, shall be maintained with the file or reference on the recent copy of the information.</P>
          <P>(4) Unauthorized disclosure of foreign government information, the identity of a confidential foreign source, or disclosure of intelligence sources or methods is presumed to cause damage to the national security.</P>
          <P>(5) Information classified in accordance with the above classification categories shall not be declassified automatically as a result of any unofficial publication or inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure in the United States or abroad of identical or similar information.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Duration of Original Classification.</E> (1) Information shall be classified as long as required by national security considerations. When it can be determined, a specific date or event for declassification shall be set by the original classification authority at the time the information is originally classified. If the date or event for declassification cannot be determined at the time of classification, the standard notation “Originating Agency's Determination Required”, or its abbreviation “OADR”, should be entered on the “Declassify on” line.</P>
          <P>(2) Automatic declassification determinations under predecessor orders shall remain valid unless the classification is extended by an authorized declassification authority. These extensions may be by individual documents or categories of information, provided, however, that any extension of classification on other than an individual document basis shall be reported to the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office. The declassification authority shall be responsible for notifying holders of the information of such extensions.</P>
          <P>(3) Information classified under predecessor orders and marked for declassification review shall remain classified until reviewed for declassification under the provisions of the Order.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Marking and Identification.</E> (1) Classified information must be marked, or otherwise identified, to inform and warn the holder of the information of its sensitivity. The classifier is responsible for ensuring that proper classification markings are applied. At the time of classification, the following information shall be shown on the face of all classified documents, or clearly associated with other forms of classified information in a manner appropriate to the medium involved, unless this information itself would reveal a confidential source or relationship not otherwise evident in the document or information:</P>
          <P>(i) One of the three classification levels defined in § 403.3(b); “(TS)” for Top Secret, “(S)” for Secret, “(C)” for Confidential, and “(U)” for Unclassified; with each page marked at top and bottom according to the highest level of classified information on each page.</P>
          <P>(ii) The identity of the original classification authority if other than the person whose name appears as the approving or signing official;</P>
          <P>(iii) The agency and office of origin; and</P>
          <P>(iv) The date or event for declassification, or the notation “Originating Agency's Determination Required.”</P>
          <P>(2) Each classified document shall, by marking or other means, indicate which portions are classified, with the applicable classification level, and which portions are not classified. The Chairman may, for good cause, grant and revoke waivers of this requirement for specified classes of documents or information. The Director of the Information Security Oversight Office shall be notified of any waivers.</P>
          <P>(3) Marking designations implementing the provisions of the Order, including abbreviations, shall conform to the standards prescribed in implementing directives issued by the Information Security Oversight Office. All authorized classifiers shall be issued a uniform stamp that has a “Classified by” line and a “Declassify on” line.</P>

          <P>(4) Documents that contain foreign government information shall include either the marking, “FOREIGN GOVERNMENT INFORMATION”, or a marking that otherwise indicates that the information is foreign government <PRTPAGE P="479"/>information. If that fact must be concealed, the document will be marked as if it were of U.S. origin. Foreign government information shall either retain its original classification or be assigned a United States classification that shall ensure a degree of protection at least equivalent to that required by the entity that furnished the information.</P>
          <P>(5) Documents that contain information relating to intelligence sources or methods shall include the following marking unless proscribed by the Director of the Central Intelligence; WARNING NOTICE—INTELLIGENCE SOURCES OR METHODS INVOLVED.</P>
          <P>(6) Information assigned a level of classification under predecessor orders shall be considered as classified at that level of classification despite the omission of other required markings. Omitted markings may be inserted on a document by the General Counsel or the Security Officer.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Limitations on Classification.</E> (1) In no case shall information be classified in order to conceal violations of law, inefficiency, or administrative error; to prevent embarrassment to a person, organization, or agency; to restrain competition; or to prevent or delay the release of information that does not require protection in the interest of national security.</P>
          <P>(2) Basic scientific research information not clearly related to the national security may not be classified.</P>
          <P>(3) The Chairman or other authorized original classifiers may reclassify information previously declassified and disclosed if it is determined in writing that—</P>
          <P>(i) The information requires protection in the interest of national security, and</P>
          <P>(ii) The information may reasonably be recovered.
          </P>
          <FP>In making such determination, the Chairman or any other authorized original classifier shall consider the following factors: The lapse of time following disclosure; the nature and extent of disclosure; the ability to bring the fact of reclassification to the attention of persons to whom the information was disclosed; the ability to prevent further disclosure; and the ability to retrieve the information voluntarily from persons not authorized access to its reclassified state. These reclassification actions shall be reported promptly to the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office.</FP>
          <P>(4) Information may be classified or reclassified after an agency has received a request for it under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) or the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), or the mandatory review provisions of the Order and these regulations, if such classification meets the requirements of the Order and is accomplished personally and on a document-by-document basis by the Chairman, the Vice Chairman, or the Security Officer.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Derivative classification.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Use of derivative classification.</E> (1) Unlike original classification which is an initial determination, derivative classification is an incorporation, paraphrasing, restatement, or generation in new form of information that is already classified. Derivative classification is the responsibility of those who only reproduce, extract, or summarize classified information, or who only apply classification markings derived from source material or as directed by a classification guide. Original classification authority is not required for derivative classification.</P>
          <P>(2) Persons who apply such derivative classification markings shall:</P>
          <P>(i) Respect original classification decisions;</P>
          <P>(ii) Verify the information's current level of classification so far as practicable before applying the markings; and</P>
          <P>(iii) Carry forward to any newly created documents the assigned dates or events for declassification or review. The latest date for declassification should be entered in the case of multiple source documents.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">New Material.</E> (1) New material that derives its classification from information classified on or after the effective date of the Order, April 2, 1982, shall be marked with the declassification date or event, or the date for review, as assigned to the source information.<PRTPAGE P="480"/>
          </P>
          <P>(2) New material that derives its classification under prior orders shall be treated as follows:</P>
          <P>(i) If the source material bears a classification date or event 20 years or less from the date or origin, that date or event shall be carried forward on the new material.</P>
          <P>(ii) If the source material bears no declassification date or event or is marked for declassification beyond 20 years, the new material shall be marked with a date for review for declassification at 20 years from the date of original classification of the source material.</P>
          <P>(iii) If the source material is foreign government information bearing no date or event for declassification or is marked for declassification beyond 30 years, the new material shall be marked for review for declassification at 30 years from the date of original classification of the source materials.</P>
          <P>(iv) A copy of the source document or documents should be maintained with the file copy of the new document or documents which have been derivatively classified.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Declassification and downgrading.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Authority and policy for declassification and downgrading.</E> Information that continues to meet the classification requirements prescribed in § 403.3(c) despite the passage of time will continue to be safeguarded. However, information which is properly classified at the time it is developed may not necessarily require protection indefinitely. National security information over which the Bank exercises final classification jurisdiction shall be declassified or downgraded as soon as national security considerations permit. Information shall be declassified or downgraded by:</P>
          <P>(1) The official who authorized the original classification, if that official is still serving in the same position, by a successor, or by a supervisory official of either; or</P>
          <P>(2) Officials specifically delegated this authority in writing by the Chairman or by the Security Officer. A list of those who may be so delegated shall be maintained by the Security Officer.</P>
          <P>(3) If the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office determines that information is unlawfully classified, the Director may require the Export-Import Bank to declassify it. Any such decision by the Director may be appealed to the National Security Council. The information shall remain classified until the appeal is decided.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Declassification Procedure.</E> Information marked with a specific declassification date or event shall be declassified on that date or upon occurrence of that event. The overall classification markings shall be lined through a statement placed on the cover or first page to indicate the declassification authority, by name and title, and the date of declassification. If practicable, the classification markings on each page shall be cancelled; otherwise, the statement on the cover or first page shall indicate that the declassification applies to the entire document.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Notification to Holders.</E> When classified information has been properly marked with specific dates or events for declassification it is not necessary to issue notices of declassification to any holders. However, when declassification action is taken earlier than originally scheduled, or the duration of classification is extended, the authority making such changes shall promptly notify all holders to whom the information was originally transmitted. This notification shall include the marking action to be taken, the authority for the change (name and title), and the effective date of the change. Upon receipt of notification, recipients shall make the proper changes and shall notify holders to whom they have transmitted the classified information.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Downgrading.</E> Information designated a particular level of classification may be assigned a lower classification level by the original classifier or by an official authorized to declassify the same information. Prompt notice of such downgrading shall be provided to known holders of the information. Classified information marked for automatic downgrading under previous Executive Orders shall be reviewed to determine that it no longer continues to meet classification requirements despite the passage of time.<PRTPAGE P="481"/>
          </P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Transferred Information.</E> Classified information transferred from one agency to another in conjunction with a transfer of functions, and not merely for storage purposes, shall be considered under the control of the receiving agency for purposes of downgrading and declassification, subject to consultation with any other agency that has an interest in the subject matter of the information. Prior to forwarding classified information to an approved storage facility of the Bank, to a Federal records center, or to the National Archives for permanent preservation, the information shall be reviewed for downgrading or declassification.</P>

          <P>(a) Classified information under the jurisdiction of the Bank shall be reviewed for declassification upon receipt of a request by a United States citizen or permanent resident alien, a Federal agency, or a State or local government. A request for mandatory review of classified information shall be submitted in writing and describe the information with sufficient particularity to locate it with a reasonable amount of effort. Requests may be addressed to the:

          </EXTRACT>
          
          <P>(b) The Bank's response to mandatory review requests will be governed by the amount of search and review time required to process the request. The Bank will acknowledge receipt of all requests, and will inform the requester if additional time is needed to process the request. Except in unusual circumstances, the Bank will make a final determination within one year from the date of receipt of the request.</P>
          <P>(c) When information cannot be declassified in its entirety, the Bank will make a reasonable effort to release, consistent with other applicable laws, those declassified portions that constitute a coherent segment.</P>
          <P>(d) The bank shall determine whether information under the classification jurisdiction of the Bank or any reasonably segregable portion of it no longer requires protection. If so, the General Counsel shall promptly make such information available to the requester, and shall inform the requester of any fees due before releasing the document. If the information may not be released, in whole or in part, the General Counsel shall give the requester a brief statement of the reasons, and a notice, mailed with return receipt requested, of the right to appeal the determination within 60 days of the denial letter's receipt.</P>
          <P>(e) The agency that initially received or classified records containing foreign government information shall be responsible for making a declassification determination on review requests for classified records which contain such foreign government information. Such requests shall be referred to the appropriate agency for action.</P>
          <P>(f) When the Bank receives a mandatory declassification review request for records in its possession that were originated by another agency, it shall forward the request to that agency. The Bank may request notification of the declassification determination.</P>
          <P>(g) Information originated by a President, the White House staff, by committees, commissions, or boards appointed by the President, or other specifically providing advice and counsel to a President or acting on behalf of a President is exempted from the provisions of mandatory review for declassification, except as consistent with applicable laws that pertain to presidential papers or records.</P>

(<E T="03">See,</E> 12 CFR part 404 and 12 CFR part 405, respectively.) In any case, however, exemptions under the Freedom of Information Act or other exemptions under applicable law may be invoked by the Bank to deny material on grounds other than classification.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Safeguarding.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">General Access Requirements.</E> Except as provided in § 403.10(c), access to classified information shall be granted in accordance with the following:</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Determination of Trustworthiness.</E> No person shall be given access to classified information or material unless a favorable determination has been made as to his trustworthiness. The determination of eligibility, referred to as a security clearance, shall be based on such investigations as the Bank may require in accordance with the standards and criteria of applicable law and Executive orders.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Determination of Need to Know.</E> In addition to a security clearance, a person must have a need for access to the particular classified information or material sought in connection with the performance of official duties or contractual obligations. The determination of that need shall be made by officials having responsibility for the classified information or material.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement.</E> All persons with authorized access to classified information shall be required to sign a nondisclosure agreement, Standard Form 189, as a <PRTPAGE P="483"/>condition of access. This form shall be retained in the security file of the individual for 50 years.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Access by Historical Researchers and Former Presidential Appointees.</E> The Bank shall obtain written agreements from requesters to safeguard the information to which they are given access as permitted by the Order and written consent to the Bank's review of their notes and manuscripts for the purpose of determining that no classified information is contained therein. A determination of trustworthiness is a pre-condition to a requester's access. If the access requested by historical researchers and former Presidential Appointees requires the rendering of services for which fair and equitable fees may be charged pursuant to title 5 of the Independent Offices Appropriations Act, 65 Stat. 290, 31 U.S.C. 483a (1976), the requester shall be so notified and the fees may be imposed.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Media Contacts.</E> All contacts by members of the media which concern classified information shall be directed to the attention of the Security Officer, Room 1031, Export-Import Bank of the United States, 811 Vermont Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20571.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Dissemination.</E> Except as otherwise provided by directives issued by the President through the National Security Council, classified information originating in another agency and in the possession of the Bank may not be disseminated outside the Bank without the consent of the originating agency.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Accountability Procedures.</E> Dissemination of various levels of classified information or material shall be within the control and responsibility of designated control officers. Particularly stringent controls shall be placed on information and material classified as TOP SECRET.</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">TOP SECRET.</E> Designated as TOP SECRET control officers are the Chairman, Vice Chairman and the Security Officer who alone have authority to receive TOP SECRET information for the Bank. Other personnel authorized in writing by the Chairman or Security Officer also may receive TOP SECRET information for the Bank. It shall be the responsibility of these individuals with respect to all TOP SECRET information:</P>
          <P>(i) To receive the material for the Bank;</P>
          <P>(ii) To maintain registers which will reflect the routing of the material and the return thereof in a reasonable length of time for security storage;</P>
          <P>(iii) To dispatch and make record of material disseminated to authorize persons outside the Bank;</P>
          <P>(iv) To make a physical inventory of all material at least annually; and</P>
          <P>(v) To maintain current access records.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">SECRET.</E> Designated as SECRET control officers are the Security Officer and the Analysis, Records &amp; Communications Manager, who have the responsibility with respect to all information classified in this category:</P>
          <P>(i) To receive the material for the Bank;</P>
          <P>(ii) To maintain registers which will reflect the routing of the material and the return thereof in a reasonable length of time for security storage;</P>
          <P>(iii) To dispatch and make record of material disseminated to authorized persons outside the Bank;</P>
          <P>(iv) To maintain current access records.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">CONFIDENTIAL.</E> Designated as CONFIDENTIAL control officers are the Security Officer and the Analysis, Records &amp; Communications Manager who have responsibility with respect to all information classified in this category:</P>
          <P>(i) To review material for the Bank;</P>
          <P>(ii) To route the material to proper Bank offices;</P>
          <P>(iii) To dispatch and make record of material disseminated to authorized persons outside the Bank;</P>
          <P>(iv) To maintain current access records.</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Storage.</E> Classified information shall be stored only in facilities or under conditions adequate to prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to it and in accordance with the Directive as well as General Services Administration standards and specifications. Reference may be made to 32 CFR 2001.41, 2001.43 for preliminary guidance regarding these standards and specifications.</P>
          <P>(h) <E T="03">Coversheets.</E> Department of State (DSC) classified incoming cables are to <PRTPAGE P="484"/>be logged in and routed to the appropriate offices in double envelopes. When these cables are being used in various offices, classified coversheets must be used to protect the documents. This practice eliminates the possibility of inadvertently mixing classified with non-classified material, and promotes security awareness. Coversheets are obtainable from the Office of the Security Director.</P>
          <P>(i) <E T="03">Transmittal.</E> (1) To be transmitted outside the Bank, all classified documents must be sent through the Security Office and have attached EIB Form 71-2, approved by one of the following: the President and Chairman, First Vice President and Vice Chairman, a Senior Vice President, General Counsel, Vice President or Security Officer.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Preparation and Receipting.</E> Classified information shall be enclosed in opaque inner and outer covers before transmitting. The inner cover shall be a sealed wrapper or envelope plainly marked with the assigned classification and addresses of both sender and addressee. Transmittal documents shall indicate on their face the highest level of any information transmitted, and must clearly state whether or not the transmittal document itself is classified after removal of enclosures and attachments. The outer cover shall be sealed and addressed with no identification of the classification of its contents. A receipt shall be attached to or enclosed in the inner cover, except that CONFIDENTIAL information shall require a receipt only if the sender deems it necessary. The receipt shall identify the sender, addressee, and the document but shall contain no classified information. It shall be immediately signed by the recipient and returned to the sender. Any of these wrapping and receipting requirements may be waived by agency heads under conditions that will provide adequate protection and prevent access by unauthorized persons.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Transmittal of CONFIDENTIAL information.</E> CONFIDENTIAL information shall be transmitted within and between the fifty States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and U.S. territories or possessions by one of the means established for higher classifications, or by United States Postal Service, certified first class, or express mail service, when prescribed by an agency head. Outside these areas, CONFIDENTIAL information shall be transmitted only as is authorized for higher classification levels.</P>
          <P>(4) Transmittal of TOP SECRET and SECRET information shall be in accordance with the Directive. Reference may be made to 32 CFR 2001.44 for preliminary guidance.</P>
          <P>(j) <E T="03">Destruction.</E> Classified information no longer needed in working files or for record or reference purposes shall be processed for appropriate disposition in accordance with Chapters 21 and 33 of title 44 U.S.C., when govern disposition of Federal Records. All classified information approved for destruction must be torn and placed in containers designated as burnbags which are available through the Office Services Section of the Bank. Destruction of such information will be carried out by the Security Officer or a designee by use of a disintegrator or by burning. The method of destruction selected must preclude recognition or reconstruction of the classified information or material. Records of destruction will be maintained by the Security Office for TOP SECRET information and material with serialized markings or material for which there is a special need to record its destruction.</P>
          <P>(k) <E T="03">Reproduction controls.</E> (1) Reproduction of classified documents is prohibited, except by personnel authorized in writing by the Chairman or Security Officer.</P>
          <P>(2) TOP SECRET documents may not be reproduced without the consent of the originating agency unless otherwise marked by the originating office.</P>
          <P>(3) Reproduction of SECRET and CONFIDENTIAL documents may be restricted by the originating agency.</P>
          <P>(4) Reproduced copies of classified documents are subject to the same accountability and controls as the original documents.</P>

          <P>(5) Records shall be maintained by the Security Officer to show the number and distribution or reproduced copies of all TOP SECRET documents, of all documents covered by special access programs distributed outside the <PRTPAGE P="485"/>originating agency, and all SECRET and all CONFIDENTIAL documents which are marked with special dissemination and reproduction limitations.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 403.11</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Enforcement and investigation procedures.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Loss or Possible Compromise.</E> Any person who has knowledge of the loss or possible compromise of classified information shall immediately report the circumstances to the Security Officer of the Bank. In turn, the originating agency shall be notified about the loss or compromise in order that a damage assessment may be conducted and appropriate measures taken to negate or minimize any adverse effect, and prevent further such loss or compromise. An immediate inquiry shall be initiated by the Bank for the purposes: (1) Of determining cause and responsibility and (2) taking corrective measures and appropriate administrative, disciplinary, or legal action.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Reporting and Investigating Unauthorized Disclosures.</E> (1) Employees who have reason to believe that an unauthorized disclosure of classified information has occurred shall report the disclosure to their supervisor, who shall inform the Security Officer.</P>
          <P>(2) The Bank shall promptly notify the Information Security Oversight Office at the General Services Administration, Washington, DC 20405, of all unauthorized disclosures of classified information.</P>
          <P>(3) If the Bank believes that it is the source of an unauthorized disclosure of classified information that it originated, it shall evaluate the disclosure under paragraph (b)(7) of this section. If the disclosure is serious, the Bank shall report the disclosure and the results of the evaluation to the Department of Justice together with notification that it is conducting an internal investigation.</P>
          <P>(4) If the Bank believes that it is the source of an unauthorized disclosure of classified information that it handled but did not originate, it shall report the disclosure to the Department of Justice and to the originating agency(ies) or department(s) for evaluation under paragraph (b)(7) of this section. If the Bank cannot determine the identity of the originating agency(ies) or department(s), it shall report the disclosure to the Department of Justice together with any information or reasonable inferences as to the identity of the originating agency(ies) or department(s).</P>
          <P>(5) If the Bank receives a request for an evaluation of information it originated, it shall, if the evaluation shows the disclosure was serious, inform the agency(ies) or department(s) from which the disclosure occurred of this conclusion and request that the agency(ies) or department(s) conduct an internal investigation.</P>
          <P>(6) If the Bank determines that an unauthorized disclosure of classified information has occurred but that it neither originated, handled nor disclosed the information, it shall report the disclosure to the likely originating agency(ies) or department(s).</P>
          <P>(7) In determining whether a disclosure is sufficiently serious to warrant reporting to the Department of Justice, the Bank, if it is the originating agency, shall ascertain the nature of the disclosed information, determine the extent to which it disseminated the information and evaluate the disclosure to determine whether it seriously damages its mission and responsibilities. In evaluating the damage caused by the disclosure, the Bank shall consider such matters as whether the disclosure jeopardizes an ongoing project, operation or source of information and to what extent the policy goals underlying the project or operation must be altered.</P>

          <P>(8) In any instance where the Bank is determined to be the source of an unauthorized disclosure and an evaluation by the Bank or the originating agency(ies) or department(s) determines the disclosure to be of a serious nature, an internal investigation will be initiated and an investigation report, containing such information as may be required by the Department of Justice, will be submitted to the Department of Justice within 15 days after notification from the originating agency or Department of Justice, but in any case no later than 30 days. If the investigation report is not completed within 15 days, the Bank shall submit as much of the required information as is available at that time and furnish <PRTPAGE P="486"/>additional information as it is developed.</P>
          <P>(9) Whenever the Bank determines during the course of an investigation that it is necessary to compel or induce the cooperation of an employee, the Bank shall first consult with the Department of Justice. The Department of Justice will coordinate with the Bank to determine the procedures the Bank may use to compel an employee's participation without foreclosing possible criminal proceedings.</P>
          <P>(10) The Bank shall maintain records of all disclosures that have been reported or investigated.</P>
          <P>(11) All employees shall cooperate fully with officials of the Bank or other agencies who are conducting investigations of unauthorized disclosures of classified information.</P>
          <P>(12) Employees determined by the Bank to have knowingly participated in an unauthorized disclosure of classified information or who have refused to cooperate with an investigation of such a disclosure shall be denied further access to classified information and shall be subject to other appropriate administrative sanctions. Prior to taking action against an employee in connection with the unauthorized disclosure or classified information, the Bank shall consult with the Department of Justice, National Security Division.</P>

            <SUBJECT>General provisions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> This subpart establishes policy, procedures, requirements, and responsibilities for administration of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552, at the Export-Import Bank of the United States (Ex-Im Bank).</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Policy.</E> It is Ex-Im Bank's policy to honor all requests for the disclosure of its records, provided that disclosure would not adversely affect a legitimate public or private interest and would not impose an unreasonable burden on Ex-Im Bank. However, this subpart also recognizes that the soundness of many Ex-Im Bank programs depends upon the receipt of reliable commercial, technical, financial, and business information relating to applicants for Ex-Im Bank assistance and that receipt of such information depends on Ex-Im Bank's ability to hold such information in confidence. Consequently, except as provided by applicable law and this regulation, information provided to Ex-Im Bank in confidence will not be disclosed without the submitter's consent.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Scope.</E> All record requests made to Ex-Im Bank shall be processed under this subpart, except that information customarily furnished to the public in the regular course of the performance of official duties may continue to be furnished to the public without complying with this subpart. Requests made by individuals under the Privacy Act of 1974 which are processed under subpart B of this part also shall be processed under this subpart A.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Ex-Im Bank Internet site.</E> Ex-Im Bank maintains an Internet site at <E T="03">http://www.exim.gov.</E> The site contains information on Ex-Im Bank functions, activities, programs, and transactions. Web site visitors have access to Board of Directors and Loan Committee meeting minutes, country information, and Ex-Im Bank press releases, among other information. Ex-Im Bank encourages all prospective FOIA requesters to visit the site prior to submission of a FOIA request.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Delegation.</E> Any action or determination in this subpart which is the responsibility of a specific Ex-Im Bank employee, may be delegated to a duly designated alternate.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Ex-Im Bank address.</E> The Export-Import Bank of the United States is located at 811 Vermont Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20571.</P>

Requesters shall be responsible for the cost of duplicating such material in accordance with the provisions of § 404.9(e). Persons desiring to use the reading room should contact the Ex-Im Bank Freedom of Information and Privacy Office, either in writing at the address at § 404.1(f) or by telephone at (202) 565-3946 or (800) 565-3946, to arrange a time to inspect the available records.</P>

Requests should be addressed to the Freedom of Information and Privacy Office at the address in § 404.1(f) and should contain both the return address and telephone number of the requester.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Description of records requested.</E> Each request must describe the records sought in sufficient detail so as to enable a professional employee of Ex-Im Bank familiar with the subject matter of the request to locate the record with a reasonable amount of effort. A request shall not be deemed to have been received until such time as the request adequately identifies the records sought. To the extent practicable, a description should include relevant dates, format, subject matter, and the name of any person to whom the record is known to relate. A general request for records with no accompanying date restriction, either express or implied, shall be deemed to be a request for records created within the preceding twelve months.<PRTPAGE P="489"/>
            </P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Fee statement.</E> The request must contain a statement expressing willingness to pay fees for the requested records or a request for a fee waiver (see § 404.10) before the request shall be deemed to have been received. A fee statement may specify the maximum amount a requester is willing to pay for processing the request.</P>
            <P>(1) Whenever a requester submits a FOIA request that does not contain a fee statement or a request for a fee waiver, Ex-Im Bank shall advise the requester of the requirements of this paragraph. If the requester fails to respond within ten working days of such notification, then the Freedom of Information and Privacy Office shall notify the requester, in writing, that Ex-Im Bank will not process the request.</P>
            <P>(2) A general statement by the requester expressing willingness to pay all applicable fees under § 404.9 shall be deemed an agreement to pay up to $50.00. If Ex-Im Bank estimates that the fees for a request will exceed $50.00, then Ex-Im Bank shall offer the requester the opportunity to agree, in writing, either to pay a greater fee or to modify the request as a means of limiting the cost.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Written notice of amendment.</E> The requester should provide any amendment to the original request in writing to Ex-Im Bank.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Requester assistance.</E> Ex-Im Bank shall make reasonable efforts to assist a requester in complying with the requirements of this section.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Ex-Im Bank shall respond to requests within twenty working days of the date of receipt of the request unless unusual circumstances exist. Ex-Im Bank shall provide written notice to the requester whenever such unusual circumstances necessitate an extension. If the extension is expected to exceed ten working days, then Ex-Im Bank shall offer the requester the opportunity to:</P>
            <P>(1) Alter the request so that it may be processed within the time limit; or</P>
            <P>(2) Propose an alternative, feasible time frame for processing the request.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Date of receipt.</E> A request shall be deemed to have been received on the date that the request is received in the Freedom of Information and Privacy Office, provided that the requester has met all the requirements of § 404.4. Ex-Im Bank shall notify the requester of the date on which a request was officially received.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Order of processing.</E> Ex-Im Bank ordinarily shall process requests according to their order of receipt.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Expedited processing.</E> A request for expedited processing must be included in the original request for records and may be granted at the discretion of Ex-Im Bank based upon the requester's demonstration of:</P>
            <P>(1) An imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or</P>
            <P>(2) In the case of a requester who is a representative of the news media, an urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity. Ex-Im Bank shall provide notice of its determination on expedited processing to the requester. A requester may file an administrative appeal, as set forth at § 404.11, based on a denial of a request for expedited processing. Ex-Im Bank shall grant expeditious consideration to any such appeal.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Creation of records.</E> A reasonable request for material not in existence may be honored at Ex-Im Bank's discretion when tabulation or compilation will not significantly burden Ex-Im Bank, its programs or its activities.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Discretionary release.</E> Consistent with federal government policy, material technically qualifying for exemption from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(5) may be made available when disclosure would not adversely affect legitimate public or private interests, violate law or impose an unreasonable burden on Ex-Im Bank. This policy does not, however, create any right enforceable in a court of law.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Segregable records.</E> Whenever it is determined that a portion of a record is exempt from disclosure, any reasonably segregable portion of the record shall be provided to the requester after redaction of the exempt material. If segregation would render the document meaningless, Ex-Im Bank shall withhold the entire record.<PRTPAGE P="490"/>

            <P>(2) The records have been published or otherwise made available to the public; or</P>
            <P>(3) disclosure of the records is required by law.</P>

A submitter located outside the United States shall have twenty working days to object to disclosure. Ex-Im Bank may extend the time for objection upon timely request from the submitter and for good cause shown. A statement of objection must specify all grounds under the FOIA for withholding the information.</P>

This notification—which shall be provided at least ten days prior to the planned disclosure date and which shall include a copy or description of the records at issue—is intended to afford the submitter the opportunity to seek judicial review.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Notice to requester of disclosure date.</E> If Ex-Im Bank determines to disclose records over a business submitter's objection, then Ex-Im Bank shall notify the requester of the expected disclosure date.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Appeal.</E> Whenever Ex-Im Bank determines to disclose, pursuant to an administrative appeal, business information that initially was withheld from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), Ex-Im Bank shall notify the business submitter. Such notice shall be in writing and shall be provided ten working days prior to the proposed disclosure date. It shall include a copy or description of the records at issue and a statement of Ex-Im Bank's reasons for disclosure.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Notice of FOIA lawsuit.</E> Ex-Im Bank shall promptly notify the submitter whenever a requester brings suit against Ex-Im Bank seeking to compel the release of business information covered by this section. Ex-Im Bank shall promptly notify the requester when a submitter brings suit against Ex-Im seeking to restrict the release of business information that is covered by this section.</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Description of records sought.</E> A request for access must describe the records sought in sufficient detail so as to enable Ex-Im Bank personnel to locate the system of records containing the records with a reasonable amount of effort. To the extent practicable, such description should include the nature of the record sought, the date of the record or the period in which the record was compiled, and the name or identifying number of the system of records in which the requester believes the record is kept. A requester may include his or her social security number in the request in order to facilitate the identification and location of the requested records.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Fee statement.</E> The request must contain a statement expressing willingness to pay fees for processing the request or a request for a fee waiver (see § 404.16(d)).</P>
            <P>(1) Whenever a requester submits a request for access that does not contain a fee statement or a request for a fee waiver, Ex-Im Bank shall advise the requester of the requirements of this section. If the requester fails to respond within ten working days of such notification, then the Freedom of Information and Privacy Office shall notify the requester, in writing, that Ex-Im Bank will not process the request.</P>
            <P>(2) A general statement by the requester expressing willingness to pay all applicable fees shall be deemed an agreement to pay up to $25.00. If Ex-Im Bank estimates that the fees for a request will exceed $25.00, then Ex-Im Bank shall notify the requester. Ex-Im Bank shall offer the requester the opportunity to agree, in writing, either to pay a greater fee or to modify the request as a means of limiting the cost.</P>
            <P>(3) Whenever the estimated fee chargeable under this section exceeds $25.00, Ex-Im Bank reserves the right to require a requester to make an advance payment prior to processing the request.</P>
            <P>(4) Ex-Im Bank shall not process a request by a requester who has failed to pay a fee for a previous request unless and until such requester had paid the full amount owed and also has paid, in advance, the total estimated charges for the new request.</P>

The request must include the requesters full name, current address, and date and place of birth. In addition, such requester must provide a notarized statement attesting to his or her identity.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Verification of guardianship.</E> When a parent or guardian of a minor or the guardian of a person judicially determined to be incompetent submits a request for access to records that relate to the minor or incompetent, such parent or guardian must establish:</P>
            <P>(1) His or her own identity and the identity of the subject of the record in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section; and</P>
            <P>(2) Parentage or guardianship of the subject of the record, either by providing a copy of the subject's birth certificate showing parentage or by providing a court order establishing guardianship.</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Notice regarding request for access.</E> The Freedom of Information and Privacy Office shall notify the requester in writing of its decision to grant or deny a request for access.</P>
            <P>(1) If the request is granted, then the notice shall either include the requested records, in releasable form, or shall describe the manner in which access to the record will be granted. The notice also shall inform the requester of any processing fee.</P>

In addition, the requester must provide a form of official photographic identification—such as a passport, driver's license or identification badge—and any other form of identification bearing his or her name and address prior to inspection of the requested records. Records may be inspected by the requester in the presence of another individual, provided that the requester signs a form stating that Ex-Im Bank is authorized to disclose the record in the presence of both individuals.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Exemptions: EIB-35—Office of Inspector General Investigative Records.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Criminal Law Enforcement</E>—(1) <E T="03">Exemption.</E> Under the authority granted by 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), Ex-Im Bank hereby exempts the system of records entitled “EIB-35—Office of Inspector General Investigative Records” from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (c)(4), (d)(1) through (4), (e)(1) through (3), (e)(4)(G) and (H), (e)(5), (e)(8), (f), and (g) because the system contains information pertaining to the enforcement of criminal laws. “EIB-35—Office of Inspector General Investigative Records” is maintained by the Ex-Im Bank Office of Inspector General (“OIG” or “Ex-Im Bank OIG.”)</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Reasons for exemption.</E> The reasons for asserting this exemption are:</P>
            <P>(i) Disclosure to the individual named in the record pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (c)(4), or (d)(1) through (4) could seriously impede or compromise the investigation by alerting the target(s), subjecting a potential witness or witnesses to intimidation or improper influence, and leading to destruction of evidence. Disclosure could enable suspects to take action to prevent detection of criminal activities, conceal evidence, or escape prosecution.</P>
            <P>(ii) Application of 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1) is impractical because the relevance of specific information might be established only after considerable analysis and as the investigation progresses. Effective law enforcement requires the OIG to keep information that may not be relevant to a specific OIG investigation, but which may provide leads for appropriate law enforcement and to establish patterns of activity that might relate to the jurisdiction of the OIG and/or other agencies.</P>
            <P>(iii) Application of 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(2) would be counterproductive to the performance of a criminal investigation because it would alert the individual to the existence of an investigation. In any investigation, it is necessary to obtain evidence from a variety of sources other than the subject of the investigation in order to verify the evidence necessary for successful litigation or prosecution.</P>
            <P>(iv) Application of 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(3) could discourage the free flow of information in a criminal law enforcement inquiry.</P>
            <P>(v) The requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(G) and (H) and (f) would be counterproductive to the performance of a criminal investigation. To notify an individual at the individual's request of the existence of records in an investigative file pertaining to such individual, or to grant access to an investigative file could interfere with investigative and enforcement proceedings, deprive co-defendants of a right to a fair trial or other impartial adjudication, constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy of others, disclose the identity or confidential sources, reveal confidential information supplied by these sources and disclose investigative techniques and procedures. Nevertheless, Ex-Im Bank OIG has published notice of its notification, access, and contest procedures because access may be appropriate in some cases.</P>

            <P>(vi) Although the OIG endeavors to maintain accurate records, application of 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(5) is impractical because maintaining only those records that are accurate, relevant, timely, and complete and that assure fairness <PRTPAGE P="500"/>in determination is contrary to established investigative techniques. Information that may initially appear inaccurate, irrelevant, untimely, or incomplete may, when collated and analyzed with other available information, become more pertinent as an investigation progresses.</P>
            <P>(vii) Application of 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(8) could prematurely reveal an ongoing criminal investigation to the subject of the investigation.</P>
            <P>(viii) The provisions of subsection (g) do not apply to this system if an exemption otherwise applies.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Other Law Enforcement</E>—(1) <E T="03">Exemption.</E> Under the authority granted by 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), Ex-Im Bank hereby exempts the system of records entitled “EIB-35—Office of Inspector General Investigative Records” from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d)(1) through (4), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G) and (H), and (f) for the same reasons as stated in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, that is, because the system contains investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes other than material within the scope of subsection 552a(j)(2).</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Reasons for exemption.</E> The reasons for asserting this exemption are because the disclosure and other requirements of the Privacy Act could substantially compromise the efficacy and integrity of OIG operations. Disclosure could invade the privacy of other individuals and disclose their identity when they were expressly promised confidentiality. Disclosure could interfere with the integrity of information which would otherwise be subject to privileges (see, e.g., 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(5)), and which could interfere with other important law enforcement concerns (see, e.g., 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)).</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Federal Civilian or Contract Employment</E>—(1) <E T="03">Exemption.</E> Under the authority granted by 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5), Ex-Im Bank hereby exempts the system of records entitled “EIB-35—Office of Inspector General Investigative Records” from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d)(1) through (4), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G) and (H), and (f) because the system contains investigatory material compiled for the purpose of determining eligibility or qualifications for federal civilian or contract employment.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Reasons for exemption.</E> The reasons for asserting this exemption are the same as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>

            <P>(a) The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) establishes national policies and goals for the protection of the environment. Section 102(2) of NEPA contains certain procedural requirements directed toward the attainment of such goals. In particular, all Federal agencies are required to give appropriate consideration to the environmental effects of their proposed actions in their decision-making and to prepare detailed environmental statements on recommendations or reports on proposals for legislation and other major Federal Actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.</P>
            <P>(b) Executive Order 11991 of May 24, 1977, directed the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) to issue regulations to implement the procedural provisions of NEPA (NEPA Regulations). Accordingly, CEQ issued final NEPA Regulations which are binding on all Federal agencies as of July 30, 1979 (40 CFR parts 1500 through 1508) on November 29, 1979. These Regulations provide that each Federal agency shall as necessary adopt implementing procedures to supplement the NEPA Regulations. Section 1507.3(b) of the NEPA Regulations identifies those sections of the NEPA Regulations which must be addressed in agency procedures.</P>

            <P>Historically, virtually all financing provided by Eximbank has been in aid of U.S. exports which involve no effects on the quality of the environment within the United States, its territories or possessions. Eximbank has <PRTPAGE P="508"/>separate procedures for conducting environmental reviews where such reviews are required by E.O. 12114 (January 4, 1979) because of potential effects on the environment of global commons areas or on the environment of foreign nations. The procedures set forth in this part apply to the relatively rare cases where Eximbank financing of U.S. exports may affect environmental quality in the United States, its territories or possessions.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Early involvement in foreign activities for which Eximbank financing may be requested.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Section 1501.2(d) of the NEPA Regulations requires agencies to provide for early involvement in actions which, while planned by private applicants or other non-Federal entities, require some form of Federal approval. Pursuant to the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945, as amended, Eximbank is asked to provide financing for transactions involving exports of U.S. goods and services for projects in foreign countries which are planned by non-U.S. entities (Transactions).</P>
            <P>(b) To implement the requirements of § 1501.2(d) with respect to these Transactions, Eximbank:</P>
            <P>(1) Will provide on a project-by-project basis to applicant seeking financing from Eximbank guidance as to the scope and level of environmental information to be used in evaluating a proposed Transaction where: (i) The proposed Eximbank financing would be a major action and (ii) a Transaction may significantly affect the quality of the human environment in the United States, its territories or possessions.</P>

            <P>(2) Upon receipt of an application for Eximbank financing or notification that an application will be filed, will consult as required with other appropriate parties to initiate and coordinate the necessary environmental analyses.
            </P>
            <FP>These responsibilities will be performed by the General Counsel and the Engineers of Eximbank.</FP>
            <P>(c) To facilitate Eximbank review of Transactions for which positive determinations have been made under paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, applicants should:</P>
            <P>(1) Consult with the Engineer as early as possible in the planning process for guidance on the scope and level of environmental information required to be submitted in support of their application;</P>
            <P>(2) Conduct any studies which are deemed necessary and appropriate by Eximbank to determine the impact of the proposed action on the quality of the human environment;</P>
            <P>(3) Consult with appropriate U.S. (Federal, regional, State and local) agencies and other potentially interested parties during preliminary planning stages to ensure that all environmental factors are identified;</P>
            <P>(4) Submit applications for all U.S. (Federal, regional, State and local) approvals as early as possible in the planning process;</P>
            <P>(5) Notify Eximbank as early as possible of all other applicable legal requirements for project completion so that all applicable Federal environmental reviews may be coordinated; and</P>
            <P>(6) Notify Eximbank of all known parties potentially affected by or interested in the proposed action.</P>

            <P>Section 1505.1 of the NEPA Regulations contains requirements to ensure adequate consideration of environmental documents in agency decision-making. To implement these requirements, Eximbank officials will:</P>
            <P>(a) Consider all relevant environmental documents in evaluating applications for Eximbank financing;</P>
            <P>(b) Ensure that all relevant environmental documents, comments and responses accompany the application through Eximbank's review processes;</P>

            <P>(c) Consider only those alternatives encompassed by the range of alternatives discussed in the relevant environmental documents when evaluating an application which is the subject of an EIS.<PRTPAGE P="509"/>

          <P>Except as otherwise provided in § 410.150, no qualified handicapped person shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>

        <SECTION>

          <SUBJECT>Program accessibility: Existing facilities.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not—</P>
          <P>(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons; or</P>

          <P>(2) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 410.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or <PRTPAGE P="513"/>such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods.</E> The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is nor required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151 through 4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Time period for compliance.</E> The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by June 6, 1986, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by April 7, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by October 7, 1986, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—</P>
          <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped persons;</P>
          <P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;</P>
          <P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</P>
          <P>(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.</P>

          <P>(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the handicapped person.</P>

          <P>(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for <PRTPAGE P="514"/>personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.</P>
          <P>(2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.</P>
          <P>(b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.</P>
          <P>(c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.</P>
          <P>(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 410.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>

          <P>(b) The agency shall process complaints alleging violations of section 504 with respect to employment according to the procedures established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR part 1613 pursuant to section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791).</P>

          <P>(e) If the agency receives a complaint over which it does not have jurisdiction, it shall promptly notify the complainant and shall make reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate government entity.</P>
          <P>(f) The agency shall notify the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a building or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151 through 4157), or section 502 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 792), is not readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Professional and technical services.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 411.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or an extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.</P>
            <P>(b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, <E T="03">professional and technical services</E> shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.</P>
            <P>(c) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.</P>

            <P>(a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 411.100 (a), does not apply in the case of any reasonable <PRTPAGE P="520"/>payment to a person, other than an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action, if the payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.</P>
            <P>(b) The reporting requirements in § 411.110 (a) and (b) regarding filing a disclosure form by each person, if required, shall not apply with respect to professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any commitment providing for the United States to insure or guarantee a loan.</P>

            <P>(d) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.</P>
            <P>(e) Persons other than officers or employees of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action include consultants and trade associations.</P>

            <P>(b) Any person who fails to file or amend the disclosure form (see appendix B) to be filed or amended if required herein, shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than $100,000 for each such failure.</P>
            <P>(c) A filing or amended filing on or after the date on which an administrative action for the imposition of a civil penalty is commenced does not prevent the imposition of such civil penalty for a failure occurring before that date. An administrative action is commenced with respect to a failure when an investigating official determines in writing to commence an investigation of an allegation of such failure.</P>

            <P>(d) In determining whether to impose a civil penalty, and the amount of any such penalty, by reason of a violation by any person, the agency shall consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation, the effect on the ability of such person to <PRTPAGE P="521"/>continue in business, any prior violations by such person, the degree of culpability of such person, the ability of the person to pay the penalty, and such other matters as may be appropriate.</P>
            <P>(e) First offenders under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of $10,000, absent aggravating circumstances. Second and subsequent offenses by persons shall be subject to an appropriate civil penalty between $10,000 and $100,000, as determined by the agency head or his or her designee.</P>
            <P>(f) An imposition of a civil penalty under this section does not prevent the United States from seeking any other remedy that may apply to the same conduct that is the basis for the imposition of such civil penalty.</P>

This part does not authorize acceptance of such payments by an employee in his/her personal capacity.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Solicitation prohibited.</E> An employee shall not solicit payment for travel, subsistence and related expenses from a non-Federal source. However, after receipt of an invitation from a non-Federal source to attend a meeting or similar event, Eximbank or the employee may inform the non-Federal source of this authority.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> As used in this part, the following definitions apply:</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Conflicting non-Federal source. Conflicting non-Federal source</E> means any person who, or entity other than the Government of the United States which, has interests that may be substantially affected by the performance or nonperformance of the employee's duties.</P>

This term does not include any meeting or similar function described in 41 CFR 304-1.2 or sponsored by Eximbank. A meeting or similar event need not be widely attended for purposes of this definition.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Non-Federal source. Non-Federal source</E> means any person or entity other than the Government of the United States. The term includes any individual, private or commercial entity, nonprofit organization or association, state, local, or foreign government, or international or multinational organization.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Policy.</SUBJECT>

          <P>As provided in this part, Eximbank may accept payment from a non-Federal source (or authorize an employee to receive such payment on its behalf) with respect to attendance of the employee at a meeting or similar event which the employee has been authorized to attend in an official capacity on behalf of Eximbank. The employee's immediate supervisor and Eximbank's designated agency ethics official or his/her designee (DAEO) must approve any offer and acceptance of payment under this part in accordance with the procedures described below. If the employee is a member of Eximbank's Board of Directors, only the DAEO's approval is required. Any employee authorized to <PRTPAGE P="527"/>travel in accordance with this part is subject to the maximum per diem or actual subsistence expense rates and transportation class of service limitations prescribed in 41 CFR chapter 301.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 412.7</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Conditions for acceptance.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Eximbank may accept payment for employee travel from a non-Federal source when a written authorization to accept payment is issued in advance of the travel following a determination by the employee's supervisor (except in the case of Board members) and the DAEO that the payment is:</P>
          <P>(1) For travel relating to an employee's official duties under an official travel authorization issued to the employee;</P>
          <P>(2) For attendance at a meeting or similar event as defined in § 412.3(c)(3):</P>
          <P>(i) In which the employee's participation is necessary in order to further the mission of Eximbank;</P>
          <P>(ii) Which cannot be held at the offices of Eximbank for justifiable business reasons in light of the location and number of participants and the purpose of the meeting or similar event; and</P>
          <P>(iii) Which is taking place at a location and for a period of time that is appropriate for the purpose of the meeting or similar event;</P>
          <P>(3) From a non-Federal source that is not a conflicting non-Federal source or from a conflicting non-Federal source that has been approved under § 412.9; and</P>
          <P>(4) In an amount which does not exceed the maximum per diem or actual subsistence expense rates and transportation class of service limitations prescribed in 41 CFR chapter 301.</P>
          <P>(b) An employee requesting approval of payment of travel expenses by a non-Federal source under this part shall submit to the employee's supervisor (except in the case of Board members) and the DAEO a written description of the following: the nature of the meeting or similar event and the reason that it cannot be held at Eximbank, the date(s) and location of the meeting or similar event, the identities of all participants in the meeting or similar event, the name of the non-Federal source offering to make the payment, the amount and method of the proposed payment, and the nature of the expenses.</P>
          <P>(c) Payments may be accepted from multiple sources under paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 412.9</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Conflict of interest analysis.</SUBJECT>
          <P>Eximbank may accept payment from a conflicting non-Federal source if the conditions of § 412.7 are met and the employee's supervisor (except in the case of Board members) and the DAEO determine that Eximbank's interest in the employee's attendance at or participation in the meeting or similar event outweighs concern that acceptance of the payment by Eximbank may cause a reasonable person to question the integrity of Eximbank's programs and operations. In determining whether to accept payment, Eximbank shall consider all relevant factors, including the purpose of the meeting or similar event, the importance of the travel for Eximbank, the nature and sensitivity of any pending matter affecting the interests of the conflicting non-Federal source, the significance of the employee's role in any such matter, the identity of other expected participants, and the location and duration of the meeting or similar event.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Payment guidelines.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Payments from a non-Federal source, other than payments in kind, shall be by check or similar instrument made payable to Eximbank. Payments from a non-Federal source, including payments in kind, are subject to the maximum per diem or actual subsistence expense rates and transportation class of service limitations prescribed in 41 CFR chapter 301.</P>
          <P>(b) If Eximbank determines in advance of the travel that a payment covers some but not all of the per diem costs to be incurred by the employee, Eximbank shall authorize a reduced per diem rate, in accordance with 41 CFR part 301-7.12.</P>

          <P>(a) This part is in addition to and not in place of any other authority under which Eximbank may accept payment from a non-Federal source or authorize an employee to accept such payment on behalf of Eximbank. This part shall <PRTPAGE P="528"/>not be applied in connection with the acceptance by Eximbank of payment for travel, subsistence, and related expenses incurred by an employee to attend a meeting or similar function described in and authorized by 41 CFR part 304-1.</P>
          <P>(b) An employee who accepts any payment in violation of this part is subject to the following:</P>
          <P>(1) The employee may be required, in addition to any penalty provided by law and applicable regulations, to repay for deposit to the general fund of the Treasury, an amount equal to the amount of the payment so accepted; and</P>
          <P>(2) When repayment is required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the employee shall not be entitled to any payment or reimbursement from Eximbank for such expenses.</P>
