      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, January 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

Except as otherwise provided, this part applies to United States branches and agencies of foreign banks that are subject to reserve requirements under Regulation D (12 CFR part 204) in the same manner and to the same extent as this part applies to depository institutions. The Federal Reserve System extends credit with due regard to the basic objectives of monetary policy and the maintenance of a sound and orderly financial system.</P>

            <P>For purposes of this part, the following definitions shall apply:</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Appropriate federal banking agency</E> has the same meaning as in section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act) (12 U.S.C. 1813(q)).</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Critically undercapitalized insured depository institution</E> means any insured depository institution as defined in section 3 of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1813(c)(2)) that is deemed to be critically undercapitalized under section 38 of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1831o(b)(1)(E)) and its implementing regulations.</P>
            <P>(c)(1) <E T="03">Depository institution</E> means an institution that maintains reservable transaction accounts or nonpersonal time deposits and is:</P>
            <P>(i) An <E T="03">insured bank</E> as defined in section 3 of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1813(h)) or a bank that is eligible to make application to become an insured bank under section 5 of such act (12 U.S.C. 1815);</P>
            <P>(ii) A <E T="03">mutual savings bank</E> as defined in section 3 of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1813(f)) or a bank that is eligible to make application to become an insured bank under section 5 of such act (12 U.S.C. 1815);</P>
            <P>(iii) A <E T="03">savings bank</E> as defined in section 3 of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1813(g)) or a bank that is eligible to make application to become an insured bank under section 5 of such act (12 U.S.C. 1815);</P>
            <P>(iv) An <E T="03">insured credit union</E> as defined in section 101 of the Federal Credit Union Act (12 U.S.C. 1752(7)) or a credit union that is eligible to make application to become an insured credit union pursuant to section 201 of such act (12 U.S.C. 1781);</P>
            <P>(v) A <E T="03">member</E> as defined in section 2 of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act (12 U.S.C. 1422(4)); or</P>
            <P>(vi) A <E T="03">savings association</E> as defined in section 3 of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1813(b)) that is an insured depository <PRTPAGE P="6"/>institution as defined in section 3 of the act (12 U.S.C. 1813(c)(2)) or is eligible to apply to become an insured depository institution under section 5 of the act (12 U.S.C. 15(a)).</P>
            <P>(2) The term <E T="03">depository institution</E> does not include a financial institution that is not required to maintain reserves under § 204.1(c)(4) of Regulation D (12 CFR 204.1(c)(4)) because it is organized solely to do business with other financial institutions, is owned primarily by the financial institutions with which it does business, and does not do business with the general public.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Transaction account</E> and <E T="03">nonpersonal time deposit</E> have the meanings specified in Regulation D (12 CFR part 204).</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Undercapitalized insured depository institution</E> means any insured depository institution as defined in section 3 of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1813(c)(2)) that:</P>
            <P>(1) Is not a critically undercapitalized insured depository institution; and</P>
            <P>(2)(i) Is deemed to be undercapitalized under section 38 of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1831o(b)(1)(C)) and its implementing regulations; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Has received from its appropriate federal banking agency a composite CAMELS rating of 5 under the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System (or an equivalent rating by its appropriate federal banking agency under a comparable rating system) as of the most recent examination of such institution.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Viable,</E> with respect to a depository institution, means that the Board of Governors or the appropriate federal banking agency has determined, giving due regard to the economic conditions and circumstances in the market in which the institution operates, that the institution is not critically undercapitalized, is not expected to become critically undercapitalized, and is not expected to be placed in conservatorship or receivership. Although there are a number of criteria that may be used to determine viability, the Board of Governors believes that ordinarily an undercapitalized insured depository institution is viable if the appropriate federal banking agency has accepted a capital restoration plan for the depository institution under 12 U.S.C. 1831o(e)(2) and the depository institution is complying with that plan.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Extensions of credit generally.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Advances to and discounts for a depository institution.</E> (1) A Federal Reserve Bank may lend to a depository institution either by making an advance secured by acceptable collateral under § 201.4 of this part or by discounting certain types of paper. A Federal Reserve Bank generally extends credit by making an advance.</P>
            <P>(2) An advance to a depository institution must be secured to the satisfaction of the Federal Reserve Bank that makes the advance. Satisfactory collateral generally includes United States government and federal-agency securities, and, if of acceptable quality, mortgage notes covering one-to four-family residences, state and local government securities, and business, consumer, and other customer notes.</P>
            <P>(3) If a Federal Reserve Bank concludes that a discount would meet the needs of a depository institution or an institution described in section 13A of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 349) more effectively, the Reserve Bank may discount any paper indorsed by the institution, provided the paper meets the requirements specified in the Federal Reserve Act.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">No obligation to make advances or discounts.</E> This section does not entitle any person or entity to obtain any credit or any increase, renewal or extension of maturity of any credit from a Federal Reserve Bank.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Information requirements.</E> (1) Before extending credit to a depository institution, a Federal Reserve Bank should determine if the institution is an undercapitalized insured depository institution or a critically undercapitalized insured depository institution and, if so, follow the lending procedures specified in § 201.5.</P>

            <P>(2) Each Federal Reserve Bank shall require any information it believes appropriate or desirable to ensure that assets tendered as collateral for advances or for discount are acceptable and that the borrower uses the credit provided in a manner consistent with this part.<PRTPAGE P="7"/>
            </P>
            <P>(3) Each Federal Reserve Bank shall:</P>
            <P>(i) Keep itself informed of the general character and amount of the loans and investments of a depository institution as provided in section 4(8) of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 301); and</P>
            <P>(ii) Consider such information in determining whether to extend credit.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Indirect credit for others.</E> Except for depository institutions that receive primary credit as described in § 201.4(a), no depository institution shall act as the medium or agent of another depository institution in receiving Federal Reserve credit except with the permission of the Federal Reserve Bank extending credit.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Availability and terms of credit.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Primary credit.</E> A Federal Reserve Bank may extend primary credit on a very short-term basis, usually overnight, as a backup source of funding to a depository institution that is in generally sound financial condition in the judgment of the Reserve Bank. Such primary credit ordinarily is extended with minimal administrative burden on the borrower. A Federal Reserve Bank also may extend primary credit with maturities up to a few weeks as a backup source of funding to a depository institution if, in the judgment of the Reserve Bank, the depository institution is in generally sound financial condition and cannot obtain such credit in the market on reasonable terms. Credit extended under the primary credit program is granted at the primary credit rate.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Secondary credit.</E> A Federal Reserve Bank may extend secondary credit on a very short-term basis, usually overnight, as a backup source of funding to a depository institution that is not eligible for primary credit if, in the judgment of the Reserve Bank, such a credit extension would be consistent with a timely return to a reliance on market funding sources. A Federal Reserve Bank also may extend longer-term secondary credit if the Reserve Bank determines that such credit would facilitate the orderly resolution of serious financial difficulties of a depository institution. Credit extended under the secondary credit program is granted at a rate above the primary credit rate.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Seasonal credit.</E> A Federal Reserve Bank may extend seasonal credit for periods longer than those permitted under primary credit to assist a smaller depository institution in meeting regular needs for funds arising from expected patterns of movement in its deposits and loans. An interest rate that varies with the level of short-term market interest rates is applied to seasonal credit.</P>
            <P>(1) A Federal Reserve Bank may extend seasonal credit only if:</P>
            <P>(i) The depository institution's seasonal needs exceed a threshold that the institution is expected to meet from other sources of liquidity (this threshold is calculated as a certain percentage, established by the Board of Governors, of the institution's average total deposits in the preceding calendar year); and</P>
            <P>(ii) The Federal Reserve Bank is satisfied that the institution's qualifying need for funds is seasonal and will persist for at least four weeks.</P>
            <P>(2) The Board may establish special terms for seasonal credit when depository institutions are experiencing unusual seasonal demands for credit in a period of liquidity strain.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Emergency credit for others</E>—(1) <E T="03">Authorization to extend credit.</E> In unusual and exigent circumstances, the Board, by the affirmative vote of not less than five members,<SU>1</SU>
              <FTREF/> may authorize any Federal Reserve Bank, subject to such conditions and during such periods as the Board may determine, to extend credit to any participant in a program or facility with broad-based eligibility established and operated in accordance with this paragraph (d).</P>

            <P>(2) <E T="03">Approval of the Secretary of the Treasury.</E> A program or facility may not be established under this paragraph (d) without obtaining the prior approval of the Secretary of the Treasury.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Disclosure of justification and terms.</E> As soon as is reasonably practicable, <PRTPAGE P="8"/>and no later than 7 days after a program or facility is authorized under this paragraph (d), the Board and the authorized Federal Reserve Bank or Federal Reserve Banks, as appropriate, will make publicly available a description of the program or facility, a description of the market or sector of the financial system to which the program or facility is intended to provide liquidity, a description of the unusual and exigent circumstances that exist, the intended effect of the program or facility, and the terms and conditions for participation in the program or facility. In addition, within the same 7-day period, the Board will provide a copy of this information to the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs of the U.S. Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the U.S. House of Representatives.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Broad-based eligibility.</E> (i) A program or facility established under this paragraph (d) must have broad-based eligibility in accordance with terms established by the Board.</P>
            <P>(ii) For purposes of this paragraph (d), a program or facility has broad-based eligibility only if the program or facility is designed to provide liquidity to an identifiable market or sector of the financial system;</P>
            <P>(iii) A program or facility will not be considered to have broad-based eligibility for purposes of this paragraph (d) if:</P>

            <P>(A) The program or facility is designed for the purpose of assisting one or more specific companies avoid bankruptcy, resolution under Title II of Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Pub. L. 111-203, 12 U.S.C. 5381 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), or any other Federal or State insolvency proceeding, including by removing assets from the balance sheet of one or more such company;</P>
            <P>(B) The program or facility is designed for the purpose of aiding one or more failing financial companies; or</P>
            <P>(C) Fewer than five persons or entities would be eligible to participate in the program or facility.</P>
            <P>(iv) A Federal Reserve Bank may extend credit through a program or facility with broad-based eligibility established under this paragraph (d) through such mechanism or vehicle as the Board determines would facilitate the extension of such credit.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Insolvency.</E> (i) A Federal Reserve Bank may not extend credit through a program or facility established under this paragraph (d) to any person or entity that is insolvent or to any person or entity that is borrowing for the purpose of lending the proceeds of the loan to a person or entity that is insolvent.</P>
            <P>(ii) Before extending credit through a program or facility established under this paragraph (d) to any person or entity, the Federal Reserve Bank must obtain evidence that the person or entity is not insolvent.</P>
            <P>(iii) A person or entity is “insolvent” for purposes of this paragraph (d) if:</P>

            <P>(A) The person or entity is in bankruptcy, resolution under Title II of Public Law 111-203 (12 U.S.C. 5381 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) or any other Federal or State insolvency proceeding;</P>
            <P>(B) The person or entity is generally not paying its undisputed debts as they become due during the 90 days preceding the date of borrowing under the program or facility; or</P>
            <P>(C) The Board or Federal Reserve Bank otherwise determines that the person or entity is insolvent.</P>
            <P>(iv) For purposes of meeting the requirements of this paragraph (d)(5), the Board or Federal Reserve Bank, as relevant, may rely on:</P>

            <P>(A) A written certification from the person or from the chief executive officer or other authorized officer of the entity, at the time the person or entity initially borrows under the program or facility, that the person or entity is not in bankruptcy, resolution under Title II of Public Law 111-203 (12 U.S.C. 5381 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) or any other Federal or State insolvency proceeding, and has not failed to generally pay its undisputed debts as they become due during the 90 days preceding the date of borrowing under the program or facility;</P>
            <P>(B) Recent audited financial statements of the person or entity; or</P>
            <P>(C) Other information that the Board or the Federal Reserve Bank may determine to be relevant.</P>

            <P>(v) A person or officer (or successor of either) that submits a written certification under this subparagraph must immediately notify the lending <PRTPAGE P="9"/>Federal Reserve Bank if the information in the certification changes.</P>
            <P>(vi) Upon a finding by the Board or a Federal Reserve Bank that a participant, including a participant that has provided a certification under this paragraph (d)(5), is or has become insolvent, that participant is not eligible for any new extension of credit from a program or facility established under this paragraph (d) until such time as the Board or a Federal Reserve Bank determines that such participant is no longer insolvent.</P>
            <P>(vii) If a participant or person has provided a certification under this paragraph (d)(5) or paragraph (d)(8)(ii) of this section that includes a knowing material misrepresentation in the certification, all extensions of credit made pursuant to this paragraph (d) that are outstanding to the relevant participant shall become immediately due and payable, and all accrued interest, fees and penalties shall become immediately due and payable. The Board or the lending Federal Reserve Bank will also refer the matter to the relevant law enforcement authorities for investigation and action in accordance with applicable criminal and civil law.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Indorsement or other security.</E> (i) All credit extended under a program or facility established under this paragraph (d) must be indorsed or otherwise secured, in each case, to the satisfaction of the lending Federal Reserve Bank.</P>
            <P>(ii) In determining whether an extension of credit under any program or facility established under this paragraph (d) is secured to its satisfaction, a Federal Reserve Bank must, prior to or at the time the credit is initially extended, assign a lendable value to all collateral for the program or facility, consistent with sound risk management practices and to ensure protection for the taxpayer.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Penalty rate and fees.</E> (i) The Board will determine the interest rate to be charged on any credit extended through a program or facility established under this section in accordance with this paragraph (d) and the provisions of section 14, subdivision (d) of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 357). The Board may determine the interest rate by auction or such other method as the Board determines in accordance with section 14, subdivision (d) of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 357).</P>
            <P>(ii) The interest rate established for credit extended through a program or facility established under this section will be set at a penalty level that:</P>
            <P>(A) Is a premium to the market rate in normal circumstances;</P>
            <P>(B) Affords liquidity in unusual and exigent circumstances; and</P>
            <P>(C) Encourages repayment of the credit and discourages use of the program or facility as the unusual and exigent circumstances that motivated the program or facility recede and economic conditions normalize.</P>
            <P>(iii) In determining the rate, the Board will consider the condition of affected markets and the financial system generally, the historical rate of interest for loans of comparable terms and maturity during normal times, the purpose of the program or facility, the risk of repayment, the collateral supporting the credit, the duration, terms and amount of the credit, and any other factor that the Board determines to be relevant to ensuring that the taxpayer is appropriately compensated for the risks associated with the credit extended under the program or facility and the purposes of this paragraph (d) are fulfilled.</P>
            <P>(iv) In addition to the rate established and charged under this paragraph (d)(7), the Board may require the payment of any fees, penalties, charges or other consideration the Board determines to be appropriate to protect and appropriately compensate the taxpayer for the risks associated with the credit extended under the program or facility.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Evidence regarding unavailability of adequate credit accommodation.</E> (i) Each lending Federal Reserve Bank must obtain evidence that, under the prevailing circumstances, participants in a program or facility established under this paragraph (d) are unable to secure adequate credit accommodations from other banking institutions.</P>

            <P>(ii) Evidence required under this paragraph (d)(8) may be based on economic conditions in the market or markets intended to be addressed by the program or facility, a written certification from the person or from the chief executive officer or other authorized officer of the entity at the time <PRTPAGE P="10"/>the person or entity initially borrows under the program or facility, or other evidence from participants or other sources.</P>
            <P>(9) <E T="03">Termination of program or facility.</E> (i) A program or facility established under this paragraph (d) shall cease extending new credit no later than one year after the date of the first extension of credit under the program or facility or the date of any extension of the program or facility by the Board under paragraph (d)(9)(ii) of this section.</P>
            <P>(ii) A program or facility may be renewed upon the vote of not less than five members of the Board <SU>2</SU>
              <FTREF/> that unusual and exigent circumstances continue to exist and the program or facility continues to appropriately provide liquidity to the financial system, and the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury.</P>

            <P>(iv) The Board may at any time terminate a program or facility established under this paragraph (d). To ensure that the program or facility under this paragraph (d) is terminated in a timely and orderly fashion, the Board will periodically review, no less frequently than once every 6 months, the existence of unusual and exigent circumstances, the extent of usage of the program or facility, the extent to which the continuing authorization of the program or facility facilitates restoring or sustaining confidence in the identified financial markets, the ongoing need for the liquidity support provided by such program or facility, and such other factors as the Board may deem to be appropriate. The Board will terminate lending under a program or facility promptly upon finding that conditions no longer warrant the continuation of the program or facility or that continuation of the program or facility is no longer appropriate.</P>
            <P>(v) A program or facility that has been terminated will cease extending new credit and will collect existing loans pursuant to the applicable terms and conditions.</P>
            <P>(10) <E T="03">Reporting requirements.</E> The Board will comply with the reporting requirements of 12 U.S.C. 248(s) and 12 U.S.C. 343(3)(C) pursuant to their terms.</P>
            <P>(11) <E T="03">No obligation to extend credit.</E> This paragraph (d) does not entitle any person or entity to obtain any credit or any increase, renewal or extension of maturity of any credit from a Federal Reserve Bank.</P>
            <P>(12) <E T="03">Participation in programs and facilities and vendor selection.</E> (i) Participation in any program or facility under this paragraph (d) shall not be limited or conditioned on the basis of any legally prohibited basis, such as the race, religion, color, gender, national origin, age or disability of the borrower.</P>
            <P>(ii) The selection of any third-party vendor used in the design, marketing or implementation of any program or facility under this paragraph (d) shall be without regard to the race, religion, color, gender, national origin, age or disability of the vendor or any principal shareholder of the vendor, and, to the extent possible and consistent with law, shall involve a process designed to support equal opportunity and diversity.</P>
            <P>(13) <E T="03">Short-term emergency credit secured solely by United States or agency obligations.</E> In unusual and exigent circumstances and after consultation with the Board, a Federal Reserve Bank may extend credit under section 13(13) of the Federal Reserve Act if the collateral used to secure such credit consists solely of obligations of, or obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the United States or an agency thereof. Prior to extending credit under this paragraph (d)(13), the Federal Reserve Bank must obtain evidence that credit is not available from other sources and failure to obtain such credit would adversely affect the economy.

              <SUBJECT>Eligibility of consumer loans and finance company paper.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Board of Governors has clarified and modified its position with respect to the eligibility of consumer loans and finance company paper for discount with and as collateral for advances by the reserve banks.</P>

              <P>(b) Section 13, paragraph 2, of the Federal Reserve Act authorizes a Federal Reserve Bank, under certain conditions, to discount for member banks
              </P>
              <EXTRACT>
                <P>* * * notes, drafts, and bills of exchange arising out of actual commercial transactions; that is, notes, drafts, and bills of exchange issued or drawn for agricultural, industrial, or commercial purposes, or the proceeds of which have been used, or are to be used, for such purposes, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to have the right to determine or define the character of the paper thus eligible for discount, within the meaning of this Act.</P>
              </EXTRACT>
              

              <P>(c) It continues to be the opinion of the Board that borrowing for the purpose of purchasing goods is borrowing for a commercial purpose, whether the borrower intends to use the goods himself or to resell them. Hence, loans made to enable consumers to purchase automobiles or other goods should be included under commercial, agricultural, and industrial paper within the meaning of the Federal Reserve Act, and as such are eligible for discounting with the Reserve Banks and as security for advances from the Reserve Banks under section 13, paragraph 8, of the Federal Reserve Act as long as they conform to requirements with respect to maturity and other matters. This applies equally to loans made directly by banks to consumers and to paper accepted by banks from dealers or finance companies. It also applies to notes of finance companies themselves as long as the proceeds of such notes are used to finance the purchase of consumer goods or for other purposes which are eligible within the meaning of the Federal Reserve Act.<PRTPAGE P="13"/>
              </P>
              <P>(d) If there is any question as to whether the proceeds of a note of a finance company have been or are to be used for a commercial, agricultural, or industrial purpose, a financial statement of the finance company reflecting an excess of notes receivable which appear eligible for rediscount (without regard to maturity) over total current liabilities (i.e., notes due within 1 year) may be taken as an indication of eligibility. Where information is lacking as to whether direct consumer loans by a finance company are for eligible purposes, it may be assumed that 50 percent of such loans are “notes receivable which appear eligible for rediscount”. In addition, that language should be regarded as including notes given for the purchase of mobile homes that are acquired by a finance company from a dealer-seller of such homes.</P>
              <P>(e) The principles stated above apply not only to notes of a finance company engaged in making consumer loans but also to notes of a finance company engaged in making loans for other eligible purposes, including business and agricultural loans. Under section 13a of the Federal Reserve Act, paper representing loans to finance the production, marketing, and carrying of agricultural products or the breeding, raising, fattening, or marketing of livestock is eligible for discount if the paper has a maturity of not exceeding 9 months. Consequently, a note of a finance company the proceeds of which are used by it to make loans for such purposes is eligible for discount or as security for a Federal Reserve advance, and such a note, unlike the note of a finance company making consumer loans, may have a maturity of up to 9 months.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Eligibility of demand paper for discount and as security for advances by Reserve Banks.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Board of Governors has reconsidered a ruling made in 1917 that demand notes are ineligible for discount under the provisions of the Federal Reserve Act. (1917 Federal Reserve Bulletin 378.)</P>

              <P>(b) The basis of that ruling was the provision in the second paragraph of section 13 of the Federal Reserve Act that notes, drafts, and bills of exchange must have a maturity at the time of discount of not more than 90 days, exclusive of grace. The ruling stated that
              </P>
              <EXTRACT>
                <P>a demand note or bill is not eligible under the provisions of the act, since it is not in terms payable within the prescribed 90 days, but, at the option of the holder, may not be presented for payment until after that time.</P>
              </EXTRACT>
              

              <P>(c) It is well settled as a matter of law, however, that demand paper is due and payable on the date of its issue. The generally accepted legal view is stated in Beutel's Brannan on Negotiable Instruments Law, at page 305, as follows:
              </P>
              <EXTRACT>
                <P>The words <E T="03">on demand</E> serve the same purpose as words making instruments payable at a specified time. They fix maturity of the obligation and do not make demand necessary, but mean that the instrument is due, payable and matured when made and delivered.</P>
              </EXTRACT>
              
              <P>(d) Accordingly, the Board has concluded that, since demand paper is due and payable on the date of its issue, it satisfies the maturity requirements of the statute. Demand paper which otherwise meets the eligibility requirements of the Federal Reserve Act and this part Regulation A, therefore, is eligible for discount and as security for advances by Reserve Banks.</P>

              <P>(c) Nothing less than a full guarantee of principal and interest by a Federal agency will make an obligation eligible. For example, mortgage loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration are not eligible since the insurance contract is not equivalent to an unconditional guarantee and does not fully cover interest payable on the loan. Obligations of international institutions, such as the Inter-American Development Bank and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, are also not eligible, since such institutions are not agencies of the United States.</P>
              <P>(d) Also eligible for purchase under section 14(b) are “bills, notes, revenue bonds, and warrants with a maturity from date of purchase of not exceeding 6 months, issued in anticipation of the collection of taxes or in anticipation of the receipt of assured revenues by any State, county, district, political subdivision, or municipality in the continental United States, including irrigation, drainage and reclamation districts.”<SU>5</SU>

                <FTREF/> In determining the eligibility of such obligations as collateral for advances, but the Reserve Bank will satisfy itself that sufficient tax or other assured revenues earmarked for payment of such obligations will be available for that purpose at maturity, or within 6 months from the date of the advance if no maturity is stated. Payments due from Federal, State or other governmental units may, in the Reserve Bank's discretion, be regarded as “other assured revenues”; but neither the proceeds of a prospective issue of securities nor future tolls, rents or similar collections for the voluntary use of government property for non-<PRTPAGE P="15"/>governmental purposes will normally be so regarded. Obligations with original maturities exceeding 1 year would not ordinarily be self-liquidating as contemplated by the statute, unless at the time of issue provision is made for a redemption or sinking fund that will be sufficient to pay such obligations at maturity.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Eligibility for discount of mortgage company notes.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The question has arisen whether notes issued by mortgage banking companies to finance their acquisition and temporary holding of real estate mortgages are eligible for discount by Reserve Banks.</P>
              <P>(b) Under section 13 of the Federal Reserve Act the Board has authority to define what are “agricultural, industrial, or commercial purposes”, which is the statutory criterion for determining the eligibility of notes and drafts for discount. However, such definition may not include paper “covering merely investments or issued or drawn for the purpose of carrying or trading in stocks, bonds, or other investment securities”.</P>
              <P>(c) The legislative history of section 13 suggests that Congress intended to make eligible for discount “any paper drawn for a legitimate business purpose of any kind” <SU>6</SU>
                <FTREF/> and that the Board, in determining what paper is eligible, should place a “broad and adaptable construction” <SU>7</SU>
                <FTREF/> upon the terms in section 13. It may also be noted that Congress apparently considered paper issued to carry investment securities as paper issued for a “commercial purpose”, since it specifically prohibited the Board from making such paper eligible for discount. If “commercial” is broad enough to encompass investment banking, it would also seem to include mortgage banking.</P>

                <FTREF/> In the main, trading in stocks and bonds is investment-oriented; most securities transactions do not directly affect the production or distribution of goods and services. Mortgage banking, on the other hand, is essential to the construction industry and thus more closely related to industry and commerce. Although investment bankers also perform similar functions with respect to newly issued securities, Congress saw fit to deny eligibility to all paper issued to finance the carrying of securities. Congress did not distinguish between newly issued and outstanding securities, perhaps covering the larger area in order to make certain that the area of principal concern (i.e., trading in outstanding stocks and bonds) was fully included. Speculation was also a major Congressional concern, but speculation is not a material element in mortgage banking operations. Mortgage loans would not therefore seem to be within the purpose underlying the exclusions from eligibility in section 13.</P>

              <P>(e) Section 201.3(a) provides that a negotiable note maturing in 90 days or less is not eligible for discount if the proceeds are used “for permanent or fixed investments of any kind, such as land, buildings or machinery, or for any other fixed capital purpose”. However, the proceeds of a mortgage company's commercial paper are not used by it for any permanent or fixed capital purpose, but only to carry temporarily an inventory of mortgage loans pending their “packaging” for sale to permanent investors that are usually recurrent customers.</P>

              <P>(f) In view of the foregoing considerations the Board concluded that notes issued to finance such temporary “warehousing” of real estate mortgage loans are notes issued for an industrial or commercial purpose, that such <PRTPAGE P="16"/>mortgage loans do not constitute “investment securities”, as that term is used in section 13, and that the temporary holding of such mortgages in these circumstances is not a permanent investment by the mortgage banking company. Accordingly, the Board held that notes having not more than 90 days to run which are issued to finance the temporary holding of mortgage loans are eligible for discount by Reserve Banks.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Goods held by persons employed by owner.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) The Board has been asked to review an Interpretation it issued in 1933 concerning the eligibility for rediscount by a Federal Reserve Bank of bankers' acceptances issued against field warehouse receipts where the custodian of the goods is a present or former employee of the borrower. [¶ 1445 Published Interpretations, 1933 BULLETIN 188] The Board determined at that time that the acceptances were not eligible because such receipts do not comply with the requirement of section 13 of the Federal Reserve Act that a banker's acceptance be “secured at the time of acceptance by a warehouse receipt or other such document <E T="03">conveying or securing title</E> covering readily marketable staples,” nor with the requirement of section XI of the Board's Regulation A that it be “secured at the time of acceptance by a warehouse, terminal, or other similar receipt, conveying security title to such staples, <E T="03">issued by a party independent of the customer.”</E>
              </P>
              <FP>The requirement that the receipt be “issued by a party independent of the customer” was deleted from Regulation A in 1973, and thus the primary issue for the Board's consideration is whether a field warehouse receipt is a document “securing title” to readily marketable staples.</FP>
              <P>(b) While bankers' acceptances secured by field warehouse receipts are rarely offered for rediscount or as collateral for an advance, the issue of “eligibility” is still significant. If an ineligible acceptance is discounted and then sold by a member bank, the proceeds are deemed to be “deposits” under § 204.1(f) of Regulation D and are subject to reserve requirements.</P>
              <P>(c) In reviewing this matter, the Board has taken into consideration the changes that have occurred in commercial law and practice since 1933. Modern commercial law, embodied in the Uniform Commercial Code, refers to “perfecting security interests” rather than “securing title” to goods. The Board believes that if, under State law, the issuance of a field warehouse receipt provides the lender with a perfected security interest in the goods, the receipt should be regarded as a document “securing title” to goods for the purposes of section 13 of the Federal Reserve Act. It should be noted, however, that the mere existence of a perfected security interest alone is not sufficient; the Act requires that the acceptance be secured by a warehouse receipt or its equivalent.</P>
              <P>(d) Under the U.C.C., evidence of an agreement between the secured party and the debtor must exist before a security interest can attach. [U.C.C. section 9-202.] This agreement may be evidence by: (1) A written security agreement signed by the debtor, or (2) the collateral being placed in the possession of the secured party or his agent [U.C.C. section 9-203]. Generally, a security interest is perfected by the filing of a financing statement, [U.C.C. section 9-302.] However, if the collateral is in the possession of a bailee, then perfection can be achieved by:</P>
              <P>(1) Having warehouse receipts issued in the name of the secured party; (2) notifying the bailee of the secured party's interest; or (3) having a financing statement filed. [U.C.C. section 9-304(3).]</P>

              <P>(e) If the field warehousing operation is properly conducted, a security interest in the goods is perfected when a warehouse receipt is issued in the name of the secured party (the lending bank). Therefore, warehouse receipts issued pursuant to a bona fide field warehousing operation satisfy the legal requirements of section 13 of the Federal Reserve Act. Moreover, in a properly conducted field warehousing operation, the warehouse manager will be trained, bonded, supervised and audited by the field warehousing company. This procedure tends to insure that he <PRTPAGE P="17"/>will not be impermissibly controlled by his former (or sometimes present) employer, the borrower, even though he may look to the borrower for reemployment at some future time. A prudent lender will, of course, carefully review the field warehousing operation to ensure that stated procedures are satisfactory and that they are actually being followed. The lender may also wish to review the field warehousing company's fidelity bonds and legal liability insurance policies to ensure that they provide satisfactory protection to the lender.</P>
              <P>(f) If the warehousing operation is not conducted properly, however, and the manager remains under the control of the borrower, the security interest may be lost. Consequently, the lender may wish to require a written security agreement and the filing of a financing statement to insure that the lender will have a perfected security interest even if it is later determined that the field warehousing operation was not properly conducted. It should be noted however, that the Federal Reserve Act clearly requires that the bankers' acceptance be secured by a warehouse receipt in order to satisfy the requirements of eligibility, and a written security agreement and a filed financing statement, while desirable, cannot serve as a substitute for a warehouse receipt.</P>
              <P>(g) This Interpretation is based on facts that have been presented in regard to field warehousing operations conducted by established, professional field warehouse companies, and it does not necessarily apply to all field warehousing operations. Thus ¶ 1430 and ¶ 1440 of the Published Interpretations [1918 BULLETIN 31 and 1918 BULLETIN 862] maintain their validity with regard to corporations formed for the purpose of conducting limited field warehousing operations. Furthermore, the prohibition contained in ¶ 1435 Published Interpretations [1918 BULLETIN 634] that “the borrower shall not have access to the premises and shall exercise no control over the goods stored” retains its validity, except that access for inspection purposes is still permitted under ¶ 1450 [1926 BULLETIN 666]. The purpose for the acceptance transaction must be proper and cannot be for speculation [¶ 1400, 1919 BULLETIN 858] or for the purpose of furnishing working capital [¶ 1405, 1922 BULLETIN 52].</P>
              <P>(h) This interpretation suspersedes only the previous ¶ 1445 of the Published Interpretations [1933 BULLETIN 188], and is not intended to affect any other Board Interpretation regarding field warehousing.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Authority and scope.</E> This regulation is issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System <PRTPAGE P="18"/>pursuant to title VII (Equal Credit Opportunity Act) of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, as amended (15 U.S.C. 1601 <E T="03">et seq.</E>). Except as otherwise provided herein, this regulation applies to all persons who are creditors, as defined in § 202.2(1). Information collection requirements contained in this regulation have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. 3501 <E T="03">et seq.</E> and have been assigned OMB No. 7100-0201.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The purpose of this regulation is to promote the availability of credit to all creditworthy applicants without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, or age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract); to the fact that all or part of the applicant's income derives from a public assistance program; or to the fact that the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act. The regulation prohibits creditor practices that discriminate on the basis of any of these factors. The regulation also requires creditors to notify applicants of action taken on their applications; to report credit history in the names of both spouses on an account; to retain records of credit applications; to collect information about the applicant's race and other personal characteristics in applications for certain dwelling-related loans; and to provide applicants with copies of appraisal reports used in connection with credit transactions.</P>

            <P>(p) <E T="03">Empirically derived and other credit scoring systems</E>—(1) <E T="03">A credit scoring system</E> is a system that evaluates an applicant's creditworthiness mechanically, based on key attributes of the applicant and aspects of the transaction, and that determines, alone or in conjunction with an evaluation of additional information about the applicant, whether an applicant is deemed creditworthy. To qualify as an <E T="03">empirically derived, demonstrably and statistically sound, credit scoring system,</E> the system must be:</P>
            <P>(i) Based on data that are derived from an empirical comparison of sample groups or the population of creditworthy and noncreditworthy applicants who applied for credit within a reasonable preceding period of time;</P>
            <P>(ii) Developed for the purpose of evaluating the creditworthiness of applicants with respect to the legitimate business interests of the creditor utilizing the system (including, but not limited to, minimizing bad debt losses and operating expenses in accordance with the creditor's business judgment);</P>
            <P>(iii) Developed and validated using accepted statistical principles and methodology; and</P>

            <P>(iv) Periodically revalidated by the use of appropriate statistical principles and methodology and adjusted as necessary to maintain predictive ability.<PRTPAGE P="20"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) A creditor may use an empirically derived, demonstrably and statistically sound, credit scoring system obtained from another person or may obtain credit experience from which to develop such a system. Any such system must satisfy the criteria set forth in paragraph (p)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section; if the creditor is unable during the development process to validate the system based on its own credit experience in accordance with paragraph (p)(1) of this section, the system must be validated when sufficient credit experience becomes available. A system that fails this validity test is no longer an empirically derived, demonstrably and statistically sound, credit scoring system for that creditor.</P>
            <P>(q) <E T="03">Extend credit</E> and <E T="03">extension of credit</E> mean the granting of credit in any form (including, but not limited to, credit granted in addition to any existing credit or credit limit; credit granted pursuant to an open-end credit plan; the refinancing or other renewal of credit, including the issuance of a new credit card in place of an expiring credit card or in substitution for an existing credit card; the consolidation of two or more obligations; or the continuance of existing credit without any special effort to collect at or after maturity).</P>
            <P>(r) <E T="03">Good faith</E> means honesty in fact in the conduct or transaction.</P>
            <P>(s) <E T="03">Inadvertent error</E> means a mechanical, electronic, or clerical error that a creditor demonstrates was not intentional and occurred notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid such errors.</P>
            <P>(t) <E T="03">Judgmental system of evaluating applicants</E> means any system for evaluating the creditworthiness of an applicant other than an empirically derived, demonstrably and statistically sound, credit scoring system.</P>
            <P>(u) <E T="03">Marital status</E> means the state of being unmarried, married, or separated, as defined by applicable state law. The term “unmarried” includes persons who are single, divorced, or widowed.</P>
            <P>(v) <E T="03">Negative factor or value,</E> in relation to the age of elderly applicants, means utilizing a factor, value, or weight that is less favorable regarding elderly applicants than the creditor's experience warrants or is less favorable than the factor, value, or weight assigned to the class of applicants that are not classified as elderly and are most favored by a creditor on the basis of age.</P>
            <P>(w) <E T="03">Open-end credit</E> means credit extended under a plan in which a creditor may permit an applicant to make purchases or obtain loans from time to time directly from the creditor or indirectly by use of a credit card, check, or other device.</P>
            <P>(x) <E T="03">Person</E> means a natural person, corporation, government or governmental subdivision or agency, trust, estate, partnership, cooperative, or association.</P>
            <P>(y) <E T="03">Pertinent element of creditworthiness,</E> in relation to a judgmental system of evaluating applicants, means any information about applicants that a creditor obtains and considers and that has a demonstrable relationship to a determination of creditworthiness.</P>
            <P>(z) <E T="03">Prohibited basis</E> means race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, or age (provided that the applicant has the capacity to enter into a binding contract); the fact that all or part of the applicant's income derives from any public assistance program; or the fact that the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act or any state law upon which an exemption has been granted by the Board.</P>
            <P>(aa) <E T="03">State</E> means any state, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or any territory or possession of the United States.</P>

When an applicant relies on alimony, child support, or separate maintenance payments in applying for credit, the creditor shall consider such payments as income to the extent that they are likely to be consistently made.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Credit history.</E> To the extent that a creditor considers credit history in evaluating the creditworthiness of similarly qualified applicants for a similar type and amount of credit, in evaluating an applicant's creditworthiness a creditor shall consider:</P>

A creditor shall not deem the submission of a joint financial statement or other evidence of jointly held assets as an application for joint credit.</P>

            <P>(i) Applicable state law denies the applicant power to manage or control sufficient community property to qualify for the credit requested under the creditor's standards of creditworthiness; and</P>
            <P>(ii) The applicant does not have sufficient separate property to qualify for the credit requested without regard to community property.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Secured credit.</E> If an applicant requests secured credit, a creditor may require the signature of the applicant's spouse or other person on any instrument necessary, or reasonably believed by the creditor to be necessary, under applicable state law to make the property being offered as security available to satisfy the debt in the event of default, for example, an instrument to create a valid lien, pass clear title, waive inchoate rights, or assign earnings.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Additional parties.</E> If, under a creditor's standards of creditworthiness, the personal liability of an additional party is necessary to support the credit requested, a creditor may request a cosigner, guarantor, endorser, or similar party. The applicant's spouse may serve as an additional party, but the creditor shall not require that the spouse be the additional party.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Rights of additional parties.</E> A creditor shall not impose requirements upon an additional party that the creditor is prohibited from imposing upon an applicant under this section.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Insurance.</E> A creditor shall not refuse to extend credit and shall not terminate an account because credit life, health, accident, disability, or other credit-related insurance is not available on the basis of the applicant's age.</P>

            <P>(2) <E T="03">Notice of incompleteness.</E> If additional information is needed from an applicant, the creditor shall send a written notice to the applicant specifying the information needed, designating a reasonable period of time for the applicant to provide the information, and informing the applicant that failure to provide the information requested will result in no further consideration being given to the application. The creditor shall have no further obligation under this section if the applicant fails to respond within the designated time period. If the applicant supplies the requested information within the designated time period, the <PRTPAGE P="28"/>creditor shall take action on the application and notify the applicant in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Oral request for information.</E> At its option, a creditor may inform the applicant orally of the need for additional information. If the application remains incomplete the creditor shall send a notice in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Oral notifications by small-volume creditors.</E> In the case of a creditor that did not receive more than 150 applications during the preceding calendar year, the requirements of this section (including statements of specific reasons) are satisfied by oral notifications.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Withdrawal of approved application.</E> When an applicant submits an application and the parties contemplate that the applicant will inquire about its status, if the creditor approves the application and the applicant has not inquired within 30 days after applying, the creditor may treat the application as withdrawn and need not comply with paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Multiple applicants.</E> When an application involves more than one applicant, notification need only be given to one of them but must be given to the primary applicant where one is readily apparent.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Applications submitted through a third party.</E> When an application is made on behalf of an applicant to more than one creditor and the applicant expressly accepts or uses credit offered by one of the creditors, notification of action taken by any of the other creditors is not required. If no credit is offered or if the applicant does not expressly accept or use the credit offered, each creditor taking adverse action must comply with this section, directly or through a third party. A notice given by a third party shall disclose the identity of each creditor on whose behalf the notice is given.</P>

            <P>(4) <E T="03">Enforcement proceedings and investigations.</E> A creditor shall retain the information beyond 25 months (12 months for business credit, except as provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this section) if the creditor has actual notice that it is under investigation or is subject to an enforcement proceeding for an alleged violation of the Act or this part, by the Attorney General of the United States or by an enforcement agency charged with monitoring that creditor's compliance with the Act and this regulation, or if it has been served with notice of an action filed pursuant to section 706 of the Act and § 202.16 of this part. The creditor shall retain the information until final disposition of the matter, unless an earlier time is allowed by order of the agency or court.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Special rule for certain business credit applications.</E> With regard to a business that had gross revenues in excess of $1 million in its preceding fiscal year, or an extension of trade credit, credit incident to a factoring agreement, or other similar types of business credit, the creditor shall retain records for at least 60 days after notifying the applicant of the action taken.

            <P>(a) <E T="03">General rules</E>—(1) <E T="03">Voluntary self-testing and correction.</E> The report or results of a self-test that a creditor voluntarily conducts (or authorizes) are privileged as provided in this section. Data collection required by law or by any governmental authority is not a voluntary self-test.<PRTPAGE P="32"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Corrective action required.</E> The privilege in this section applies only if the creditor has taken or is taking appropriate corrective action.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Other privileges.</E> The privilege created by this section does not preclude the assertion of any other privilege that may also apply.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Self-test defined</E>—(1) <E T="03">Definition.</E> A self-test is any program, practice, or study that:</P>
            <P>(i) Is designed and used specifically to determine the extent or effectiveness of a creditor's compliance with the Act or this regulation; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Creates data or factual information that is not available and cannot be derived from loan or application files or other records related to credit transactions.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Types of information privileged.</E> The privilege under this section applies to the report or results of the self-test, data or factual information created by the self-test, and any analysis, opinions, and conclusions pertaining to the self-test report or results. The privilege covers workpapers or draft documents as well as final documents.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Types of information not privileged.</E> The privilege under this section does not apply to:</P>
            <P>(i) Information about whether a creditor conducted a self-test, the methodology used or the scope of the self-test, the time period covered by the self-test, or the dates it was conducted; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Loan and application files or other business records related to credit transactions, and information derived from such files and records, even if the information has been aggregated, summarized, or reorganized to facilitate analysis.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Appropriate corrective action</E>—(1) <E T="03">General requirement.</E> For the privilege in this section to apply, appropriate corrective action is required when the self-test shows that it is more likely than not that a violation occurred, even though no violation has been formally adjudicated.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Determining the scope of appropriate corrective action.</E> A creditor must take corrective action that is reasonably likely to remedy the cause and effect of a likely violation by:</P>
            <P>(i) Identifying the policies or practices that are the likely cause of the violation; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Assessing the extent and scope of any violation.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Types of relief.</E> Appropriate corrective action may include both prospective and remedial relief, except that to establish a privilege under this section:</P>
            <P>(i) A creditor is not required to provide remedial relief to a tester used in a self-test;</P>
            <P>(ii) A creditor is only required to provide remedial relief to an applicant identified by the self-test as one whose rights were more likely than not violated; and</P>
            <P>(iii) A creditor is not required to provide remedial relief to a particular applicant if the statute of limitations applicable to the violation expired before the creditor obtained the results of the self-test or the applicant is otherwise ineligible for such relief.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">No admission of violation.</E> Taking corrective action is not an admission that a violation occurred.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Scope of privilege</E>—(1) <E T="03">General rule.</E> The report or results of a privileged self-test may not be obtained or used:</P>
            <P>(i) By a government agency in any examination or investigation relating to compliance with the Act or this regulation; or</P>
            <P>(ii) By a government agency or an applicant (including a prospective applicant who alleges a violation of § 202.4(b)) in any proceeding or civil action in which a violation of the Act or this regulation is alleged.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Loss of privilege.</E> The report or results of a self-test are not privileged under paragraph (d)(1) of this section if the creditor or a person with lawful access to the report or results:</P>
            <P>(i) Voluntarily discloses any part of the report or results, or any other information privileged under this section, to an applicant or government agency or to the public;</P>
            <P>(ii) Discloses any part of the report or results, or any other information privileged under this section, as a defense to charges that the creditor has violated the Act or regulation; or</P>

            <P>(iii) Fails or is unable to produce written or recorded information about <PRTPAGE P="33"/>the self-test that is required to be retained under § 202.12(b)(6) when the information is needed to determine whether the privilege applies. This paragraph does not limit any other penalty or remedy that may be available for a violation of § 202.12.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Limited use of privileged information.</E> Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the self-test report or results and any other information privileged under this section may be obtained and used by an applicant or government agency solely to determine a penalty or remedy after a violation of the Act or this regulation has been adjudicated or admitted. Disclosures for this limited purpose may be used only for the particular proceeding in which the adjudication or admission was made. Information disclosed under this paragraph (d)(3) remains privileged under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Enforcement, penalties and liabilities.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Administrative enforcement.</E> (1) As set forth more fully in section 704 of the Act, administrative enforcement of the Act and this regulation regarding certain creditors is assigned to the Comptroller of the Currency, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Thrift Supervision, National Credit Union Administration, Surface Transportation Board, Secretary of Agriculture, Farm Credit Administration, Securities and Exchange Commission, Small Business Administration, and Secretary of Transportation.</P>
            <P>(2) Except to the extent that administrative enforcement is specifically assigned to other authorities, compliance with the requirements imposed under the Act and this regulation is enforced by the Federal Trade Commission.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Penalties and liabilities.</E> (1) Sections 702(g) and 706(a) and (b) of the Act provide that any creditor that fails to comply with a requirement imposed by the Act or this regulation is subject to civil liability for actual and punitive damages in individual or class actions. Pursuant to sections 702(g) and 704(b), (c), and (d) of the Act, violations of the Act or this regulation also constitute violations of other federal laws. Liability for punitive damages can apply only to nongovernmental entities and is limited to $10,000 in individual actions and the lesser of $500,000 or 1 percent of the creditor's net worth in class actions. Section 706(c) provides for equitable and declaratory relief and section 706(d) authorizes the awarding of costs and reasonable attorney's fees to an aggrieved applicant in a successful action.</P>
            <P>(2) As provided in section 706(f), a civil action under the Act or this regulation may be brought in the appropriate United States district court without regard to the amount in controversy or in any other court of competent jurisdiction within two years after the date of the occurrence of the violation, or within one year after the commencement of an administrative enforcement proceeding or of a civil action brought by the Attorney General of the United States within two years after the alleged violation.</P>
            <P>(3) If an agency responsible for administrative enforcement is unable to obtain compliance with the Act or this regulation, it may refer the matter to the Attorney General of the United States. If the Board, the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of Thrift Supervision, or the National Credit Union Administration has reason to believe that one or more creditors have engaged in a pattern or practice of discouraging or denying applications in violation of the Act or this regulation, the agency shall refer the matter to the Attorney General. If the agency has reason to believe that one or more creditors violated section 701(a) of the Act, the agency may refer a matter to the Attorney General.</P>
            <P>(4) On referral, or whenever the Attorney General has reason to believe that one or more creditors have engaged in a pattern or practice in violation of the Act or this regulation, the Attorney General may bring a civil action for such relief as may be appropriate, including actual and punitive damages and injunctive relief.</P>

On discovering an error under §§ 202.9 and 202.10, the creditor shall correct it as soon as possible. If a creditor inadvertently obtains the monitoring information regarding the ethnicity, race, and sex of the applicant in a dwelling-related transaction not covered by § 202.13, the creditor may retain information and act on the application without violating the regulation.</P>

              <P>1. This appendix contains five model credit application forms, each designated for use in a particular type of consumer credit transaction as indicated by the bracketed caption on each form. The first sample form is intended for use in open-end, unsecured transactions; the second for closed-end, secured transactions; the third for closed-end transactions, whether unsecured or secured; the fourth in transactions involving community property or occurring in community property states; and the fifth in residential mortgage transactions which contains a model disclosure for use in complying with § 202.13 for certain dwelling-related loans. All forms contained in this appendix are models; their use by creditors is optional.</P>
              <P>2. The use or modification of these forms is governed by the following instructions. A creditor may change the forms: by asking for additional information not prohibited by § 202.5; by deleting any information request; or by rearranging the format without modifying the substance of the inquiries. In any of these three instances, however, the appropriate notices regarding the optional nature of courtesy titles, the option to disclose alimony, child support, or separate maintenance, and the limitation concerning marital status inquiries must be included in the appropriate places if the items to which they relate appear on the creditor's form.</P>
              <P>3. If a creditor uses an appropriate Appendix B model form, or modifies a form in accordance with the above instructions, that creditor shall be deemed to be acting in compliance with the provisions of paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of § 202.5 of this regulation.</P>

              <EAR>Pt. 202, App. C</EAR>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix C to Part 202—Sample Notification Forms</HD>
              <P>1. This appendix contains ten sample notification forms. Forms C-1 through C-4 are intended for use in notifying an applicant that adverse action has been taken on an application or account under §§ 202.9(a)(1) and (2)(i) of this regulation. Form C-5 is a notice of disclosure of the right to request specific reasons for adverse action under §§ 202.9(a)(1) and (2)(ii). Form C-6 is designed for use in notifying an applicant, under § 202.9(c)(2), that an application is incomplete. Forms C-7 and C-8 are intended for use in connection with applications for business credit under § 202.9(a)(3). Form C-9 is designed for use in notifying an applicant of the right to receive a copy of an appraisal under § 202.14. Form C-10 is designed for use in notifying an applicant for nonmortgage credit that the creditor is requesting applicant characteristic information.</P>
              <P>2. Form C-1 contains the Fair Credit Reporting Act disclosure as required by sections 615(a) and (b) of that act. Forms C-2 through C-5 contain only the section 615(a) disclosure (that a creditor obtained information from a consumer reporting agency that was considered in the credit decision and, as applicable, a credit score used in taking adverse action along with related information). A creditor must provide the section 615(a) disclosure when adverse action is taken against a consumer based on information from a consumer reporting agency. A creditor must provide the section 615(b) disclosure when adverse action is taken based on information from an outside source other than a consumer reporting agency. In addition, a creditor must provide the section 615(b) disclosure if the creditor obtained information from an affiliate other than information in a consumer report or other than information concerning the affiliate's own transactions or experiences with the consumer. Creditors may comply with the disclosure requirements for adverse action based on information in a consumer report obtained from an affiliate by providing either the section 615(a) or section 615(b) disclosure. Optional language in Forms C-1 through C-5 may be used to direct the consumer to the entity that provided the credit score for any questions about the credit score, along with the entity's contact information. Creditors may use or not use this additional language without losing the safe harbor, since the language is optional.</P>
              <P>3. The sample forms are illustrative and may not be appropriate for all creditors. They were designed to include some of the factors that creditors most commonly consider. If a creditor chooses to use the checklist of reasons provided in one of the sample forms in this appendix and if reasons commonly used by the creditor are not provided on the form, the creditor should modify the checklist by substituting or adding other reasons. For example, if “inadequate down payment” or “no deposit relationship with us” are common reasons for taking adverse action on an application, the creditor ought to add or substitute such reasons for those presently contained on the sample forms.</P>
              <P>4. If the reasons listed on the forms are not the factors actually used, a creditor will not satisfy the notice requirement by simply checking the closest identifiable factor listed. For example, some creditors consider only references from banks or other depository institutions and disregard finance company references altogether; their statement of reasons should disclose “insufficient bank references,” not “insufficient credit references.” Similarly, a creditor that considers bank references and other credit references as distinct factors should treat the two factors separately and disclose them as appropriate. The creditor should either add such other factors to the form or check “other” and include the appropriate explanation. The creditor need not, however, describe how or why a factor adversely affected the application. For example, the notice may say “length of residence” rather than “too short a period of residence.”</P>
              <P>5. A creditor may design its own notification forms or use all or a portion of the forms contained in this appendix. Proper use of Forms C-1 through C-4 will satisfy the requirement of § 202.9(a)(2)(i). Proper use of Forms C-5 and C-6 constitutes full compliance with §§ 202.9(a)(2)(ii) and 202.9(c)(2), respectively. Proper use of Forms C-7 and C-8 will satisfy the requirements of § 202.9(a)(2)(i) and (ii), respectively, for applications for business credit. Proper use of Form C-9 will satisfy the requirements of § 202.14 of this part. Proper use of Form C-10 will satisfy the requirements of § 202.5(b)(1).</P>

              <P>Following is an official staff interpretation of Regulation B (12 CFR part 202) issued under authority delegated by the Federal Reserve Board to officials in the Division of Consumer and Community Affairs. References are to sections of the regulation or the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (15 U.S.C. 1601 <E T="03">et seq.</E>).</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Introduction</HD>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Official status.</E> Section 706(e) of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act protects a creditor from civil liability for any act done or omitted in good faith in conformity with an interpretation issued by a duly authorized official of the Federal Reserve Board. This commentary is the means by which the Division of Consumer and Community Affairs of the Federal Reserve Board issues official staff interpretations of Regulation B. Good-faith compliance with this commentary affords a <PRTPAGE P="54"/>creditor protection under section 706(e) of the Act.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Issuance of interpretations.</E> Under Appendix D to the regulation, any person may request an official staff interpretation. Interpretations will be issued at the discretion of designated officials and incorporated in this commentary following publication for comment in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> Except in unusual circumstances, official staff interpretations will be issued only by means of this commentary.</P>
              <P>3. <E T="03">Status of previous interpretations.</E> Interpretations of Regulation B previously issued by the Federal Reserve Board and its staff have been incorporated into this commentary as appropriate. All other previous Board and staff interpretations, official and unofficial, are superseded by this commentary.</P>
              <P>4. <E T="03">Footnotes.</E> Footnotes in the regulation have the same legal effect as the text of the regulation, whether they are explanatory or illustrative in nature.</P>
              <P>5. <E T="03">Comment designations.</E> The comments are designated with as much specificity as possible according to the particular regulatory provision addressed. Each comment in the commentary is identified by a number and the regulatory section or paragraph that it interprets. For example, comments to § 202.2(c) are further divided by subparagraph, such as comment 2(c)(1)(ii)-1 and comment 2(c)(2)(ii)-1.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 202.1—Authority, Scope, and Purpose</HD>
              <P>1(a) <E T="03">Authority and scope.</E>
              </P>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Scope.</E> The Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B apply to all credit—commercial as well as personal—without regard to the nature or type of the credit or the creditor. If a transaction provides for the deferral of the payment of a debt, it is credit covered by Regulation B even though it may not be a credit transaction covered by Regulation Z (Truth in Lending) (12 CFR part 226). Further, the definition of creditor is not restricted to the party or person to whom the obligation is initially payable, as is the case under Regulation Z. Moreover, the Act and regulation apply to all methods of credit evaluation, whether performed judgmentally or by use of a credit scoring system.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Foreign applicability.</E> Regulation B generally does not apply to lending activities that occur outside the United States. The regulation does apply to lending activities that take place within the United States (as well as the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and any territory or possession of the United States), whether or not the applicant is a citizen.</P>
              <P>3. <E T="03">Board.</E> The term <E T="03">Board,</E> as used in this regulation, means the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 202.2—Definitions</HD>
              <P>2(c) <E T="03">Adverse action.</E>
              </P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 2(c)(1)(i)</HD>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Application for credit.</E> If the applicant applied in accordance with the creditor's procedures, a refusal to refinance or extend the term of a business or other loan is adverse action.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 2(c)(1)(ii)</HD>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Move from service area.</E> If a credit card issuer terminates the open-end account of a customer because the customer has moved out of the card issuer's service area, the termination is adverse action unless termination on this ground was explicitly provided for in the credit agreement between the parties. In cases where termination is adverse action, notification is required under § 202.9.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Termination based on credit limit.</E> If a creditor terminates credit accounts that have low credit limits (for example, under $400) but keeps open accounts with higher credit limits, the termination is adverse action and notification is required under § 202.9.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 2(c)(2)(ii)</HD>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Default—exercise of due-on-sale clause.</E> If a mortgagor sells or transfers mortgaged property without the consent of the mortgagee, and the mortgagee exercises its contractual right to accelerate the mortgage loan, the mortgagee may treat the mortgagor as being in default. An adverse action notice need not be given to the mortgagor or the transferee. (See comment 2(e)-1 for treatment of a purchaser who requests to assume the loan.)</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Current delinquency or default.</E> The term adverse action does not include a creditor's termination of an account when the accountholder is currently in default or delinquent on that account. Notification in accordance with § 202.9 of the regulation generally is required, however, if the creditor's action is based on a past delinquency or default on the account.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 2(c)(2)(iii)</HD>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Point-of-sale transactions.</E> Denial of credit at point of sale is not adverse action except under those circumstances specified in the regulation. For example, denial at point of sale is not adverse action in the following situations:</P>
              <P>i. A credit cardholder presents an expired card or a card that has been reported to the card issuer as lost or stolen.</P>
              <P>ii. The amount of a transaction exceeds a cash advance or credit limit.</P>

              <P>iii. The circumstances (such as excessive use of a credit card in a short period of time) suggest that fraud is involved.<PRTPAGE P="55"/>
              </P>
              <P>iv. The authorization facilities are not functioning.</P>
              <P>v. Billing statements have been returned to the creditor for lack of a forwarding address.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Application for increase in available credit.</E> A refusal or failure to authorize an account transaction at the point of sale or loan is not adverse action except when the refusal is a denial of an application, submitted in accordance with the creditor's procedures, for an increase in the amount of credit.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 2(c)(2)(v)</HD>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Terms of credit versus type of credit offered.</E> When an applicant applies for credit and the creditor does not offer the credit terms requested by the applicant (for example, the interest rate, length of maturity, collateral, or amount of downpayment), a denial of the application for that reason is adverse action (unless the creditor makes a counteroffer that is accepted by the applicant) and the applicant is entitled to notification under § 202.9.</P>
              <P>2(e) <E T="03">Applicant.</E>
              </P>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Request to assume loan.</E> If a mortgagor sells or transfers the mortgaged property and the buyer makes an application to the creditor to assume the mortgage loan, the mortgagee must treat the buyer as an applicant unless its policy is not to permit assumptions.</P>
              <P>2(f) <E T="03">Application.</E>
              </P>
              <P>1. <E T="03">General.</E> A creditor has the latitude under the regulation to establish its own application process and to decide the type and amount of information it will require from credit applicants.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Procedures used.</E> The term “procedures” refers to the actual practices followed by a creditor for making credit decisions as well as its stated application procedures. For example, if a creditor's stated policy is to require all applications to be in writing on the creditor's application form, but the creditor also makes credit decisions based on oral requests, the creditor's procedures are to accept both oral and written applications.</P>
              <P>3. <E T="03">When an inquiry or prequalification request becomes an application.</E> A creditor is encouraged to provide consumers with information about loan terms. However, if in giving information to the consumer the creditor also evaluates information about the consumer, decides to decline the request, and communicates this to the consumer, the creditor has treated the inquiry or prequalification request as an application and must then comply with the notification requirements under § 202.9. Whether the inquiry or prequalification request becomes an application depends on how the creditor responds to the consumer, not on what the consumer says or asks. (See comment 9-5 for further discussion of prequalification requests; see comment 2(f)-5 for a discussion of preapproval requests.)</P>
              <P>4. <E T="03">Examples of inquiries that are not applications.</E> The following examples illustrate situations in which only an inquiry has taken place:</P>
              <P>i. A consumer calls to ask about loan terms and an employee explains the creditor's basic loan terms, such as interest rates, loan-to-value ratio, and debt-to-income ratio.</P>
              <P>ii. A consumer calls to ask about interest rates for car loans, and, in order to quote the appropriate rate, the loan officer asks for the make and sales price of the car and the amount of the downpayment, then gives the consumer the rate.</P>
              <P>iii. A consumer asks about terms for a loan to purchase a home and tells the loan officer her income and intended downpayment, but the loan officer only explains the creditor's loan-to-value ratio policy and other basic lending policies, without telling the consumer whether she qualifies for the loan.</P>
              <P>iv. A consumer calls to ask about terms for a loan to purchase vacant land and states his income and the sales price of the property to be financed, and asks whether he qualifies for a loan; the employee responds by describing the general lending policies, explaining that he would need to look at all of the consumer's qualifications before making a decision, and offering to send an application form to the consumer.</P>
              <P>5. <E T="03">Examples of an application.</E> An application for credit includes the following situations:</P>
              <P>i. A person asks a financial institution to “preapprove” her for a loan (for example, to finance a house or a vehicle she plans to buy) and the institution reviews the request under a program in which the institution, after a comprehensive analysis of her creditworthiness, issues a written commitment valid for a designated period of time to extend a loan up to a specified amount. The written commitment may not be subject to conditions other than conditions that require the identification of adequate collateral, conditions that require no material change in the applicant's financial condition or creditworthiness prior to funding the loan, and limited conditions that are not related to the financial condition or creditworthiness of the applicant that the lender ordinarily attaches to a traditional application (such as certification of a clear termite inspection for a home purchase loan, or a maximum mileage requirement for a used car loan). But if the creditor's program does not provide for giving written commitments, requests for preapprovals are treated as prequalification requests for purposes of the regulation.</P>

              <P>ii. Under the same facts as above, the financial institution evaluates the person's <PRTPAGE P="56"/>creditworthiness and determines that she does not qualify for a preapproval.</P>
              <P>6. <E T="03">Completed application—diligence requirement.</E> The regulation defines a completed application in terms that give a creditor the latitude to establish its own information requirements. Nevertheless, the creditor must act with reasonable diligence to collect information needed to complete the application. For example, the creditor should request information from third parties, such as a credit report, promptly after receiving the application. If additional information is needed from the applicant, such as an address or a telephone number to verify employment, the creditor should contact the applicant promptly. (But see comment 9(a)(1)-3, which discusses the creditor's option to deny an application on the basis of incompleteness.)</P>
              <P>2(g) <E T="03">Business credit.</E>
              </P>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Definition.</E> The test for deciding whether a transaction qualifies as business credit is one of primary purpose. For example, an open-end credit account used for both personal and business purposes is not business credit unless the primary purpose of the account is business-related. A creditor may rely on an applicant's statement of the purpose for the credit requested.</P>
              <P>2(j) <E T="03">Credit.</E>
              </P>
              <P>1. <E T="03">General.</E> Regulation B covers a wider range of credit transactions than Regulation Z (Truth in Lending). Under Regulation B, a transaction is credit if there is a right to defer payment of a debt—regardless of whether the credit is for personal or commercial purposes, the number of installments required for repayment, or whether the transaction is subject to a finance charge.</P>
              <P>2(l) <E T="03">Creditor.</E>
              </P>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Assignees.</E> The term creditor includes all persons participating in the credit decision. This may include an assignee or a potential purchaser of the obligation who influences the credit decision by indicating whether or not it will purchase the obligation if the transaction is consummated.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Referrals to creditors.</E> For certain purposes, the term creditor includes persons such as real estate brokers, automobile dealers, home builders, and home-improvement contractors who do not participate in credit decisions but who only accept applications and refer applicants to creditors, or select or offer to select creditors to whom credit requests can be made. These persons must comply with § 202.4(a), the general rule prohibiting discrimination, and with § 202.4(b), the general rule against discouraging applications.</P>
              <P>2(p) <E T="03">Empirically derived and other credit scoring systems.</E>
              </P>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Purpose of definition.</E> The definition under § 202.2(p)(1)(i) through (iv) sets the criteria that a credit system must meet in order to use age as a predictive factor. Credit systems that do not meet these criteria are judgmental systems and may consider age only for the purpose of determining a “pertinent element of creditworthiness.” (Both types of systems may favor an elderly applicant. See § 202.6(b)(2).)</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Periodic revalidation.</E> The regulation does not specify how often credit scoring systems must be revalidated. The credit scoring system must be revalidated frequently enough to ensure that it continues to meet recognized professional statistical standards for statistical soundness. To ensure that predictive ability is being maintained, the creditor must periodically review the performance of the system. This could be done, for example, by analyzing the loan portfolio to determine the delinquency rate for each score interval, or by analyzing population stability over time to detect deviations of recent applications from the applicant population used to validate the system. If this analysis indicates that the system no longer predicts risk with statistical soundness, the system must be adjusted as necessary to reestablish its predictive ability. A creditor is responsible for ensuring its system is validated and revalidated based on the creditor's own data.</P>
              <P>3. <E T="03">Pooled data scoring systems.</E> A scoring system or the data from which to develop such a system may be obtained from either a single credit grantor or multiple credit grantors. The resulting system will qualify as an empirically derived, demonstrably and statistically sound, credit scoring system provided the criteria set forth in paragraph (p)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section are met. A creditor is responsible for ensuring its system is validated and revalidated based on the creditor's own data when it becomes available.</P>
              <P>4. <E T="03">Effects test and disparate treatment.</E> An empirically derived, demonstrably and statistically sound, credit scoring system may include age as a predictive factor (provided that the age of an elderly applicant is not assigned a negative factor or value). Besides age, no other prohibited basis may be used as a variable. Generally, credit scoring systems treat all applicants objectively and thus avoid problems of disparate treatment. In cases where a credit scoring system is used in conjunction with individual discretion, disparate treatment could conceivably occur in the evaluation process. In addition, neutral factors used in credit scoring systems could nonetheless be subject to challenge under the effects test. (See comment 6(a)-2 for a discussion of the effects test).</P>
              <P>2(w) <E T="03">Open-end credit.</E>
              </P>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Open-end real estate mortgages.</E> The term “open-end credit” does not include negotiated advances under an open-end real estate mortgage or a letter of credit.</P>
              <P>2(z) <E T="03">Prohibited basis.</E>
                <PRTPAGE P="57"/>
              </P>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Persons associated with applicant.</E> As used in this regulation, prohibited basis refers not only to characteristics—the race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, or age—of an applicant (or officers of an applicant in the case of a corporation) but also to the characteristics of individuals with whom an applicant is affiliated or with whom the applicant associates. This means, for example, that under the general rule stated in § 202.4(a), a creditor may not discriminate against an applicant because of that person's personal or business dealings with members of a certain religion, because of the national origin of any persons associated with the extension of credit (such as the tenants in the apartment complex being financed), or because of the race of other residents in the neighborhood where the property offered as collateral is located.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">National origin.</E> A creditor may not refuse to grant credit because an applicant comes from a particular country but may take the applicant's immigration status into account. A creditor may also take into account any applicable law, regulation, or executive order restricting dealings with citizens (or the government) of a particular country or imposing limitations regarding credit extended for their use.</P>
              <P>3. <E T="03">Public assistance program.</E> Any federal, state, or local governmental assistance program that provides a continuing, periodic income supplement, whether premised on entitlement or need, is “public assistance” for purposes of the regulation. The term includes (but is not limited to) Temporary Aid to Needy Families, food stamps, rent and mortgage supplement or assistance programs, social security and supplemental security income, and unemployment compensation. Only physicians, hospitals, and others to whom the benefits are payable need consider Medicare and Medicaid as public assistance.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 202.3—Limited Exceptions for Certain Classes of Transactions</HD>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Scope.</E> Under this section, procedural requirements of the regulation do not apply to certain types of credit. All classes of transactions remain subject to § 202.4(a), the general rule barring discrimination on a prohibited basis, and to any other provision not specifically excepted.</P>
              <P>3(a) <E T="03">Public-utilities credit.</E>
              </P>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Definition.</E> This definition applies only to credit for the purchase of a utility service, such as electricity, gas, or telephone service. Credit provided or offered by a public utility for some other purpose—such as for financing the purchase of a gas dryer, telephone equipment, or other durable goods, or for insulation or other home improvements—is not excepted.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Security deposits.</E> A utility company is a creditor when it supplies utility service and bills the user after the service has been provided. Thus, any credit term (such as a requirement for a security deposit) is subject to the regulation's bar against discrimination on a prohibited basis.</P>
              <P>3. <E T="03">Telephone companies.</E> A telephone company's credit transactions qualify for the exceptions provided in § 202.3(a)(2) only if the company is regulated by a government unit or files the charges for service, delayed payment, or any discount for prompt payment with a government unit.</P>
              <P>3(c) <E T="03">Incidental credit.</E>
              </P>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Examples.</E> If a service provider (such as a hospital, doctor, lawyer, or merchant) allows the client or customer to defer the payment of a bill, this deferral of debt is credit for purposes of the regulation, even though there is no finance charge and no agreement for payment in installments. Because of the exceptions provided by this section, however, these particular credit extensions are excepted from compliance with certain procedural requirements as specified in § 202.3(c).</P>
              <P>3(d) <E T="03">Government credit.</E>
              </P>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Credit to governments.</E> The exception relates to credit extended to (not by) governmental entities. For example, credit extended to a local government is covered by this exception, but credit extended to consumers by a federal or state housing agency does not qualify for special treatment under this category.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 202.4—General Rules</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 4(a)</HD>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Scope of rule.</E> The general rule stated in § 202.4(a) covers all dealings, without exception, between an applicant and a creditor, whether or not addressed by other provisions of the regulation. Other provisions of the regulation identify specific practices that the Board has decided are impermissible because they could result in credit discrimination on a basis prohibited by the Act. The general rule covers, for example, application procedures, criteria used to evaluate creditworthiness, administration of accounts, and treatment of delinquent or slow accounts. Thus, whether or not specifically prohibited elsewhere in the regulation, a credit practice that treats applicants differently on a prohibited basis violates the law because it violates the general rule. Disparate treatment on a prohibited basis is illegal whether or not it results from a conscious intent to discriminate.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Examples.</E>
              </P>
              <P>i. Disparate treatment would exist, for example, in the following situations:</P>

              <P>A. A creditor provides information only on “subprime” and similar products to minority applicants who request information about the creditor's mortgage products, but provides information on a wider variety of <PRTPAGE P="58"/>mortgage products to similarly situated nonminority applicants.</P>
              <P>B. A creditor provides more comprehensive information to men than to similarly situated women.</P>
              <P>C. A creditor requires a minority applicant to provide greater documentation to obtain a loan than a similarly situated nonminority applicant.</P>
              <P>D. A creditor waives or relaxes credit standards for a nonminority applicant but not for a similarly situated minority applicant.</P>
              <P>ii. Treating applicants differently on a prohibited basis is unlawful if the creditor lacks a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its action, or if the asserted reason is found to be a pretext for discrimination.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 4(b)</HD>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Prospective applicants.</E> Generally, the regulation's protections apply only to persons who have requested or received an extension of credit. In keeping with the purpose of the Act—to promote the availability of credit on a nondiscriminatory basis—§ 202.4(b) covers acts or practices directed at prospective applicants that could discourage a reasonable person, on a prohibited basis, from applying for credit. Practices prohibited by this section include:</P>
              <P>i. A statement that the applicant should not bother to apply, after the applicant states that he is retired.</P>
              <P>ii. The use of words, symbols, models or other forms of communication in advertising that express, imply, or suggest a discriminatory preference or a policy of exclusion in violation of the Act.</P>
              <P>iii. The use of interview scripts that discourage applications on a prohibited basis.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Affirmative advertising.</E> A creditor may affirmatively solicit or encourage members of traditionally disadvantaged groups to apply for credit, especially groups that might not normally seek credit from that creditor.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 4(c)</HD>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Requirement for written applications.</E> Model application forms are provided in Appendix B to the regulation, although use of a printed form is not required. A creditor will satisfy the requirement by writing down the information that it normally considers in making a credit decision. The creditor may complete an application on behalf of an applicant and need not require the applicant to sign the application.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Telephone applications.</E> A creditor that accepts applications by telephone for dwelling-related credit covered by § 202.13 can meet the requirement for written applications by writing down pertinent information that is provided by the applicant.</P>
              <P>3. <E T="03">Computerized entry.</E> Information entered directly into and retained by a computerized system qualifies as a written application under this paragraph. (See the commentary to § 202.13(b), <E T="03">Applications through electronic media</E> and <E T="03">Applications through video.</E>)</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 4(d)</HD>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Clear and conspicuous.</E> This standard requires that disclosures be presented in a reasonably understandable format in a way that does not obscure the required information. No minimum type size is mandated, but the disclosures must be legible, whether typewritten, handwritten, or printed by computer.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Form of disclosures.</E> Whether the disclosures required to be on or with an application must be in electronic form depends upon the following:</P>
              <P>i. If an applicant accesses a credit application electronically (other than as described under ii below), such as online at a home computer, the creditor must provide the disclosures in electronic form (such as with the application form on its website) in order to meet the requirement to provide disclosures in a timely manner on or with the application. If the creditor instead mailed paper disclosures to the applicant, this requirement would not be met.</P>
              <P>ii. In contrast, if an applicant is physically present in the creditor's office, and accesses a credit application electronically, such as via a terminal or kiosk (or if the applicant uses a terminal or kiosk located on the premises of an affiliate or third party that has arranged with the creditor to provide applications to consumers), the creditor may provide disclosures in either electronic or paper form, provided the creditor complies with the timing, delivery, and retainability requirements of the regulation.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 5(a)(1)</HD>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Requests for information.</E> This section governs the types of information that a creditor may gather. Section 202.6 governs how information may be used.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 5(a)(2)</HD>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Local laws.</E> Information that a creditor is allowed to collect pursuant to a “state” statute or regulation includes information required by a local statute, regulation, or ordinance.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Information required by Regulation C.</E> Regulation C generally requires creditors covered by the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) to collect and report information about the race, ethnicity, and sex of applicants for home-improvement loans and home-purchase loans, including some types of loans not covered by § 202.13.<PRTPAGE P="59"/>
              </P>
              <P>3. <E T="03">Collecting information on behalf of creditors.</E> Persons such as loan brokers and correspondents do not violate the ECOA or Regulation B if they collect information that they are otherwise prohibited from collecting, where the purpose of collecting the information is to provide it to a creditor that is subject to the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act or another federal or state statute or regulation requiring data collection.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 5(d)(1)</HD>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Indirect disclosure of prohibited information.</E> The fact that certain credit-related information may indirectly disclose marital status does not bar a creditor from seeking such information. For example, the creditor may ask about:</P>
              <P>i. The applicant's obligation to pay alimony, child support, or separate maintenance income.</P>
              <P>ii. The source of income to be used as the basis for repaying the credit requested, which could disclose that it is the income of a spouse.</P>
              <P>iii. Whether any obligation disclosed by the applicant has a co-obligor, which could disclose that the co-obligor is a spouse or former spouse.</P>
              <P>iv. The ownership of assets, which could disclose the interest of a spouse.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 5(d)(2)</HD>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Disclosure about income.</E> The sample application forms in appendix B to the regulation illustrate how a creditor may inform an applicant of the right not to disclose alimony, child support, or separate maintenance income.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">General inquiry about source of income.</E> Since a general inquiry about the source of income may lead an applicant to disclose alimony, child support, or separate maintenance income, a creditor making such an inquiry on an application form should preface the request with the disclosure required by this paragraph.</P>
              <P>3. <E T="03">Specific inquiry about sources of income.</E> A creditor need not give the disclosure if the inquiry about income is specific and worded in a way that is unlikely to lead the applicant to disclose the fact that income is derived from alimony, child support, or separate maintenance payments. For example, an application form that asks about specific types of income such as salary, wages, or investment income need not include the disclosure.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 202.6—Rules Concerning Evaluation of Applications</HD>
              <P>6(a) <E T="03">General rule concerning use of information.</E>
              </P>
              <P>1. <E T="03">General.</E> When evaluating an application for credit, a creditor generally may consider any information obtained. However, a creditor may not consider in its evaluation of creditworthiness any information that it is barred by § 202.5 from obtaining or from using for any purpose other than to conduct a self-test under § 202.15.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Effects test.</E> The effects test is a judicial doctrine that was developed in a series of employment cases decided by the U.S. Supreme Court under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e <E T="03">et seq.</E>), and the burdens of proof for such employment cases were codified by Congress in the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (42 U.S.C. 2000e-2). Congressional intent that this doctrine apply to the credit area is documented in the Senate Report that accompanied H.R. 6516, No. 94-589, pp. 4-5; and in the House Report that accompanied H.R. 6516, No. 94-210, p.5. The Act and regulation may prohibit a creditor practice that is discriminatory in effect because it has a disproportionately negative impact on a prohibited basis, even though the creditor has no intent to discriminate and the practice appears neutral on its face, unless the creditor practice meets a legitimate business need that cannot reasonably be achieved as well by means that are less disparate in their impact. For example, requiring that applicants have income in excess of a certain amount to qualify for an overdraft line of credit could mean that women and minority applicants will be rejected at a higher rate than men and nonminority applicants. If there is a demonstrable relationship between the income requirement and creditworthiness for the level of credit involved, however, use of the income standard would likely be permissible.</P>
              <P>6(b) <E T="03">Specific rules concerning use of information.</E>
              </P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 6(b)(1)</HD>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Prohibited basis—special purpose credit.</E> In a special purpose credit program, a creditor may consider a prohibited basis to determine whether the applicant possesses a characteristic needed for eligibility. (See § 202.8.)</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 6(b)(2)</HD>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Favoring the elderly.</E> Any system of evaluating creditworthiness may favor a credit applicant who is age 62 or older. A credit program that offers more favorable credit terms to applicants age 62 or older is also permissible; a program that offers more favorable credit terms to applicants at an age lower than 62 is permissible only if it meets the special-purpose credit requirements of § 202.8.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Consideration of age in a credit scoring system.</E> Age may be taken directly into account in a credit scoring system that is “demonstrably and statistically sound,” as defined in § 202.2(p), with one limitation: applicants age 62 years or older must be treated at least as favorably as applicants who are under age <PRTPAGE P="60"/>62. If age is scored by assigning points to an applicant's age category, elderly applicants must receive the same or a greater number of points as the most favored class of nonelderly applicants.</P>
              <P>i. <E T="03">Age-split scorecards.</E> Some credit systems segment the population and use different scorecards based on the age of an applicant. In such a system, one card may cover a narrow age range (for example, applicants in their twenties or younger) who are evaluated under attributes predictive for that age group. A second card may cover all other applicants, who are evaluated under the attributes predictive for that broader class. When a system uses a card covering a wide age range that encompasses elderly applicants, the credit scoring system is not deemed to score age. Thus, the system does not raise the issue of assigning a negative factor or value to the age of elderly applicants. But if a system segments the population by age into multiple scorecards, and includes elderly applicants in a narrower age range, the credit scoring system does score age. To comply with the Act and regulation in such a case, the creditor must ensure that the system does not assign a negative factor or value to the age of elderly applicants as a class.</P>
              <P>3. <E T="03">Consideration of age in a judgmental system.</E> In a judgmental system, defined in § 202.2(t), a creditor may not decide whether to extend credit or set the terms and conditions of credit based on age or information related exclusively to age. Age or age-related information may be considered only in evaluating other “pertinent elements of creditworthiness” that are drawn from the particular facts and circumstances concerning the applicant. For example, a creditor may not reject an application or terminate an account because the applicant is 60 years old. But a creditor that uses a judgmental system may relate the applicant's age to other information about the applicant that the creditor considers in evaluating creditworthiness. As the following examples illustrate, the evaluation must be made in an individualized, case-by-case manner:</P>
              <P>i. A creditor may consider the applicant's occupation and length of time to retirement to ascertain whether the applicant's income (including retirement income) will support the extension of credit to its maturity.</P>
              <P>ii. A creditor may consider the adequacy of any security offered when the term of the credit extension exceeds the life expectancy of the applicant and the cost of realizing on the collateral could exceed the applicant's equity. An elderly applicant might not qualify for a 5 percent down, 30-year mortgage loan but might qualify with a larger downpayment or a shorter loan maturity.</P>
              <P>iii. A creditor may consider the applicant's age to assess the significance of length of employment (a young applicant may have just entered the job market) or length of time at an address (an elderly applicant may recently have retired and moved from a long-term residence).</P>
              <P>4. <E T="03">Consideration of age in a reverse mortgage.</E> A reverse mortgage is a home-secured loan in which the borrower receives payments from the creditor, and does not become obligated to repay these amounts (other than in the case of default) until the borrower dies, moves permanently from the home, or transfers title to the home, or upon a specified maturity date. Disbursements to the borrower under a reverse mortgage typically are determined by considering the value of the borrower's home, the current interest rate, and the borrower's life expectancy. A reverse mortgage program that requires borrowers to be age 62 or older is permissible under § 202.6(b)(2)(iv). In addition, under § 202.6(b)(2)(iii), a creditor may consider a borrower's age to evaluate a pertinent element of creditworthiness, such as the amount of the credit or monthly payments that the borrower will receive, or the estimated repayment date.</P>
              <P>5. <E T="03">Consideration of age in a combined system.</E> A creditor using a credit scoring system that qualifies as “empirically derived” under § 202.2(p) may consider other factors (such as a credit report or the applicant's cash flow) on a judgmental basis. Doing so will not negate the classification of the credit scoring component of the combined system as “demonstrably and statistically sound.” While age could be used in the credit scoring portion, however, in the judgmental portion age may not be considered directly. It may be used only for the purpose of determining a “pertinent element of creditworthiness.” (See comment 6(b)(2)-3.)</P>
              <P>6. <E T="03">Consideration of public assistance.</E> When considering income derived from a public assistance program, a creditor may take into account, for example:</P>
              <P>i. The length of time an applicant will likely remain eligible to receive such income.</P>
              <P>ii. Whether the applicant will continue to qualify for benefits based on the status of the applicant's dependents (as in the case of Temporary Aid to Needy Families, or social security payments to a minor).</P>
              <P>iii. Whether the creditor can attach or garnish the income to assure payment of the debt in the event of default.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 6(b)(5)</HD>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Consideration of an individual applicant.</E> A creditor must evaluate income derived from part-time employment, alimony, child support, separate maintenance payments, retirement benefits, or public assistance on an <PRTPAGE P="61"/>individual basis, not on the basis of aggregate statistics; and must assess its reliability or unreliability by analyzing the applicant's actual circumstances, not by analyzing statistical measures derived from a group.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Payments consistently made.</E> In determining the likelihood of consistent payments of alimony, child support, or separate maintenance, a creditor may consider factors such as whether payments are received pursuant to a written agreement or court decree; the length of time that the payments have been received; whether the payments are regularly received by the applicant; the availability of court or other procedures to compel payment; and the creditworthiness of the payor, including the credit history of the payor when it is available to the creditor.</P>
              <P>3. <E T="03">Consideration of income.</E>
              </P>
              <P>i. A creditor need not consider income at all in evaluating creditworthiness. If a creditor does consider income, there are several acceptable methods, whether in a credit scoring or a judgmental system:</P>
              <P>A. A creditor may score or take into account the total sum of all income stated by the applicant without taking steps to evaluate the income for reliability.</P>
              <P>B. A creditor may evaluate each component of the applicant's income, and then score or take into account income determined to be reliable separately from other income; or the creditor may disregard that portion of income that is not reliable when it aggregates reliable income.</P>
              <P>C. A creditor that does not evaluate all income components for reliability must treat as reliable any component of protected income that is not evaluated.</P>
              <P>ii. In considering the separate components of an applicant's income, the creditor may not automatically discount or exclude from consideration any protected income. Any discounting or exclusion must be based on the applicant's actual circumstances.</P>
              <P>4. <E T="03">Part-time employment, sources of income.</E> A creditor may score or take into account the fact that an applicant has more than one source of earned income—a full-time and a part-time job or two part-time jobs. A creditor may also score or treat earned income from a secondary source differently than earned income from a primary source. The creditor may not, however, score or otherwise take into account the number of sources for income such as retirement income, social security, supplemental security income, and alimony. Nor may the creditor treat negatively the fact that an applicant's only earned income is derived from, for example, a part-time job.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 6(b)(6)</HD>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Types of credit references.</E> A creditor may restrict the types of credit history and credit references that it will consider, provided that the restrictions are applied to all credit applicants without regard to sex, marital status, or any other prohibited basis. On the applicant's request, however, a creditor must consider credit information not reported through a credit bureau when the information relates to the same types of credit references and history that the creditor would consider if reported through a credit bureau.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 6(b)(7)</HD>
              <P>1. <E T="03">National origin—immigration status.</E> The applicant's immigration status and ties to the community (such as employment and continued residence in the area) could have a bearing on a creditor's ability to obtain repayment. Accordingly, the creditor may consider immigration status and differentiate, for example, between a noncitizen who is a long-time resident with permanent resident status and a noncitizen who is temporarily in this country on a student visa.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">National origin—citizenship.</E> A denial of credit on the ground that an applicant is not a United States citizen is not per se discrimination based on national origin.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 6(b)(8)</HD>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Prohibited basis—marital status.</E> A creditor may consider the marital status of an applicant or joint applicant for the purpose of ascertaining the creditor's rights and remedies applicable to the particular extension of credit. For example, in a secured transaction involving real property, a creditor could take into account whether state law gives the applicant's spouse an interest in the property being offered as collateral.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 202.7—Rules Concerning Extensions of Credit</HD>
              <P>7(a) <E T="03">Individual accounts.</E>
              </P>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Open-end credit—authorized user.</E> A creditor may not require a creditworthy applicant seeking an individual credit account to provide additional signatures. But the creditor may condition the designation of an authorized user by the account holder on the authorized user's becoming contractually liable for the account, as long as the creditor does not differentiate on any prohibited basis in imposing this requirement.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Open-end credit—choice of authorized user.</E> A creditor that permits an account holder to designate an authorized user may not restrict this designation on a prohibited basis. For example, if the creditor allows the designation of spouses as authorized users, the creditor may not refuse to accept a nonspouse as an authorized user.</P>
              <P>3. <E T="03">Overdraft authority on transaction accounts.</E> If a transaction account (such as a checking account or NOW account) includes an overdraft line of credit, the creditor may require that all persons authorized to draw <PRTPAGE P="62"/>on the transaction account assume liability for any overdraft.</P>
              <P>7(b) <E T="03">Designation of name.</E>
              </P>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Single name on account.</E> A creditor may require that joint applicants on an account designate a single name for purposes of administering the account and that a single name be embossed on any credit cards issued on the account. But the creditor may not require that the name be the husband's name. (See § 202.10 for rules governing the furnishing of credit history on accounts held by spouses.)</P>
              <P>7(c) <E T="03">Action concerning existing open-end accounts.</E>
              </P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 7(c)(1)</HD>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Termination coincidental with marital status change.</E> When an account holder's marital status changes, a creditor generally may not terminate the account unless it has evidence that the account holder is now unable or unwilling to repay. But the creditor may terminate an account on which both spouses are jointly liable, even if the action coincides with a change in marital status, when one or both spouses:</P>
              <P>i. Repudiate responsibility for future charges on the joint account.</P>
              <P>ii. Request separate accounts in their own names.</P>
              <P>iii. Request that the joint account be closed.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Updating information.</E> A creditor may periodically request updated information from applicants but may not use events related to a prohibited basis—such as an applicant's retirement or reaching a particular age, or a change in name or marital status—to trigger such a request.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 7(c)(2)</HD>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Procedure pending reapplication.</E> A creditor may require a reapplication from an account holder, even when there is no evidence of unwillingness or inability to repay, if (1) the credit was based on the qualifications of a person who is no longer available to support the credit and (2) the creditor has information indicating that the account holder's income may be insufficient to support the credit. While a reapplication is pending, the creditor must allow the account holder full access to the account under the existing contract terms. The creditor may specify a reasonable time period within which the account holder must submit the required information.</P>
              <P>7(d) <E T="03">Signature of spouse or other person.</E>
              </P>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Qualified applicant.</E> The signature rules ensure that qualified applicants are able to obtain credit in their own names. Thus, when an applicant requests individual credit, a creditor generally may not require the signature of another person unless the creditor has first determined that the applicant alone does not qualify for the credit requested.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Unqualified applicant.</E> When an applicant requests individual credit but does not meet a creditor's standards, the creditor may require a cosigner, guarantor, endorser, or similar partie—but cannot require that it be the spouse. (See commentary to § 202.7(d)(5) and (6).)</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 7(d)(1)</HD>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Signature of another person.</E> It is impermissible for a creditor to require an applicant who is individually creditworthy to provide a cosigner—even if the creditor applies the requirement without regard to sex, marital status, or any other prohibited basis. (But see comment 7(d)(6)-1 concerning guarantors of closely held corporations.)</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Joint applicant.</E> The term “joint applicant” refers to someone who applies contemporaneously with the applicant for shared or joint credit. It does not refer to someone whose signature is required by the creditor as a condition for granting the credit requested.</P>
              <P>3. <E T="03">Evidence of joint application.</E> A person's intent to be a joint applicant must be evidenced at the time of application. Signatures on a promissory note may not be used to show intent to apply for joint credit. On the other hand, signatures or initials on a credit application affirming applicants' intent to apply for joint credit may be used to establish intent to apply for joint credit. (See Appendix B). The method used to establish intent must be distinct from the means used by individuals to affirm the accuracy of information. For example, signatures on a joint financial statement affirming the veracity of information are not sufficient to establish intent to apply for joint credit.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 7(d)(2)</HD>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Jointly owned property.</E> If an applicant requests unsecured credit, does not own sufficient separate property, and relies on joint property to establish creditworthiness, the creditor must value the applicant's interest in the jointly owned property. A creditor may not request that a nonapplicant joint owner sign any instrument as a condition of the credit extension unless the applicant's interest does not support the amount and terms of the credit sought.</P>
              <P>i. <E T="03">Valuation of applicant's interest.</E> In determining the value of an applicant's interest in jointly owned property, a creditor may consider factors such as the form of ownership and the property's susceptibility to attachment, execution, severance, or partition; the value of the applicant's interest after such action; and the cost associated with the action. This determination must be based on the existing form of ownership, and not on the possibility of a subsequent change. For <PRTPAGE P="63"/>example, in determining whether a married applicant's interest in jointly owned property is sufficient to satisfy the creditor's standards of creditworthiness for individual credit, a creditor may not consider that the applicant's separate property could be transferred into tenancy by the entirety after consummation. Similarly, a creditor may not consider the possibility that the couple may divorce. Accordingly, a creditor may not require the signature of the nonapplicant spouse in these or similar circumstances.</P>
              <P>ii. <E T="03">Other options to support credit.</E> If the applicant's interest in jointly owned property does not support the amount and terms of credit sought, the creditor may offer the applicant other options to qualify for the extension of credit. For example:</P>
              <P>A. Providing a co-signer or other party (§ 202.7(d)(5));</P>
              <P>B. Requesting that the credit be granted on a secured basis (§ 202.7(d)(4)); or</P>
              <P>C. Providing the signature of the joint owner on an instrument that ensures access to the property in the event of the applicant's death or default, but does not impose personal liability unless necessary under state law (such as a limited guarantee). A creditor may not routinely require, however, that a joint owner sign an instrument (such as a quitclaim deed) that would result in the forfeiture of the joint owner's interest in the property.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Need for signature—reasonable belief.</E> A creditor's reasonable belief as to what instruments need to be signed by a person other than the applicant should be supported by a thorough review of pertinent statutory and decisional law or an opinion of the state attorney general.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 7(d)(3)</HD>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Residency.</E> In assessing the creditworthiness of a person who applies for credit in a community property state, a creditor may assume that the applicant is a resident of the state unless the applicant indicates otherwise.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 7(d)(4)</HD>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Creation of enforceable lien.</E> Some state laws require that both spouses join in executing any instrument by which real property is encumbered. If an applicant offers such property as security for credit, a creditor may require the applicant's spouse to sign the instruments necessary to create a valid security interest in the property. The creditor may not require the spouse to sign the note evidencing the credit obligation if signing only the mortgage or other security agreement is sufficient to make the property available to satisfy the debt in the event of default. However, if under state law both spouses must sign the note to create an enforceable lien, the creditor may require the signatures.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Need for signature—reasonable belief.</E> Generally, a signature to make the secured property available will only be needed on a security agreement. A creditor's reasonable belief that, to ensure access to the property, the spouse's signature is needed on an instrument that imposes personal liability should be supported by a thorough review of pertinent statutory and decisional law or an opinion of the state attorney general.</P>
              <P>3. <E T="03">Integrated instruments.</E> When a creditor uses an integrated instrument that combines the note and the security agreement, the spouse cannot be asked to sign the integrated instrument if the signature is only needed to grant a security interest. But the spouse could be asked to sign an integrated instrument that makes clear—for example, by a legend placed next to the spouse's signature—that the spouse's signature is only to grant a security interest and that signing the instrument does not impose personal liability.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 7(d)(5)</HD>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Qualifications of additional parties.</E> In establishing guidelines for eligibility of guarantors, cosigners, or similar additional parties, a creditor may restrict the applicant's choice of additional parties but may not discriminate on the basis of sex, marital status, or any other prohibited basis. For example, the creditor could require that the additional party live in the creditor's market area.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Reliance on income of another person—individual credit.</E> An applicant who requests individual credit relying on the income of another person (including a spouse in a non-community property state) may be required to provide the signature of the other person to make the income available to pay the debt. In community property states, the signature of a spouse may be required if the applicant relies on the spouse's separate income. If the applicant relies on the spouse's future earnings that as a matter of state law cannot be characterized as community property until earned, the creditor may require the spouse's signature, but need not do so—even if it is the creditor's practice to require the signature when an applicant relies on the future earnings of a person other than a spouse. (See § 202.6(c) on consideration of state property laws.)</P>
              <P>3. <E T="03">Renewals.</E> If the borrower's creditworthiness is reevaluated when a credit obligation is renewed, the creditor must determine whether an additional party is still warranted and, if not warranted, release the additional party.<PRTPAGE P="64"/>

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 7(d)(6)</HD>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Guarantees.</E> A guarantee on an extension of credit is part of a credit transaction and therefore subject to the regulation. A creditor may require the personal guarantee of the partners, directors, or officers of a business, and the shareholders of a closely held corporation, even if the business or corporation is creditworthy. The requirement must be based on the guarantor's relationship with the business or corporation, however, and not on a prohibited basis. For example, a creditor may not require guarantees only for women-owned or minority-owned businesses. Similarly, a creditor may not require guarantees only of the married officers of a business or the married shareholders of a closely held corporation.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Spousal guarantees.</E> The rules in § 202.7(d) bar a creditor from requiring the signature of a guarantor's spouse just as they bar the creditor from requiring the signature of an applicant's spouse. For example, although a creditor may require all officers of a closely held corporation to personally guarantee a corporate loan, the creditor may not automatically require that spouses of married officers also sign the guarantee. If an evaluation of the financial circumstances of an officer indicates that an additional signature is necessary, however, the creditor may require the signature of another person in appropriate circumstances in accordance with § 202.7(d)(2).</P>

              </P>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Differences in terms.</E> Differences in the availability, rates, and other terms on which credit-related casualty insurance or credit life, health, accident, or disability insurance is offered or provided to an applicant does not violate Regulation B.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Insurance information.</E> A creditor may obtain information about an applicant's age, sex, or marital status for insurance purposes. The information may only be used for determining eligibility and premium rates for insurance, however, and not in making the credit decision.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 202.8—Special Purpose Credit Programs</HD>
              <P>8(a) <E T="03">Standards for programs.</E>
              </P>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Determining qualified programs.</E> The Board does not determine whether individual programs qualify for special purpose credit status, or whether a particular program benefits an “economically disadvantaged class of persons.” The agency or creditor administering or offering the loan program must make these decisions regarding the status of its program.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Compliance with a program authorized by federal or state law.</E> A creditor does not violate Regulation B when it complies in good faith with a regulation promulgated by a government agency implementing a special purpose credit program under § 202.8(a)(1). It is the agency's responsibility to promulgate a regulation that is consistent with federal and state law.</P>
              <P>3. <E T="03">Expressly authorized.</E> Credit programs authorized by federal or state law include programs offered pursuant to federal, state, or local statute, regulation or ordinance, or pursuant to judicial or administrative order.</P>
              <P>4. <E T="03">Creditor liability.</E> A refusal to grant credit to an applicant is not a violation of the Act or regulation if the applicant does not meet the eligibility requirements under a special purpose credit program.</P>
              <P>5. <E T="03">Determining need.</E> In designing a special purpose credit program under § 202.8(a), a for-profit organization must determine that the program will benefit a class of people who would otherwise be denied credit or would receive it on less favorable terms. This determination can be based on a broad analysis using the organization's own research or data from outside sources, including governmental reports and studies. For example, a creditor might design new products to reach consumers who would not meet, or have not met, its traditional standards of creditworthiness due to such factors as credit inexperience or the use of credit sources that may not report to consumer reporting agencies. Or, a bank could review Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data along with demographic data for its assessment area and conclude that there is a need for a special purpose credit program for low-income minority borrowers.</P>
              <P>6. <E T="03">Elements of the program.</E> The written plan must contain information that supports the need for the particular program. The plan also must either state a specific period of time for which the program will last, or contain a statement regarding when the program will be reevaluated to determine if there is a continuing need for it.</P>
              <P>8(b) <E T="03">Rules in other sections.</E>
              </P>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Applicability of rules.</E> A creditor that rejects an application because the applicant does not meet the eligibility requirements (common characteristic or financial need, for example) must nevertheless notify the applicant of action taken as required by § 202.9.</P>
              <P>8(c) <E T="03">Special rule concerning requests and use of information.</E>
              </P>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Request of prohibited basis information.</E> This section permits a creditor to request and consider certain information that would otherwise be prohibited by §§ 202.5 and 202.6 to determine an applicant's eligibility for a particular program.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Examples.</E> Examples of programs under which the creditor can ask for and consider information about a prohibited basis are:</P>

              <P>i. Energy conservation programs to assist the elderly, for which the creditor must consider the applicant's age.<PRTPAGE P="65"/>
              </P>
              <P>ii. Programs under a Minority Enterprise Small Business Investment Corporation, for which a creditor must consider the applicant's minority status.</P>
              <P>8(d) <E T="03">Special rule in the case of financial need.</E>
              </P>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Request of prohibited basis information.</E> This section permits a creditor to request and consider certain information that would otherwise be prohibited by §§ 202.5 and 202.6, and to require signatures that would otherwise be prohibited by § 202.7(d).</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Examples.</E> Examples of programs in which financial need is a criterion are:</P>
              <P>i. Subsidized housing programs for low- to moderate-income households, for which a creditor may have to consider the applicant's receipt of alimony or child support, the spouse's or parents' income, etc.</P>
              <P>ii. Student loan programs based on the family's financial need, for which a creditor may have to consider the spouse's or parents' financial resources.</P>
              <P>3. <E T="03">Student loans.</E> In a guaranteed student loan program, a creditor may obtain the signature of a parent as a guarantor when required by federal or state law or agency regulation, or when the student does not meet the creditor's standards of creditworthiness. (See § 202.7(d)(1) and (5).) The creditor may not require an additional signature when a student has a work or credit history that satisfies the creditor's standards.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 202.9—Notifications</HD>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Use of the term adverse action.</E> The regulation does not require that a creditor use the term adverse action in communicating to an applicant that a request for an extension of credit has not been approved. In notifying an applicant of adverse action as defined by § 202.2(c)(1), a creditor may use any words or phrases that describe the action taken on the application.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Expressly withdrawn applications.</E> When an applicant expressly withdraws a credit application, the creditor is not required to comply with the notification requirements under § 202.9. (The creditor must comply, however, with the record retention requirements of the regulation. See § 202.12(b)(3).)</P>
              <P>3. <E T="03">When notification occurs.</E> Notification occurs when a creditor delivers or mails a notice to the applicant's last known address or, in the case of an oral notification, when the creditor communicates the credit decision to the applicant.</P>
              <P>4. <E T="03">Location of notice.</E> The notifications required under § 202.9 may appear on either or both sides of a form or letter.</P>
              <P>5. <E T="03">Prequalification requests.</E> Whether a creditor must provide a notice of action taken for a prequalification request depends on the creditor's response to the request, as discussed in comment 2(f)-3. For instance, a creditor may treat the request as an inquiry if the creditor evaluates specific information about the consumer and tells the consumer the loan amount, rate, and other terms of credit the consumer could qualify for under various loan programs, explaining the process the consumer must follow to submit a mortgage application and the information the creditor will analyze in reaching a credit decision. On the other hand, a creditor has treated a request as an application, and is subject to the adverse action notice requirements of § 202.9 if, after evaluating information, the creditor decides that it will not approve the request and communicates that decision to the consumer. For example, if the creditor tells the consumer that it would not approve an application for a mortgage because of a bankruptcy in the consumer's record, the creditor has denied an application for credit.</P>
              <P>9(a) <E T="03">Notification of action taken, ECOA notice, and statement of specific reasons.</E>
              </P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 9(a)(1)</HD>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Timing of notice—when an application is complete.</E> Once a creditor has obtained all the information it normally considers in making a credit decision, the application is complete and the creditor has 30 days in which to notify the applicant of the credit decision. (See also comment 2(f)-6.)</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Notification of approval.</E> Notification of approval may be express or by implication. For example, the creditor will satisfy the notification requirement when it gives the applicant the credit card, money, property, or services requested.</P>
              <P>3. <E T="03">Incomplete application—denial for incompleteness.</E> When an application is incomplete regarding information that the applicant can provide and the creditor lacks sufficient data for a credit decision, the creditor may deny the application giving as the reason for denial that the application is incomplete. The creditor has the option, alternatively, of providing a notice of incompleteness under § 202.9(c).</P>
              <P>4. <E T="03">Incomplete application—denial for reasons other than incompleteness.</E> When an application is missing information but provides sufficient data for a credit decision, the creditor may evaluate the application, make its credit decision, and notify the applicant accordingly. If credit is denied, the applicant must be given the specific reasons for the credit denial (or notice of the right to receive the reasons); in this instance missing information or “incomplete application” cannot be given as the reason for the denial.</P>
              <P>5. <E T="03">Length of counteroffer.</E> Section 202.9(a)(1)(iv) does not require a creditor to hold a counteroffer open for 90 days or any other particular length of time.</P>
              <P>6. <E T="03">Counteroffer combined with adverse action notice.</E> A creditor that gives the applicant a combined counteroffer and adverse action notice that complies with § 202.9(a)(2) need not send a second adverse action notice if the applicant does not accept the <PRTPAGE P="66"/>counteroffer. A sample of a combined notice is contained in form C-4 of Appendix C to the regulation.</P>
              <P>7. <E T="03">Denial of a telephone application.</E> When an application is made by telephone and adverse action is taken, the creditor must request the applicant's name and address in order to provide written notification under this section. If the applicant declines to provide that information, then the creditor has no further notification responsibility.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 9(a)(3)</HD>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Coverage.</E> In determining which rules in this paragraph apply to a given business credit application, a creditor may rely on the applicant's assertion about the revenue size of the business. (Applications to start a business are governed by the rules in § 202.9(a)(3)(i).) If an applicant applies for credit as a sole proprietor, the revenues of the sole proprietorship will determine which rules govern the application. However, if an applicant applies for business credit as an individual, the rules in § 202.9(a)(3)(i) apply unless the application is for trade or similar credit.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Trade credit.</E> The term trade credit generally is limited to a financing arrangement that involves a buyer and a seller—such as a supplier who finances the sale of equipment, supplies, or inventory; it does not apply to an extension of credit by a bank or other financial institution for the financing of such items.</P>
              <P>3. <E T="03">Factoring.</E> Factoring refers to a purchase of accounts receivable, and thus is not subject to the Act or regulation. If there is a credit extension incident to the factoring arrangement, the notification rules in § 202.9(a)(3)(ii) apply, as do other relevant sections of the Act and regulation.</P>
              <P>4. <E T="03">Manner of compliance.</E> In complying with the notice provisions of the Act and regulation, creditors offering business credit may follow the rules governing consumer credit. Similarly, creditors may elect to treat all business credit the same (irrespective of revenue size) by providing notice in accordance with § 202.9(a)(3)(i).</P>
              <P>5. <E T="03">Timing of notification.</E> A creditor subject to § 202.9(a)(3)(ii)(A) is required to notify a business credit applicant, orally or in writing, of action taken on an application within a reasonable time of receiving a completed application. Notice provided in accordance with the timing requirements of § 202.9(a)(1) is deemed reasonable in all instances.</P>
              <P>9(b) <E T="03">Form of ECOA notice and statement of specific reasons.</E>
              </P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 9(b)(1)</HD>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Substantially similar notice.</E> The ECOA notice sent with a notification of a credit denial or other adverse action will comply with the regulation if it is “substantially similar” to the notice contained in § 202.9(b)(1). For example, a creditor may add a reference to the fact that the ECOA permits age to be considered in certain credit scoring systems, or add a reference to a similar state statute or regulation and to a state enforcement agency.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 9(b)(2)</HD>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Number of specific reasons.</E> A creditor must disclose the principal reasons for denying an application or taking other adverse action. The regulation does not mandate that a specific number of reasons be disclosed, but disclosure of more than four reasons is not likely to be helpful to the applicant.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Source of specific reasons.</E> The specific reasons disclosed under §§ 202.9(a)(2) and (b)(2) must relate to and accurately describe the factors actually considered or scored by a creditor.</P>
              <P>3. <E T="03">Description of reasons.</E> A creditor need not describe how or why a factor adversely affected an applicant. For example, the notice may say “length of residence” rather than “too short a period of residence.”</P>
              <P>4. <E T="03">Credit scoring system.</E> If a creditor bases the denial or other adverse action on a credit scoring system, the reasons disclosed must relate only to those factors actually scored in the system. Moreover, no factor that was a principal reason for adverse action may be excluded from disclosure. The creditor must disclose the actual reasons for denial (for example, “age of automobile”) even if the relationship of that factor to predicting creditworthiness may not be clear to the applicant.</P>
              <P>5. <E T="03">Credit scoring—method for selecting reasons.</E> The regulation does not require that any one method be used for selecting reasons for a credit denial or other adverse action that is based on a credit scoring system. Various methods will meet the requirements of the regulation. One method is to identify the factors for which the applicant's score fell furthest below the average score for each of those factors achieved by applicants whose total score was at or slightly above the minimum passing score. Another method is to identify the factors for which the applicant's score fell furthest below the average score for each of those factors achieved by all applicants. These average scores could be calculated during the development or use of the system. Any other method that produces results substantially similar to either of these methods is also acceptable under the regulation.</P>
              <P>6. <E T="03">Judgmental system.</E> If a creditor uses a judgmental system, the reasons for the denial or other adverse action must relate to those factors in the applicant's record actually reviewed by the person making the decision.<PRTPAGE P="67"/>
              </P>
              <P>7. <E T="03">Combined credit scoring and judgmental system.</E> If a creditor denies an application based on a credit evaluation system that employs both credit scoring and judgmental components, the reasons for the denial must come from the component of the system that the applicant failed. For example, if a creditor initially credit scores an application and denies the credit request as a result of that scoring, the reasons disclosed to the applicant must relate to the factors scored in the system. If the application passes the credit scoring stage but the creditor then denies the credit request based on a judgmental assessment of the applicant's record, the reasons disclosed must relate to the factors reviewed judgmentally, even if the factors were also considered in the credit scoring component. If the application is not approved or denied as a result of the credit scoring, but falls into a gray band, and the creditor performs a judgmental assessment and denies the credit after that assessment, the reasons disclosed must come from both components of the system. The same result applies where a judgmental assessment is the first component of the combined system. As provided in comment 9(b)(2)-1, disclosure of more than a combined total of four reasons is not likely to be helpful to the applicant.</P>
              <P>8. <E T="03">Automatic denial.</E> Some credit decision methods contain features that call for automatic denial because of one or more negative factors in the applicant's record (such as the applicant's previous bad credit history with that creditor, the applicant's declaration of bankruptcy, or the fact that the applicant is a minor). When a creditor denies the credit request because of an automatic-denial factor, the creditor must disclose that specific factor.</P>
              <P>9. <E T="03">Combined ECOA-FCRA disclosures.</E> The ECOA requires disclosure of the principal reasons for denying or taking other adverse action on an application for an extension of credit. The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) requires a creditor to disclose when it has based its decision in whole or in part on information from a source other than the applicant or its own files. Disclosing that a consumer report was obtained and used in the denial of the application, as the FCRA requires, does not satisfy the ECOA requirement to disclose specific reasons. For example, if the applicant's credit history reveals delinquent credit obligations and the application is denied for that reason, to satisfy § 202.9(b)(2) the creditor must disclose that the application was denied because of the applicant's delinquent credit obligations. The FCRA also requires a creditor to disclose, as applicable, a credit score it used in taking adverse action along with related information, including up to four key factors that adversely affected the consumer's credit score (or up to five factors if the number of inquiries made with respect to that consumer report is a key factor). Disclosing the key factors that adversely affected the consumer's credit score does not satisfy the ECOA requirement to disclose specific reasons for denying or taking other adverse action on an application or extension of credit. Sample forms C-1 through C-5 of appendix C of the regulation provide for both the ECOA and FCRA disclosures. See also comment 9(a)(2)-1.</P>

              <P>1. <E T="03">Exception for preapprovals.</E> The requirement to provide a notice of incompleteness does not apply to preapprovals that constitute applications under § 202.2(f).</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 9(c)(2)</HD>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Reapplication.</E> If information requested by a creditor is submitted by an applicant after the expiration of the time period designated by the creditor, the creditor may require the applicant to make a new application.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 9(c)(3)</HD>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Oral inquiries for additional information.</E> If an applicant fails to provide the information in response to an oral request, a creditor must send a written notice to the applicant within the 30-day period specified in § 202.9(c)(1) and (2). If the applicant provides the information, the creditor must take action on the application and notify the applicant in accordance with § 202.9(a).</P>
              <P>9(g) <E T="03">Applications submitted through a third party.</E>
              </P>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Third parties.</E> The notification of adverse action may be given by one of the creditors to whom an application was submitted, or by a noncreditor third party. If one notification is provided on behalf of multiple creditors, the notice must contain the name and address of each creditor. The notice must either disclose the applicant's right to a statement of specific reasons within 30 days, or give the primary reasons each creditor relied upon in taking the adverse action—clearly indicating which reasons relate to which creditor.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Third party notice—enforcement agency.</E> If a single adverse action notice is being provided to an applicant on behalf of several creditors and they are under the jurisdiction of different federal enforcement agencies, the notice need not name each agency; disclosure of any one of them will suffice.</P>
              <P>3. <E T="03">Third-party notice—liability.</E> When a notice is to be provided through a third party, a creditor is not liable for an act or omission of the third party that constitutes a violation of the regulation if the creditor accurately and in a timely manner provided the third party with the information necessary <PRTPAGE P="68"/>for the notification and maintains reasonable procedures adapted to prevent such violations.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 202.10—Furnishing of Credit Information</HD>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Scope.</E> The requirements of § 202.10 for designating and reporting credit information apply only to consumer credit transactions. Moreover, they apply only to creditors that opt to furnish credit information to credit bureaus or to other creditors; there is no requirement that a creditor furnish credit information on its accounts.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Reporting on all accounts.</E> The requirements of § 202.10 apply only to accounts held or used by spouses. However, a creditor has the option to designate all joint accounts (or all accounts with an authorized user) to reflect the participation of both parties, whether or not the accounts are held by persons married to each other.</P>
              <P>3. <E T="03">Designating accounts.</E> In designating accounts and reporting credit information, a creditor need not distinguish between accounts on which the spouse is an authorized user and accounts on which the spouse is a contractually liable party.</P>
              <P>4. <E T="03">File and index systems.</E> The regulation does not require the creation or maintenance of separate files in the name of each participant on a joint or user account, or require any other particular system of recordkeeping or indexing. It requires only that a creditor be able to report information in the name of each spouse on accounts covered by § 202.10. Thus, if a creditor receives a credit inquiry about the wife, it should be able to locate her credit file without asking the husband's name.</P>
              <P>10(a) <E T="03">Designation of accounts.</E>
              </P>
              <P>1. <E T="03">New parties.</E> When new parties who are spouses undertake a legal obligation on an account, as in the case of a mortgage loan assumption, the creditor must change the designation on the account to reflect the new parties and must furnish subsequent credit information on the account in the new names.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Request to change designation of account.</E> A request to change the manner in which information concerning an account is furnished does not alter the legal liability of either spouse on the account and does not require a creditor to change the name in which the account is maintained.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 202.12—Record Retention</HD>
              <P>12(a) <E T="03">Retention of prohibited information.</E>
              </P>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Receipt of prohibited information.</E> Unless the creditor specifically requested such information, a creditor does not violate this section when it receives prohibited information from a consumer reporting agency.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Use of retained information.</E> Although a creditor may keep in its files prohibited information as provided in § 202.12(a), the creditor may use the information in evaluating credit applications only if permitted to do so by § 202.6.</P>
              <P>12(b) <E T="03">Preservation of records.</E>
              </P>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Copies.</E> Copies of the original record include carbon copies, photocopies, microfilm or microfiche copies, or copies produced by any other accurate retrieval system, such as documents stored and reproduced by computer. A creditor that uses a computerized or mechanized system need not keep a paper copy of a document (for example, of an adverse action notice) if it can regenerate all pertinent information in a timely manner for examination or other purposes.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Computerized decisions.</E> A creditor that enters information items from a written application into a computerized or mechanized system and makes the credit decision mechanically, based only on the items of information entered into the system, may comply with § 202.12(b) by retaining the information actually entered. It is not required to store the complete written application, nor is it <PRTPAGE P="69"/>required to enter the remaining items of information into the system. If the transaction is subject to § 202.13, however, the creditor is required to enter and retain the data on personal characteristics in order to comply with the requirements of that section.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 12(b)(3)</HD>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Withdrawn and brokered applications.</E> In most cases, the 25-month retention period for applications runs from the date a notification is sent to the applicant granting or denying the credit requested. In certain transactions, a creditor is not obligated to provide a notice of the action taken. (See, for example, comment 9-2.) In such cases, the 25-month requirement runs from the date of application, as when:</P>
              <P>i. An application is withdrawn by the applicant.</P>
              <P>ii. An application is submitted to more than one creditor on behalf of the applicant, and the application is approved by one of the other creditors.</P>
              <P>12(b)(6) <E T="03">Self-tests</E>
              </P>
              <P>1. The rule requires all written or recorded information about a self-test to be retained for 25 months after a self-test has been completed. For this purpose, a self-test is completed after the creditor has obtained the results and made a determination about what corrective action, if any, is appropriate. Creditors are required to retain information about the scope of the self-test, the methodology used and time period covered by the self-test, the report or results of the self-test including any analysis or conclusions, and any corrective action taken in response to the self-test.</P>
              <P>12(b)(7) <E T="03">Preapplication marketing information.</E>
              </P>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Prescreened credit solicitations.</E> The rule requires creditors to retain copies of prescreened credit solicitations. For purposes of this regulation, a prescreened solicitation is an “offer of credit” as described in 15 U.S.C. 1681a(1) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. A creditor complies with this rule if it retains a copy of each solicitation mailing that contains different terms, such as the amount of credit offered, annual percentage rate, or annual fee.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">List of criteria.</E> A creditor must retain the list of criteria used to select potential recipients. This includes the criteria used by the creditor both to determine the potential recipients of the particular solicitation and to determine who will actually be offered credit.</P>
              <P>3. <E T="03">Correspondence.</E> A creditor may retain correspondence relating to consumers' complaints about prescreened solicitations in any manner that is reasonably accessible and is understandable to examiners. There is no requirement to establish a separate database or set of files for such correspondence, or to match consumer complaints with specific solicitation programs.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 202.13—Information for Monitoring Purposes</HD>
              <P>13(a) <E T="03">Information to be requested.</E>
              </P>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Natural person.</E> Section 202.13 applies only to applications from natural persons.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Principal residence.</E> The requirements of § 202.13 apply only if an application relates to a dwelling that is or will be occupied by the applicant as the principal residence. A credit application related to a vacation home or a rental unit is not covered. In the case of a two- to four-unit dwelling, the application is covered if the applicant intends to occupy one of the units as a principal residence.</P>
              <P>3. <E T="03">Temporary financing.</E> An application for temporary financing to construct a dwelling is not subject to § 202.13. But an application for both a temporary loan to finance construction of a dwelling and a permanent mortgage loan to take effect upon the completion of construction is subject to § 202.13.</P>
              <P>4. <E T="03">New principal residence.</E> A person can have only one principal residence at a time. However, if a person buys or builds a new dwelling that will become that person's principal residence within a year or upon completion of construction, the new dwelling is considered the principal residence for purposes of § 202.13.</P>
              <P>5. <E T="03">Transactions not covered.</E> The information-collection requirements of this section apply to applications for credit primarily for the purchase or refinancing of a dwelling that is or will become the applicant's principal residence. Therefore, applications for credit secured by the applicant's principal residence but made primarily for a purpose other than the purchase or refinancing of the principal residence (such as loans for home improvement and debt consolidation) are not subject to the information-collection requirements. An application for an open-end home equity line of credit is not subject to this section unless it is readily apparent to the creditor when the application is taken that the primary purpose of the line is for the purchase or refinancing of a principal dwelling.</P>
              <P>6. <E T="03">Refinancings.</E> A refinancing occurs when an existing obligation is satisfied and replaced by a new obligation undertaken by the same borrower. A creditor that receives an application to refinance an existing extension of credit made by that creditor for the purchase of the applicant's dwelling may request the monitoring information again but is not required to do so if it was obtained in the earlier transaction.</P>
              <P>7. <E T="03">Data collection under Regulation C.</E> See comment 5(a)(2)-2.</P>
              <P>13(b) <E T="03">Obtaining of information.</E>
              </P>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Forms for collecting data.</E> A creditor may collect the information specified in § 202.13(a) <PRTPAGE P="70"/>either on an application form or on a separate form referring to the application. The applicant must be offered the option to select more than one racial designation.</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Written applications.</E> The regulation requires written applications for the types of credit covered by § 202.13. A creditor can satisfy this requirement by recording on paper or by means of computer the information that the applicant provides orally and that the creditor normally considers in a credit decision.</P>
              <P>3. <E T="03">Telephone, mail applications.</E>
              </P>
              <P>i. A creditor that accepts an application by telephone or mail must request the monitoring information.</P>
              <P>ii. A creditor that accepts an application by mail need not make a special request for the monitoring information if the applicant has failed to provide it on the application form returned to the creditor.</P>
              <P>iii. If it is not evident on the face of an application that it was received by mail, telephone, or via an electronic medium, the creditor should indicate on the form or other application record how the application was received.</P>
              <P>4. <E T="03">Video and other electronic-application processes.</E>
              </P>
              <P>i. If a creditor takes an application through an electronic medium that allows the creditor to see the applicant, the creditor must treat the application as taken in person. The creditor must note the monitoring information on the basis of visual observation or surname, if the applicant chooses not to provide the information.</P>
              <P>ii. If an applicant applies through an electronic medium without video capability, the creditor treats the application as if it were received by mail.</P>
              <P>5. <E T="03">Applications through loan-shopping services.</E> When a creditor receives an application through an unaffiliated loan-shopping service, it does not have to request the monitoring information for purposes of the ECOA or Regulation B. Creditors subject to the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act should be aware, however, that data collection may be called for under Regulation C (12 CFR part 203), which generally requires creditors to report, among other things, the sex and race of an applicant on brokered applications or applications received through a correspondent.</P>
              <P>6. <E T="03">Inadvertent notation.</E> If a creditor inadvertently obtains the monitoring information in a dwelling-related transaction not covered by § 202.13, the creditor may process and retain the application without violating the regulation.</P>
              <P>13(c) <E T="03">Disclosure to applicants.</E>
              </P>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Procedures for providing disclosures.</E> The disclosure to an applicant regarding the monitoring information may be provided in writing. Appendix B contains a sample disclosure. A creditor may devise its own disclosure so long as it is substantially similar. The creditor need not orally request the monitoring information if it is requested in writing.</P>
              <P>13(d) <E T="03">Substitute monitoring program.</E>
              </P>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Substitute program.</E> An enforcement agency may adopt, under its established rulemaking or enforcement procedures, a program requiring creditors under its jurisdiction to collect information in addition to information required by this section.</P>

              <P>14(a) <E T="03">Providing appraisals.</E>
              </P>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Coverage.</E> This section covers applications for credit to be secured by a lien on a dwelling, as that term is defined in § 202.14(c), whether the credit is for a business purpose (for example, a loan to start a business) or a consumer purpose (for example, a loan to finance a child's education).</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Renewals.</E> This section applies when an applicant requests the renewal of an existing extension of credit and the creditor obtains a new appraisal report. This section does not apply when a creditor uses the appraisal report previously obtained to evaluate the renewal request.</P>
              <P>14(a)(2)(i) <E T="03">Notice.</E>
              </P>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Multiple applicants.</E> When an application that is subject to this section involves more than one applicant, the notice about the appraisal report need only be given to one applicant, but it must be given to the primary applicant where one is readily apparent.</P>
              <P>14(a)(2)(ii) <E T="03">Delivery.</E>
              </P>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Reimbursement.</E> Creditors may charge for photocopy and postage costs incurred in providing a copy of the appraisal report, unless prohibited by state or other law. If the consumer has already paid for the report—for example, as part of an application fee—the creditor may not require additional fees for the appraisal (other than photocopy and postage costs).</P>
              <P>14(c) <E T="03">Definitions.</E>
              </P>
              <P>1. <E T="03">Appraisal reports.</E> Examples of appraisal reports are:</P>
              <P>i. A report prepared by an appraiser (whether or not licensed or certified), including written comments and other documents submitted to the creditor in support of the appraiser's estimate or opinion of the property's value.</P>
              <P>ii. A document prepared by the creditor's staff that assigns value to the property, if a third-party appraisal report has not been used.</P>
              <P>iii. An internal review document reflecting that the creditor's valuation is different from a valuation in a third party's appraisal report (or different from valuations that are publicly available or valuations such as manufacturers' invoices for mobile homes).</P>
              <P>2. <E T="03">Other reports.</E> The term “appraisal report” does not cover all documents relating <PRTPAGE P="71"/>to the value of the applicant's property. Examples of reports not covered are:</P>
              <P>i. Internal documents, if a third-party appraisal report was used to establish the value of the property.</P>
              <P>ii. Governmental agency statements of appraised value.</P>
              <P>iii. Valuations lists that are publicly available (such as published sales prices or mortgage amounts, tax assessments, and retail price ranges) and valuations such as manufacturers' invoices for mobile homes.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 202.15—Incentives for Self-Testing and Self-Correction</HD>
              <P>15(a) <E T="03">General rules.</E>
              </P>
              <P>15(a)(1) <E T="03">Voluntary self-testing and correction.</E>
              </P>
              <P>1. Activities required by any governmental authority are not voluntary self-tests. A governmental authority includes both administrative and judicial authorities for federal, state, and local governments.</P>
              <P>15(a)(2) <E T="03">Corrective action required.</E>
              </P>
              <P>1. To qualify for the privilege, appropriate corrective action is required when the results of a self-test show that it is more likely than not that there has been a violation of the ECOA or this regulation. A self-test is also privileged when it identifies no violations.</P>
              <P>2. In some cases, the issue of whether certain information is privileged may arise before the self-test is complete or corrective actions are fully under way. This would not necessarily prevent a creditor from asserting the privilege. In situations where the self-test is not complete, for the privilege to apply the lender must satisfy the regulation's requirements within a reasonable period of time. To assert the privilege where the self-test shows a likely violation, the rule requires, at a minimum, that the creditor establish a plan for corrective action and a method to demonstrate progress in implementing the plan. Creditors must take appropriate corrective action on a timely basis after the results of the self-test are known.</P>

              <P>3. A creditor's determination about the type of corrective action needed, or a finding that no corrective action is required, is not conclusive in determining whether the requirements of this paragraph have been satisfied. If a creditor's claim of privilege is challenged, an assessment of the need for corrective action or the type of corrective action that is appropriate must be based on a review of the self-testing results, which may require an <E T="03">in camera</E> inspection of the privileged documents.</P>
              <P>15(a)(3) Other privileges.</P>
              <P>1. A creditor may assert the privilege established under this section in addition to asserting any other privilege that may apply, such as the attorney-client privilege or the work-product privilege. Self-testing data may be privileged under this section whether or not the creditor's assertion of another privilege is upheld.</P>
              <P>15(b) <E T="03">Self-test defined.</E>
              </P>
              <P>15(b)(1) <E T="03">Definition.</E>
              </P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 15(b)(1)(i)</HD>
              <P>1. To qualify for the privilege, a self-test must be sufficient to constitute a determination of the extent or effectiveness of the creditor's compliance with the Act and Regulation B. Accordingly, a self-test is only privileged if it was designed and used for that purpose. A self-test that is designed or used to determine compliance with other laws or regulations or for other purposes is not privileged under this rule. For example, a self-test designed to evaluate employee efficiency or customers' satisfaction with the level of service provided by the creditor is not privileged even if evidence of discrimination is uncovered incidentally. If a self-test is designed for multiple purposes, only the portion designed to determine compliance with the ECOA is eligible for the privilege.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 15(b)(1)(ii)</HD>
              <P>1. The principal attribute of self-testing is that it constitutes a voluntary undertaking by the creditor to produce new data or factual information that otherwise would not be available and could not be derived from loan or application files or other records related to credit transactions. Self-testing includes, but is not limited to, the practice of using fictitious applicants for credit (testers), either with or without the use of matched pairs. A creditor may elect to test a defined segment of its business, for example, loan applications processed by a specific branch or loan officer, or applications made for a particular type of credit or loan program. A creditor also may use other methods of generating information that is not available in loan and application files, such as surveying mortgage loan applicants. To the extent permitted by law, creditors might also develop new methods that go beyond traditional pre-application testing, such as hiring testers to submit fictitious loan applications for processing.</P>
              <P>2. The privilege does not protect a creditor's analysis performed as part of processing or underwriting a credit application. A creditor's evaluation or analysis of its loan files, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data, or similar types of records (such as broker or loan officer compensation records) does not produce new information about a creditor's compliance and is not a self-test for purposes of this section. Similarly, a statistical analysis of data derived from existing loan files is not privileged.</P>
              <P>15(b)(3) <E T="03">Types of information not privileged.</E>
                <PRTPAGE P="72"/>
              </P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 15(b)(3)(i)</HD>
              <P>1. The information listed in this paragraph is not privileged and may be used to determine whether the prerequisites for the privilege have been satisfied. Accordingly, a creditor might be asked to identify the self-testing method, for example, whether preapplication testers were used or data were compiled by surveying loan applicants. Information about the scope of the self-test (such as the types of credit transactions examined, or the geographic area covered by the test) also is not privileged.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 15(b)(3)(ii)</HD>
              <P>1. Property appraisal reports, minutes of loan committee meetings or other documents reflecting the basis for a decision to approve or deny an application, loan policies or procedures, underwriting standards, and broker compensation records are examples of the types of records that are not privileged. If a creditor arranges for testers to submit loan applications for processing, the records are not related to actual credit transactions for purposes of this paragraph and may be privileged self-testing records.</P>
              <P>15(c) <E T="03">Appropriate corrective action.</E>
              </P>
              <P>1. The rule only addresses the corrective actions required for a creditor to take advantage of the privilege in this section. A creditor may be required to take other actions or provide additional relief if a formal finding of discrimination is made.</P>
              <P>15(c)(1) <E T="03">General requirement.</E>
              </P>
              <P>1. Appropriate corrective action is required even though no violation has been formally adjudicated or admitted by the creditor. In determining whether it is more likely than not that a violation occurred, a creditor must treat testers as if they are actual applicants for credit. A creditor may not refuse to take appropriate corrective action under this section because the self-test used fictitious loan applicants. The fact that a tester's agreement with the creditor waives the tester's legal right to assert a violation does not eliminate the requirement for the creditor to take corrective action, although no remedial relief for the tester is required under paragraph 15(c)(3).</P>
              <P>15(c)(2) <E T="03">Determining the scope of appropriate corrective action.</E>
              </P>
              <P>1. Whether a creditor has taken or is taking corrective action that is appropriate will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Generally, the scope of the corrective action that is needed to preserve the privilege is governed by the scope of the self-test. For example, a creditor that self-tests mortgage loans and discovers evidence of discrimination may focus its corrective actions on mortgage loans, and is not required to expand its testing to other types of loans.</P>
              <P>2. In identifying the policies or practices that are a likely cause of the violation, a creditor might identify inadequate or improper lending policies, failure to implement established policies, employee conduct, or other causes. The extent and scope of a likely violation may be assessed by determining which areas of operations are likely to be affected by those policies and practices, for example, by determining the types of loans and stages of the application process involved and the branches or offices where the violations may have occurred.</P>
              <P>3. Depending on the method and scope of the self-test and the results of the test, appropriate corrective action may include one or more of the following:</P>
              <P>i. If the self-test identifies individuals whose applications were inappropriately processed, offering to extend credit if the application was improperly denied and compensating such persons for out-of-pocket costs and other compensatory damages;</P>
              <P>ii. Correcting institutional policies or procedures that may have contributed to the likely violation, and adopting new policies as appropriate;</P>
              <P>iii. Identifying and then training and/or disciplining the employees involved;</P>
              <P>iv. Developing outreach programs, marketing strategies, or loan products to serve more effectively segments of the lender's markets that may have been affected by the likely discrimination; and</P>
              <P>v. Improving audit and oversight systems to avoid a recurrence of the likely violations.</P>
              <P>15(c)(3) <E T="03">Types of relief.</E>
              </P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 15(c)(3)(ii)</HD>
              <P>1. The use of pre-application testers to identify policies and practices that illegally discriminate does not require creditors to review existing loan files for the purpose of identifying and compensating applicants who might have been adversely affected.</P>
              <P>2. If a self-test identifies a specific applicant who was discriminated against on a prohibited basis, to qualify for the privilege in this section the creditor must provide appropriate remedial relief to that applicant; the creditor is not required to identify other applicants who might also have been adversely affected.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 15(c)(3)(iii)</HD>
              <P>1. A creditor is not required to provide remedial relief to an applicant that would not be available by law. An applicant might also be ineligible for certain types of relief due to changed circumstances. For example, a creditor is not required to offer credit to a denied applicant if the applicant no longer qualifies for the credit due to a change in financial circumstances, although some other type of relief might be appropriate.</P>
              <P>15(d)(1) <E T="03">Scope of privilege.</E>
                <PRTPAGE P="73"/>
              </P>
              <P>1. The privilege applies with respect to any examination, investigation or proceeding by federal, state, or local government agencies relating to compliance with the Act or this regulation. Accordingly, in a case brought under the ECOA, the privilege established under this section preempts any inconsistent laws or court rules to the extent they might require disclosure of privileged self-testing data. The privilege does not apply in other cases (such as in litigation filed solely under a state's fair lending statute). In such cases, if a court orders a creditor to disclose self-test results, the disclosure is not a voluntary disclosure or waiver of the privilege for purposes of paragraph 15(d)(2); a creditor may protect the information by seeking a protective order to limit availability and use of the self-testing data and prevent dissemination beyond what is necessary in that case. Paragraph 15(d)(1) precludes a party who has obtained privileged information from using it in a case brought under the ECOA, provided the creditor has not lost the privilege through voluntary disclosure under paragraph 15(d)(2).</P>

              </P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 15(d)(2)(i)</HD>
              <P>1. A creditor's corrective action, by itself, is not considered a voluntary disclosure of the self-test report or results. For example, a creditor does not disclose the results of a self-test merely by offering to extend credit to a denied applicant or by inviting the applicant to reapply for credit. Voluntary disclosure could occur under this paragraph, however, if the creditor disclosed the self-test results in connection with a new offer of credit.</P>
              <P>2. The disclosure of self-testing results to an independent contractor acting as an auditor or consultant for the creditor on compliance matters does not result in loss of the privilege.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 15(d)(2)(ii)</HD>
              <P>1. The privilege is lost if the creditor discloses privileged information, such as the results of the self-test. The privilege is not lost if the creditor merely reveals or refers to the existence of the self-test.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 15(d)(2)(iii)</HD>

              <P>1. A creditor's claim of privilege may be challenged in a court or administrative law proceeding with appropriate jurisdiction. In resolving the issue, the presiding officer may require the creditor to produce privileged information about the self-test.

              </FP>
              
              <P>1. A creditor may be required to produce privileged documents for the purpose of determining a penalty or remedy after a violation of the ECOA or Regulation B has been formally adjudicated or admitted. A creditor's compliance with such a requirement does not evidence the creditor's intent to forfeit the privilege.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>For purposes of this part, the following definitions apply unless otherwise specified:</P>
            <P>(a)(1) <E T="03">Deposit</E> means:</P>
            <P>(i) The unpaid balance of money or its equivalent received or held by a depository institution in the usual course of business and for which it has given or is obligated to give credit, either conditionally or unconditionally, to an account, including interest credited, or which is evidenced by an instrument on which the depository institution is primarily liable;</P>
            <P>(ii) Money received or held by a depository institution, or the credit given for money or its equivalent received or held by the depository institution in the usual course of business for a special or specific purpose, regardless of the legal relationships established thereby, including escrow funds, funds held as security for securities loaned by the depository institution, funds deposited as advance payment on subscriptions to United States government securities, and funds held to meet its acceptances;</P>
            <P>(iii) An outstanding teller's check, or an outstanding draft, certified check, cashier's check, money order, or officer's check drawn on the depository institution, issued in the usual course of business for any purpose, including payment for services, dividends or purchases;</P>
            <P>(iv) Any due bill or other liability or undertaking on the part of a depository institution to sell or deliver securities to, or purchase securities for the account of, any customer (including another depository institution), involving either the receipt of funds by the depository institution, regardless of the use of the proceeds, or a debit to an account of the customer before the securities are delivered. A deposit arises thereafter, if after three business days from the date of issuance of the obligation, the depository institution does not deliver the securities purchased or does not fully collateralize its obligation with securities similar to the securities purchased. A security is similar if it is of the same type and if it is of comparable maturity to that purchased by the customer;</P>

            <P>(v) Any liability of a depository institution's affiliate that is not a depository institution, on any promissory note, acknowledgment of advance, due bill, or similar obligation (written or oral), with a maturity of less than one and one-half years, to the extent that the proceeds are used to supply or to maintain the availability of funds (other than capital) to the depository institution, except any such obligation that, had it been issued directly by the depository institution, would not constitute a deposit. If an obligation of an affiliate of a depository institution is regarded as a deposit and is used to purchase assets from the depository institution, the maturity of the deposit <PRTPAGE P="76"/>is determined by the shorter of the maturity of the obligation issued or the remaining maturity of the assets purchased. If the proceeds from an affiliate's obligation are placed in the depository institution in the form of a reservable deposit, no reserves need be maintained against the obligation of the affiliate since reserves are required to be maintained against the deposit issued by the depository institution. However, the maturity of the deposit issued to the affiliate shall be the shorter of the maturity of the affiliate's obligation or the maturity of the deposit;</P>
            <P>(vi) Credit balances;</P>
            <P>(vii) Any liability of a depository institution on any promissory note, acknowledgment of advance, bankers' acceptance, or similar obligation (written or oral), including mortgage-backed bonds, that is issued or undertaken by a depository institution as a means of obtaining funds, except any such obligation that:</P>
            <P>(A) Is issued or undertaken and held for the account of:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) An office located in the United States of another depository institution, foreign bank, Edge or Agreement Corporation, or New York Investment (Article XII) Company;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The United States government or an agency thereof; or</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) The Export-Import Bank of the United States, Minbanc Capital Corporation, the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico, a Federal Reserve Bank, a Federal Home Loan Bank, or the National Credit Union Administration Central Liquidity Facility;</P>
            <P>(B) Arises from a transfer of direct obligations of, or obligations that are fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the United States Government or any agency thereof that the depository institution is obligated to repurchase;</P>
            <P>(C) Is not insured by a Federal agency, is subordinated to the claims of depositors, has a weighted average maturity of five years or more, and is issued by a depository institution with the approval of, or under the rules and regulations of, its primary Federal supervisor;</P>

            <P>(D) Arises from a borrowing by a depository institution from a dealer in securities, for one business day, of proceeds of a transfer of deposit credit in a Federal Reserve Bank or other immediately available funds (commonly referred to as <E T="03">Federal funds</E>), received by such dealer on the date of the loan in connection with clearance of securities transactions; or</P>
            <P>(E) Arises from the creation, discount and subsequent sale by a depository institution of its bankers' acceptance of the type described in paragraph 7 of section 13 of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 372).</P>
            <P>(viii) Any liability of a depository institution that arises from the creation after June 20, 1983, of a bankers' acceptance that is not of the type described in paragraph 7 of section 13 of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 372) except any such liability held for the account of an entity specified in § 204.2(a)(1)(vii)(A); or</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Deposit</E> does not include:</P>
            <P>(i) Trust funds received or held by the depository institution that it keeps properly segregated as trust funds and apart from its general assets or which it deposits in another institution to the credit of itself as trustee or other fiduciary. If trust funds are deposited with the commercial department of the depository institution or otherwise mingled with its general assets, a deposit liability of the institution is created;</P>
            <P>(ii) An obligation that represents a conditional, contingent or endorser's liability;</P>
            <P>(iii) Obligations, the proceeds of which are not used by the depository institution for purposes of making loans, investments, or maintaining liquid assets such as cash or “due from” depository institutions or other similar purposes. An obligation issued for the purpose of raising funds to purchase business premises, equipment, supplies, or similar assets is not a deposit;</P>
            <P>(iv) Accounts payable;</P>
            <P>(v) Hypothecated <E T="03">deposits</E> created by payments on an installment loan where (A) the amounts received are not used immediately to reduce the unpaid balance due on the loan until the sum of the payments equals the entire amount of loan principal and interest; (B) and <PRTPAGE P="77"/>where such amounts are irrevocably assigned to the depository institution and cannot be reached by the borrower or creditors of the borrower;</P>
            <P>(vi) Dealer reserve and differential accounts that arise from the financing of dealer installment accounts receivable, and which provide that the dealer may not have access to the funds in the account until the installment loans are repaid, as long as the depository institution is not actually (as distinguished from contingently) obligated to make credit or funds available to the dealer;</P>
            <P>(vii) A dividend declared by a depository institution for the period intervening between the date of the declaration of the dividend and the date on which it is paid;</P>
            <P>(viii) An obligation representing a <E T="03">pass through account,</E> as defined in this section;</P>
            <P>(ix) An obligation arising from the retention by the depository institution of no more than a 10 per cent interest in a pool of conventional 1-4 family mortgages that are sold to third parties;</P>
            <P>(x) An obligation issued to a State or municipal housing authority under a loan-to-lender program involving the issuance of tax exempt bonds and the subsequent lending of the proceeds to the depository institution for housing finance purposes;</P>
            <P>(xi) Shares of a credit union held by the National Credit Union Administration or the National Credit Union Administration Central Liquidity Facility under a statutorily authorized assistance program; and</P>
            <P>(xii) Any liability of a United States branch or agency of a foreign bank to another United States branch or agency of the same foreign bank, or the liability of the United States office of an Edge Corporation to another United States office of the same Edge Corporation.</P>

Demand deposits may be in the form of:</P>
            <P>(i) Checking accounts;</P>
            <P>(ii) Certified, cashier's, teller's, and officer's checks (including such checks issued in payment of dividends);</P>

            <P>(vi) Withheld taxes, withheld insurance and other withheld funds;</P>
            <P>(vii) Time deposits that have matured or time deposits upon which the contractually required notice of withdrawal as given and the notice period has expired and which have not been renewed (either by action of the depositor or automatically under the terms of the deposit agreement); and</P>
            <P>(viii) An obligation to pay, on demand or within six days, a check (or other instrument, device, or arrangement for the transfer of funds) drawn on the depository institution, where the account of the institution's customer already has been debited.</P>
            <P>(2) The term <E T="03">demand deposit</E> also means deposits or accounts on which the depository institution has reserved the right to require at least seven days' written notice prior to withdrawal or transfer of any funds in the account and from which the depositor is authorized to make withdrawals or transfers in excess of the withdrawal or transfer limitations specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section for such an account and the account is not a NOW account, or an ATS account or other account that meets the criteria specified in either paragraph (b)(3)(ii) or (iii) of this section.</P>

            <P>(B) From which the depositor is authorized to make transfers by preauthorized transfer or telephonic (including data transmission) agreement, order or instruction to another account or to a third party, provided that the depositor is eligible to hold a NOW account;</P>

A preauthorized transfer includes any arrangement by the depository institution to pay a third party from the account of a depositor upon written or oral instruction (including an order received through an automated clearing house (ACH)) or any arrangement by a depository institution to pay a third party from the account of the depositor at a predetermined time or on a fixed schedule. Such an account is not a transaction account by virtue of an arrangement that permits transfers for the purpose of repaying loans and associated expenses at the same depository institution (as originator or servicer) or that permits transfers of funds from this account to another account of the same depositor at the same institution or permits withdrawals (payments directly to the depositor) from the account when such transfers or withdrawals are made by mail, messenger, automated teller machine, or in person or when such withdrawals are made by <PRTPAGE P="80"/>telephone (via check mailed to the depositor) regardless of the number of such transfers or withdrawals.<SU>4</SU>

For customers who continue to violate those limits after they have been contacted by the depository institution, the depository institution must either close the account and place the funds in another account that the depositor is eligible to maintain or take away the transfer and draft capacities of the account. An account that authorizes withdrawals or transfers in excess of the permitted number is a transaction account regardless of whether the authorized number of transactions is actually made.

            <P>(iii) A transferable time deposit.

            <P>(a) Every depository institution, U.S. branch or agency of a foreign bank, and Edge or Agreement corporation shall file a report of deposits (or any other form or statement that may be required by the Board or by a Federal Reserve Bank) with the Federal Reserve Bank in the Federal Reserve District in which it is located, regardless of the manner in which it chooses to maintain required reserve balances.</P>
            <P>(b) A foreign bank's U.S. branches and agencies and an Edge or Agreement corporation's offices operating within the same State and the same Federal Reserve District shall prepare and file a report of deposits on an aggregated basis.</P>
            <P>(c) For purposes of this part, the obligations of a majority-owned (50 percent or more) U.S. subsidiary (except an Edge or Agreement corporation) of a depository institution shall be regarded as obligations of the parent depository institution.</P>
            <P>(d) A depository institution, a foreign bank, or an Edge or Agreement corporation shall, if possible, assign the low reserve tranche and reserve requirement exemption prescribed in § 204.4(f) to only one office or to a group of offices filing a single aggregated report of deposits. The amount of the reserve requirement exemption allocated to an office or group of offices may not exceed the amount of the low reserve tranche allocated to such office or offices. If the low reserve tranche or reserve requirement exemption cannot be fully utilized by a single office or by a group of offices filing a single report of deposits, the unused portion of the tranche or exemption may be assigned to other offices or groups of offices of the same institution until the amount of the tranche (or net transaction accounts) or exemption (or reservable liabilities) is exhausted. The tranche or exemption may be reallocated each year concurrent with implementation of the indexed tranche and exemption, or, if necessary during the course of the year to avoid underutilization of the tranche or exemption, at the beginning of a reserve computation period.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Computation of transaction accounts.</E> Overdrafts in demand deposit or other transaction accounts are not to be treated as negative demand deposits or negative transaction accounts and shall not be netted since overdrafts are properly reflected on an institution's books as assets. However, where a customer maintains multiple transaction accounts with a depository institution, overdrafts in one account pursuant to a <E T="03">bona fide</E> cash management arrangement are permitted to be netted against balances in other related transaction accounts for reserve requirement purposes.</P>
            <P>(f) The Board and the Federal Reserve Banks will not hold a pass-through correspondent responsible for guaranteeing the accuracy of the reports of deposits submitted by its respondents.</P>
            <P>(g)(1) For purposes of this section, a depository institution, a U.S. branch or agency of a foreign bank, or an Edge or Agreement corporation is located in the Federal Reserve District that contains the location specified in the institution's charter, organizing certificate, license, or articles of incorporation, or as specified by the institution's primary regulator, or if no such location is specified, the location of its head office, unless otherwise determined by the Board under paragraph (g)(2) of this section.</P>

            <P>(2) If the location specified in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, in the Board's judgment, is ambiguous, would impede the ability of the Board or the Federal Reserve Banks to perform their functions under the Federal Reserve Act, or would impede the ability of the institution to operate efficiently, the Board will determine the Federal Reserve District in which the institution is located, after consultation with the institution and the relevant Federal Reserve Banks. The relevant Federal Reserve Banks are the Federal Reserve Bank whose District <PRTPAGE P="87"/>contains the location specified in paragraph (g)(1) of this section and the Federal Reserve Bank in whose District the institution is proposed to be located. In making this determination, the Board will consider any applicable laws, the business needs of the institution, the location of the institution's head office, the locations where the institution performs its business, and the locations that would allow the institution, the Board, and the Federal Reserve Banks to perform their functions efficiently and effectively.</P>

            <P>(c) Balances “due from other depository institutions” do not include balances due from Federal Reserve Banks, pass-through accounts, or balances (payable in dollars or otherwise) due from banking offices located outside the United States. An institution exercising fiduciary powers may not include in balances “due from other depository institutions” amounts of trust funds deposited with other banks and due to it as a trustee or other fiduciary.</P>
            <P>(d) For institutions that file a report of deposits weekly, reserve requirements are computed on the basis of the institution's daily average balances of deposits and Eurocurrency liabilities during a 14-day computation period ending every second Monday.</P>
            <P>(e) For institutions that file a report of deposits quarterly, reserve requirements are computed on the basis of the institution's daily average balances of deposits and Eurocurrency liabilities during the 7-day computation period that begins on the third Tuesday of March, June, September, and December.</P>
            <P>(f) For all depository institutions, Edge and Agreement corporations, and United States branches and agencies of foreign banks, required reserves are computed by applying the reserve requirement ratios below to net transaction accounts, nonpersonal time deposits, and Eurocurrency liabilities of the institution during the computation period.</P>

            <P>(b)(1) For institutions that file a report of deposits weekly, the balances maintained to satisfy reserve balance requirements shall be maintained during a 14-day maintenance period that begins on the third Thursday following the end of a given computation period.</P>
            <P>(2) For institutions that file a report of deposits quarterly, the balances maintained to satisfy reserve balance requirements shall be maintained during an interval of either six or seven consecutive 14-day maintenance periods, depending on when the interval begins and ends. The interval will begin on the fourth Thursday following the end of each quarterly reporting period if that Thursday is the first day of a 14-day maintenance period. If the fourth Thursday following the end of a quarterly reporting period is not the first day of a 14-day maintenance period, then the interval will begin on the fifth Thursday following the end of the quarterly reporting period. The interval will end on the fourth Wednesday following the end of the subsequent quarterly reporting period if that Wednesday is the last day of a 14-day maintenance period.

If a depository institution draws against items before that time, the charge will be made to its account if the balance is sufficient to pay it; any resulting deficiency in balances maintained to satisfy the institution's reserve balance requirement will be subject to the penalties provided by law and to the deficiency charges provided by this part. However, the Federal Reserve Bank may, at its discretion, refuse to permit the withdrawal or other use of credit given in an account for any time for which the Federal Reserve Bank has not received payment in actually and finally collected funds.</P>

            <P>(d)(1) A depository institution, a U.S. branch or agency of a foreign bank, or an Edge or Agreement corporation with a reserve balance requirement (“respondent”) may select only one pass-through correspondent under this section, unless otherwise permitted by the Federal Reserve Bank in whose District the respondent is located. Eligible pass-through correspondents are Federal Home Loan Banks, the National Credit Union Administration Central Liquidity Facility, and depository institutions, U.S. branches or agencies of foreign banks, and Edge and Agreement corporations that maintain balances to satisfy their own reserve balance requirements which may be zero, in an account at a Federal Reserve Bank.

            <P>(ii) Each correspondent is required to maintain detailed records for each of its respondents that permit Reserve Banks to determine whether the respondent has provided a sufficient funds to the correspondent to satisfy the reserve balance requirement of the respondent. The correspondent shall maintain such records and make such reports as the Board or Reserve Bank may requires in order to ensure the correspondent's compliance with its responsibilities under this section and shall make them available to the Board or Reserve Bank as required.</P>
            <P>(iii) The Federal Reserve Bank may terminate any pass-through agreement under which the correspondent is deficient in its recordkeeping or other responsibilities.</P>

The reason or reasons in such cases are generally expected to include that such notice, public participation, or deferment of effective date would prevent the action from becoming effective as promptly as necessary in the public interest, would permit speculators or others to reap unfair profits or to interfere with the Board's actions taken with a view to accommodating commerce and business and with regard to their bearing upon the general credit situation of the country, would provoke other consequences contrary to the public interest, would not aid the persons affected, or would otherwise serve no useful purpose.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Bankers' banks.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) The Federal Reserve Act, as amended by the Monetary Control Act of 1980 (title I of Pub. L. 96-221), imposes Federal reserve requirements on depository institutions that maintain transaction accounts or nonpersonal time deposits. Under section 19(b)(9), however, a depository institution is not required to maintain reserves if it:</P>
              <P>(i) Is organized solely to do business with other financial institutions;</P>
              <P>(ii) Is owned primarily by the financial institutions with which it does business; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Does not do business with the general public.</P>

              <FP>Depository institutions that satisfy all of these requirements are regarded as <E T="03">bankers' banks.</E>
              </FP>
              <P>(2) In its application of these requirements to specific institutions, the Board will use the following standards:</P>
              <P>(i) A depository institution may be regarded as organized solely to do business with other depository institutions even if, as an incidental part to its activities, it does business to a limited extent with entities other than depository institutions. The extent to which the institution may do business with other entities and continue to be regarded as a bankers' bank is specified in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) A depository institution will be regarded as being owned primarily by the institutions with which it does business if 75 per cent or more of its capital is owned by other depository institutions. The 75 per cent or more ownership rule applies regardless of the type of depository institution.</P>

              <P>(iii) A depository institution will not be regarded as doing business with the general public if it meets two conditions. First, the range of customers <PRTPAGE P="95"/>with which the institution does business must be limited to depository institutions, including subsidiaries or organizations owned by depository institutions; directors, officers or employees of the same or other depository institutions; individuals whose accounts are acquired at the request of the institution's supervisory authority due to the actual or impending failure of another depository institution; share insurance funds; depository institution trade associations; and such others as the Board may determine on a case-by-case basis consistent with the purposes of the Act and the bankers' bank exemption. Second, the extent to which the depository institution makes loans to, or investments in, the above entities (other than depository institutions) cannot exceed 10 per cent of total assets, and the extent to which it receives deposits (or shares if the institution does not receive deposits) from or issues other liabilities to the above entities (other than depository institutions) cannot exceed 10 per cent of total liabilities (or net worth if the institution does not receive deposits).</P>
              <FP>If a depository institution is unable to meet all of these requirements on a continuing basis, it will not be regarded as a bankers' bank and will be required to satisfy Federal reserve requirements on all of its transaction accounts and nonpersonal time deposits.</FP>
              <P>(b) (1) Section 19(c)(1) of the Federal Reserve Act, as amended by the Monetary Control Act of 1980 (title I of Pub. L. 96-221) provides that Federal reserve requirements may be satisfied by the maintenance of vault cash or balances in a Federal Reserve Bank. Depository institutions that are not members of the Federal Reserve System may also satisfy reserve requirements by maintaining a balance in another depository institution that maintains required reserve balances at a Federal Reserve Bank, in a Federal Home Loan Bank, or in the National Credit Union Administration Central Liquidity Facility if the balances maintained by such institutions are subsequently passed through to the Federal Reserve Bank.</P>

              <P>(2) On August 27, 1980, the Board announced the procedures that will apply to such pass-through arrangements (45 FR 58099). Section 204.3(i)(1) provides that the Board may permit, on a case-by-case basis, depository institutions that are not themselves required to maintain reserves (<E T="03">bankers' banks</E>) to act as pass-through correspondents if certain criteria are satisfied. The Board has determined that a bankers' bank may act as a pass-through correspondent if it enters into an agreement with the Federal Reserve to accept responsibility for the maintenance of pass-through reserve accounts in accordance with Regulation D (12 CFR 204.3(i)) and if the Federal Reserve is satisfied that the quality of management and financial resources of the institution are adequate in order to enable the institution to serve as a pass-through correspondent in accordance with Regulation D. Satisfaction of these criteria will assure that pass-through arrangements are maintained properly without additional financial risk to the Federal Reserve.</P>

              <P>(3) In order to determine uniformly the adequacy of managerial and financial resources, the Board will consult with the Federal supervisor for the type of institution under consideration. Because the Board does not possess direct experience with supervising depository institutions other than commerical banks, and does not intend to involve itself in the direct supervision of such institutions, it will request the National Credit Union Administration to review requests from credit unions that qualify as bankers' banks and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to review requests from savings and loan associations that qualify as bankers' banks, regardless of charter or insurance status. (The Board, itself, will consider requests from all commercial banks that qualify as bankers' banks.) If the Federal supervisor does not find the institution's managerial or financial resources to be adequate, the Board will not permit the institution to act as a pass-through correspondent. In order to assure the continued adequacy of managerial and financial resources, it is anticipated that the appropriate Federal supervisor will, on a periodic basis, review and evaluate the managerial and financial resources of the institution in order to determine whether it should continue to be permitted to act as a pass-<PRTPAGE P="96"/>through correspondent. It is anticipated that, with respect to state chartered institutions, the Federal supervisor may discuss the request with the institute State supervisor. The Board believes that this procedure will promote uniformity of treatment for all types of bankers' banks, and provide consistent advice concerning managerial ability and financial strength from supervisory authorities that are in a better position to evaluate these criteria for depository institutions that are not commercial banks.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Secondary market activities of international banking facilities.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Questions have been raised concerning the extent to which international banking facilities may purchase (or sell) IBF-eligible assets such as loans (including loan participations), securities, CDs, and bankers' acceptances from (or to) third parties. Under the Board's regulations, as specified in § 204.8 of Regulation D, IBFs are limited, with respect to making loans and accepting deposits, to dealing only with certain customers, such as other IBFs and foreign offices of other organizations, and with the entity establishing the IBF. In addition, an IBF may extend credit to a nonbank customer only to finance the borrower's non-U.S. operations and may accept deposits from a nonbank customer that are used only to support the depositor's non-U.S. business.</P>
              <P>(b) Consistent with the Board's intent, IBFs may purchase IBF-eligible assets <SU>1</SU>
                <FTREF/> from, or sell such assets to, any domestic or foreign customer provided that the transactions are at arm's length without recourse. However, an IBF of a U.S. depository institution may not purchase assets from, or sell such assets to, any U.S. affiliate of the institution establishing the IBF; an IBF of an Edge or Agreement corporation may not purchase assets from, or sell assets to, any U.S. affiliate of the Edge or Agreement corporation or to U.S. branches of the Edge or Agreement corporation or to U.S. branches of the Edge or Agreement corporation other than the branch <SU>2</SU>
                <FTREF/> establishing the IBF; and an IBF of a U.S. branch or agency of a foreign bank may not purchase assets from, or sell assets to any U.S. affiliates of the foreign bank or to any other U.S. branch or agency of the same foreign bank. <SU>2</SU> (This would not prevent an IBF from purchasing (or selling) assets directly from (or to) any IBF, including an IBF of an affiliate, or to the institution establishing the IBF; such purchases from the institution establishing the IBF would continue to be subject to Eurocurrency reserve requirements except during the initial four-week transition period.) Since repurchase agreements are regarded as loans, transactions involving repurchase agreements are permitted only with customers who are otherwise eligible to deal with IBFs, as specified in Regulation D.</P>

              <P>(c) In the case of purchases of assets, in order to determine that the Board's use-of-proceeds requirement has been met, it is necessary for the IBF (1) to ascertain that the applicable IBF notices and acknowledgments have been provided, or (2) in the case of loans or securities, to review the documentation underlying the loan or security, or accompanying the security (e.g., the prospectus or offering statement), to <PRTPAGE P="97"/>determine that the proceeds are being used only to finance the obligor's operations outside the U.S., or (3) in the case of loans, to obtain a statement from either the seller or borrower that the proceeds are being used only to finance operations outside the U.S., or in the case of securities, to obtain such a statement from the obligor, or (4) in the case of bankers' acceptances, to review the underlying documentation to determine that the proceeds are being used only to finance the parties' operations outside the United States.</P>
              <P>(d) Under the Board's regulations, IBFs are not permitted to issue negotiable Euro-CDs, bankers' acceptances, or similar instruments. Accordingly, consistent with the Board's intent in this area, IBFs may sell such instruments issued by third parties that qualify as IBF-eligible assets provided that the IBF, its establishing institution and any affiliate of the institution establishing the IBF do not endorse, accept, or otherwise guarantee the instrument.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Sale of Federal funds by investment companies or trusts in which the entire beneficial interest is held exclusively by depository institutions.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) The Federal Reserve Act, as amended by the Monetary Control Act of 1980 (Title I of Pub. L. 96-221) imposes Federal Reserve requirements on transaction accounts and nonpersonnel time deposits held by depository institutions. The Board is empowered under the Act to determine what types of obligations shall be deemed a deposit. Regulation D—Reserve Requirements of Depository Institutions exempts from the definition of <E T="03">deposit</E> those obligations of a depository institution that are issued or undertaken and held for the account of a domestic office of another depository institution (12 CFR 204.2(a)(1)(vii)(A)(1)). These exemptions from the definition of <E T="03">deposit</E> are known collectively as the <E T="03">Federal funds</E> or <E T="03">interbank</E> exemption.</P>
              <P>(b) Title IV of the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980 authorizes Federal savings and loan associations to invest in open-ended management investment companies provided the funds' investment portfolios are limited to the types of investments that a Federal savings and loan association could hold without limit as to percentage of assets (12 U.S.C. 1464(c)(1)(Q)). Such investments include mortgages, U.S. Government and agency securities, securities of states and political subdivisions, sales of Federal funds and deposits held at banks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Federal Credit Union Act authorizes Federal credit unions to aggregate their funds in trusts provided the trust is limited to such investments that Federal credit unions could otherwise make. Such investments include loans to credit union members, obligations of the U.S. government or secured by the U.S. government, loans to other credit unions, shares or accounts held at savings and loan associations or mutual savings banks insured by FSLIC or FDIC, sales of Federal funds and shares of any central credit union whose investments are specifically authorized by the board of directors of the Federal credit union making the investment (12 U.S.C. 1757(7)).</P>
              <P>(c) The Board has considered whether an investment company or trust whose entire beneficial interest is held by depository institutions, as defined in Regulation D, would be eligible for the Federal funds exemption from Reserve requirements and interest rate limitations. The Board has determined that such investment companies or trusts are eligible to participate in the Federal funds market because, in effect, they act as mere conduits for the holders of their beneficial interest. To be regarded by the Board as acting as a conduit and, thus, be eligible for participation in the Federal funds market, an investment company or trust must meet each of the following conditions:</P>

              <P>(1) The entire beneficial interest in the investment company or trust must be held by depository institutions, as defined in Regulation D. These institutions presently may participate directly in the Federal funds market. If the entire beneficial interest in the investment company or trust is held only by depository institutions, the Board will regard the investment company or <PRTPAGE P="98"/>trust as a mere conduit for the holders of its beneficial interest.</P>

              <P>(2) The assets of the investment company or trust must be limited to investments that <E T="03">all</E> of the holders of the beneficial interest could make directly without limit.</P>
              <P>(3) Holders of the beneficial interest in the investment company or trust must not be allowed to make third party payments from their accounts with the investment company or trust. The Board does not regard an investment company or trust that offers third party payment capabilities or other similar services which actively transform the nature of the funds passing between the holders of the beneficial interest and the Federal funds market as mere conduits.</P>
              <FP>The Board expects that the above conditions will be included in materials filed by an investment company or trust with the appropriate regulatory agencies.</FP>
              
              <P>(d) The Board believes that permitting sales of Federal funds by investment companies or trusts whose beneficial interests are held exclusively by depository institutions, that invest solely in assets that the holders of their beneficial interests can otherwise invest in without limit, and do not provide third party payment capabilities offer the potential for an increased yield for thrifts. This is consistent with Congressional intent to provide thrifts with convenient liquidity vehicles.</P>

              <P>(a) The Federal Reserve Act, as amended by the Monetary Control Act of 1980 (title I of Pub. L. 96-221) imposes Federal reserve requirements on transaction accounts and nonpersonal time deposits held by depository institutions. The Board is empowered under the Act to determine what types of obligations shall be deemed a deposit (12 U.S.C. 461). Regulation D—Reserve Requirements of Depository Institutions exempts from the definition of <E T="03">deposit</E> those obligations of a depository institution that arise from a transfer of direct obligations of, or obligations that are fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the United States government or any agency thereof that the depository institution is obligated to repurchase (12 CFR 204.2(a)(1)(vii)(B)).</P>
              <P>(b) The National Bank Act provides that a national bank may purchase for its own account investment securities under limitations and restrictions as the Comptroller may prescribe (12 U.S.C. 24, ¶ 7). The statute defines investment securities to mean marketable obligations evidencing indebtedness of any person in the form of bonds, notes, and debentures. The Act further limits a national bank's holdings of any one security to no more than an amount equal to 10 percent of the bank's capital stock and surplus. However, these limitations do not apply to obligations issued by the United States, general obligations of any state and certain obligations of Federal agencies. In addition, generally a national bank is not permitted to purchase for its own account stock of any corporation. These restrictions also apply to state member banks (12 U.S.C. 335).</P>

              <P>(c) The Comptroller of the Currency has permitted national banks to purchase for their own accounts shares of open-end investment companies that are purchased and sold at par (i.e., money market mutual funds) provided the portfolios of such companies consist solely of securities that a national bank may purchase directly (Banking Bulletin B-83-58). The Board of Governors has permitted state member banks to purchase, to the extent permitted under applicable state law, shares of money market mutual funds (<E T="03">MMMF</E>) whose portfolios consist solely of securities that the state member bank may purchase directly (12 CFR 208.123).</P>
              <P>(d) The Board has determined that an obligation arising from a repurchase agreement involving shares of a MMMF whose portfolio consists wholly of securities of the United States government or any agency thereof <SU>1</SU>
                <FTREF/> would <PRTPAGE P="99"/>not be a <E T="03">deposit</E> for purposes of Regulations D and Q. The Board believes that a repurchase agreement involving shares of such a MMMF is the functional equivalent of a repurchase agreement directly involving United States government or agency obligations. A purchaser of shares of a MMMF obtains an interest in a <E T="03">pro rata</E> portion of the assets that comprise the MMMF's portfolio. Accordingly, regardless of whether the repurchase agreement involves United States government or agency obligations directly or shares in a MMMF whose portfolio consists entirely of United States government or agency obligations, an equitable and undivided interest in United States and agency government obligations is being transferred. Moreover, the Board believes that this interpretation will further the purpose of the exemption in Regulations D and Q for repurchase agreements involving United States government or Federal obligations by enhancing the market for such obligations.</P>

              <P>(a) Under § 204.2(a)(1)(vii)(A), there is an exemption from Regulation D for member bank obligations in nondeposit form to another bank. To assure the effectiveness of the limitations on persons who sell Federal funds to depository institutions, Regulation D applies to nondocumentary obligations undertaken by a depository institution to obtain funds for use in its banking business, as well as to documentary obligations. Under § 204.2(a)(1)(vii) of Regulation D, a depository institution's liability under informal arrangements as well as those formally embodied in a document are within the coverage of Regulation D.<PRTPAGE P="100"/>
              </P>

              <P>(b) The exemption in § 204.2(a)(1)(vii)(A) applies to obligations owed by a depository institution to a domestic office of any entity listed in that section (the <E T="03">exempt institutions</E>). The <E T="03">exempt institutions</E> explicitly include another depository institution, foreign bank, Edge or agreement corporation, New York Investment (article XII) Company, the Export-Import Bank of the United States, Minbanc Capital Corp., and certain other credit sources. The term <E T="03">exempt institutions</E> also includes subsidiaries of depository institutions:</P>
              <P>(1) That engage in businesses in which their parents are authorized to engage; or</P>
              <P>(2) The stock of which by statute is explicitly eligible for purchase by national banks.</P>

              <P>(c) To assure that this exemption for liabilities to exempt institutions is not used as a means by which nondepository institutions may arrange through an exempt institution to <E T="03">sell</E> Federal funds to a depository institution, obligations within the exemption must be issued to an exempt institution for its own account. In view of this requirement, a depository institution that <E T="03">purchases</E> Federal funds should ascertain the character (not necessarily the identity) of the actual <E T="03">seller</E> in order to justify classification of its liability on the transaction as <E T="03">Federal funds purchased</E> rather than as a deposit. Any exempt institution that has given general assurance to the purchasing depository institution that sales by it of Federal funds ordinarily will be for its own account and thereafter executes such transactions for the account of others, should disclose the nature of the actual lender with respect to each such transaction. If it fails to do so, the depository institution would be deemed by the Board as indirectly violating section 19 of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation D.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Nondepository participation in “Federal funds” market.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Board has considered whether the use of <E T="03">interdepository institution loan participations</E> (<E T="03">IDLPs</E>) which involve participation by third parties other than depository institutions in Federal funds transactions, comes within the exemption from <E T="03">deposit</E> classification for certain obligations owed by a depository institution to an institution exempt in § 204.2(a)(1)(vii)(A) of Regulation D. An IDLP transaction is one through which an institution that has sold Federal funds to a depository institution, subsequently <E T="03">sells</E> or participates out that obligation to a nondepository third party without notifying the obligated institution.</P>

              <P>(b) The Board's interpretation regarding Federal funds transactions (12 CFR 204.126) clarified that a depository institutions's liability must be issued to an exempt institution described in § 204.2(a)(1)(vii)(A) of Regulation D for its own account in order to come within the nondeposit exemption for interdepository liabilities. The Board regards transactions which result in third parties gaining access to the Federal funds market as contrary to the exemption contained in § 204.2(a)(1)(vii)(A) of Regulation D regardless of whether the nondepository institution third party is a party to the initial transaction or thereafter becomes a participant in the transaction through purchase of all or part of the obligation held by the <E T="03">selling</E> depository institution.</P>

              <P>(c) The Board regards the notice requirements set out in 12 CFR 204.126 as applicable to IDLP-type transactions as described herein so that a depository institution <E T="03">selling</E> Federal funds must provide to the purchaser—</P>
              <P>(1) Notice of its intention, at the time of the initial transaction, to sell or participate out its loan contract to a nondepository third party, and</P>
              <P>(2) Full and prompt notice whenever it (the <E T="03">selling</E> depository institution) subsequently sells or participates out its loan contract to a non-depository third party.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Deposits at foreign branches guaranteed by domestic office of a depository institution.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) In accepting deposits at branches abroad, some depository institutions may enter into agreements from time to time with depositors that in effect guarantee payment of such deposits in the United States if the foreign branch <PRTPAGE P="101"/>is precluded from making payment. The question has arisen whether such deposits are subject to Regulation D, and this interpretation is intended as clarification.</P>

              <P>(b) Section 19 of the Federal Reserve Act which establishes reserve requirements does not apply to deposits of a depository institution “payable only at an office thereof located outside of the States of the United States and the District of Columbia” (12 U.S.C. 371a; 12 CFR 204.1(c)(5)). The Board rule in 1918 that the requirements of section 19 as to reserves to be carried by member banks do not apply to foreign branches (1918 <E T="03">Fed. Res. Bull.</E> 1123). The Board has also defined the phrase <E T="03">Any deposit that is payable only at an office located outside the United States,</E> in § 204.2(t) of Regulation D, 12 CFR 204.2(t).</P>
              <P>(c) The Board believes that this exemption from reserve requirements should be limited to deposits in foreign branches as to which the depositor is entitled, under his agreement with the depository institution, to demand payment only outside the United States, regardless of special circumstances. The exemption is intended principally to enable foreign branches of U.S. depository institutions to compete on a more nearly equal basis with banks in foreign countries in accordance with the laws and regulations of those countries. A customer who makes a deposit that is payable solely at a foreign branch of the depository institution assumes whatever risk may exist that the foreign country in which a branch is located might impose restrictions on withdrawals. When payment of a deposit in a foreign branch is guaranteed by a promise of payment at an office in the United States if not paid at the foreign office, the depositor no longer assumes this risk but enjoys substantially the same rights as if the deposit had been made in a U.S. office of the depository institution. To assure the effectiveness of Regulation D and to prevent evasions thereof, the Board considers that such guaranteed foreign-branch deposits must be subject to that regulation.</P>
              <P>(d) Accordingly, a deposit in a foreign branch of a depository institution that is guaranteed by a domestic office is subject to the reserve requirements of Regulation D the same as if the deposit had been made in the domestic office. This interpretation is not designed in any respect to prevent the head office of a U.S. bank from repaying borrowings from, making advances to, or supplying capital funds to its foreign branches, subject to Eurocurrency liability reserve requirements.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Eligibility for NOW accounts.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Summary.</E> In response to many requests for rulings, the Board has determined to clarify the types of entities that may maintain NOW accounts at member banks.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Individuals.</E> (1) Any individual may maintain a NOW account regardless of the purposes that the funds will serve. Thus, deposits of an individual used in his or her business including a sole proprietor or an individual doing business under a trade name is eligible to maintain a NOW account in the individual's name or in the “DBA” name. However, other entities organized or operated to make a profit such as corporations, partnerships, associations, business trusts, or other organizations may not maintain NOW accounts.</P>
              <P>(2) Pension funds, escrow accounts, security deposits, and other funds held under various agency agreements may also be classified as NOW accounts if the entire beneficial interest is held by individuals or other entities eligible to maintain NOW accounts directly. The Board believes that these accounts are similar in nature to trust accounts and should be accorded identical treatment. Therefore, such funds may be regarded as eligible for classification as NOW accounts.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Nonprofit organizations.</E> (1) A nonprofit organization that is operated primarily for religious, philanthropic, charitable, educational, political or other similar purposes may maintain a NOW account. The Board regards the following kinds of organizations as eligible for NOW accounts under this standard if they are not operated for profit:</P>

              <P>(i) Organizations described in section 501(c)(3) through (13), and (19) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. (I.R.C. 1954) section 501(c)(3) through (13) and (19));<PRTPAGE P="102"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) Political organizations described in section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. (I.R.C. 1954) section 527); and</P>
              <P>(iii) Homeowners and condominium owners associations described in section 528 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. (I.R.C. 1954) section 528), including housing cooperative associations that perform similar functions.</P>
              <P>(2) All organizations that are operated for profit are not eligible to maintain NOW accounts at depository institutions.</P>
              <P>(3) The following types of organizations described in the cited provisions of the Internal Revenue Code are among those not eligible to maintain NOW accounts:</P>
              <P>(i) Credit unions and other mutual depository institutions described in section 501(c)(14) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. (I.R.C. 1954) section 501(c)(14));</P>
              <P>(ii) Mutual insurance companies described in section 501(c)(15) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. (I.R.C. 1954) section 501(c)(15));</P>
              <P>(iii) Crop financing organizations described in section 501(c)(16) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. (I.R.C. 1954) section 501(c)(16));</P>
              <P>(iv) Organizations created to function as part of a qualified group legal services plan described in section 501(c)(20) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. (I.R.C. 1954) section 501(c)(20)); or</P>
              <P>(v) Farmers' cooperatives described in section 521 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. (I.R.C. 1954) section 521).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Governmental units.</E> Governmental units are generally eligible to maintain NOW accounts at member banks. NOW accounts may consist of funds in which the entire beneficial interest is held by the United States, any State of the United States, county, municipality, or political subdivision thereof, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, any territory or possession of the United States, or any political subdivision thereof.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Funds held by a fiduciary.</E> Under current provisions, funds held in a fiduciary capacity (either by an individual fiduciary or by a corporate fiduciary such as a bank trust department or a trustee in bankruptcy), including those awaiting distribution or investment, may be held in the form of NOW accounts if all of the beneficiaries are otherwise eligible to maintain NOW accounts. The Board believes that such a classification should continue since fiduciaries are required to invest even temporarily idle balances to the greatest extent feasible in order to responsibly carry out their fiduciary duties. The availability of NOW accounts provides a convenient vehicle for providing a short-term return on temporarily idle trust funds of beneficiaries eligible to maintain accounts in their own names.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Grandfather provision.</E> In order to avoid unduly disrupting account relationships, a NOW account established at a member bank on or before August 31, 1981, that represents funds of a nonqualifying entity that previously qualified to maintain a NOW account may continue to be maintained in a NOW account.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Participation by a depository institution in the secondary market for its own time deposits.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Background.</E> In 1982, the Board issued an interpretation concerning the effect of a member bank's purchase of its own time deposits in the secondary market in order to ensure compliance with regulatory restrictions on the payment of interest on time deposits, with the prohibition against payment of interest on demand deposits, and with regulatory requirements designed to distinguish between time deposits and demand deposits for federal reserve requirement purposes (47 FR 37878, Aug. 27, 1982). The interpretation was designed to ensure that the regulatory early withdrawal penalties in Regulation Q used to achieve these three purposes were not evaded through the purchase by a member bank or its affiliate of a time deposit of the member bank prior to the maturity of the deposit.</P>

              <P>(b) Because the expiration of the Depository Institutions Deregulation Act (title II of Pub. L. 96-221) on April 1, 1986, removed the authority to set interest rate ceilings on deposits, one of the purposes for adopting the interpretation was eliminated. The removal of <PRTPAGE P="103"/>the authority to set interest rate ceilings on deposits required the Board to revise the early withdrawal penalties which were also used to distinguish between types of deposits for reserve requirement purposes. Effective April 1, 1986, the Board amended its Regulation D to incorporate early withdrawal penalties applicable to all depository institutions for this purpose (51 FR 9629, Mar. 20, 1986). Although the new early withdrawal penalties differ from the penalties used to enforce interest rate ceilings, secondary market purchases still effectively shorten the maturities of deposits and may be used to evade reserve requirements. This interpretation replaces the prior interpretation and states the application of the new early withdrawal penalties to purchases by depository institutions and their affiliates of the depository institution's time deposits. The interpretation applies only to situations in which the Board's regulatory penalties apply.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Secondary market purchases under the rule.</E> The Board has determined that a depository institution purchasing a time deposit it has issued should be regarded as having paid the time deposit prior to maturity. The effect of the transaction is that the depository institution has cancelled a liability as opposed to having acquired an asset for its portfolio. Thus, the depository institution is required to impose any early withdrawal penalty required by Regulation D on the party from whom it purchases the instrument by deducting the amount of the penalty from the purchase price. The Board recognizes, however, that secondary market sales of time deposits are often done without regard to the identity of the original owner of the deposit. Such sales typically involve a pool of time deposits with the price based on the aggregate face value and average rate of return on the deposits. A depository institution purchasing time deposits from persons other than the person to whom the deposit was originally issued should be aware of the parties named on each of the deposits it is purchasing but through failure to inspect the deposits prior to the purchase may not be aware at the time it purchases a pool of time deposits that it originally issued one or more of the deposits in the pool. In such cases, if a purchasing depository institution does not wish to assess an applicable early withdrawal penalty, the deposit may be sold immediately in the secondary market as an alternative to imposing the early withdrawal penalty.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Purchases by affiliates.</E> On a consolidated basis, if an affiliate (as defined in § 204.2(q) of Regulation D) of a depository institution purchases a CD issued by the depository institution, the purchase does not reduce their consolidated liabilities and could be accomplished primarily to assist the depository institution in avoiding the requirements of the Board's Regulation D. Because the effect of the early withdrawal penalty rule could be easily circumvented by purchases of time deposits by affiliates, such purchases are also regarded as an early withdrawals of the time deposit, and the purchase should be treated as if the depository institution made the purchase directly. Thus, the regulatory requirements for early withdrawal penalties apply to affiliates of a depository institution as well as to the institution itself.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Depository institution acting as broker.</E> The Board believes that it is permissible for a depository institution to facilitate the secondary market for its own time deposits by finding a purchaser for a time deposit that a customer is trying to sell. In such instances, the depository institution will not be paying out any of its own funds, and the depositor does not have a guarantee that the depository institution will actually be able to find a buyer.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Third-party market-makers.</E> A depository institution may also establish and advertise arrangements whereby an unaffiliated third party agrees in advance to purchase time deposits issued by the institution. The Board would not regard these transactions as inconsistent with the purposes that the early withdrawal penalty is intended to serve unless a depository institution pays a fee to the third party purchaser as compensation for making the purchases or to remove the risk from purchasing the deposits. In this regard, any interim financing provided to such <PRTPAGE P="104"/>a third party by a depository institution in connection with the institution's secondary market activity involving the institution's time deposits must be made substantially on the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the same time for comparable transactions with other similarly situated persons and may not involve more than the normal risk of repayment.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Reciprocal arrangements.</E> Finally, while a depository institution may enter into an arrangement with an unaffiliated third party wherein the third party agrees to stand ready to purchase time deposits held by the depository institution's customers, the Board will regard a reciprocal arrangement with another depository institution for purchase of each other's time deposits as a circumvention of the early withdrawal penalty rule and the purposes it is designed to serve.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Treatment of loan strip participations.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Effective March 31, 1988, the glossary section of the instructions for the Report of Condition and Income (FFIEC 031-034; OMB control number 7100-0036; available from a depository institution's primary federal regulator) (<E T="03">Call Report</E>) was amended to clarify that certain short-term loan participation arrangements (sometimes known or styled as <E T="03">loan strips</E> or <E T="03">strip participations</E>) are regarded as borrowings rather than sales for Call Report purposes in certain circumstances. Through this interpretation, the Board is clarifying that such transactions should be treated as deposits for purposes of Regulation D.</P>
              <P>(b) These transactions involve the sale (or placement) of a short-term loan by a depository institution that has been made under a long-term commitment of the depository institution to advance funds. For example, a 90-day loan made under a five-year revolving line of credit may be sold to or placed with a third party by the depository institution originating the loan. The depository institution originating the loan is obligated to renew the 90-day note itself (by advancing funds to its customer at the end of the 90-day period) in the event the original participant does not wish to renew the credit. Since, under these arrangements, the depository institution is obligated to make another loan at the end of 90 days (absent any event of default on the part of the borrower), the depository institution selling the loan or participation in effect must buy back the loan or participation at the maturity of the 90-day loan sold to or funded by the purchaser at the option of the purchaser. Accordingly, these transactions bear the essential characteristics of a repurchase agreement and, therefore, are reportable and reservable under Regulation D.</P>

              <P>(c) Because many of these transactions give rise to deposit liabilities in the form of promissory notes, acknowledgments of advance or similar obligations (written or oral) as described in § 204.2(a)(1)(vii) of Regulation D, the exemptions from the definition of <E T="03">deposit</E> incorporated in that section may apply to the liability incurred by a depository institution when it offers or originates a loan strip facility. Thus, for example, loan strips sold to domestic offices of other depository institutions are exempt from Regulation D under § 204.2(a)(1)(vii)(A)(<E T="03">1</E>) because they are obligations issued or undertaken and held for the account of a U.S. office of another depository institution. Similarly, some of these transactions result in Eurocurrency liabilities and are reportable and reservable as such.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Multiple savings deposits treated as a transaction account.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Authority.</E> Under section 19(a) of the Federal Reserve Act, the Board is authorized to define the terms used in section 19, and to prescribe regulations to implement and prevent evasions of the requirements of that section. Section 19(b) establishes general reserve requirements on transaction accounts and nonpersonal time deposits. Under section 19(b)(1)(F), the Board also is authorized to determine, by regulation or order, that an account or deposit is a transaction account if such account is <PRTPAGE P="105"/>used directly or indirectly for the purpose of making payments to third persons or others. This interpretation is adopted under these authorities.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Background.</E> Under Regulation D, 12 CFR 204.2(d)(2), the term “savings deposit” includes a deposit or an account that meets the requirements of § 204.2(d)(1) and from which, under the terms of the deposit contract or by practice of the depository institution, the depositor is permitted or authorized to make up to six transfers or withdrawals per month or statement cycle of at least four weeks. The depository institution may authorize up to three of these six transfers to be made by check, draft, debit card, or similar order drawn by the depositor and payable to third parties. If more than six transfers (or more than three third party transfers by check, etc.) are permitted or authorized per month or statement cycle, the depository institution may not classify the account as a savings deposit. If the depositor, during the period, makes more than six transfers or withdrawals (or more than three third party transfers by check, etc.), the depository institution may, depending upon the facts and circumstances, be required by Regulation D (Footnote 5 at § 204.2(d)(2)) to reclassify or close the account.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Use of multiple savings deposits.</E> Depository institutions have asked for guidance as to when a depositor may maintain more than one savings deposit and be permitted to make all the transfers or withdrawals authorized for savings deposits under Regulation D from each savings deposit. The Board has determined that, if a depository institution suggests or otherwise promotes the establishment of or operation of multiple savings accounts with transfer capabilities in order to permit transfers and withdrawals in excess of those permitted by Regulation D for an individual savings account, the accounts generally should be considered to be transaction accounts. This determination applies regardless of whether the deposits have entirely separate account numbers or are subsidiary accounts of a master deposit account. Multiple savings accounts, however, should not be considered to be transaction accounts if there is a legitimate purpose, other than increasing the number of transfers or withdrawals, for opening more than one savings deposit.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Examples.</E> The distinction between appropriate and inappropriate uses of multiple accounts is illustrated by the following examples:
              </P>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1.</HD>
                <P>(i) X wishes to open an account that maximizes his interest earnings but also permits X to draw up to ten checks a month against the account. X's Bank suggests an arrangement under which X establishes four savings deposits at Bank. Under the arrangement, X deposits funds in the first account and then draws three checks against that account. X then instructs Bank to transfer all funds in excess of the amount of the three checks to the second account and draws an additional three checks. Funds are continually shifted between accounts when additional checks are drawn so that no more than three checks are drawn against each account each month.</P>
                <P>(ii) Suggesting the use of four savings accounts in the name of X in this example is designed solely to permit the customer to exceed the transfer limitations on savings accounts. Accordingly, the savings accounts should be classified as transaction accounts.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2.</HD>
                <P>(i) X is trustee of separate trusts for each of his four children. X's Bank suggests that X, as trustee, open a savings deposit in a depository institution for each of his four children in order to ensure an independent accounting of the funds held by each trust.</P>
                <P>(ii) X's Bank's suggestion to use four savings deposits in the name of X in this example is appropriate, and the third party transfers from one account should not be considered in determining whether the transfer and withdrawal limit was exceeded on any other account. X established a legitimate purpose, the segregation of the trust assets, for each account separate from the need to make third party transfers. Furthermore, there is no indication, such as by the direct or indirect transfer of funds from one account to another, that the accounts are being used for any purpose other than to make transfers to the appropriate trust.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 3.</HD>
                <P>(i) X opens four savings accounts with Bank. X regularly draws up to three checks against each account and transfers funds between the accounts in order to ensure that the checks on the separate accounts are covered. X's Bank did not suggest or otherwise promote the arrangement.</P>

                <P>(ii) X's Bank may treat the multiple accounts as savings deposits for Regulation D purposes, even if it discovers that X is using the accounts to increase the transfer limits applicable to savings accounts because X's Bank did not suggest or otherwise promote <PRTPAGE P="106"/>the establishment of or operation of the arrangement.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Linked time deposits and transaction accounts.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Authority.</E> Under section 19(a) of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 461(a)), the Board is authorized to define the terms used in section 19, and to prescribe regulations to implement and prevent evasions of the requirements of that section. Section 19(b)(2) establishes general reserve requirements on transaction accounts and nonpersonal time deposits. Under section 19(b)(1)(F), the Board also is authorized to determine, by regulation or order, that an account or deposit is a transaction account if such account is used directly or indirectly for the purpose of making payments to third persons or others. This interpretation is adopted under these authorities.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Linked time deposits and transaction accounts.</E> Some depository institutions are offering or proposing to offer account arrangements under which a group of participating depositors maintain transaction accounts and time deposits with a depository institution in an arrangement under which each depositor may draw checks up to the aggregate amount held by that depositor in these accounts. Under this account arrangement, at the end of the day funds over a specified balance in each depositor's transaction account are swept from the transaction account into a commingled time deposit. A separate time deposit is opened on each business day with the balance of deposits received that day, as well as the proceeds of any time deposit that has matured that day that are not used to pay checks or withdrawals from the transaction accounts. The time deposits, which generally have maturities of seven days, are staggered so that one or more time deposits mature each business day. Funds are apportioned among the various time deposits in a manner calculated to minimize the possibility that the funds available on any given day would be insufficient to pay all items presented.</P>
              <P>(1) The time deposits involved in such an arrangement may be held directly by the depositor or indirectly through a trust or other arrangement. The individual depositor's interest in time deposits may be identifiable, with an agreement by the depositors that balances held in the arrangement may be used to pay checks drawn by other depositors participating in the arrangement, or the depositor may have an undivided interest in a series of time deposits.</P>
              <P>(2) Each day funds from the maturing time deposits are available to pay checks or other charges to the depositor's transaction account. The depository institution's decision concerning whether to pay checks drawn on an individual depositor's transaction account is based on the aggregate amount of funds that the depositor has invested in the arrangement, including any amount that may be invested in unmatured time deposits. Only if checks drawn by all participants in the arrangement exceed the total balance of funds available that day (i.e. funds from the time deposit that has matured that day as well as any deposits made to participating accounts during the day) is a time deposit withdrawn prior to maturity so as to incur an early withdrawal penalty. The arrangement may be marketed as providing the customer unlimited access to its funds with a high rate of interest.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Determination.</E> In these arrangements, the aggregate deposit balances of all participants generally vary by a comparatively small amount, allowing the time deposits maturing on any day safely to cover any charges to the depositors' transaction accounts and avoiding any early withdrawal penalties. Thus, this arrangement substitutes time deposit balances for transaction accounts balances with no practical restrictions on the depositors' access to their funds, and serves no business purpose other than to allow the payment of higher interest through the avoidance of reserve requirements. As the time deposits may be used to provide funds indirectly for the purposes of making payments or transfers to third persons, the Board has determined that the time deposits should be considered to be transaction <PRTPAGE P="107"/>accounts for the purposes of Regulation D.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Shifting funds between depository institutions to make use of the low reserve tranche.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Authority.</E> Under section 19(a) of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 461(a)) the Board is authorized to define terms used in section 19, and to prescribe regulations to implement and to prevent evasions of the requirements of that section. Section 19(b)(2) establishes general reserve requirements on transaction accounts and nonpersonal time deposits. In addition to its authority to define terms under section 19(a), section 19(g) of the Federal Reserve Act also give the Board the specific authority to define terms relating to deductions allowed in reserve computation, including “balances due from other banks.” This interpretation is adopted under these authorities.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Background.</E> (1) Currently, the Board requires reserves of zero, three, or ten percent on transaction accounts, depending upon the amount of transaction deposits in the depository institution, and of zero percent on nonpersonal time deposits. In determining its reserve balance under Regulation D, a depository institution may deduct the balances it maintains in another depository institution located in the United States if those balances are subject to immediate withdrawal by the depositing depository institution (§ 204.3(f)). This deduction is commonly known as the “due from” deduction. In addition, Regulation D at § 204.2(a)(1)(vii)(A) exempts from the definition of “deposit” any liability of a depository institution on a promissory note or similar obligation that is issued or undertaken and held for the account of an office located in the United States of another depository institution. Transactions falling within this exemption from the definition of “deposit” include federal funds or “fed funds” transactions.</P>
              <P>(2) Under section 19(b)(2) of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 461(b)(2)), the Board is required to impose reserves of three percent on total transaction deposits at or below an amount determined under a formula. Transaction deposits falling within this amount are in the “low reserve tranche.” Currently the low reserve tranche runs up to $42.2 million. Under section 19(b)(11) of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 461(b)(11)) the Board is also required to impose reserves of zero percent on reservable liabilities at or below an amount determined under a formula. Currently that amount is $3.6 million.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Shifting funds between depository institutions.</E> The Board is aware that certain depository institutions with transaction account balances in an amount greater than the low reserve tranche have entered into transactions with affiliated depository institutions that have transaction account balances below the maximum low reserve tranche amount. These transactions are intended to lower the transaction reserves of the larger depository institution and leave the economic position of the smaller depository institutions unaffected, and have no apparent purpose other than to reduce required reserves of the larger institution. The larger depository institution places funds in a demand deposit at a small domestic depository institution. The larger depository institution considers those funds to be subject to the “due from” deduction, and accordingly reduces its transaction reserves in the amount of the demand deposit. The larger depository institution then reduces its transaction account reserves by 10 percent of the deposited amount. The small depository institution, because it is within the low reserve tranche, must maintain transaction account reserves of 3 percent on the funds deposited by the larger depository institution. The small depository institution then transfers all but 3 percent of the funds deposited by the larger depository institution back to the larger depository institution in a transaction that qualifies as a “fed funds” transaction. The 3 percent not transferred to the larger depository institution is the amount of the larger depository institution's deposit that the small depository institution must maintain as transaction account reserves. Because the larger depository institution books this second part of the transaction as a “fed funds” transaction, the larger depository institution does not maintain <PRTPAGE P="108"/>reserves on the funds that it receives back from the small depository institution. As a consequence, the larger depository institution has available for its use 97 percent of the amount transferred to the small depository institution. Had the larger depository institution not entered into the transaction, it would have maintained transaction account reserves of 10 percent on that amount, and would have had only 90 percent of that amount for use in its business.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Determination.</E> The Board believes that the practice described above generally is a device to evade the reserves imposed by Regulation D. Consequently, the Board has determined that, in the circumstances described above, the larger depository institution depositing funds in the smaller institution may not take a “due from” deduction on account of the funds in the demand deposit account if, and to the extent that, funds flow back to the larger depository institution from the small depository institution by means of a transaction that is exempt from transaction account reserve requirements.</P>

Under section 19(b)(1)(F), the Board also is authorized to determine, by regulation or order, that an account or deposit is a transaction account if such account is used directly or indirectly for the purpose of making payments to third persons or others. This interpretation is adopted under these authorities.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Netting of trust account balances.</E> (1) Not all depository institutions have treated overdrafts in trust accounts administered by a trust department in the same manner when calculating the balance in a commingled transaction account in the depository institution for the account of the trust department of the institution. In some cases, depository institutions carry the aggregate of the positive balances in the individual trust accounts as the balance on which reserves are computed for the commingled account. In other cases depository institutions net positive balances in some trust accounts against negative balances in other trust accounts, thus reducing the balance in the commingled account and lowering the reserve requirements. Except in limited circumstances, negative balances in individual trust accounts should not be netted against positive balances in other trust accounts when determining the balance in a trust department's commingled transaction account maintained in a depository institution's commercial department. The netting of positive and negative balances has the effect of reducing the aggregate of a commingled transaction account reported by the depository institution to the Federal Reserve and reduces the reserves the institution must hold against transaction accounts under Regulation D. Unless the governing trust agreement or state law authorizes the depository institution, as trustee, to lend money in one trust to another trust, the negative balances in effect, for purposes of Regulation D, represent a loan from the depository institution. Consequently, negative balances in individual trust accounts should not be netted against positive balances in other individual trust accounts, and the balance in any transaction account containing commingled trust balances should reflect positive or zero balances for each individual trust.</P>

              <P>(2) For example, where a trust department engages in securities lending activities for trust accounts, overdrafts might occur because of the trust department's attempt to “normalize” the effects of timing delays between the depository institution's receipt of the cash collateral from the broker and the trust department's posting of the transaction to the lending trust account. When securities are lent from a trust customer to a broker that pledges cash as collateral, the broker usually transfers the cash collateral to the depository institution on the day that <PRTPAGE P="109"/>the securities are made available. While the institution has the use of the funds from the time of the transfer, the trust department's normal posting procedures may not reflect receipt of the cash collateral by the individual account until the next day. On the day that the loan is terminated, the broker returns the securities to the lending trust account and the trust customer's account is debited for the amount of the cash collateral that is returned by the depository institution to the broker. The trust department, however, often does not liquidate the investment made with the cash collateral until the day after the loan terminates, a delay that normally causes a one day overdraft in the trust account. Regulation D requires that, on the day the loan is terminated, the depository institution regard the negative balance in the customer's account as zero for reserve requirement reporting purposes and not net the overdraft against positive balances in other accounts.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Procedures.</E> In order to meet the requirements of Regulation D, a depository institution must have procedures to determine the aggregate of trust department transaction account balances for Regulation D on a daily basis. The procedures must consider only the positive balances in individual trust accounts without netting negative balances except in those limited circumstances where loans are legally permitted from one trust to another, or where offsetting is permitted pursuant to trust law or written agreement, or where the amount that caused the overdraft is still available in a settlement, suspense or other trust account within the trust department and may be used to offset the overdraft.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Coverage.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> This part applies to any electronic fund transfer that authorizes a financial institution to debit or credit a consumer's account. Generally, this part applies to financial institutions. For purposes of §§ 205.3(b)(2) and (b)(3), 205.10(b), (d), and (e), 205.13, and 205.20, this part applies to any person.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Electronic fund transfer</E>—(1) <E T="03">Definition.</E> The term electronic fund transfer means any transfer of funds that is initiated through an electronic terminal, telephone, computer, or magnetic tape for the purpose of ordering, instructing, or authorizing a financial institution to debit or credit a consumer's account. The term includes, but is not limited to—</P>
            <P>(i) Point-of-sale transfers;</P>
            <P>(ii) Automated teller machine transfers;</P>
            <P>(iii) Direct deposits or withdrawals of funds;</P>
            <P>(iv) Transfers initiated by telephone; and</P>
            <P>(v) Transfers resulting from debit card transactions, whether or not initiated through an electronic terminal.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Electronic fund transfer using information from a check.</E> (i) This part applies where a check, draft, or similar paper instrument is used as a source of information to initiate a one-time electronic fund transfer from a consumer's account. The consumer must authorize the transfer.</P>
            <P>(ii) The person initiating an electronic fund transfer using the consumer's check as a source of information for the transfer must provide a notice that the transaction will or may be processed as an EFT, and obtain a consumer's authorization for each transfer. A consumer authorizes a one-time electronic fund transfer (in providing a check to a merchant or other payee for the MICR encoding, that is, the routing number of the financial institution, the consumer's account number and the serial number) when the consumer receives notice and goes forward with the underlying transaction. For point-of-sale transfers, the notice must be posted in a prominent and conspicuous location, and a copy thereof, or a substantially similar notice, must be provided to the consumer at the time of the transaction.</P>
            <P>(iii) The person that initiates an electronic fund transfer using the consumer's check as a source of information for the transfer shall also provide a notice to the consumer at the same time it provides the notice required under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) that when a check is used to initiate an electronic fund transfer, funds may be debited from the consumer's account as soon as the same day payment is received, and, as applicable, that the consumer's check will not be returned by the financial institution holding the consumer's account. For point-of-sale transfers, the person initiating the transfer may post the notice required in this paragraph (b)(2)(iii) in a prominent and conspicuous location and need not include this notice on the copy of the notice given to the consumer under paragraph (b)(2)(ii). The requirements in this paragraph (b)(2)(iii) shall remain in effect until December 31, 2009.</P>
            <P>(iv) A person may provide notices that are substantially similar to those set forth in appendix A-6 to comply with the requirements of this paragraph (b)(2).</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Collection of returned item fees via electronic fund transfer</E>—(i) <E T="03">General.</E> The person initiating an electronic fund transfer to collect a fee for the return of an electronic fund transfer or a check that is unpaid, including due to insufficient or uncollected funds in the consumer's account, must obtain the consumer's authorization for each transfer. A consumer authorizes a one-time electronic fund transfer from his or her account to pay the fee for the returned item or transfer if the person collecting the fee provides notice to the consumer stating that the person may electronically collect the fee, and the consumer goes forward with the underlying transaction. The notice must state that the fee will be collected by means of an electronic fund transfer from the consumer's account if the payment is returned unpaid and must disclose the dollar amount of the fee. If the fee may vary due to the amount of the transaction or due to other factors, then, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, the person collecting the fee <PRTPAGE P="112"/>may disclose, in place of the dollar amount of the fee, an explanation of how the fee will be determined.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Point-of-sale transactions.</E> If a fee for an electronic fund transfer or check returned unpaid may be collected electronically in connection with a point-of-sale transaction, the person initiating an electronic fund transfer to collect the fee must post the notice described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section in a prominent and conspicuous location. The person also must either provide the consumer with a copy of the posted notice (or a substantially similar notice) at the time of the transaction, or mail the copy (or a substantially similar notice) to the consumer's address as soon as reasonably practicable after the person initiates the electronic fund transfer to collect the fee. If the amount of the fee may vary due to the amount of the transaction or due to other factors, the posted notice may explain how the fee will be determined, but the notice provided to the consumer must state the dollar amount of the fee if the amount can be calculated at the time the notice is provided or mailed to the consumer.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Delayed compliance date for fee disclosure.</E> Through December 31, 2007, the notice required to be provided to consumers under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section in connection with a point-of-sale transaction, whether given to the consumer at the time of the transaction or subsequently mailed to the consumer, need not include either the dollar amount of any fee collected electronically for a check or electronic fund transfer returned unpaid or an explanation of how the amount of the fee will be determined.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Exclusions from coverage.</E> The term electronic fund transfer does not include:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Checks.</E> Any transfer of funds originated by check, draft, or similar paper instrument; or any payment made by check, draft, or similar paper instrument at an electronic terminal.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Check guarantee or authorization.</E> Any transfer of funds that guarantees payment or authorizes acceptance of a check, draft, or similar paper instrument but that does not directly result in a debit or credit to a consumer's account.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Wire or other similar transfers.</E> Any transfer of funds through Fedwire or through a similar wire transfer system that is used primarily for transfers between financial institutions or between businesses.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Securities and commodities transfers.</E> Any transfer of funds the primary purpose of which is the purchase or sale of a security or commodity, if the security or commodity is:</P>
            <P>(i) Regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission;</P>
            <P>(ii) Purchased or sold through a broker-dealer regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission or through a futures commission merchant regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission; or</P>
            <P>(iii) Held in book-entry form by a Federal Reserve Bank or federal agency.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Automatic transfers by account-holding institution.</E> Any transfer of funds under an agreement between a consumer and a financial institution which provides that the institution will initiate individual transfers without a specific request from the consumer:</P>
            <P>(i) Between a consumer's accounts within the financial institution;</P>
            <P>(ii) From a consumer's account to an account of a member of the consumer's family held in the same financial institution; or</P>
            <P>(iii) Between a consumer's account and an account of the financial institution, except that these transfers remain subject to § 205.10(e) regarding compulsory use and sections 915 and 916 of the act regarding civil and criminal liability.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Telephone-initiated transfers.</E> Any transfer of funds that:</P>
            <P>(i) Is initiated by a telephone communication between a consumer and a financial institution making the transfer; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Does not take place under a telephone bill-payment or other written plan in which periodic or recurring transfers are contemplated.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Small institutions.</E> Any preauthorized transfer to or from an account if the assets of the account-holding financial institution were $100 <PRTPAGE P="113"/>million or less on the preceding December 31. If assets of the account-holding institution subsequently exceed $100 million, the institution's exemption for preauthorized transfers terminates one year from the end of the calendar year in which the assets exceed $100 million. Preauthorized transfers exempt under this paragraph (c)(7) remain subject to § 205.10(e) regarding compulsory use and sections 915 and 916 of the act regarding civil and criminal liability.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Liability of consumer for unauthorized transfers.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Conditions for liability.</E> A consumer may be held liable, within the limitations described in paragraph (b) of this <PRTPAGE P="114"/>section, for an unauthorized electronic fund transfer involving the consumer's account only if the financial institution has provided the disclosures required by § 205.7(b)(1), (2), and (3). If the unauthorized transfer involved an access device, it must be an accepted access device and the financial institution must have provided a means to identify the consumer to whom it was issued.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Limitations on amount of liability.</E> A consumer's liability for an unauthorized electronic fund transfer or a series of related unauthorized transfers shall be determined as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Timely notice given.</E> If the consumer notifies the financial institution within two business days after learning of the loss or theft of the access device, the consumer's liability shall not exceed the lesser of $50 or the amount of unauthorized transfers that occur before notice to the financial institution.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Timely notice not given.</E> If the consumer fails to notify the financial institution within two business days after learning of the loss or theft of the access device, the consumer's liability shall not exceed the lesser of $500 or the sum of:</P>
            <P>(i) $50 or the amount of unauthorized transfers that occur within the two business days, whichever is less; and</P>
            <P>(ii) The amount of unauthorized transfers that occur after the close of two business days and before notice to the institution, provided the institution establishes that these transfers would not have occurred had the consumer notified the institution within that two-day period.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Periodic statement; timely notice not given.</E> A consumer must report an unauthorized electronic fund transfer that appears on a periodic statement within 60 days of the financial institution's transmittal of the statement to avoid liability for subsequent transfers. If the consumer fails to do so, the consumer's liability shall not exceed the amount of the unauthorized transfers that occur after the close of the 60 days and before notice to the institution, and that the institution establishes would not have occurred had the consumer notified the institution within the 60-day period. When an access device is involved in the unauthorized transfer, the consumer may be liable for other amounts set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, as applicable.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Extension of time limits.</E> If the consumer's delay in notifying the financial institution was due to extenuating circumstances, the institution shall extend the times specified above to a reasonable period.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Notice to financial institution.</E> (i) Notice to a financial institution is given when a consumer takes steps reasonably necessary to provide the institution with the pertinent information, whether or not a particular employee or agent of the institution actually receives the information.</P>
            <P>(ii) The consumer may notify the institution in person, by telephone, or in writing.</P>
            <P>(iii) Written notice is considered given at the time the consumer mails the notice or delivers it for transmission to the institution by any other usual means. Notice may be considered constructively given when the institution becomes aware of circumstances leading to the reasonable belief that an unauthorized transfer to or from the consumer's account has been or may be made.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Liability under state law or agreement.</E> If state law or an agreement between the consumer and the financial institution imposes less liability than is provided by this section, the consumer's liability shall not exceed the amount imposed under the state law or agreement.</P>

            <P>(d) <E T="03">Documentation for foreign-initiated transfers.</E> The failure by a financial institution to provide a terminal receipt for an electronic fund transfer or to document the transfer on a periodic statement does not violate this part if:</P>
            <P>(1) The transfer is not initiated within a state; and</P>
            <P>(2) The financial institution treats an inquiry for clarification or documentation as a notice of error in accordance with § 205.11.</P>

The <PRTPAGE P="124"/>term “overdraft service” does not include any payment of overdrafts pursuant to—</P>
            <P>(1) A line of credit subject to the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation Z (12 CFR part 226), including transfers from a credit card account, home equity line of credit, or overdraft line of credit;</P>

            <P>(i) Provides the consumer with a notice in writing, or if the consumer agrees, electronically, segregated from all other information, describing the institution's overdraft service;</P>
            <P>(ii) Provides a reasonable opportunity for the consumer to affirmatively consent, or opt in, to the service for ATM and one-time debit card transactions;</P>

            <P>(2) <E T="03">Conditioning payment of other overdrafts on consumer's affirmative consent.</E> A financial institution shall not:</P>
            <P>(i) Condition the payment of any overdrafts for checks, ACH transactions, and other types of transactions on the consumer affirmatively consenting to the institution's payment of ATM and one-time debit card transactions pursuant to the institution's overdraft service; or</P>

            <P>(3) <E T="03">Same account terms, conditions, and features.</E> A financial institution shall provide to consumers who do not affirmatively consent to the institution's overdraft service for ATM and one-time debit card transactions the same account terms, conditions, and features that it provides to consumers who affirmatively consent, except for the overdraft service for ATM and one-time debit card transactions.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Timing</E>—(1) <E T="03">Existing account holders.</E> For accounts opened prior to July 1, 2010, the financial institution must not assess any fees or charges on a consumer's account on or after August 15, 2010 for paying an ATM or one-time debit card transaction pursuant to the overdraft service, unless the institution has complied with § 205.17(b)(1) and obtained the consumer's affirmative consent.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">New account holders.</E> For accounts opened on or after July 1, 2010, the financial institution must comply with § 205.17(b)(1) and obtain the consumer's affirmative consent before the institution assesses any fee or charge on the consumer's account for paying an ATM or one-time debit card transaction pursuant to the institution's overdraft service.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Content and format.</E> The notice required by paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section shall be substantially similar to Model Form A-9 set forth in Appendix A of this part, include all applicable items in this paragraph, and may not contain any information not specified in or otherwise permitted by this paragraph.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Overdraft service.</E> A brief description of the financial institution's overdraft service and the types of transactions for which a fee or charge for paying an overdraft may be imposed, including ATM and one-time debit card transactions.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Fees imposed.</E> The dollar amount of any fees or charges assessed by the financial institution for paying an ATM or one-time debit card transaction pursuant to the institution's overdraft service, including any daily or other overdraft fees. If the amount of the fee <PRTPAGE P="125"/>is determined on the basis of the number of times the consumer has overdrawn the account, the amount of the overdraft, or other factors, the institution must disclose the maximum fee that may be imposed.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Limits on fees charged.</E> The maximum number of overdraft fees or charges that may be assessed per day, or, if applicable, that there is no limit.</P>

            <P>(5) <E T="03">Alternative plans for covering overdrafts.</E> If the institution offers a line of credit subject to the Board's Regulation Z (12 CFR part 226) or a service that transfers funds from another account of the consumer held at the institution to cover overdrafts, the institution must state that fact. An institution may, but is not required to, list additional alternatives for the payment of overdrafts.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Permitted modifications and additional content.</E> If applicable, the institution may modify the content required by § 205.17(d) to indicate that the consumer has the right to opt into, or opt out of, the payment of overdrafts under the institution's overdraft service for other types of transactions, such as checks, ACH transactions, or automatic bill payments; to provide a means for the consumer to exercise this choice; and to disclose the associated returned item fee and that additional merchant fees may apply. The institution may also disclose the consumer's right to revoke consent.

            <P>Also, if your statement shows transfers that you did not make, including those made by card, code or other means, tell us at once.

            <P>1. <E T="03">Examples.</E> The term access device includes debit cards, personal identification numbers (PINs), telephone transfer and telephone bill payment codes, and other means that may be used by a consumer to initiate an electronic fund transfer (EFT) to or from a consumer account. The term does not include magnetic tape or other devices used internally by a financial institution to initiate electronic transfers.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Checks used to capture information.</E> The term “access device” does not include a check or draft used to capture the MICR (Magnetic Ink Character Recognition) encoding to initiate a one-time ACH debit. For example, if a consumer authorizes a one-time ACH debit from the consumer's account using a blank, partially completed, or fully completed and signed check for the merchant to capture the routing, account, and serial numbers to initiate the debit, the check is not an access device. (Although the check is not an access device under Regulation E, the transaction is nonetheless covered by the regulation. See comment 3(b)(1)-1.v.)</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2(b) Account</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Consumer asset account.</E> The term consumer asset account includes:</P>

            <P>i. Club accounts, such as vacation clubs. In many cases, however, these accounts are exempt from the regulation under § 205.3(c)(5) because all electronic transfers to or from the account have been preauthorized by the <PRTPAGE P="137"/>consumer and involve another account of the consumer at the same institution.</P>
            <P>ii. A retail repurchase agreement (repo), which is a loan made to a financial institution by a consumer that is collateralized by government or government-insured securities.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Certain employment-related cards not covered.</E> The term “payroll card account” does not include a card used solely to disburse incentive-based payments (other than commissions which can represent the primary means through which a consumer is paid), such as bonuses, which are unlikely to be a consumer's primary source of salary or other compensation. The term also does not include a card used solely to make disbursements unrelated to compensation, such as petty cash reimbursements or travel per diem payments. Similarly, a payroll card account does not include a card that is used in isolated instances to which an employer typically does not make recurring payments, such as when providing final payments or in emergency situations when other payment methods are unavailable. However, all transactions involving the transfer of funds to or from a payroll card account are covered by the regulation, even if a particular transaction involves payment of a bonus, other incentive-based payment, or reimbursement, or the transaction does not represent a transfer of wages, salary, or other employee compensation.</P>
            <P>3. Examples of accounts not covered by Regulation E (12 CFR part 205) include:</P>
            <P>i. Profit-sharing and pension accounts established under a trust agreement, which are exempt under § 205.2(b)(2).</P>
            <P>ii. Escrow accounts, such as those established to ensure payment of items such as real estate taxes, insurance premiums, or completion of repairs or improvements.</P>
            <P>iii. Accounts for accumulating funds to purchase U.S. savings bonds.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 2(b)(2)</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Bona fide trust agreements.</E> The term bona fide trust agreement is not defined by the act or regulation; therefore, financial institutions must look to state or other applicable law for interpretation.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Custodial agreements.</E> An account held under a custodial agreement that qualifies as a trust under the Internal Revenue Code, such as an individual retirement account, is considered to be held under a trust agreement for purposes of Regulation E.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2(d) Business Day</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Duration.</E> A business day includes the entire 24-hour period ending at midnight, and a notice required by the regulation is effective even if given outside normal business hours. The regulation does not require, however, that a financial institution make telephone lines available on a 24-hour basis.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Substantially all business functions.</E> “Substantially all business functions” include both the public and the back-office operations of the institution. For example, if the offices of an institution are open on Saturdays for handling some consumer transactions (such as deposits, withdrawals, and other teller transactions), but not for performing internal functions (such as investigating account errors), then Saturday is not a business day for that institution. In this case, Saturday does not count toward the business-day standard set by the regulation for reporting lost or stolen access devices, resolving errors, etc.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Short hours.</E> A financial institution may determine, at its election, whether an abbreviated day is a business day. For example, if an institution engages in substantially all business functions until noon on Saturdays instead of its usual 3:00 p.m. closing, it may consider Saturday a business day.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Telephone line.</E> If a financial institution makes a telephone line available on Sundays for reporting the loss or theft of an access device, but performs no other business functions, Sunday is not a business day under the “substantially all business functions” standard.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2(h) Electronic Terminal</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Point-of-sale (POS) payments initiated by telephone.</E> Because the term electronic terminal excludes a telephone operated by a consumer, a financial institution need not provide a terminal receipt when:</P>
            <P>i. A consumer uses a debit card at a public telephone to pay for the call.</P>
            <P>ii. A consumer initiates a transfer by a means analogous in function to a telephone, such as by home banking equipment or a facsimile machine.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">POS terminals.</E> A POS terminal that captures data electronically, for debiting or crediting to a consumer's asset account, is an electronic terminal for purposes of Regulation E even if no access device is used to initiate the transaction. (See § 205.9 for receipt requirements.)</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Teller-operated terminals.</E> A terminal or other computer equipment operated by an employee of a financial institution is not an electronic terminal for purposes of the regulation. However, transfers initiated at such terminals by means of a consumer's access device (using the consumer's PIN, for example) are EFTs and are subject to other requirements of the regulation. If an access device is used only for identification purposes or for determining the account balance, the transfers are not EFTs for purposes of the regulation.<PRTPAGE P="138"/>
            </P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2(k) Preauthorized Electronic Fund Transfer</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Advance authorization.</E> A “preauthorized electronic fund transfer” under Regulation E is one authorized by the consumer in advance of a transfer that will take place on a recurring basis, at substantially regular intervals, and will require no further action by the consumer to initiate the transfer. In a bill-payment system, for example, if the consumer authorizes a financial institution to make monthly payments to a payee by means of EFTs, and the payments take place without further action by the consumer, the payments are preauthorized EFTs. In contrast, if the consumer must take action each month to initiate a payment (such as by entering instructions on a touch-tone telephone or home computer), the payments are not preauthorized EFTs.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2(m) Unauthorized Electronic Fund Transfer</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Transfer by institution's employee.</E> A consumer has no liability for erroneous or fraudulent transfers initiated by an employee of a financial institution.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Authority.</E> If a consumer furnishes an access device and grants authority to make transfers to a person (such as a family member or co-worker) who exceeds the authority given, the consumer is fully liable for the transfers unless the consumer has notified the financial institution that transfers by that person are no longer authorized.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Access device obtained through robbery or fraud.</E> An unauthorized EFT includes a transfer initiated by a person who obtained the access device from the consumer through fraud or robbery.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Forced initiation.</E> An EFT at an automated teller machine (ATM) is an unauthorized transfer if the consumer has been induced by force to initiate the transfer.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Reversal of direct deposits.</E> The reversal of a direct deposit made in error is not an unauthorized EFT when it involves:</P>
            <P>i. A credit made to the wrong consumer's account;</P>
            <P>ii. A duplicate credit made to a consumer's account; or</P>
            <P>iii. A credit in the wrong amount (for example, when the amount credited to the consumer's account differs from the amount in the transmittal instructions).</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Section 205.3—Coverage</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">3(a) General</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Accounts covered.</E> The requirements of the regulation apply only to an account for which an agreement for EFT services to or from the account has been entered into between:</P>
            <P>i. The consumer and the financial institution (including an account for which an access device has been issued to the consumer, for example);</P>
            <P>ii. The consumer and a third party (for preauthorized debits or credits, for example), when the account-holding institution has received notice of the agreement and the fund transfers have begun.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Automated clearing house (ACH) membership.</E> The fact that membership in an ACH requires a financial institution to accept EFTs to accounts at the institution does not make every account of that institution subject to the regulation.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Foreign applicability.</E> Regulation E applies to all persons (including branches and other offices of foreign banks located in the United States) that offer EFT services to residents of any state, including resident aliens. It covers any account located in the United States through which EFTs are offered to a resident of a state. This is the case whether or not a particular transfer takes place in the United States and whether or not the financial institution is chartered in the United States or a foreign country. The regulation does not apply to a foreign branch of a U.S. bank unless the EFT services are offered in connection with an account in a state as defined in § 205.2(l).</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">3(b) Electronic Fund Transfer</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 3(b)(1)—Definition</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Fund transfers covered.</E> The term electronic fund transfer includes:</P>
            <P>i. A deposit made at an ATM or other electronic terminal (including a deposit in cash or by check) provided a specific agreement exists between the financial institution and the consumer for EFTs to or from the account to which the deposit is made.</P>
            <P>ii. A transfer sent via ACH. For example, social security benefits under the U.S. Treasury's direct-deposit program are covered, even if the listing of payees and payment amounts reaches the account-holding institution by means of a computer printout from a correspondent bank.</P>
            <P>iii. A preauthorized transfer credited or debited to an account in accordance with instructions contained on magnetic tape, even if the financial institution holding the account sends or receives a composite check.</P>
            <P>iv. A transfer from the consumer's account resulting from a debit-card transaction at a merchant location, even if no electronic terminal is involved at the time of the transaction, if the consumer's asset account is subsequently debited for the amount of the transfer.</P>

            <P>v. A transfer via ACH where a consumer has provided a check to enable the merchant or other payee to capture the routing, account, and serial numbers to initiate the transfer, whether the check is blank, partially completed, or fully completed and signed; whether the check is presented at POS or is mailed to a merchant or other payee or lockbox and later converted to an <PRTPAGE P="139"/>EFT; or whether the check is retained by the consumer, the merchant or other payee, or the payee's financial institution.</P>
            <P>vi. A payment made by a bill payer under a bill-payment service available to a consumer via computer or other electronic means, unless the terms of the bill-payment service explicitly state that all payments, or all payments to a particular payee or payees, will be solely by check, draft, or similar paper instrument drawn on the consumer's account, and the payee or payees that will be paid in this manner are identified to the consumer.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Fund transfers not covered.</E> The term electronic fund transfer does not include:</P>
            <P>i. A payment that does not debit or credit a consumer asset account, such as a payroll allotment to a creditor to repay a credit extension (which is deducted from salary).</P>
            <P>ii. A payment made in currency by a consumer to another person at an electronic terminal.</P>
            <P>iii. A preauthorized check drawn by the financial institution on the consumer's account (such as an interest or other recurring payment to the consumer or another party), even if the check is computer-generated.</P>
            <P>iv. Transactions arising from the electronic collection, presentment, or return of checks through the check collection system, such as through transmission of electronic check images.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 3(b)(2)—Electronic Fund Transfer Using Information From a Check</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Notice at POS not furnished due to inadvertent error.</E> If the copy of the notice under section 205.3(b)(2)(ii) for ECK transactions is not provided to the consumer at POS because of a bona fide unintentional error, such as when a terminal printing mechanism jams, no violation results if the payee maintains procedures reasonably adapted to avoid such occurrences.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Authorization to process a transaction as an EFT or as a check.</E> In order to process a transaction as an EFT or alternatively as a check, the payee must obtain the consumer's authorization to do so. A payee may, at its option, specify the circumstances under which a check may not be converted to an EFT. (See model clauses in Appendix A-6.)</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Notice for each transfer.</E> Generally, a notice to authorize an electronic check conversion transaction must be provided for each transaction. For example, a consumer must receive a notice that the transaction will be processed as an EFT for each transaction at POS or each time a consumer mails a check in an accounts receivable (ARC) transaction to pay a bill, such as a utility bill, if the payee intends to convert a check received as payment. Similarly, the consumer must receive notice if the payee intends to collect a service fee for insufficient or uncollected funds via an EFT for each transaction whether at POS or if the consumer mails a check to pay a bill. The notice about when funds may be debited from a consumer's account and the non-return of consumer checks by the consumer's financial institution must also be provided for each transaction. However, if in an ARC transaction, a payee provides a coupon book to a consumer, for example, for mortgage loan payments, and the payment dates and amounts are set out in the coupon book, the payee may provide a single notice on the coupon book stating all of the required disclosures under paragraph (b)(2) of this section in order to obtain authorization for each conversion of a check and any debits via EFT to the consumer's account to collect any service fees imposed by the payee for insufficient or uncollected funds in the consumer's account. The notice must be placed on a conspicuous location of the coupon book that a consumer can retain—for example, on the first page, or inside the front cover.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Multiple payments/multiple consumers.</E> If a merchant or other payee will use information from a consumer's check to initiate an EFT from the consumer's account, notice to a consumer listed on the billing account that a check provided as payment during a single billing cycle or after receiving an invoice or statement will be processed as a one-time EFT or as a check transaction constitutes notice for all checks provided in payment for the billing cycle or the invoice for which notice has been provided, whether the check(s) is submitted by the consumer or someone else. The notice applies to all checks provided in payment for the billing cycle or invoice until the provision of notice on or with the next invoice or statement. Thus, if a merchant or other payee receives a check as payment for the consumer listed on the billing account after providing notice that the check will be processed as a one-time EFT, the authorization from that consumer constitutes authorization to convert any other checks provided for that invoice or statement. Other notices required under this paragraph (b)(2) (for example, to collect a service fee for insufficient or uncollected funds via an EFT) provided to the consumer listed on the billing account also constitutes notice to any other consumer who may provide a check for the billing cycle or invoice.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Additional disclosures about ECK transactions at POS.</E> When a payee initiates an EFT at POS using information from the consumer's check, and returns the check to the consumer at POS, the payee need not provide a notice to the consumer that the check will not be returned by the consumer's financial institution.<PRTPAGE P="140"/>
            </P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 3(b)(3)—Collection of Returned Item Fees via Electronic Fund Transfer</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Fees imposed by account-holding institution.</E> The requirement to obtain a consumer's authorization to collect a fee via EFT for the return of an EFT or check unpaid applies only to the person that intends to initiate an EFT to collect the returned item fee from the consumer's account. The authorization requirement does not apply to any fees assessed by the consumer's account-holding financial institution when it returns the unpaid underlying EFT or check or pays the amount of an overdraft.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Accounts receivable transactions.</E> In an accounts receivable (ARC) transaction where a consumer sends in a payment for amounts owed (or makes an in-person payment at a biller's physical location, such as when a consumer makes a loan payment at a bank branch or places a payment in a dropbox), a person seeking to electronically collect a fee for items returned unpaid must obtain the consumer's authorization to collect the fee in this manner. A consumer authorizes a person to electronically collect a returned item fee when the consumer receives notice, typically on an invoice or statement, that the person may collect the fee through an EFT to the consumer's account, and the consumer goes forward with the underlying transaction by providing payment. The notice must also state the dollar amount of the fee. However, an explanation of how that fee will be determined may be provided in place of the dollar amount of the fee if the fee may vary due to the amount of the transaction or due to other factors, such as the number of days the underlying transaction is left outstanding. For example, if a state law permits a maximum fee of $30 or 10% of the underlying transaction, whichever is greater, the person collecting the fee may explain how the fee is determined, rather than state a specific dollar amount for the fee.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Disclosure of dollar amount of fee for POS transactions.</E> The notice provided to the consumer in connection with a POS transaction under § 205.3(b)(3)(ii) must state the amount of the fee for a returned item if the dollar amount of the fee can be calculated at the time the notice is provided or mailed. For example, if notice is provided to the consumer at the time of the transaction, if the applicable state law sets a maximum fee that may be collected for a returned item based on the amount of the underlying transaction (such as where the amount of the fee is expressed as a percentage of the underlying transaction), the person collecting the fee must state the actual dollar amount of the fee on the notice provided to the consumer. Alternatively, if the amount of the fee to be collected cannot be calculated at the time of the transaction (for example, where the amount of the fee will depend on the number of days a debt continues to be owed), the person collecting the fee may provide a description of how the fee will be determined on both the posted notice as well as on the notice provided at the time of the transaction. However, if the person collecting the fee elects to send the consumer notice after the person has initiated an EFT to collect the fee, that notice must state the amount of the fee to be collected.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Third party providing notice.</E> The person initiating an EFT to a consumer's account to electronically collect a fee for an item returned unpaid may obtain the authorization and provide the notices required under § 205.3(b)(3) through third parties, such as merchants.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">3(c) Exclusions From Coverage</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 3(c)(1)—Checks</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Re-presented checks.</E> The electronic re-presentment of a returned check is not covered by Regulation E because the transaction originated by check. Regulation E does apply, however, to any fee debited via an EFT from a consumer's account by the payee because the check was returned for insufficient or uncollected funds. The person debiting the fee electronically must obtain the consumer's authorization.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Check used to capture information for a one-time EFT.</E> See comment 3(b)(1)-1.v.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 3(c)(2)—Check Guarantee or Authorization</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Memo posting.</E> Under a check guarantee or check authorization service, debiting of the consumer's account occurs when the check or draft is presented for payment. These services are exempt from coverage, even when a temporary hold on the account is memo-posted electronically at the time of authorization.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 3(c)(3)—Wire or Other Similar Transfers</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Fedwire and ACH.</E> If a financial institution makes a fund transfer to a consumer's account after receiving funds through Fedwire or a similar network, the transfer by ACH is covered by the regulation even though the Fedwire or network transfer is exempt.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Article 4A.</E> Financial institutions that offer telephone-initiated Fedwire payments are subject to the requirements of UCC section 4A-202, which encourages verification of Fedwire payment orders pursuant to a security procedure established by agreement between the consumer and the receiving bank. These transfers are not subject to Regulation E and the agreement is not considered a telephone plan if the service is offered separately from a telephone bill-payment or other prearranged plan subject to Regulation <PRTPAGE P="141"/>E. The Board's Regulation J (12 CFR part 210) specifies the rules applicable to funds handled by Federal Reserve Banks. To ensure that the rules for all fund transfers through Fedwire are consistent, the Board used its preemptive authority under UCC section 4A-107 to determine that subpart B of Regulation J (12 CFR part 210), including the provisions of Article 4A, applies to all fund transfers through Fedwire, even if a portion of the fund transfer is governed by the EFTA. The portion of the fund transfer that is governed by the EFTA is not governed by subpart B of Regulation J (12 CFR part 210).</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Similar fund transfer systems.</E> Fund transfer systems that are similar to Fedwire include the Clearing House Interbank Payments System (CHIPS), Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), Telex, and transfers made on the books of correspondent banks.</P>

            <P>1. <E T="03">Coverage.</E> The securities exemption applies to securities and commodities that may be sold by a registered broker-dealer or futures commission merchant, even when the security or commodity itself is not regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Example of exempt transfer.</E> The exemption applies to a transfer involving a transfer initiated by a telephone order to a stockbroker to buy or sell securities or to exercise a margin call.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Examples of nonexempt transfers.</E> The exemption does not apply to a transfer involving:</P>
            <P>i. A debit card or other access device that accesses a securities or commodities account such as a money market mutual fund and that the consumer uses for purchasing goods or services or for obtaining cash.</P>
            <P>ii. A payment of interest or dividends into the consumer's account (for example, from a brokerage firm or from a Federal Reserve Bank for government securities).</P>

            <P>1. <E T="03">Automatic transfers exempted.</E> The exemption applies to:</P>
            <P>i. Electronic debits or credits to consumer accounts for check charges, stop-payment charges, NSF charges, overdraft charges, provisional credits, error adjustments, and similar items that are initiated automatically on the occurrence of certain events.</P>
            <P>ii. Debits to consumer accounts for group insurance available only through the financial institution and payable only by means of an aggregate payment from the institution to the insurer.</P>
            <P>iii. EFTs between a thrift institution and its paired commercial bank in the state of Rhode Island, which are deemed under state law to be intra-institutional.</P>
            <P>iv. Automatic transfers between a consumer's accounts within the same financial institution, even if the account holders on the two accounts are not identical.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Automatic transfers not exempted.</E> Transfers between accounts of the consumer at affiliated institutions (such as between a bank and its subsidiary or within a holding company) are not intra-institutional transfers, and thus do not qualify for the exemption.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 3(c)(6)—Telephone-Initiated Transfers</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Written plan or agreement.</E> A transfer that the consumer initiates by telephone is covered by Regulation E if the transfer is made under a written plan or agreement between the consumer and the financial institution making the transfer. A written statement available to the public or to account holders that describes a service allowing a consumer to initiate transfers by telephone constitutes a plan—for example, a brochure, or material included with periodic statements. The following, however, do not by themselves constitute a written plan or agreement:</P>
            <P>i. A hold-harmless agreement on a signature card that protects the institution if the consumer requests a transfer.</P>
            <P>ii. A legend on a signature card, periodic statement, or passbook that limits the number of telephone-initiated transfers the consumer can make from a savings account because of reserve requirements under Regulation D (12 CFR part 204).</P>
            <P>iii. An agreement permitting the consumer to approve by telephone the rollover of funds at the maturity of an instrument.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Examples of covered transfers.</E> When a written plan or agreement has been entered into, a transfer initiated by a telephone call from a consumer is covered even though:</P>
            <P>i. An employee of the financial institution completes the transfer manually (for example, by means of a debit memo or deposit slip).</P>
            <P>ii. The consumer is required to make a separate request for each transfer.</P>
            <P>iii. The consumer uses the plan infrequently.</P>
            <P>iv. The consumer initiates the transfer via a facsimile machine.</P>
            <P>v. The consumer initiates the transfer using a financial institution's audio-response or voice-response telephone system.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 3(c)(7)—Small Institutions</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Coverage.</E> This exemption is limited to preauthorized transfers; institutions that offer other EFTs must comply with the applicable sections of the regulation as to such services. The preauthorized transfers remain <PRTPAGE P="142"/>subject to sections 913, 915, and 916 of the act and § 205.10(e), and are therefore exempt from UCC Article 4A.</P>

Numbers or codes are considered readily understandable if explained elsewhere on the disclosure form.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Foreign language disclosures.</E> Disclosures may be made in languages other than English, provided they are available in English upon request.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Section 205.5—Issuance of Access Devices</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Coverage.</E> The provisions of this section limit the circumstances under which a financial institution may issue an access device to a consumer. Making an additional account accessible through an existing access device is equivalent to issuing an access device and is subject to the limitations of this section.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">5(a) Solicited Issuance</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 5(a)(1)</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Joint account.</E> For a joint account, a financial institution may issue an access device to each account holder if the requesting holder specifically authorizes the issuance.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Permissible forms of request.</E> The request for an access device may be written or oral (for example, in response to a telephone solicitation by a card issuer).</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 5(a)(2)</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">One-for-one rule.</E> In issuing a renewal or substitute access device, only one renewal or substitute device may replace a previously issued device. For example, only one new card and PIN may replace a card and PIN previously issued. A financial institution may provide additional devices at the time it issues the renewal or substitute access device, however, provided the institution complies with § 205.5(b). (See comment 5(b)-5.) If the replacement device or the additional device permits either fewer or additional types of electronic fund transfer services, a change-in-terms notice or new disclosures are required.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Renewal or substitution by a successor institution.</E> A successor institution is an entity that replaces the original financial institution (for example, following a corporate merger or acquisition) or that acquires accounts or assumes the operation of an EFT system.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">5(b) Unsolicited Issuance</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Compliance.</E> A financial institution may issue an unsolicited access device (such as the combination of a debit card and PIN) if the institution's ATM system has been programmed not to accept the access device until after the consumer requests and the institution validates the device. Merely instructing a consumer not to use an unsolicited debit card and PIN until after the institution verifies the consumer's identity does not comply with the regulation.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">PINS.</E> A financial institution may impose no liability on a consumer for unauthorized transfers involving an unsolicited access device until the device becomes an “accepted access device” under the regulation. A card and PIN combination may be treated as an accepted access device once the consumer has used it to make a transfer.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Functions of PIN.</E> If an institution issues a PIN at the consumer's request, the issuance may constitute both a way of validating the debit card and the means to identify the consumer (required as a condition of imposing liability for unauthorized transfers).</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Verification of identity.</E> To verify the consumer's identity, a financial institution may use any reasonable means, such as a photograph, fingerprint, personal visit, signature comparison, or personal information about the consumer. However, even if reasonable means were used, if an institution fails to verify correctly the consumer's identity and an imposter succeeds in having the device validated, the consumer is not liable for any unauthorized transfers from the account.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Additional access devices in a renewal or substitution.</E> A financial institution may issue more than one access device in connection with the renewal or substitution of a previously issued accepted access device, provided that any additional access device (beyond the device replacing the accepted access device) is not validated at the time it is issued, and the institution complies with the other requirements of § 205.5(b). The institution may, if it chooses, set up the validation procedure such that both the device replacing the previously issued device and the additional device are not validated at the time they are issued, and validation will apply to both devices. If the institution sets up the validation procedure in this way, the institution should provide a clear and readily understandable disclosure to the consumer that both devices are unvalidated and that validation will apply to both devices.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Section 205.6—Liability of Consumer for Unauthorized Transfers</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">6(a) Conditions for Liability</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Means of identification.</E> A financial institution may use various means for identifying <PRTPAGE P="143"/>the consumer to whom the access device is issued, including but not limited to:</P>
            <P>i. Electronic or mechanical confirmation (such as a PIN).</P>
            <P>ii. Comparison of the consumer's signature, fingerprint, or photograph.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Multiple users.</E> When more than one access device is issued for an account, the financial institution may, but need not, provide a separate means to identify each user of the account.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">6(b) Limitations on Amount of Liability</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Application of liability provisions.</E> There are three possible tiers of consumer liability for unauthorized EFTs depending on the situation. A consumer may be liable for (1) up to $50; (2) up to $500; or (3) an unlimited amount depending on when the unauthorized EFT occurs. More than one tier may apply to a given situation because each corresponds to a different (sometimes overlapping) time period or set of conditions.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Consumer negligence.</E> Negligence by the consumer cannot be used as the basis for imposing greater liability than is permissible under Regulation E. Thus, consumer behavior that may constitute negligence under state law, such as writing the PIN on a debit card or on a piece of paper kept with the card, does not affect the consumer's liability for unauthorized transfers. (However, refer to comment 2(m)-2 regarding termination of the authority of given by the consumer to another person.)</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Limits on liability.</E> The extent of the consumer's liability is determined solely by the consumer's promptness in reporting the loss or theft of an access device. Similarly, no agreement between the consumer and an institution may impose greater liability on the consumer for an unauthorized transfer than the limits provided in Regulation E.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 6(b)(1)—Timely Notice Given</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">$50 limit applies.</E> The basic liability limit is $50. For example, the consumer's card is lost or stolen on Monday and the consumer learns of the loss or theft on Wednesday. If the consumer notifies the financial institution within two business days of learning of the loss or theft (by midnight Friday), the consumer's liability is limited to $50 or the amount of the unauthorized transfers that occurred before notification, whichever is less.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Knowledge of loss or theft of access device.</E> The fact that a consumer has received a periodic statement that reflects unauthorized transfers may be a factor in determining whether the consumer had knowledge of the loss or theft, but cannot be deemed to represent conclusive evidence that the consumer had such knowledge.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Two-business-day rule.</E> The two-business-day period does not include the day the consumer learns of the loss or theft or any day that is not a business day. The rule is calculated based on two 24-hour periods, without regard to the financial institution's business hours or the time of day that the consumer learns of the loss or theft. For example, a consumer learns of the loss or theft at 6 p.m. on Friday. Assuming that Saturday is a business day and Sunday is not, the two-business-day period begins on Saturday and expires at 11:59 p.m. on Monday, not at the end of the financial institution's business day on Monday.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 6(b)(2)—Timely Notice Not Given</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">$500 limit applies.</E> The second tier of liability is $500. For example, the consumer's card is stolen on Monday and the consumer learns of the theft that same day. The consumer reports the theft on Friday. The $500 limit applies because the consumer failed to notify the financial institution within two business days of learning of the theft (which would have been by midnight Wednesday). How much the consumer is actually liable for, however, depends on when the unauthorized transfers take place. In this example, assume a $100 unauthorized transfer was made on Tuesday and a $600 unauthorized transfer on Thursday. Because the consumer is liable for the amount of the loss that occurs within the first two business days (but no more than $50), plus the amount of the unauthorized transfers that occurs after the first two business days and before the consumer gives notice, the consumer's total liability is $500 ($50 of the $100 transfer plus $450 of the $600 transfer, in this example). But if $600 was taken on Tuesday and $100 on Thursday, the consumer's maximum liability would be $150 ($50 of the $600 plus $100).</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 6(b)(3)—Periodic Statement; Timely Notice Not Given</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Unlimited liability applies.</E> The standard of unlimited liability applies if unauthorized transfers appear on a periodic statement, and may apply in conjunction with the first two tiers of liability. If a periodic statement shows an unauthorized transfer made with a lost or stolen debit card, the consumer must notify the financial institution within 60 calendar days after the periodic statement was sent; otherwise, the consumer faces unlimited liability for all unauthorized transfers made after the 60-day period. The consumer's liability for unauthorized transfers before the statement is sent, and up to 60 days following, is determined based on the first two tiers of liability: up to $50 if the consumer notifies the financial institution within two business days of learning of the loss or theft of the card and up to $500 if the consumer notifies the institution after two business days of learning of the loss or theft.<PRTPAGE P="144"/>
            </P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Transfers not involving access device.</E> The first two tiers of liability do not apply to unauthorized transfers from a consumer's account made without an access device. If, however, the consumer fails to report such unauthorized transfers within 60 calendar days of the financial institution's transmittal of the periodic statement, the consumer may be liable for any transfers occurring after the close of the 60 days and before notice is given to the institution. For example, a consumer's account is electronically debited for $200 without the consumer's authorization and by means other than the consumer's access device. If the consumer notifies the institution within 60 days of the transmittal of the periodic statement that shows the unauthorized transfer, the consumer has no liability. However, if in addition to the $200, the consumer's account is debited for a $400 unauthorized transfer on the 61st day and the consumer fails to notify the institution of the first unauthorized transfer until the 62nd day, the consumer may be liable for the full $400.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 6(b)(4)—Extension of Time Limits</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Extenuating circumstances.</E> Examples of circumstances that require extension of the notification periods under this section include the consumer's extended travel or hospitalization.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 6(b)(5)—Notice to Financial Institution</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Receipt of notice.</E> A financial institution is considered to have received notice for purposes of limiting the consumer's liability if notice is given in a reasonable manner, even if the consumer notifies the institution but uses an address or telephone number other than the one specified by the institution.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Notice by third party.</E> Notice to a financial institution by a person acting on the consumer's behalf is considered valid under this section. For example, if a consumer is hospitalized and unable to report the loss or theft of an access device, notice is considered given when someone acting on the consumer's behalf notifies the bank of the loss or theft. A financial institution may require appropriate documentation from the person representing the consumer to establish that the person is acting on the consumer's behalf.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Content of notice.</E> Notice to a financial institution is considered given when a consumer takes reasonable steps to provide the institution with the pertinent account information. Even when the consumer is unable to provide the account number or the card number in reporting a lost or stolen access device or an unauthorized transfer, the notice effectively limits the consumer's liability if the consumer otherwise identifies sufficiently the account in question. For example, the consumer may identify the account by the name on the account and the type of account in question.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Section 205.7—Initial Disclosures</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">7(a) Timing of Disclosures</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Early disclosures.</E> Disclosures given by a financial institution earlier than the regulation requires (for example, when the consumer opens a checking account) need not be repeated when the consumer later enters into an agreement with a third party to initiate preauthorized transfers to or from the consumer's account, unless the terms and conditions differ from those that the institution previously disclosed. This interpretation also applies to any notice provided about one-time EFTs from a consumer's account initiated using information from the consumer's check. On the other hand, if an agreement for EFT services to be provided by an account-holding institution is directly between the consumer and the account-holding institution, disclosures must be given in close proximity to the event requiring disclosure, for example, when the consumer contracts for a new service.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Lack of advance notice of a transfer.</E> Where a consumer authorizes a third party to debit or credit the consumer's account, an account-holding institution that has not received advance notice of the transfer or transfers must provide the required disclosures as soon as reasonably possible after the first debit or credit is made, unless the institution has previously given the disclosures.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Addition of new accounts.</E> If a consumer opens a new account permitting EFTs at a financial institution, and the consumer already has received Regulation E disclosures for another account at that institution, the institution need only disclose terms and conditions that differ from those previously given.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Addition of service in interchange systems.</E> If a financial institution joins an interchange or shared network system (which provides access to terminals operated by other institutions), disclosures are required for additional EFT services not previously available to consumers if the terms and conditions differ from those previously disclosed.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Disclosures covering all EFT services offered.</E> An institution may provide disclosures covering all EFT services that it offers, even if some consumers have not arranged to use all services.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">7(b) Content of Disclosures</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 7(b)(1)—Liability of Consumer</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">No liability imposed by financial institution.</E> If a financial institution chooses to impose zero liability for unauthorized EFTs, it need not provide the liability disclosures. If <PRTPAGE P="145"/>the institution later decides to impose liability, however, it must first provide the disclosures.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Preauthorized transfers.</E> If the only EFTs from an account are preauthorized transfers, liability could arise if the consumer fails to report unauthorized transfers reflected on a periodic statement. To impose such liability on the consumer, the institution must have disclosed the potential liability and the telephone number and address for reporting unauthorized transfers.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Additional information.</E> At the institution's option, the summary of the consumer's liability may include advice on promptly reporting unauthorized transfers or the loss or theft of the access device.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 7(b)(2)—Telephone Number and Address</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Disclosure of telephone numbers.</E> An institution may use the same or different telephone numbers in the disclosures for the purpose of:</P>
            <P>i. Reporting the loss or theft of an access device or possible unauthorized transfers;</P>
            <P>ii. Inquiring about the receipt of a preauthorized credit;</P>
            <P>iii. Stopping payment of a preauthorized debit;</P>
            <P>iv. Giving notice of an error.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Location of telephone number.</E> The telephone number need not be incorporated into the text of the disclosure; for example, the institution may instead insert a reference to a telephone number that is readily available to the consumer, such as “Call your branch office. The number is shown on your periodic statement.” However, an institution must provide a specific telephone number and address, on or with the disclosure statement, for reporting a lost or stolen access device or a possible unauthorized transfer.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 7(b)(4)—Types of Transfers; Limitations</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Security limitations.</E> Information about limitations on the frequency and dollar amount of transfers generally must be disclosed in detail, even if related to security aspects of the system. If the confidentiality of certain details is essential to the security of an account or system, these details may be withheld (but the fact that limitations exist must still be disclosed). For example, an institution limits cash ATM withdrawals to $100 per day. The institution may disclose that daily withdrawal limitations apply and need not disclose that the limitations may not always be in force (such as during periods when its ATMs are off-line).</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Restrictions on certain deposit accounts.</E> A limitation on account activity that restricts the consumer's ability to make EFTs must be disclosed even if the restriction also applies to transfers made by nonelectronic means. For example, Regulation D (12 CFR Part 204) restricts the number of payments to third parties that may be made from a money market deposit account; an institution that does not execute fund transfers in excess of those limits must disclose the restriction as a limitation on the frequency of EFTs.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Preauthorized transfers.</E> Financial institutions are not required to list preauthorized transfers among the types of transfers that a consumer can make.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">One-time EFTs initiated using information from a check.</E> Financial institutions must disclose the fact that one-time EFTs initiated using information from a consumer's check are among the types of transfers that a consumer can make. (See Appendix A-2.)</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 7(b)(5)—Fees</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Disclosure of EFT fees.</E> An institution is required to disclose all fees for EFTs or the right to make them. Others fees (for example, minimum-balance fees, stop-payment fees, or account overdrafts) may, but need not, be disclosed (but see Regulation DD, 12 CFR Part 230. An institution is not required to disclose fees for inquiries made at an ATM since no transfer of funds is involved.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Fees also applicable to non-EFT.</E> A per-item fee for EFTs must be disclosed even if the same fee is imposed on nonelectronic transfers. If a per-item fee is imposed only under certain conditions, such as when the transactions in the cycle exceed a certain number, those conditions must be disclosed. Itemization of the various fees may be provided on the disclosure statement or on an accompanying document that is referenced in the statement.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Interchange system fees.</E> Fees paid by the account-holding institution to the operator of a shared or interchange ATM system need not be disclosed, unless they are imposed on the consumer by the account-holding institution. Fees for use of an ATM that are debited directly from the consumer's account by an institution other than the account-holding institution (for example, fees included in the transfer amount) need not be disclosed. (See § 205.7(b)(11) for the general notice requirement regarding fees that may be imposed by ATM operators and by a network used to complete the transfer.)</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 7(b)(9)—Confidentiality</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Information provided to third parties.</E> An institution must describe the circumstances under which any information relating to an account to or from which EFTs are permitted will be made available to third parties, not just information concerning those EFTs. The term “third parties” includes affiliates such as other subsidiaries of the same holding company.<PRTPAGE P="146"/>

            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 7(b)(10)—Error Resolution</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Substantially similar.</E> The error resolution notice must be substantially similar to the model form in appendix A of part 205. An institution may use different wording so long as the substance of the notice remains the same, may delete inapplicable provisions (for example, the requirement for written confirmation of an oral notification), and may substitute substantive state law requirements affording greater consumer protection than Regulation E.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Extended time-period for certain transactions.</E> To take advantage of the longer time periods for resolving errors under § 205.11(c)(3) (for new accounts as defined in Regulation CC (12 CFR part 229), transfers initiated outside the United States, or transfers resulting from POS debit-card transactions), a financial institution must have disclosed these longer time periods. Similarly, an institution that relies on the exception from provisional crediting in § 205.11(c)(2) for accounts subject to Regulation T (12 CFR part 220) must have disclosed accordingly.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">7(c) Addition of Electronic Fund Transfer Services</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Addition of electronic check conversion services.</E> One-time EFTs initiated using information from a consumer's check are a new type of transfer requiring new disclosures, as applicable. (See Appendix A-2.)</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Section 205.8—Change-in-Terms Notice; Error Resolution Notice</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">8(a) Change-in-Terms Notice</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Form of notice.</E> No specific form or wording is required for a change-in-terms notice. The notice may appear on a periodic statement, or may be given by sending a copy of a revised disclosure statement, provided attention is directed to the change (for example, in a cover letter referencing the changed term).</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Changes not requiring notice.</E> The following changes do not require disclosure:</P>
            <P>i. Closing some of an institution's ATMs;</P>
            <P>ii. Cancellation of an access device.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Limitations on transfers.</E> When the initial disclosures omit details about limitations because secrecy is essential to the security of the account or system, a subsequent increase in those limitations need not be disclosed if secrecy is still essential. If, however, an institution had no limits in place when the initial disclosures were given and now wishes to impose limits for the first time, it must disclose at least the fact that limits have been adopted. (See also § 205.7(b)(4) and the related commentary.)</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Change in telephone number or address.</E> When a financial institution changes the telephone number or address used for reporting possible unauthorized transfers, a change-in-terms notice is required only if the institution will impose liability on the consumer for unauthorized transfers under § 205.6. (See also § 205.6(a) and the related commentary.)</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">8(b) Error Resolution Notice</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Change between annual and periodic notice.</E> If an institution switches from an annual to a periodic notice, or vice versa, the first notice under the new method must be sent no later than 12 months after the last notice sent under the old method.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Exception for new accounts.</E> For new accounts, disclosure of the longer error resolution time periods under § 205.11(c)(3) is not required in the annual error resolution notice or in the notice that may be provided with each periodic statement as an alternative to the annual notice.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">9(a) Receipts at Electronic Terminals</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Receipts furnished only on request.</E> The regulation requires that a receipt be “made available.” A financial institution may program its electronic terminals to provide a receipt only to consumers who elect to receive one.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Third party providing receipt.</E> An account-holding institution may make terminal receipts available through third parties such as merchants or other financial institutions.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Inclusion of promotional material.</E> A financial institution may include promotional material on receipts if the required information is set forth clearly (for example, by separating it from the promotional material). In addition, a consumer may not be required to surrender the receipt or that portion containing the required disclosures in order to take advantage of a promotion.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Transfer not completed.</E> The receipt requirement does not apply to a transfer that is initiated but not completed (for example, if the ATM is out of currency or the consumer decides not to complete the transfer).</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Receipts not furnished due to inadvertent error.</E> If a receipt is not provided to the consumer because of a bona fide unintentional error, such as when a terminal runs out of paper or the mechanism jams, no violation results if the financial institution maintains procedures reasonably adapted to avoid such occurrences.</P>
            <P>6. <E T="03">Multiple transfers.</E> If the consumer makes multiple transfers at the same time, the financial institution may document them on a single or on separate receipts.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 9(a)(1)—Amount</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Disclosure of transaction fee.</E> The required display of a fee amount on or at the terminal <PRTPAGE P="147"/>may be accomplished by displaying the fee on a sign at the terminal or on the terminal screen for a reasonable duration. Displaying the fee on a screen provides adequate notice, as long as a consumer is given the option to cancel the transaction after receiving notice of a fee. (See § 205.16 for the notice requirements applicable to ATM operators that impose a fee for providing EFT services.)</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Relationship between § 205.9(a)(1) and § 205.16.</E> The requirements of §§ 205.9(a)(1) and 205.16 are similar but not identical.</P>
            <P>i. Section 205.9(a)(1) requires that if the amount of the transfer as shown on the receipt will include the fee, then the fee must be disclosed either on a sign on or at the terminal, or on the terminal screen. Section 205.16 requires disclosure both on a sign on or at the terminal (in a prominent and conspicuous location) and on the terminal screen. Section 205.16 permits disclosure on a paper notice as an alternative to the on-screen disclosure.</P>
            <P>ii. The disclosure of the fee on the receipt under § 205.9(a)(1) cannot be used to comply with the alternative paper disclosure procedure under § 205.16, if the receipt is provided at the completion of the transaction because, pursuant to the statute, the paper notice must be provided before the consumer is committed to paying the fee.</P>
            <P>iii. Section 205.9(a)(1) applies to any type of electronic terminal as defined in Regulation E (for example, to POS terminals as well as to ATMs), while § 205.16 applies only to ATMs.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 9(a)(2)—Date</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Calendar date.</E> The receipt must disclose the calendar date on which the consumer uses the electronic terminal. An accounting or business date may be disclosed in addition if the dates are clearly distinguished.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 9(a)(3)—Type</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Identifying transfer and account.</E> Examples identifying the type of transfer and the type of the consumer's account include “withdrawal from checking,” “transfer from savings to checking,” or “payment from savings.”</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Exception.</E> Identification of an account is not required when the consumer can access only one asset account at a particular time or terminal, even if the access device can normally be used to access more than one account. For example, the consumer may be able to access only one particular account at terminals not operated by the account-holding institution, or may be able to access only one particular account when the terminal is off-line. The exception is available even if, in addition to accessing one asset account, the consumer also can access a credit line.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Access to multiple accounts.</E> If the consumer can use an access device to make transfers to or from different accounts of the same type, the terminal receipt must specify which account was accessed, such as “withdrawal from checking I” or “withdrawal from checking II.” If only one account besides the primary checking account can be debited, the receipt can identify the account as “withdrawal from other account.”</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Generic descriptions.</E> Generic descriptions may be used for accounts that are similar in function, such as share draft or NOW accounts and checking accounts. In a shared system, for example, when a credit union member initiates transfers to or from a share draft account at a terminal owned or operated by a bank, the receipt may identify a withdrawal from the account as a “withdrawal from checking.”</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Point-of-sale transactions.</E> There is no prescribed terminology for identifying a transfer at a merchant's POS terminal. A transfer may be identified, for example, as a purchase, a sale of goods or services, or a payment to a third party. When a consumer obtains cash from a POS terminal in addition to purchasing goods, or obtains cash only, the documentation need not differentiate the transaction from one involving the purchase of goods.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 9(a)(5)—Terminal Location</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Options for identifying terminal.</E> The institution may provide either:</P>
            <P>i. The city, state or foreign country, and the information in §§ 205.9(a)(5) (i), (ii), or (iii), or</P>
            <P>ii. A number or a code identifying the terminal. If the institution chooses the second option, the code or terminal number identifying the terminal where the transfer is initiated may be given as part of a transaction code.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Omission of city name.</E> The city may be omitted if the generally accepted name (such as a branch name) contains the city name.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Omission of a state.</E> A state may be omitted from the location information on the receipt if:</P>
            <P>i. All the terminals owned or operated by the financial institution providing the statement (or by the system in which it participates) are located in that state, or</P>
            <P>ii. All transfers occur at terminals located within 50 miles of the financial institutions's main office.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Omission of a city and state.</E> A city and state may be omitted if all the terminals owned or operated by the financial institution providing the statement (or by the system in which it participates) are located in the same city.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 9(a)(5)(i)</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Street address.</E> The address should include number and street (or intersection); the <PRTPAGE P="148"/>number (or intersecting street) may be omitted if the street alone uniquely identifies the terminal location.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 9(a)(5)(ii)</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Generally accepted name.</E> Examples of a generally accepted name for a specific location include a branch of the financial institution, a shopping center, or an airport.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 9(a)(5)(iii)</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Name of owner or operator of terminal.</E> Examples of an owner or operator of a terminal are a financial institution or a retail merchant.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 9(a)(6)—Third Party Transfer</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Omission of third-party name.</E> The receipt need not disclose the third-party name if the name is provided by the consumer in a form that is not machine readable (for example, if the consumer indicates the payee by depositing a payment stub into the ATM). If, on the other hand, the consumer keys in the identity of the payee, the receipt must identify the payee by name or by using a code that is explained elsewhere on the receipt.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Receipt as proof of payment.</E> Documentation required under the regulation constitutes prima facie proof of a payment to another person, except in the case of a terminal receipt documenting a deposit.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">9(b) Periodic Statements</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Periodic cycles.</E> Periodic statements may be sent on a cycle that is shorter than monthly. The statements must correspond to periodic cycles that are reasonably equal, that is, do not vary by more than four days from the regular cycle. The requirement of reasonably equal cycles does not apply when an institution changes cycles for operational or other reasons, such as to establish a new statement day or date.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Interim statements.</E> Generally, a financial institution must provide periodic statements for each monthly cycle in which an EFT occurs, and at least quarterly if a transfer has not occurred. Where EFTs occur between regularly-scheduled cycles, interim statements must be provided. For example, if an institution issues quarterly statements at the end of March, June, September and December, and the consumer initiates an EFT in February, an interim statement for February must be provided. If an interim statement contains interest or rate information, the institution must comply with Regulation DD, 12 CFR 230.6.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Inactive accounts.</E> A financial institution need not send statements to consumers whose accounts are inactive as defined by the institution.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Statement pickup.</E> A financial institution may permit, but may not require, consumers to pick up their periodic statements at the financial institution.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Periodic statements limited to EFT activity.</E> A financial institution that uses a passbook as the primary means for displaying account activity, but also allows the account to be debited electronically, may provide a periodic statement requirement that reflects only the EFTs and other required disclosures (such as charges, account balances, and address and telephone number for inquiries). (See § 205.9(c)(1)(i) for the exception applicable to preauthorized transfers for passbook accounts.)</P>
            <P>6. <E T="03">Codes and accompanying documents.</E> To meet the documentation requirements for periodic statements, a financial institution may:</P>
            <P>i. Include copies of terminal receipts to reflect transfers initiated by the consumer at electronic terminals;</P>
            <P>ii. Enclose posting memos, deposit slips, and other documents that, together with the statement, disclose all the required information;</P>
            <P>iii. Use codes for names of third parties or terminal locations and explain the information to which the codes relate on an accompanying document.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 9(b)(1)—Transaction Information</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Information obtained from others.</E> While financial institutions must maintain reasonable procedures to ensure the integrity of data obtained from another institution, a merchant, or other third parties, verification of each transfer that appears on the periodic statement is not required.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 9(b)(1)(i)</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Incorrect deposit amount.</E> If a financial institution determines that the amount actually deposited at an ATM is different from the amount entered by the consumer, the institution need not immediately notify the consumer of the discrepancy. The periodic statement reflecting the deposit may show either the correct amount of the deposit or the amount entered by the consumer along with the institution's adjustment.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 9(b)(1)(iii)</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Type of transfer.</E> There is no prescribed terminology for describing a type of transfer. Placement of the amount of the transfer in the debit or the credit column is sufficient if other information on the statement, such as a terminal location or third-party name, enables the consumer to identify the type of transfer.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 9(b)(1)(iv)</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Nonproprietary terminal in network.</E> An institution need not reflect on the periodic statement the street addresses, identification codes, or terminal numbers for transfers <PRTPAGE P="149"/>initiated in a shared or interchange system at a terminal operated by an institution other than the account-holding institution. The statement must, however, specify the entity that owns or operates the terminal, plus the city and state.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 9(b)(1)(v)</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Recurring payments by government agency.</E> The third-party name for recurring payments from federal, state, or local governments need not list the particular agency. For example, “U.S. gov't” or “N.Y. sal” will suffice.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Consumer as third-party payee.</E> If a consumer makes an electronic fund transfer to another consumer, the financial institution must identify the recipient by name (not just by an account number, for example).</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Terminal location/third party.</E> A single entry may be used to identify both the terminal location and the name of the third party to or from whom funds are transferred. For example, if a consumer purchases goods from a merchant, the name of the party to whom funds are transferred (the merchant) and the location of the terminal where the transfer is initiated will be satisfied by a disclosure such as “XYZ Store, Anytown, Ohio.”</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Account-holding institution as third party.</E> Transfers to the account-holding institution (by ATM, for example) must show the institution as the recipient, unless other information on the statement (such as, “loan payment from checking”) clearly indicates that the payment was to the account-holding institution.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Consistency in third-party identity.</E> The periodic statement must disclose a third-party name as it appeared on the receipt, whether it was, for example, the “dba” (doing business as) name of the third party or the parent corporation's name.</P>
            <P>6. <E T="03">Third-party identity on deposits at electronic terminal.</E> A financial institution need not identify third parties whose names appear on checks, drafts, or similar paper instruments deposited to the consumer's account at an electronic terminal.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 9(b)(3)—Fees</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Disclosure of fees.</E> The fees disclosed may include fees for EFTs and for other nonelectronic services, and both fixed fees and per-item fees; they may be given as a total or may be itemized in part or in full.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Fees in interchange system.</E> An account-holding institution must disclose any fees it imposes on the consumer for EFTs, including fees for ATM transactions in an interchange or shared ATM system. Fees for use of an ATM imposed on the consumer by an institution other than the account-holding institution and included in the amount of the transfer by the terminal-operating institution need not be separately disclosed on the periodic statement.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Finance charges.</E> The requirement to disclose any fees assessed against the account does not include a finance charge imposed on the account during the statement period.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 9(b)(4)—Account Balances</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Opening and closing balances.</E> The opening and closing balances must reflect both EFTs and other account activity.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 9(b)(5)—Address and Telephone Number for Inquiries</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Telephone number.</E> A single telephone number, preceded by the “direct inquiries to” language, will satisfy the requirements of § 205.9(b)(5) and (6).</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">9(c) Exceptions to the Periodic Statement Requirements for Certain Accounts</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Transfers between accounts.</E> The regulation provides an exception from the periodic statement requirement for certain intra-institutional transfers between a consumer's accounts. The financial institution must still comply with the applicable periodic statement requirements for any other EFTs to or from the account. For example, a Regulation E statement must be provided quarterly for an account that also receives payroll deposits electronically, or for any month in which an account is also accessed by a withdrawal at an ATM.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 9(c)(1)—Preauthorized Transfers to Accounts</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Accounts that may be accessed only by preauthorized transfers to the account.</E> The exception for “accounts that may be accessed only by preauthorized transfers to the account” includes accounts that can be accessed by means other than EFTs, such as checks. If, however, an account may be accessed by any EFT other than preauthorized credits to the account, such as preauthorized debits or ATM transactions, the account does not qualify for the exception.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Reversal of direct deposits.</E> For direct-deposit-only accounts, a financial institution must send a periodic statement at least quarterly. A reversal of a direct deposit to correct an error does not trigger the monthly statement requirement when the error represented a credit to the wrong consumer's account, a duplicate credit, or a credit in the wrong amount.

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">9(d) Documentation for Foreign-Initiated Transfers</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Foreign-initiated transfers.</E> An institution must make a good faith effort to provide all required information for foreign-initiated transfers. For example, even if the institution is not able to provide a specific terminal location, it should identify the country and city in which the transfer was initiated.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Section 205.10—Preauthorized Transfers</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">10(a) Preauthorized Transfers to Consumer's Account</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 10(a)(1)—Notice by Financial Institution</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Content.</E> No specific language is required for notice regarding receipt of a preauthorized transfer. Identifying the deposit is sufficient; however, simply providing the current account balance is not.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Notice of credit.</E> A financial institution may use different methods of notice for various types or series of preauthorized transfers, and the institution need not offer consumers a choice of notice methods.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Positive notice.</E> A periodic statement sent within two business days of the scheduled transfer, showing the transfer, can serve as notice of receipt.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Negative notice.</E> The absence of a deposit entry (on a periodic statement sent within two business days of the scheduled transfer date) will serve as negative notice.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Telephone notice.</E> If a financial institution uses the telephone notice option, it should be able in most instances to verify during a consumer's initial call whether a transfer was received. The institution must respond within two business days to any inquiry not answered immediately.</P>
            <P>6. <E T="03">Phone number for passbook accounts.</E> The financial institution may use any reasonable means necessary to provide the telephone number to consumers with passbook accounts that can only be accessed by preauthorized credits and that do not receive periodic statements. For example, it may print the telephone number in the passbook, or include the number with the annual error resolution notice.</P>
            <P>7. <E T="03">Telephone line availability.</E> To satisfy the readily-available standard, the financial institution must provide enough telephone lines so that consumers get a reasonably prompt response. The institution need only provide telephone service during normal business hours. Within its primary service area, an institution must provide a local or toll-free telephone number. It need not provide a toll-free number or accept collect long-distance calls from outside the area where it normally conducts business.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">10(b) Written Authorization for Preauthorized Transfers From Consumer's Account</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Preexisting authorizations.</E> The financial institution need not require a new authorization before changing from paper-based to electronic debiting when the existing authorization does not specify that debiting is to occur electronically or specifies that the debiting will occur by paper means. A new authorization also is not required when a successor institution begins collecting payments.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Authorization obtained by third party.</E> The account-holding financial institution does not violate the regulation when a third-party payee fails to obtain the authorization in writing or fails to give a copy to the consumer; rather, it is the third-party payee that is in violation of the regulation.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Written authorization for preauthorized transfers.</E> The requirement that preauthorized EFTs be authorized by the consumer “only by a writing” cannot be met by a payee's signing a written authorization on the consumer's behalf with only an oral authorization from the consumer.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Use of a confirmation form.</E> A financial institution or designated payee may comply with the requirements of this section in various ways. For example, a payee may provide the consumer with two copies of a preauthorization form, and ask the consumer to sign and return one and to retain the second copy.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Similarly authenticated.</E> The similarly authenticated standard permits signed, written authorizations to be provided electronically. The writing and signature requirements of this section are satisfied by complying with the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, 15 U.S.C. 7001 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> which defines electronic records and electronic signatures. Examples of electronic signatures include, but are not limited to, digital signatures and security codes. A security code need not originate with the account-holding institution. The authorization process should evidence the consumer's identity and assent to the authorization. The person that obtains the authorization must provide a copy of the terms of the authorization to the consumer either electronically or in paper form. Only the consumer may authorize the transfer and not, for example, a third-party merchant on behalf of the consumer.</P>
            <P>6. <E T="03">Requirements of an authorization.</E> An authorization is valid if it is readily identifiable as such and the terms of the preauthorized transfer are clear and readily understandable.</P>
            <P>7. <E T="03">Bona fide error.</E> Consumers sometimes authorize third-party payees, by telephone or on-line, to submit recurring charges against a credit card account. If the consumer indicates use of a credit card account <PRTPAGE P="151"/>when in fact a debit card is being used, the payee does not violate the requirement to obtain a written authorization if the failure to obtain written authorization was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error, and if the payee maintains procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error. Procedures reasonably adapted to avoid error will depend upon the circumstances. Generally, requesting the consumer to specify whether the card to be used for the authorization is a debit (or check) card or a credit card is a reasonable procedure. Where the consumer has indicated that the card is a credit card (or that the card is not a debit or check card), the payee may rely on the consumer's statement without seeking further information about the type of card. If the payee believes, at the time of the authorization, that a credit card is involved, and later finds that the card used is a debit card (for example, because the consumer later brings the matter to the payee's attention), the payee must obtain a written and signed or (where appropriate) a similarly authenticated authorization as soon as reasonably possible, or cease debiting the consumer's account.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">10(c) Consumer's Right To Stop Payment</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Stop-payment order.</E> The financial institution must honor an oral stop-payment order made at least three business days before a scheduled debit. If the debit item is resubmitted, the institution must continue to honor the stop-payment order (for example, by suspending all subsequent payments to the payee-originator until the consumer notifies the institution that payments should resume).</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Revocation of authorization.</E> Once a financial institution has been notified that the consumer's authorization is no longer valid, it must block all future payments for the particular debit transmitted by the designated payee-originator. (However, see comment 10(c)-3.) The institution may not wait for the payee-originator to terminate the automatic debits. The institution may confirm that the consumer has informed the payee-originator of the revocation (for example, by requiring a copy of the consumer's revocation as written confirmation to be provided within 14 days of an oral notification). If the institution does not receive the required written confirmation within the 14-day period, it may honor subsequent debits to the account.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Alternative procedure for processing a stop-payment request.</E> If an institution does not have the capability to block a preauthorized debit from being posted to the consumer's account—as in the case of a preauthorized debit made through a debit card network or other system, for example—the institution may instead comply with the stop-payment requirements by using a third party to block the transfer(s), as long as the consumer's account is not debited for the payment.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">10(d) Notice of Transfers Varying in Amount</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 10(d)(1)—Notice</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Preexisting authorizations.</E> A financial institution holding the consumer's account does not violate the regulation if the designated payee fails to provide notice of varying amounts.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 10(d)(2)—Range</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Range.</E> A financial institution or designated payee that elects to offer the consumer a specified range of amounts for debiting (in lieu of providing the notice of transfers varying in amount) must provide an acceptable range that could be anticipated by the consumer. For example, if the transfer is for payment of a gas bill, an appropriate range might be based on the highest bill in winter and the lowest bill in summer.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Transfers to an account of the consumer held at another institution.</E> A financial institution need not provide a consumer the option of receiving notice with each varying transfer, and may instead provide notice only when a debit to an account of the consumer falls outside a specified range or differs by more than a specified amount from the most recent transfer, if the funds are transferred and credited to an account of the consumer held at another financial institution. The specified range or amount, however, must be one that reasonably could be anticipated by the consumer, and the institution must notify the consumer of the range or amount at the time the consumer provides authorization for the preauthorized transfers. For example, if the transfer is for payment of interest for a fixed-rate certificate of deposit account, an appropriate range might be based on a month containing 28 days and a month containing 31 days.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 10(e)(1)—Credit</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Loan payments.</E> Creditors may not require repayment of loans by electronic means on a preauthorized, recurring basis. A creditor may offer a program with a reduced annual percentage rate or other cost-related incentive for an automatic repayment feature, provided the program with the automatic payment feature is not the only loan program offered by the creditor for the type of credit involved. Examples include:</P>
            <P>i. Mortgages with graduated payments in which a pledged savings account is automatically debited during an initial period to supplement the monthly payments made by the borrower.</P>

            <P>ii. Mortgage plans calling for preauthorized biweekly payments that are <PRTPAGE P="152"/>debited electronically to the consumer's account and produce a lower total finance charge.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Overdraft.</E> A financial institution may require the automatic repayment of an overdraft credit plan even if the overdraft extension is charged to an open-end account that may be accessed by the consumer in ways other than by overdrafts.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 10(e)(2)—Employment or Government Benefit</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Payroll.</E> An employer (including a financial institution) may not require its employees to receive their salary by direct deposit to any particular institution. An employer may require direct deposit of salary by electronic means if employees are allowed to choose the institution that will receive the direct deposit. Alternatively, an employer may give employees the choice of having their salary deposited at a particular institution (designated by the employer) or receiving their salary by another means, such as by check or cash.</P>

            <P>1. <E T="03">Terminal location.</E> With regard to deposits at an ATM, a consumer's request for the terminal location or other information triggers the error resolution procedures, but the financial institution need only provide the ATM location if it has captured that information.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Verifying an account debit or credit.</E> If the consumer contacts the financial institution to ascertain whether a payment (for example, in a home-banking or bill-payment program) or any other type of EFT was debited to the account, or whether a deposit made via ATM, preauthorized transfer, or any other type of EFT was credited to the account, without asserting an error, the error resolution procedures do not apply.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Loss or theft of access device.</E> A financial institution is required to comply with the error resolution procedures when a consumer reports the loss or theft of an access device if the consumer also alleges possible unauthorized use as a consequence of the loss or theft.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Error asserted after account closed.</E> The financial institution must comply with the error resolution procedures when a consumer properly asserts an error, even if the account has been closed.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Request for documentation or information.</E> A request for documentation or other information must be treated as an error unless it is clear that the consumer is requesting a duplicate copy for tax or other record-keeping purposes.</P>
            <P>6. <E T="03">Terminal receipts for transfers of $15 or less.</E> The fact that an institution does not make a terminal receipt available for a transfer of $15 or less in accordance with § 205.9(e) is not an error for purposes of §§ 205.11(a)(1)(vi) or (vii).</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 11(b)(1)—Timing; Contents</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Content of error notice.</E> The notice of error is effective even if it does not contain the consumer's account number, so long as the financial institution is able to identify the account in question. For example, the consumer could provide a Social Security number or other unique means of identification.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Investigation pending receipt of information.</E> While a financial institution may request a written, signed statement from the consumer relating to a notice of error, it may not delay initiating or completing an investigation pending receipt of the statement.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Statement held for consumer.</E> When a consumer has arranged for periodic statements to be held until picked up, the statement for a particular cycle is deemed to have been transmitted on the date the financial institution first makes the statement available to the consumer.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Failure to provide statement.</E> When a financial institution fails to provide the consumer with a periodic statement, a request for a copy is governed by this section if the consumer gives notice within 60 days from the date on which the statement should have been transmitted.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Discovery of error by institution.</E> The error resolution procedures of this section apply when a notice of error is received from the consumer, and not when the financial institution itself discovers and corrects an error.</P>
            <P>6. <E T="03">Notice at particular phone number or address.</E> A financial institution may require the consumer to give notice only at the telephone number or address disclosed by the institution, provided the institution maintains reasonable procedures to refer the consumer to the specified telephone number or address if the consumer attempts to give notice to the institution in a different manner.</P>
            <P>7. <E T="03">Effect of late notice.</E> An institution is not required to comply with the requirements of this section for any notice of error from the consumer that is received by the institution later than 60 days from the date on which the periodic statement first reflecting the error is sent. Where the consumer's assertion of error involves an unauthorized EFT, however, the institution must comply with § 205.6 before it may impose any liability on the consumer.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 11(b)(2)—Written Confirmation</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Written confirmation-of-error notice.</E> If the consumer sends a written confirmation of <PRTPAGE P="153"/>error to the wrong address, the financial institution must process the confirmation through normal procedures. But the institution need not provisionally credit the consumer's account if the written confirmation is delayed beyond 10 business days in getting to the right place because it was sent to the wrong address.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">11(c) Time Limits and Extent of Investigation</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Notice to consumer.</E> Unless otherwise indicated in this section, the financial institution may provide the required notices to the consumer either orally or in writing.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Written confirmation of oral notice.</E> A financial institution must begin its investigation promptly upon receipt of an oral notice. It may not delay until it has received a written confirmation.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Charges for error resolution.</E> If a billing error occurred, whether as alleged or in a different amount or manner, the financial institution may not impose a charge related to any aspect of the error-resolution process (including charges for documentation or investigation). Since the act grants the consumer error-resolution rights, the institution should avoid any chilling effect on the good-faith assertion of errors that might result if charges are assessed when no billing error has occurred.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Correction without investigation.</E> A financial institution may make, without investigation, a final correction to a consumer's account in the amount or manner alleged by the consumer to be in error, but must comply with all other applicable requirements of § 205.11.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Correction notice.</E> A financial institution may include the notice of correction on a periodic statement that is mailed or delivered within the 10-business-day or 45-calendar-day time limits and that clearly identifies the correction to the consumer's account. The institution must determine whether such a mailing will be prompt enough to satisfy the requirements of this section, taking into account the specific facts involved.</P>
            <P>6. <E T="03">Correction of an error.</E> If the financial institution determines an error occurred, within either the 10-day or 45-day period, it must correct the error (subject to the liability provisions of §§ 205.6 (a) and (b)) including, where applicable, the crediting of interest and the refunding of any fees imposed by the institution. In a combined credit/EFT transaction, for example, the institution must refund any finance charges incurred as a result of the error. The institution need not refund fees that would have been imposed whether or not the error occurred.</P>
            <P>7. <E T="03">Extent of required investigation.</E> A financial institution complies with its duty to investigate, correct, and report its determination regarding an error described in § 205.11(a)(1)(vii) by transmitting the requested information, clarification, or documentation within the time limits set forth in § 205.11(c). If the institution has provisionally credited the consumer's account in accordance with § 205.11(c)(2), it may debit the amount upon transmitting the requested information, clarification, or documentation.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 11(c)(2)(i)</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Compliance with all requirements.</E> Financial institutions exempted from provisionally crediting a consumer's account under § 205.11(c)(2)(i) (A) and (B) must still comply with all other requirements of § 205.11.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 11(c)(3)—Extension of Time Periods</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">POS debit card transactions.</E> The extended deadlines for investigating errors resulting from POS debit card transactions apply to all debit card transactions, including those for cash only, at merchants' POS terminals, and also including mail and telephone orders. The deadlines do not apply to transactions at an ATM, however, even though the ATM may be in a merchant location.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 11(c)(4)—Investigation</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Third parties.</E> When information or documentation requested by the consumer is in the possession of a third party with whom the financial institution does not have an agreement, the institution satisfies the error resolution requirement by so advising the consumer within the specified time period.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Scope of investigation.</E> When an alleged error involves a payment to a third party under the financial institution's telephone bill-payment plan, a review of the institution's own records is sufficient, assuming no agreement exists between the institution and the third party concerning the bill-payment service.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">POS transfers.</E> When a consumer alleges an error involving a transfer to a merchant via a POS terminal, the institution must verify the information previously transmitted when executing the transfer. For example, the financial institution may request a copy of the sales receipt to verify that the amount of the transfer correctly corresponds to the amount of the consumer's purchase.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Agreement.</E> An agreement that a third party will honor an access device is an agreement for purposes of this paragraph. A financial institution does not have an agreement for purposes of § 205.11(c)(4)(ii) solely because it participates in transactions that occur under the federal recurring payments programs, or that are cleared through an ACH or similar arrangement for the clearing and settlement of fund transfers generally, or because it agrees to be bound by the rules of such an arrangement.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">No EFT agreement.</E> When there is no agreement between the institution and the <PRTPAGE P="154"/>third party for the type of EFT involved, the financial institution must review any relevant information within the institution's own records for the particular account to resolve the consumer's claim. The extent of the investigation required may vary depending on the facts and circumstances. However, a financial institution may not limit its investigation solely to the payment instructions where additional information within its own records pertaining to the particular account in question could help to resolve a consumer's claim.</P>
            <P>Information that may be reviewed as part of an investigation might include:</P>
            <P>i. The ACH transaction records for the transfer;</P>
            <P>ii. The transaction history of the particular account for a reasonable period of time immediately preceding the allegation of error;</P>
            <P>iii. Whether the check number of the transaction in question is notably out-of-sequence;</P>
            <P>iv. The location of either the transaction or the payee in question relative to the consumer's place of residence and habitual transaction area;</P>
            <P>v. Information relative to the account in question within the control of the institution's third-party service providers if the financial institution reasonably believes that it may have records or other information that could be dispositive; or</P>
            <P>vi. Any other information appropriate to resolve the claim.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">11(d) Procedures if Financial Institution Determines No Error or Different Error Occurred</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Error different from that alleged.</E> When a financial institution determines that an error occurred in a manner or amount different from that described by the consumer, it must comply with the requirements of both § 205.11 (c) and (d), as relevant. The institution may give the notice of correction and the explanation separately or in a combined form.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 11(d)(1)—Written Explanation</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Request for documentation.</E> When a consumer requests copies of documents, the financial institution must provide the copies in an understandable form. If an institution relied on magnetic tape it must convert the applicable data into readable form, for example, by printing it and explaining any codes.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 11(d)(2)—Debiting Provisional Credit</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Alternative procedure for debiting of credited funds.</E> The financial institution may comply with the requirements of this section by notifying the consumer that the consumer's account will be debited five business days from the transmittal of the notification, specifying the calendar date on which the debiting will occur.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Fees for overdrafts.</E> The financial institution may not impose fees for items it is required to honor under § 205.11. It may, however, impose any normal transaction or item fee that is unrelated to an overdraft resulting from the debiting. If the account is still overdrawn after five business days, the institution may impose the fees or finance charges to which it is entitled, if any, under an overdraft credit plan.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">11(e) Reassertion of Error</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Withdrawal of error; right to reassert.</E> The financial institution has no further error resolution responsibilities if the consumer voluntarily withdraws the notice alleging an error. A consumer who has withdrawn an allegation of error has the right to reassert the allegation unless the financial institution had already complied with all of the error resolution requirements before the allegation was withdrawn. The consumer must do so, however, within the original 60-day period.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Section 205.12—Relation to Other Laws</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">12(a) Relation to Truth in Lending</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Determining applicable regulation.</E> i. For transactions involving access devices that also function as credit cards, whether Regulation E or Regulation Z (12 CFR part 226) applies depends on the nature of the transaction. For example, if the transaction solely involves an extension of credit, and does not include a debit to a checking account (or other consumer asset account), the liability limitations and error resolution requirements of Regulation Z apply. If the transaction debits a checking account only (with no credit extended), the provisions of Regulation E apply. If the transaction debits a checking account but also draws on an overdraft line of credit attached to the account, Regulation E's liability limitations apply, in addition to §§ 226.13 (d) and (g) of Regulation Z (which apply because of the extension of credit associated with the overdraft feature on the checking account). If a consumer's access device is also a credit card and the device is used to make unauthorized withdrawals from a checking account, but also is used to obtain unauthorized cash advances directly from a line of credit that is separate from the checking account, both Regulation E and Regulation Z apply.</P>
            <P>ii. The following examples illustrate these principles:</P>

            <P>A. A consumer has a card that can be used either as a credit card or a debit card. When used as a debit card, the card draws on the consumer's checking account. When used as a credit card, the card draws only on a separate line of credit. If the card is stolen and used as a credit card to make purchases or to <PRTPAGE P="155"/>get cash advances at an ATM from the line of credit, the liability limits and error resolution provisions of Regulation Z apply; Regulation E does not apply.</P>
            <P>B. In the same situation, if the card is stolen and is used as a debit card to make purchases or to get cash withdrawals at an ATM from the checking account, the liability limits and error resolution provisions of Regulation E apply; Regulation Z does not apply.</P>
            <P>C. In the same situation, assume the card is stolen and used both as a debit card and as a credit card; for example, the thief makes some purchases using the card as a debit card, and other purchases using the card as a credit card. Here, the liability limits and error resolution provisions of Regulation E apply to the unauthorized transactions in which the card was used as a debit card, and the corresponding provisions of Regulation Z apply to the unauthorized transactions in which the card was used as a credit card.</P>
            <P>D. Assume a somewhat different type of card, one that draws on the consumer's checking account and can also draw on an overdraft line of credit attached to the checking account. There is no separate line of credit, only the overdraft line, associated with the card. In this situation, if the card is stolen and used, the liability limits and the error resolution provisions of Regulation E apply. In addition, if the use of the card has resulted in accessing the overdraft line of credit, the error resolution provisions of § 226.13(d) and (g) of Regulation Z also apply, but not the other error resolution provisions of Regulation Z.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Issuance rules.</E> For access devices that also constitute credit cards, the issuance rules of Regulation E apply if the only credit feature is a preexisting credit line attached to the asset account to cover overdrafts (or to maintain a specified minimum balance) or an overdraft service, as defined in § 205.17(a). Regulation Z (12 CFR part 226) rules apply if there is another type of credit feature; for example, one permitting direct extensions of credit that do not involve the asset account.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Overdraft service.</E> The addition of an overdraft service, as that term is defined in § 205.17(a), to an accepted access device does not constitute the addition of a credit feature subject to Regulation Z. Instead, the provisions of Regulation E apply, including the liability limitations (§ 205.6) and the requirement to obtain consumer consent to the service before any fees or charges for paying an overdraft may be assessed on the account (§ 205.17).</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">12(b) Preemption of Inconsistent State Laws</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Specific determinations.</E> The regulation prescribes standards for determining whether state laws that govern EFTs, and state laws regarding gift certificates, store gift cards, or general-use prepaid cards that govern dormancy, inactivity, or service fees, or expiration dates, are preempted by the act and the regulation. A state law that is inconsistent may be preempted even if the Board has not issued a determination. However, nothing in § 205.12(b) provides a financial institution with immunity for violations of state law if the institution chooses not to make state disclosures and the Board later determines that the state law is not preempted.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Preemption determination.</E> The Board determined that certain provisions in the state law of Michigan are preempted by the federal law, effective March 30, 1981:</P>
            <P>i. Definition of unauthorized use. Section 5(4) is preempted to the extent that it relates to the section of state law governing consumer liability for unauthorized use of an access device.</P>
            <P>ii. Consumer liability for unauthorized use of an account. Section 14 is inconsistent with § 205.6 and is less protective of the consumer than the federal law. The state law places liability on the consumer for the unauthorized use of an account in cases involving the consumer's negligence. Under the federal law, a consumer's liability for unauthorized use is not related to the consumer's negligence and depends instead on the consumer's promptness in reporting the loss or theft of the access device.</P>
            <P>iii. Error resolution. Section 15 is preempted because it is inconsistent with § 205.11 and is less protective of the consumer than the federal law. The state law allows financial institutions up to 70 days to resolve errors, whereas the federal law generally requires errors to be resolved within 45 days.</P>
            <P>iv. Receipts and periodic statements. Sections 17 and 18 are preempted because they are inconsistent with § 205.9. The state provisions require a different disclosure of information than does the federal law. The receipt provision is also preempted because it allows the consumer to be charged for receiving a receipt if a machine cannot furnish one at the time of a transfer.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">13(b) Record Retention</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Requirements.</E> A financial institution need not retain records that it has given disclosures and documentation to each consumer; it need only retain evidence demonstrating that its procedures reasonably ensure the consumers' receipt of required disclosures and documentation.<PRTPAGE P="156"/>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">14(a) Electronic Fund Transfer Service Providers Subject to Regulation</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Applicability.</E> This section applies only when a service provider issues an access device to a consumer for initiating transfers to or from the consumer's account at a financial institution and the two entities have no agreement regarding this EFT service. If the service provider does not issue an access device to the consumer for accessing an account held by another institution, it does not qualify for the treatment accorded by § 205.14. For example, this section does not apply to an institution that initiates preauthorized payroll deposits to consumer accounts on behalf of an employer. By contrast, § 205.14 can apply to an institution that issues a code for initiating telephone transfers to be carried out through the ACH from a consumer's account at another institution. This is the case even if the consumer has accounts at both institutions.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">ACH agreements.</E> The ACH rules generally do not constitute an agreement for purposes of this section. However, an ACH agreement under which members specifically agree to honor each other's debit cards is an “agreement,” and thus this section does not apply.</P>

            </P>
            <P>i. <E T="03">Account-holding institutions.</E> Section 205.17(b) applies to ATM and one-time debit card transactions made with a debit card issued by or on behalf of the account-holding institution. Section 205.17(b) does not apply to ATM and one-time debit card transactions made with a debit card issued by or through a third party unless the debit card is issued on behalf of the account-holding institution.</P>
            <P>ii. <E T="03">Coding of transactions.</E> A financial institution complies with the rule if it adapts its systems to identify debit card transactions as either one-time or recurring. If it does so, the financial institution may rely on the transaction's coding by merchants, other institutions, and other third parties as a one-time or a preauthorized or recurring debit card transaction.<PRTPAGE P="157"/>
            </P>
            <P>iii. <E T="03">One-time debit card transactions.</E> The opt-in applies to any one-time debit card transaction, whether the card is used, for example, at a point-of-sale, in an on-line transaction, or in a telephone transaction.</P>
            <P>iv. <E T="03">Application of fee prohibition.</E> The prohibition on assessing overdraft fees under § 205.17(b)(1) applies to all institutions. For example, the prohibition applies to an institution that has a policy and practice of declining to authorize and pay any ATM or one-time debit card transactions when the institution has a reasonable belief at the time of the authorization request that the consumer does not have sufficient funds available to cover the transaction. However, the institution is not required to comply with §§ 205.17(b)(1)(i)-(iv), including the notice and opt-in requirements, if it does not assess overdraft fees for paying ATM or one-time debit card transactions that overdraw the consumer's account. Assume an institution does not provide an opt-in notice, but authorizes an ATM or one-time debit card transaction on the reasonable belief that the consumer has sufficient funds in the account to cover the transaction. If, at settlement, the consumer has insufficient funds in the account (for example, due to intervening transactions that post to the consumer's account), the institution is not permitted to assess an overdraft fee or charge for paying that transaction.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">No affirmative consent.</E> A financial institution may pay overdrafts for ATM and one-time debit card transactions even if a consumer has not affirmatively consented or opted in to the institution's overdraft service. If the institution pays such an overdraft without the consumer's affirmative consent, however, it may not impose a fee or charge for doing so. These provisions do not limit the institution's ability to debit the consumer's account for the amount overdrawn if the institution is permitted to do so under applicable law.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Overdraft transactions not required to be authorized or paid.</E> Section 205.17 does not require a financial institution to authorize or pay an overdraft on an ATM or one-time debit card transaction even if the consumer has affirmatively consented to an institution's overdraft service for such transactions.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Reasonable opportunity to provide affirmative consent.</E> A financial institution provides a consumer with a reasonable opportunity to provide affirmative consent when, among other things, it provides reasonable methods by which the consumer may affirmatively consent. A financial institution provides such reasonable methods, if—</P>
            <P>i. <E T="03">By mail.</E> The institution provides a form for the consumer to fill out and mail to affirmatively consent to the service.</P>
            <P>ii. <E T="03">By telephone.</E> The institution provides a readily-available telephone line that consumers may call to provide affirmative consent.</P>
            <P>iii. <E T="03">By electronic means.</E> The institution provides an electronic means for the consumer to affirmatively consent. For example, the institution could provide a form that can be accessed and processed at its Web site, where the consumer may click on a check box to provide consent and confirm that choice by clicking on a button that affirms the consumer's consent.</P>
            <P>iv. <E T="03">In person.</E> The institution provides a form for the consumer to complete and present at a branch or office to affirmatively consent to the service.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Implementing opt-in at account-opening.</E> A financial institution may provide notice regarding the institution's overdraft service prior to or at account-opening. A financial institution may require a consumer, as a necessary step to opening an account, to choose whether or not to opt into the payment of ATM or one-time debit card transactions pursuant to the institution's overdraft service. For example, the institution could require the consumer, at account opening, to sign a signature line or check a box on a form (consistent with comment 17(b)-6) indicating whether or not the consumer affirmatively consents at account opening. If the consumer does not check any box or provide a signature, the institution must assume that the consumer does not opt in. Or, the institution could require the consumer to choose between an account that does not permit the payment of ATM or one-time debit card transactions pursuant to the institution's overdraft service and an account that permits the payment of such overdrafts, provided that the accounts comply with § 205.17(b)(2) and § 205.17(b)(3).</P>
            <P>6. <E T="03">Affirmative consent required.</E> A consumer's affirmative consent, or opt-in, to a financial institution's overdraft service must be obtained separately from other consents or acknowledgements obtained by the institution, including a consent to receive disclosures electronically. An institution may obtain a consumer's affirmative consent by providing a blank signature line or check box that the consumer could sign or select to affirmatively consent, provided that the signature line or check box is used solely for purposes of evidencing the consumer's choice whether or not to opt into the overdraft service and not for other purposes. An institution does not obtain a consumer's affirmative consent by including preprinted language about the overdraft service in an account disclosure provided with a signature card or contract that the consumer must sign to open the account and that acknowledges the consumer's acceptance of the account terms. Nor does an institution obtain a consumer's affirmative consent by providing a signature card that contains a pre-selected check box indicating that the consumer is requesting the service.<PRTPAGE P="158"/>
            </P>
            <P>7. <E T="03">Confirmation.</E> A financial institution may comply with the requirement in § 205.17(b)(1)(iv) to provide confirmation of the consumer's affirmative consent by mailing or delivering to the consumer a copy of the consumer's completed opt-in notice, or by mailing or delivering a letter or notice to the consumer acknowledging that the consumer has elected to opt into the institution's service. The confirmation, which must be provided in writing, or electronically if the consumer agrees, must include a statement informing the consumer of the right to revoke the opt-in at any time. <E T="03">See</E> § 205.17(d)(6), which permits institutions to include the revocation statement on the initial opt-in notice. An institution complies with the confirmation requirement if it has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that overdraft fees are assessed only in connection with transactions paid after the confirmation has been mailed or delivered to the consumer.</P>
            <P>8. <E T="03">Outstanding Negative Balance.</E> If a fee or charge is based on the amount of the outstanding negative balance, an institution is prohibited from assessing any such fee if the negative balance is solely attributable to an ATM or one-time debit card transaction, unless the consumer has opted into the institution's overdraft service for ATM or one-time debit card transactions. However, the rule does not prohibit an institution from assessing such a fee if the negative balance is attributable in whole or in part to a check, ACH, or other type of transaction not subject to the prohibition on assessing overdraft fees in § 205.17(b)(1).</P>
            <P>9. <E T="03">Daily or Sustained Overdraft, Negative Balance, or Similar Fee or Charge</E>
            </P>
            <P>i. <E T="03">Daily or sustained overdraft, negative balance, or similar fees or charges.</E> If a consumer has not opted into the institution's overdraft service for ATM or one-time debit card transactions, the fee prohibition in § 205.17(b)(1) applies to all overdraft fees or charges for paying those transactions, including but not limited to daily or sustained overdraft, negative balance, or similar fees or charges. Thus, where a consumer's negative balance is solely attributable to an ATM or one-time debit card transaction, the rule prohibits the assessment of such fees unless the consumer has opted in. However, the rule does not prohibit an institution from assessing daily or sustained overdraft, negative balance, or similar fees or charges if a negative balance is attributable in whole or in part to a check, ACH, or other type of transaction not subject to the fee prohibition. When the negative balance is attributable in part to an ATM or one-time debit card transaction, and in part to a check, ACH, or other type of transaction not subject to the fee prohibition, the date on which such a fee may be assessed is based on the date on which the check, ACH, or other type of transaction is paid into overdraft.</P>
            <P>ii. <E T="03">Examples.</E> The following examples illustrate how an institution complies with the fee prohibition. For each example, assume the following: (a) The consumer has not opted into the payment of ATM or one-time debit card overdrafts; (b) these transactions are paid into overdraft because the amount of the transaction at settlement exceeded the amount authorized or the amount was not submitted for authorization; (c) under the account agreement, the institution may charge a per-item fee of $20 for each overdraft, and a one-time sustained overdraft fee of $20 on the fifth consecutive day the consumer's account remains overdrawn; (d) the institution posts ATM and debit card transactions before other transactions; and (e) the institution allocates deposits to account debits in the same order in which it posts debits.</P>
            <P>a. Assume that a consumer has a $50 account balance on March 1. That day, the institution posts a one-time debit card transaction of $60 and a check transaction of $40. The institution charges an overdraft fee of $20 for the check overdraft but cannot assess an overdraft fee for the debit card transaction. At the end of the day, the consumer has an account balance of negative $70. The consumer does not make any deposits to the account, and no other transactions occur between March 2 and March 6. Because the consumer's negative balance is attributable in part to the $40 check (and associated overdraft fee), the institution may charge a sustained overdraft fee on March 6 in connection with the check.</P>
            <P>b. Same facts as in a., except that on March 3, the consumer deposits $40 in the account. The institution allocates the $40 to the debit card transaction first, consistent with its posting order policy. At the end of the day on March 3, the consumer has an account balance of negative $30, which is attributable to the check transaction (and associated overdraft fee). The consumer does not make any further deposits to the account, and no other transactions occur between March 4 and March 6. Because the remaining negative balance is attributable to the March 1 check transaction, the institution may charge a sustained overdraft fee on March 6 in connection with the check.</P>

            <P>c. Assume that a consumer has a $50 account balance on March 1. That day, the institution posts a one-time debit card transaction of $60. At the end of that day, the consumer has an account balance of negative $10. The institution may not assess an overdraft fee for the debit card transaction. On March 3, the institution pays a check transaction of $100 and charges an overdraft fee of $20. At the end of that day, the consumer has <PRTPAGE P="159"/>an account balance of negative $130. The consumer does not make any deposits to the account, and no other transactions occur between March 4 and March 8. Because the consumer's negative balance is attributable in part to the check, the institution may assess a $20 sustained overdraft fee. However, because the check was paid on March 3, the institution must use March 3 as the start date for determining the date on which the sustained overdraft fee may be assessed. Thus, the institution may charge a $20 sustained overdraft fee on March 8.</P>
            <P>iii. <E T="03">Alternative approach.</E> For a consumer who does not opt into the institution's overdraft service for ATM and one-time debit card transactions, an institution may also comply with the fee prohibition in § 205.17(b)(1) by not assessing daily or sustained overdraft, negative balance, or similar fees or charges unless a consumer's negative balance is attributable solely to check, ACH or other types of transactions not subject to the fee prohibition while that negative balance remains outstanding. In such case, the institution would not have to determine how to allocate subsequent deposits that reduce but do not eliminate the negative balance. For example, if a consumer has a negative balance of $30, of which $10 is attributable to a one-time debit card transaction, an institution complies with the fee prohibition if it does not assess a sustained overdraft fee while that negative balance remains outstanding.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 17(b)(2)—Conditioning Payment of Other Overdrafts on Consumer's Affirmative Consent</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Application of the same criteria.</E> The prohibitions on conditioning in § 205.17(b)(2) generally require an institution to apply the same criteria for deciding when to pay overdrafts for checks, ACH transactions, and other types of transactions, whether or not the consumer has affirmatively consented to the institution's overdraft service with respect to ATM and one-time debit card overdrafts. For example, if an institution's internal criteria would lead the institution to pay a check overdraft if the consumer had affirmatively consented to the institution's overdraft service for ATM and one-time debit card transactions, it must also apply the same criteria in a consistent manner in determining whether to pay the check overdraft if the consumer has not opted in.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">No requirement to pay overdrafts on checks, ACH transactions, or other types of transactions.</E> The prohibition on conditioning in § 205.17(b)(2) does not require an institution to pay overdrafts on checks, ACH transactions, or other types of transactions in all circumstances. Rather, the rule simply prohibits institutions from considering the consumer's decision not to opt in when deciding whether to pay overdrafts for checks, ACH transactions, or other types of transactions.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 17(b)(3)—Same Account Terms, Conditions, and Features</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Variations in terms, conditions, or features.</E> A financial institution may not vary the terms, conditions, or features of an account provided to a consumer who does not affirmatively consent to the payment of ATM or one-time debit card transactions pursuant to the institution's overdraft service. This includes, but is not limited to:</P>
            <P>i. Interest rates paid and fees assessed;</P>
            <P>ii. The type of ATM or debit card provided to the consumer. For instance, an institution may not provide consumers who do not opt in a PIN-only card while providing a debit card with both PIN and signature-debit functionality to consumers who opt in;</P>
            <P>iii. Minimum balance requirements; or</P>
            <P>iv. Account features such as on-line bill payment services.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Limited-feature bank accounts.</E> Section 205.17(b)(3) does not prohibit institutions from offering deposit account products with limited features, provided that a consumer is not required to open such an account because the consumer did not opt in. For example, § 205.17(b)(3) does not prohibit an institution from offering a checking account designed to comply with state basic banking laws, or designed for consumers who are not eligible for a checking account because of their credit or checking account history, which may include features limiting the payment of overdrafts. However, a consumer who applies, and is otherwise eligible, for a full-service or other particular deposit account product may not be provided instead with the account with more limited features because the consumer has declined to opt in.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">17(c) Timing</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Early compliance.</E> A financial institution may provide the notice required by § 205(b)(1)(i) and obtain the consumer's affirmative consent to the financial institution's overdraft service for ATM and one-time debit card transactions prior to July 1, 2010, provided that the financial institution complies with all of the requirements of this section.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Permitted fees or charges.</E> Fees or charges for ATM and one-time debit card overdrafts may be assessed only for overdrafts paid on or after the date the financial institution receives the consumer's affirmative consent to the institution's overdraft service. <E T="03">See also</E> comment 17(b)-7.<PRTPAGE P="160"/>
            </P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">17(d) Content and Format</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Overdraft service.</E> The description of the institution's overdraft service should indicate that the consumer has the right to affirmatively consent, or opt into payment of overdrafts for ATM and one-time debit card transactions. The description should also disclose the institution's policies regarding the payment of overdrafts for other transactions, including checks, ACH transactions, and automatic bill payments, provided that this content is not more prominent than the description of the consumer's right to opt into payment of overdrafts for ATM and one-time debit card transactions. As applicable, the institution also should indicate that it pays overdrafts at its discretion, and should briefly explain that if the institution does not authorize and pay an overdraft, it may decline the transaction.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Maximum fee.</E> If the amount of a fee may vary from transaction to transaction, the financial institution may indicate that the consumer may be assessed a fee “up to” the maximum fee. The financial institution must disclose all applicable overdraft fees, including but not limited to:</P>
            <P>i. Per item or per transaction fees;</P>
            <P>ii. Daily overdraft fees;</P>
            <P>iii. Sustained overdraft fees, where fees are assessed when the consumer has not repaid the amount of the overdraft after some period of time (for example, if an account remains overdrawn for five or more business days); or</P>
            <P>iv. Negative balance fees.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Opt-in methods.</E> The opt-in notice must include the methods by which the consumer may consent to the overdraft service for ATM and one-time debit card transactions. Institutions may tailor Model Form A-9 to the methods offered to consumers for affirmatively consenting to the service. For example, an institution need not provide the tear-off portion of Model Form A-9 if it is only permitting consumers to opt-in telephonically or electronically. Institutions may, but are not required, to provide a signature line or check box where the consumer can indicate that he or she declines to opt in.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Identification of consumer's account.</E> An institution may use any reasonable method to identify the account for which the consumer submits the opt-in notice. For example, the institution may include a line for a printed name and an account number, as shown in Model Form A-9. Or, the institution may print a bar code or use other tracking information. <E T="03">See also</E> comment 17(b)-6, which describes how an institution obtains a consumer's affirmative consent.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Alternative plans for covering overdrafts.</E> If the institution offers both a line of credit subject to the Board's Regulation Z (12 CFR part 226) and a service that transfers funds from another account of the consumer held at the institution to cover overdrafts, the institution must state in its opt-in notice that both alternative plans are offered. For example, the notice might state “We also offer <E T="03">overdraft protection plans,</E> such as a link to a savings account or to an overdraft line of credit, which may be less expensive than our standard overdraft practices.” If the institution offers one, but not the other, it must state in its opt-in notice the alternative plan that it offers. If the institution does not offer either plan, it should omit the reference to the alternative plans.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">17(f) Continuing Right To Opt-In or To Revoke the Opt-In</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Fees or charges for overdrafts incurred prior to revocation.</E> Section 205.17(f)(1) provides that a consumer may revoke his or her prior consent at any time. If a consumer does so, this provision does not require the financial institution to waive or reverse any overdraft fees assessed on the consumer's account prior to the institution's implementation of the consumer's revocation request.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">17(g) Duration of Opt-In.</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Termination of overdraft service.</E> A financial institution may, for example, terminate the overdraft service when the consumer makes excessive use of the service.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">§ 205.18 Requirements for Financial Institutions Offering Payroll Card Accounts.</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">18(a) Coverage</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Issuance of access device.</E> Consistent with § 205.5(a), a financial institution may issue an access device only in response to an oral or written request for the device, or as a renewal or substitute for an accepted access device. A consumer is deemed to request an access device for a payroll card account when the consumer chooses to receive salary or other compensation through a payroll card account.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Application to employers and service providers.</E> Typically, employers and third-party service providers do not meet the definition of a “financial institution” subject to the regulation because they neither hold payroll card accounts nor issue payroll cards and agree with consumers to provide EFT services in connection with payroll card accounts. However, to the extent an employer or a service provider undertakes either of these functions, it would be deemed a financial institution under the regulation.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">18(b) Alternative to Periodic Statements</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Posted transactions.</E> A history of transactions provided under §§ 205.18(b)(1)(ii) and (iii) shall reflect transfers once they have been posted to the account. Thus, an institution does not need to include transactions <PRTPAGE P="161"/>that have been authorized, but that have not yet posted to the account.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Electronic history.</E> The electronic history required under § 205.18(b)(1)(ii) must be provided in a form that the consumer may keep, as required under § 205.4(a)(1). Financial institutions may satisfy this requirement if they make the electronic history available in a format that is capable of being retained. For example, an institution satisfies the requirement if it provides a history at an Internet Web site in a format that is capable of being printed or stored electronically using an Internet web browser.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">18(c) Modified Requirements</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Error resolution safe harbor provision.</E> Institutions that choose to investigate notices of error provided up to 120 days from the date a transaction has posted to a consumer's account may still disclose the error resolution time period required by the regulation (as set forth in the Model Form in Appendix A-7). Specifically, an institution may disclose to payroll card account holders that the institution will investigate any notice of error provided within 60 days of the consumer electronically accessing an account or receiving a written history upon request that reflects the error, even if, for some or all transactions, the institution investigates any notice of error provided up to 120 days from the date that the transaction alleged to be in error has posted to the consumer's account. Similarly, an institution's summary of the consumer's liability (as required under § 205.7(b)(1)) may disclose that liability is based on the consumer providing notice of error within 60 days of the consumer electronically accessing an account or receiving a written history reflecting the error, even if, for some or all transactions, the institution allows a consumer to assert a notice of error up to 120 days from the date of posting of the alleged error.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Electronic access.</E> A consumer is deemed to have accessed a payroll card account electronically when the consumer enters a user identification code or password or otherwise complies with a security procedure used by an institution to verify the consumer's identity. An institution is not required to determine whether a consumer has in fact accessed information about specific transactions to trigger the beginning of the 60-day periods for liability limits and error resolution under §§ 205.6 and 205.11.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Untimely notice of error.</E> An institution that provides a transaction history under § 205.18(b)(1) is not required to comply with the requirements of § 205.11 for any notice of error from the consumer pertaining to a transfer that occurred more than 60 days prior to the earlier of the date the consumer electronically accesses the account or the date the financial institution sends a written history upon the consumer's request. (Alternatively, as provided in § 205.18(c)(4)(ii), an institution need not comply with the requirements of § 205.11 with respect to any notice of error received from the consumer more than 120 days after the date of posting of the transfer allegedly in error.) Where the consumer's assertion of error involves an unauthorized EFT, however, the institution must comply with § 205.6 before it may impose any liability on the consumer.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Section 205.20—Requirements for Gift Cards and Gift Certificates</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">20(a) Definitions</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Form of card, code, or device.</E> Section 205.20 applies to any card, code, or other device that meets one of the definitions in § 205.20(a)(1) through (a)(3) (and is not otherwise excluded by § 205.20(b)), even if it is not issued in card form. Section 205.20 applies, for example, to an account number or bar code that can be used to access underlying funds. Similarly, § 205.20 applies to a device with a chip or other embedded mechanism that links the device to stored funds, such as a mobile phone or sticker containing a contactless chip that enables the consumer to access the stored funds. A card, code, or other device that meets the definition in § 205.20(a)(1) through (a)(3) includes an electronic promise (<E T="03">see</E> comment 20(a)-2) as well as a promise that is not electronic. <E T="03">See, however,</E> § 205.20(b)(5). In addition, § 205.20 applies if a merchant issues a code that entitles a consumer to redeem the code for goods or services, regardless of the medium in which the code is issued (<E T="03">see, however,</E> § 205.20(b)(5)), and whether or not it may be redeemed electronically or in the merchant's store. Thus, for example, if a merchant e-mails a code that a consumer may redeem in a specified amount either on-line or in the merchant's store, that code is covered under § 205.20, unless one of the exclusions in § 205.20(b) apply.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Electronic promise.</E> The term “electronic promise” as used in EFTA Sections 915(a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), and (a)(2)(D) means a person's commitment or obligation communicated or stored in electronic form made to a consumer to provide payment for goods or services for transactions initiated by the consumer. The electronic promise is itself represented by a card, code or other device that is issued or honored by the person, reflecting the person's commitment or obligation to pay. For example, if a merchant issues a code that can be given as a gift and that entitles the recipient to redeem the code in an on-line transaction for goods or services, that code represents an electronic promise by the merchant and is a card, code, or other device covered by § 205.20.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Cards, codes, or other devices redeemable for specific goods or services.</E> Certain cards, codes, or other devices may be redeemable <PRTPAGE P="162"/>upon presentation for a specific good or service, or “experience,” such as a spa treatment, hotel stay, or airline flight. In other cases, a card, code, or other device may entitle the consumer to a certain percentage off the purchase of a good or service, such as 20% off of any purchase in a store. Such cards, codes, or other devices generally are not subject to the requirements of this section because they are not issued to a consumer “in a specified amount” as required under the definitions of “gift certificate,” “store gift card,” or “general-use prepaid card.” However, if the card, code, or other device is issued in a specified or denominated amount that can be applied toward the purchase of a specific good or service, such as a certificate or card redeemable for a spa treatment up to $50, the card, code, or other device is subject to this section, unless one of the exceptions in § 205.20(b) apply. <E T="03">See, e.g.,</E> § 205.20(b)(3). Similarly, if the card, code, or other device states a specific monetary value, such as “a $50 value,” the card, code, or other device is subject to this section, unless an exclusion in § 205.20(b) applies.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Issued primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.</E> Section 205.20 only applies to cards, codes, or other devices that are sold or issued to a consumer primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. A card, code, or other device initially purchased by a business is subject to this section if the card, code, or other device is purchased for redistribution or resale to consumers primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. Moreover, the fact that a card, code, or other device may be primarily funded by a business, for example, in the case of certain rewards or incentive cards, does not mean the card, code, or other device is outside the scope of § 205.20, if the card, code, or other device will be provided to a consumer primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. <E T="03">But see</E> § 205.20(b)(3). Whether a card, code, or other device is issued to a consumer primarily for personal, family, or household purposes will depend on the facts and circumstances. For example, if a program manager purchases store gift cards directly from an issuing merchant and sells those cards through the program manager's retail outlets, such gift cards are subject to the requirements of § 205.20 because the store gift cards are sold to consumers primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. In contrast, a card, code, or other device generally would not be issued to consumers primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, and therefore would fall outside the scope of § 205.20, if the purchaser of the card, code, or device is contractually prohibited from reselling or redistributing the card, code, or device to consumers primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, and reasonable policies and procedures are maintained to avoid such sale or distribution for such purposes. However, if an entity that has purchased cards, codes, or other devices for business purposes sells or distributes such cards, codes, or other devices to consumers primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, that entity does not comply with § 205.20 if it has not otherwise met the substantive and disclosure requirements of the rule or unless an exclusion in § 205.20(b) applies.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Examples of cards, codes, or other devices issued for business purposes.</E> Examples of cards, codes, or other devices that are issued and used for business purposes and therefore excluded from the definitions of “gift certificate,” “store gift card,” or “general-use prepaid card” include</P>
            <P>i. Cards, codes, or other devices to reimburse employees for travel or moving expenses.</P>
            <P>ii. Cards, codes, or other devices for employees to use to purchase office supplies and other business-related items.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 20(a)(2)—Store Gift Card</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Relationship between “gift certificate” and “store gift card”.</E> The term “store gift card” in § 205.20(a)(2) includes “gift certificate” as defined in § 205.20(a)(1). For example, a numeric or alphanumeric code representing a specified dollar amount or value that is electronically sent to a consumer as a gift which can be redeemed or exchanged by the recipient to obtain goods or services may be both a “gift certificate” and a “store gift card” if the specified amount or value cannot be increased.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Affiliated group of merchants.</E> The term “affiliated group of merchants” means two or more affiliated merchants or other persons that are related by common ownership or common corporate control (<E T="03">see, e.g.,</E> 12 CFR 227.3(b) and 12 CFR 223.2) and that share the same name, mark, or logo. For example, the term includes franchisees that are subject to a common set of corporate policies or practices under the terms of their franchise licenses. The term also applies to two or more merchants or other persons that agree among themselves, by contract or otherwise, to redeem cards, codes, or other devices bearing the same name, mark, or logo (other than the mark, logo, or brand of a payment network), for the purchase of goods or services solely at such merchants or persons. For example, assume a movie theatre chain and a restaurant chain jointly agree to issue cards that share the same “Flix and Food” logo that can be redeemed solely towards the purchase of movie tickets or concessions at any of the participating movie theatres, or towards the purchase of food or beverages at any of the participating restaurants. For purposes of § 205.20, the movie theatre chain and the restaurant chain would be considered to be an affiliated group of merchants, and the cards are considered to be “store gift <PRTPAGE P="163"/>cards.” However, merchants or other persons are not considered to be affiliated merely because they agree to accept a card that bears the mark, logo, or brand of a payment network.</P>

            <P>1. <E T="03">Redeemable upon presentation at multiple, unaffiliated merchants.</E> A card, code, or other device is redeemable upon presentation at multiple, unaffiliated merchants if, for example, such merchants agree to honor the card, code, or device if it bears the mark, logo, or brand of a payment network, pursuant to the rules of the payment network.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Mall gift cards.</E> Mall gift cards that are intended to be used or redeemed for goods or services at participating retailers within a shopping mall may be considered store gift cards or general-use prepaid cards depending on the merchants with which the cards may be redeemed. For example, if a mall card may only be redeemed at merchants within the mall itself, the card is more likely to be redeemable at an affiliated group of merchants and considered a store gift card. However, certain mall cards also carry the brand of a payment network and can be used at any retailer that accepts that card brand, including retailers located outside of the mall. Such cards are considered general-use prepaid cards.</P>

A periodic fee includes any fee that may be imposed on a gift certificate, store gift card, or general-use prepaid card from time to time for holding or using the certificate or card, such as a monthly maintenance fee, a transaction fee, an ATM fee, a reload fee, a foreign currency transaction fee, or a balance inquiry fee, whether or not the fee is waived for a certain period of time or is only imposed after a certain period of time. A service fee does not include a one-time fee or a fee that is unlikely to be imposed more than once while the underlying funds are still valid, such as an initial issuance fee, a cash-out fee, a supplemental card fee, or a lost or stolen certificate or card replacement fee.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 20(a)(7)—Activity</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Activity.</E> Under § 205.20(a)(7), any action that results in an increase or decrease of the funds underlying a gift certificate, store gift card, or general-use prepaid card, other than the imposition of a fee, or an adjustment due to an error or a reversal of a prior transaction, constitutes activity for purposes of § 205.20. For example, the purchase and activation of a certificate or card, the use of the <PRTPAGE P="164"/>certificate or card to purchase a good or service, or the reloading of funds onto a store gift card or general-use prepaid card constitutes activity. However, the imposition of a fee, the replacement of an expired, lost, or stolen certificate or card, and a balance inquiry do not constitute activity. In addition, if a consumer attempts to engage in a transaction with a gift certificate, store gift card, or general-use prepaid card, but the transaction cannot be completed due to technical or other reasons, such attempt does not constitute activity. Furthermore, if the funds underlying a gift certificate, store gift card, or general-use prepaid card are adjusted because there was an error or the consumer has returned a previously purchased good, the adjustment also does not constitute activity with respect to the certificate or card.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">20(b) Exclusions</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Application of exclusion.</E> A card, code, or other device is excluded from the definition of “gift certificate,” “store gift card,” or “general-use prepaid card” if it meets any of the exclusions in § 205.20(b). An excluded card, code, or other device generally is not subject to any of the requirements of this section. (<E T="03">See, however,</E> § 205.20(a)(4)(iii), requiring certain disclosures for loyalty, award, or promotional gift cards.)</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Eligibility for multiple exclusions.</E> A card, code, or other device may qualify for one or more exclusions. For example, a corporation may give its employees a gift card that is marketed solely to businesses for incentive-related purposes, such as to reward job performance or promote employee safety. In this case, the card may qualify for the exclusion for loyalty, award, or promotional gift cards under § 205.20(b)(3), or for the exclusion for cards, codes, or other devices not marketed to the general public under § 205.20(b)(4). In addition, as long as any one of the exclusions applies, a card, code, or other device is not covered by § 205.20, even if other exclusions do not apply. In the above example, the corporation may give its employees a type of gift card that can also be purchased by a consumer directly from a merchant. Under these circumstances, while the card does not qualify for the exclusion for cards, codes, or other devices not marketed to the general public under § 205.20(b)(4) because the card can also be obtained through retail channels, it is nevertheless exempt from the substantive requirements of § 205.20 because it is a loyalty, award, or promotional gift card. (<E T="03">See, however,</E> § 205.20(a)(4)(iii), requiring certain disclosures for loyalty, award, or promotional gift cards.) Similarly, a person may market a reloadable card to teenagers for occasional expenses that enables parents to monitor spending. Although the card does not qualify for the exclusion for cards, codes, or other devices not marketed to the general public under § 205.20(b)(4), it may nevertheless be exempt from the requirements of § 205.20 under § 205.20(b)(2) if it is reloadable and not marketed or labeled as a gift card or gift certificate.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 20(b)(1)—Usable Solely for Telephone Services</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Examples of excluded products.</E> The exclusion for products usable solely for telephone services applies to prepaid cards for long-distance telephone service, prepaid cards for wireless telephone service and prepaid cards for other services that function similar to telephone services, such as prepaid cards for voice over internet protocol (VoIP) access time.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 20(b)(2)—Reloadable and Not Marketed or Labeled as a Gift Card or Gift Certificate</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Reloadable.</E> A card, code, or other device is “reloadable” if the terms and conditions of the agreement permit funds to be added to the card, code, or other device after the initial purchase or issuance. A card, code, or other device is not “reloadable” merely because the issuer or processor is technically able to add functionality that would otherwise enable the card, code, or other device to be reloaded.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Marketed or labeled as a gift card or gift certificate.</E> The term “marketed or labeled as a gift card or gift certificate” means directly or indirectly offering, advertising or otherwise suggesting the potential use of a card, code or other device, as a gift for another person. Whether the exclusion applies generally does not depend on the type of entity that makes the promotional message. For example, a card may be marketed or labeled as a gift card or gift certificate if anyone (other than the purchaser of the card), including the issuer, the retailer, the program manager that may distribute the card, or the payment network on which a card is used, promotes the use of the card as a gift card or gift certificate. A card, code, or other device, including a general-purpose reloadable card, is marketed or labeled as a gift card or gift certificate even if it is only occasionally marketed as a gift card or gift certificate. For example, a network-branded general purpose reloadable card would be marketed or labeled as a gift card or gift certificate if the issuer principally advertises the card as a less costly alternative to a bank account but promotes the card in a television, radio, newspaper, or Internet advertisement, or on signage as “the perfect gift” during the holiday season. However, the mere mention of the availability of gift cards or gift certificates in an advertisement or on a sign that <PRTPAGE P="165"/>also indicates the availability of other excluded prepaid cards does not by itself cause the excluded prepaid cards to be marketed as a gift card or a gift certificate. For example, the posting of a sign in a store that refers to the availability of gift cards does not by itself constitute the marketing of otherwise excluded prepaid cards that may also be sold in the store as gift cards or gift certificates, provided that a consumer acting reasonably under the circumstances would not be led to believe that the sign applies to all prepaid cards sold in the store.

            </P>
            <P>i. Examples of marketed or labeled as a gift card or gift certificate include</P>
            <P>A. Using the word “gift” or “present” on a card, certificate, or accompanying material, including documentation, packaging and promotional displays;</P>
            <P>B. Representing or suggesting that a certificate or card can be given to another person, for example, as a “token of appreciation” or a “stocking stuffer,” or displaying a congratulatory message on the card, certificate or accompanying material;</P>
            <P>C. Incorporating gift-giving or celebratory imagery or motifs, such as a bow, ribbon, wrapped present, candle, or congratulatory message, on a card, certificate, accompanying documentation, or promotional material;</P>
            <P>ii. The term does not include</P>
            <P>A. Representing that a card or certificate can be used as a substitute for a checking, savings, or deposit account;</P>
            <P>B. Representing that a card or certificate can be used to pay for a consumer's health-related expenses—for example, a card tied to a health savings account;</P>
            <P>C. Representing that a card or certificate can be used as a substitute for travelers checks or cash;</P>
            <P>D. Representing that a card or certificate can be used as a budgetary tool, for example, by teenagers, or to cover emergency expenses.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Reasonable policies and procedures to avoid marketing as a gift card.</E> The exclusion for a card, code, or other device that is reloadable and not marketed or labeled as a gift card or gift certificate in § 205.20(b)(2) applies if a reloadable card, code, or other device is not marketed or labeled as a gift card or gift certificate and if persons subject to the rule, including issuers, program managers, and retailers, maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to avoid such marketing. Such policies and procedures may include contractual provisions prohibiting a reloadable card, code, or other device from being marketed or labeled as a gift card or gift certificate, merchandising guidelines or plans regarding how the product must be displayed in a retail outlet, and controls to regularly monitor or otherwise verify that the card, code or other device is not being marketed as a gift card. Whether a reloadable card, code, or other device has been marketed as a gift card or gift certificate will depend on the facts and circumstances, including whether a reasonable consumer would be led to believe that the card, code, or other device is a gift card or gift certificate. The following examples illustrate the application of § 205.20(b)(2)</P>
            <P>i. An issuer or program manager of prepaid cards agrees to sell general-purpose reloadable cards through a retailer. The contract between the issuer or program manager and the retailer establishes the terms and conditions under which the cards may be sold and marketed at the retailer. The terms and conditions prohibit the general-purpose reloadable cards from being marketed as a gift card or gift certificate, and require policies and procedures to regularly monitor or otherwise verify that the cards are not being marketed as such. The issuer or program manager sets up one promotional display at the retailer for gift cards and another physically separated display for excluded products under § 205.20(b), including general-purpose reloadable cards and wireless telephone cards, such that a reasonable consumer would not believe that the excluded cards are gift cards. The exclusion in § 205.20(b)(2) applies because policies and procedures reasonably designed to avoid the marketing of the general-purpose reloadable cards as gift cards or gift certificates are maintained, even if a retail clerk inadvertently stocks or a consumer inadvertently places a general-purpose reloadable card on the gift card display.</P>
            <P>ii. Same facts as in i., except that the issuer or program manager sets up a single promotional display at the retailer on which a variety of prepaid cards are sold, including store gift cards and general-purpose reloadable cards. A sign stating “Gift Cards” appears prominently at the top of the display. The exclusion in § 205.20(b)(2) does not apply with respect to the general-purpose reloadable cards because policies and procedures reasonably designed to avoid the marketing of excluded cards as gift cards or gift certificates are not maintained.</P>

            <P>iii. Same facts as in i., except that the issuer or program manager sets up a single promotional multi-sided display at the retailer on which a variety of prepaid card products, including store gift cards and general-purpose reloadable cards are sold. Gift cards are segregated from excluded cards, with gift cards on one side of the display and excluded cards on a different side of a display. Signs of equal prominence at the top of each side of the display clearly differentiate between gift cards and the other types of prepaid cards that are available for sale. The retailer does not use any more conspicuous <PRTPAGE P="166"/>signage suggesting the general availability of gift cards, such as a large sign stating “Gift Cards” at the top of the display or located near the display. The exclusion in § 205.20(b)(2) applies because policies and procedures reasonably designed to avoid the marketing of the general-purpose reloadable cards as gift cards or gift certificates are maintained, even if a retail clerk inadvertently stocks or a consumer inadvertently places a general-purpose reloadable card on the gift card display.</P>
            <P>iv. Same facts as in i., except that the retailer sells a variety of prepaid card products, including store gift cards and general-purpose reloadable cards, arranged side-by-side in the same checkout lane. The retailer does not affirmatively indicate or represent that gift cards are available, such as by displaying any signage or other indicia at the checkout lane suggesting the general availability of gift cards. The exclusion in § 205.20(b)(2) applies because policies and procedures reasonably designed to avoid marketing the general-purpose reloadable cards as gift cards or gift certificates are maintained.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">On-line sales of prepaid cards.</E> Some Web sites may prominently advertise or promote the availability of gift cards or gift certificates in a manner that suggests to a consumer that the Web site exclusively sells gift cards or gift certificates. For example, a Web site may display a banner advertisement or a graphic on the home page that prominently states “Gift Cards,” “Gift Giving,” or similar language without mention of other available products, or use a Web address that includes only a reference to gift cards or gift certificates in the address. In such a case, a consumer acting reasonably under the circumstances could be led to believe that all prepaid products sold on the Web site are gift cards or gift certificates. Under these facts, the Web site has marketed all such products, including general-purpose reloadable cards, as gift cards or gift certificates, and the exclusion in § 205.20(b)(2) does not apply.</P>
            <P>6. <E T="03">Temporary non-reloadable cards issued in connection with a general-purpose reloadable card.</E> Certain general-purpose reloadable cards that are typically marketed as an account substitute initially may be sold or issued in the form of a temporary non-reloadable card. After the card is purchased, the cardholder is typically required to call the issuer to register the card and to provide identifying information in order to obtain a reloadable replacement card. In most cases, the temporary non-reloadable card can be used for purchases until the replacement reloadable card arrives and is activated by the cardholder. Because the temporary non-reloadable card may only be obtained in connection with the general-purpose reloadable card, the exclusion in § 205.20(b)(2) applies so long as the card is not marketed as a gift card or gift certificate.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 20(b)(4)—Not Marketed to the General Public</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Marketed to the general public.</E> A card, code, or other device is marketed to the general public if the potential use of the card, code, or other device is directly or indirectly offered, advertised, or otherwise promoted to the general public. A card, code, or other device may be marketed to the general public through any advertising medium, including television, radio, newspaper, the Internet, or signage. However, the posting of a company policy that funds may be disbursed by prepaid card (such as a sign posted at a cash register or customer service center stating that store credit will be issued by prepaid card) does not constitute the marketing of a card, code, or other device to the general public. In addition, the method of distribution by itself is not dispositive in determining whether a card, code, or other device is marketed to the general public. Factors that may be considered in determining whether the exclusion applies to a particular card, code, or other device include the means or channel through which the card, code, or device may be obtained by a consumer, the subset of consumers that are eligible to obtain the card, code, or device, and whether the availability of the card, code, or device is advertised or otherwise promoted in the marketplace.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Examples.</E> The following examples illustrate the application of the exclusion in § 205.20(b)(4)</P>

            <P>i. A merchant sells its gift cards at a discount to a business which may give them to employees or loyal consumers as incentives or rewards. In determining whether the gift card falls within the exclusion in § 205.20(b)(4), the merchant must consider whether the card is of a type that is advertised or made available to consumers generally or can be obtained elsewhere. If the card can also be purchased through retail channels, the exclusion in § 205.20(b)(4) does not apply, even if the consumer obtained the card from the business as an incentive or reward. <E T="03">See, however,</E> § 205.20(b)(3).</P>

            <P>ii. A national retail chain decides to market its gift cards only to members of its frequent buyer program. Similarly, a bank may decide to sell gift cards only to its customers. If a member of the general public may become a member of the program or a customer of the bank, the card does not fall within the exclusion in § 205.20(b)(4) because the general public has the ability to obtain the cards. <E T="03">See, however,</E> § 205.20(b)(3).</P>

            <P>iii. A card issuer advertises a reloadable card to teenagers and their parents promoting the card for use by teenagers for occasional expenses, schoolbooks and emergencies and by parents to monitor spending. <PRTPAGE P="167"/>Because the card is marketed to and may be sold to any member of the general public, the exclusion in § 205.20(b)(4) does not apply. <E T="03">See, however,</E> § 205.20(b)(2).</P>
            <P>iv. An insurance company settles a policyholder's claim and distributes the insurance proceeds to the consumer by means of a prepaid card. Because the prepaid card is simply the means for providing the insurance proceeds to the consumer and the availability of the card is not advertised to the general public, the exclusion in § 205.20(b)(4) applies.</P>
            <P>v. A merchant provides store credit to a consumer following a merchandise return by issuing a prepaid card that clearly indicates that the card contains funds for store credit. Because the prepaid card is issued for the stated purpose of providing store credit to the consumer and the ability to receive refunds by a prepaid card is not advertised to the general public, the exclusion in § 205.20(b)(4) applies.</P>
            <P>vi. A tax preparation company elects to distribute tax refunds to its clients by issuing prepaid cards, but does not advertise or otherwise promote the ability to receive proceeds in this manner. Because the prepaid card is simply the mechanism for providing the tax refund to the consumer, and the tax preparer does not advertise the ability to obtain tax refunds by a prepaid card, the exclusion in § 205.20(b)(4) applies. However, if the tax preparer promotes the ability to receive tax refund proceeds through a prepaid card as a way to obtain “faster” access to the proceeds, the exclusion in § 205.20(b)(4) does not apply.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 20(b)(5)—Issued in Paper Form Only</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Exclusion explained.</E> To qualify for the exclusion in § 205.20(b)(5), the sole means of issuing the card, code, or other device must be in a paper form. Thus, the exclusion generally applies to certificates issued in paper form where solely the paper itself may be used to purchase goods or services. A card, code or other device is not issued solely in paper form simply because it may be reproduced or printed on paper. For example, a bar code, card or certificate number, or certificate or coupon electronically provided to a consumer and redeemable for goods and services is not issued in paper form, even if it may be reproduced or otherwise printed on paper by the consumer. In this circumstance, although the consumer might hold a paper facsimile of the card, code, or other device, the exclusion does not apply because the information necessary to redeem the value was initially issued in electronic form. A paper certificate is within the exclusion regardless of whether it may be redeemed electronically. For example, a paper certificate or receipt that bears a bar code, code, or account number falls within the exclusion in § 205.20(b)(5) if the bar code, code, or account number is not issued in any form other than on the paper. In addition, the exclusion in § 205.20(b)(5) continues to apply in circumstances where an issuer replaces a gift certificate that was initially issued in paper form with a card or electronic code (for example, to replace a lost paper certificate).</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Examples.</E> The following examples illustrate the application of the exclusion in § 205.20(b)(5)</P>
            <P>i. A merchant issues a paper gift certificate that entitles the bearer to a specified dollar amount that can be applied towards a future meal. The merchant fills in the certificate with the name of the certificate holder and the amount of the certificate. The certificate falls within the exclusion in § 205.20(b)(5) because it is issued in paper form only.</P>
            <P>ii. A merchant allows a consumer to prepay for a good or service, such as a car wash or time at a parking meter, and issues a paper receipt bearing a numerical or bar code that the consumer may redeem to obtain the good or service. The exclusion in § 205.20(b)(5) applies because the code is issued in paper form only.</P>
            <P>iii. A merchant issues a paper certificate or receipt bearing a bar code or certificate number that can later be scanned or entered into the merchant's system and redeemed by the certificate or receipt holder towards the purchase of goods or services. The bar code or certificate number is not issued by the merchant in any form other than paper. The exclusion in § 205.20(b)(5) applies because the bar code or certificate number is issued in paper form only.</P>
            <P>iv. An on-line merchant electronically provides a bar code, card or certificate number, or certificate or coupon to a consumer that the consumer may print on a home printer and later redeem towards the purchase of goods or services. The exclusion in § 205.20(b)(5) does not apply because the bar code or card or certificate number was issued to the consumer in electronic form, even though it can be reproduced or otherwise printed on paper by the consumer.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 20(b)(6)—Redeemable Solely for Admission to Events or Venues</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Exclusion explained.</E> The exclusion for cards, codes, or other devices that are redeemable solely for admission to events or venues at a particular location or group of affiliated locations generally applies to cards, codes, or other devices that are not redeemed for a specified monetary value, but rather solely for admission or entry to an event or venue. The exclusion also covers a card, code, or other device that is usable to purchase goods or services in addition to entry into the event or the venue, either at the event or venue or at an affiliated location or location in geographic proximity to the event or venue.<PRTPAGE P="168"/>
            </P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Examples.</E> The following examples illustrate the application of the exclusion in § 205.20(b)(6)</P>

            <P>i. A consumer purchases a prepaid card that entitles the holder to a ticket for entry to an amusement park. The prepaid card may only be used for entry to the park. The card qualifies for the exclusion in § 205.20(b)(6) because it is redeemable for admission or entry and for goods or services in conjunction with that admission. In addition, if the prepaid card does not have a monetary value, and therefore is not “issued in a specified amount,” the card does not meet the definitions of “gift certificate,” “store gift card,” or “general-use prepaid card” in § 205.20(a). <E T="03">See</E> comment 20(a)-3.</P>
            <P>ii. Same facts as in i., except that the gift card also entitles the holder of the gift card to a dollar amount that can be applied towards the purchase of food and beverages or goods or services at the park or at nearby affiliated locations. The card qualifies for the exclusion in § 205.20(b)(6) because it is redeemable for admission or entry and for goods or services in conjunction with that admission.</P>
            <P>iii. A consumer purchases a $25 gift card that the holder of the gift card can use to make purchases at a merchant, or, alternatively, can apply towards the cost of admission to the merchant's affiliated amusement park. The card is not eligible for the exclusion in § 205.20(b)(6) because it is not redeemable solely for the admission or ticket itself (or for goods and services purchased in conjunction with such admission). The card meets the definition of “store gift card” and is therefore subject to § 205.20, unless a different exclusion applies.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">20(c) Form of Disclosures</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 20(c)(1)—Clear and Conspicuous</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Clear and conspicuous standard.</E> All disclosures required by this section must be clear and conspicuous. Disclosures are clear and conspicuous for purposes of this section if they are readily understandable and, in the case of written and electronic disclosures, the location and type size are readily noticeable to consumers. Disclosures need not be located on the front of the certificate or card, except where otherwise required, to be considered clear and conspicuous. Disclosures are clear and conspicuous for the purposes of this section if they are in a print that contrasts with and is otherwise not obstructed by the background on which they are printed. For example, disclosures on a card or computer screen are not likely to be conspicuous if obscured by a logo printed in the background. Similarly, disclosures on the back of a card that are printed on top of indentations from embossed type on the front of the card are not likely to be conspicuous if the indentations obstruct the readability of the disclosures. To the extent permitted, oral disclosures meet the standard when they are given at a volume and speed sufficient for a consumer to hear and comprehend them.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Abbreviations and symbols.</E> Disclosures may contain commonly accepted or readily understandable abbreviations or symbols, such as “mo.” for month or a “/” to indicate “per.” Under the clear and conspicuous standard, it is sufficient to state, for example, that a particular fee is charged “$2.50/mo. after 12 mos.”</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 20(c)(2)—Format</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Electronic disclosures.</E> Disclosures provided electronically pursuant to this section are not subject to compliance with the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act) (15 U.S.C. 7001 <E T="03">et seq.</E>). Electronic disclosures must be in a retainable form. For example, a person may satisfy the requirement if it provides an online disclosure in a format that is capable of being printed. Electronic disclosures may not be provided through a hyperlink or in another manner by which the purchaser can bypass the disclosure. A person is not required to confirm that the consumer has read the electronic disclosures.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 20(c)(3)—Disclosure Prior to Purchase</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Method of purchase.</E> The disclosures required by this paragraph must be provided before a certificate or card is purchased regardless of whether the certificate or card is purchased in person, online, by telephone, or by other means.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Electronic disclosures.</E> Section 205.20(c)(3) provides that the disclosures required by this section must be provided to the consumer prior to purchase. For certificates or cards purchased electronically, disclosures made to the consumer after a consumer has initiated an online purchase of a certificate or card, but prior to completing the purchase of the certificate or card, would satisfy the prior-to-purchase requirement. However, electronic disclosures made available on a person's Web site that may or may not be accessed by the consumer are not provided to the consumer and therefore would not satisfy the prior-to-purchase requirement.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Non-physical certificates and cards.</E> If no physical certificate or card is issued, the disclosures must be provided to the consumer before the certificate or card is purchased. For example, where a gift certificate or card is a code that is provided by telephone, the required disclosures may be provided orally prior to purchase. <E T="03">See also</E> § 205.20(c)(2).<PRTPAGE P="169"/>
            </P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 20(c)(4)—Disclosures on the Certificate or Card</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Non-physical certificates and cards.</E> If no physical certificate or card is issued, the disclosures required by this paragraph must be disclosed on the code, confirmation, or other written or electronic document provided to the consumer. For example, where a gift certificate or card is a code or confirmation that is provided to a consumer on-line or sent to a consumer's e-mail address, the required disclosures may be provided electronically on the same document as the code or confirmation.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">No disclosures on a certificate or card.</E> Disclosures required by § 205.20(c)(4) need not be made on a certificate or card if it is accompanied by a certificate or card that complies with this section. For example, a person may issue or sell a supplemental gift card that is smaller than a standard size and that does not bear the applicable disclosures if it is accompanied by a fully compliant certificate or card. <E T="03">See also</E> comment 20(c)(2)-2.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">20(d) Prohibition on Imposition of Fees or Charges</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">One-year period.</E> Section 205.20(d) provides that a person may impose a dormancy, inactivity, or service fee only if there has been no activity with respect to a certificate or card for one year. The following examples illustrate this rule</P>
            <P>i. A certificate or card is purchased on January 15 of year one. If there has been no activity on the certificate or card since the certificate or card was purchased, a dormancy, inactivity, or service fee may be imposed on the certificate or card on January 15 of year two.</P>

            <P>ii. Same facts as i., and a fee was imposed on January 15 of year two. Because no more than one dormancy, inactivity, or service fee may be imposed in any given calendar month, the earliest date that another dormancy, inactivity, or service fee may be imposed, assuming there continues to be no activity on the certificate or card, is February 1 of year two. A dormancy, inactivity, or service fee is permitted to be imposed on February 1 of year two because there has been no activity on the certificate or card for the preceding year (February 1 of year one through January 31 of year two), and February is a new calendar month. The imposition of a fee on January 15 of year two is not activity for purposes of § 205.20(d). <E T="03">See</E> comment 20(a)(7)-1.</P>
            <P>iii. Same facts as i., and a fee was imposed on January 15 of year two. On January 31 of year two, the consumer uses the card to make a purchase. Another dormancy, inactivity, or service fee could not be imposed until January 31 of year three, assuming there has been no activity on the certificate or card since January 31 of year two.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Relationship between §§ 205.20(d)(2) and (c)(3).</E> Sections 205.20(d)(2) and (c)(3) contain similar, but not identical, disclosure requirements. Section 205.20(d)(2) requires the disclosure of dormancy, inactivity, and service fees on a certificate or card. Section 205.20(c)(3) requires that vendor person that issues or sells such certificate or card disclose to a consumer any dormancy, inactivity, and service fees associated with the certificate or card before such certificate or card may be purchased. Depending on the context, a single disclosure that meets the clear and conspicuous requirements of both §§ 205.20(d)(2) and (c)(3) may be used to disclose a dormancy, inactivity, or service fee. For example, if the disclosures on a certificate or card, required by § 205.20(d)(2), are visible to the consumer without having to remove packaging or other materials sold with the certificate or card, for a purchase made in person, the disclosures also meet the requirements of § 205.20(c)(3). Otherwise, a dormancy, inactivity, or service fee may need to be disclosed multiple times to satisfy the requirements of §§ 205.20(d)(2) and (c)(3). For example, if the disclosures on a certificate or card, required by § 205.20(d)(2), are obstructed by packaging sold with the certificate or card, for a purchase made in person, they also must be disclosed on the packaging sold with the certificate or card to meet the requirements of § 205.20(c)(3).</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Relationship between §§ 205.20(d)(2), (e)(3), and (f)(2).</E> In addition to any disclosures required under § 205.20(d)(2), any applicable disclosures under §§ 205.20(e)(3) and (f)(2) of this section must also be provided on the certificate or card.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">One fee per month.</E> Under § 205.20(d)(3), no more than one dormancy, inactivity, or service fee may be imposed in any given calendar month. For example, if a dormancy fee is imposed on January 1, following a year of inactivity, and a consumer makes a balance inquiry on January 15, a balance inquiry fee may not be imposed at that time because a dormancy fee was already imposed earlier that month and a balance inquiry fee is a type of service fee. If, however, the dormancy fee could be imposed on January 1, following a year of inactivity, and the consumer makes a balance inquiry on the same date, the person assessing the fees may choose whether to impose the dormancy fee or the balance inquiry fee on January 1. The restriction in § 205.20(d)(3) does not apply to any fee that is not a dormancy, inactivity, or service fee. For example, assume a service fee is imposed on a general-use prepaid card on January 1, following a year of inactivity. If a consumer cashes out the remaining funds by check on January 15, a cash-out fee, to the extent such cash-out fee is permitted under § 205.20(e)(4), may be imposed at that time because a cash-out fee is not a dormancy, inactivity, or service fee.<PRTPAGE P="170"/>
            </P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Accumulation of fees.</E> Section 205.20(d) prohibits the accumulation of dormancy, inactivity, or service fees for previous periods into a single fee because such a practice would circumvent the limitation in § 205.20(d)(3) that only one fee may be charged per month. For example, if a consumer purchases and activates a store gift card on January 1 but never uses the card, a monthly maintenance fee of $2.00 a month may not be accumulated such that a fee of $24 is imposed on January 1 the following year.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">20(e) Prohibition on Sale of Gift Certificates or Cards With Expiration Dates</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Reasonable opportunity.</E> Under § 205.20(e)(1), no person may sell or issue a gift certificate, store gift card, or general-use prepaid card with an expiration date, unless there are policies and procedures in place to provide consumers with a reasonable opportunity to purchase a certificate or card with at least five years remaining until the certificate or card expiration date. Consumers are deemed to have a reasonable opportunity to purchase a certificate or card with at least five years remaining until the certificate or card expiration date if</P>
            <P>i. There are policies and procedures established to prevent the sale of a certificate or card unless the certificate or card expiration date is at least five years after the date the certificate or card was sold or initially issued to a consumer; or</P>
            <P>ii. A certificate or card is available to consumers to purchase five years and six months before the certificate or card expiration date.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Applicability to replacement certificates or cards.</E> Section 205.20(e)(1) applies solely to the <E T="03">purchase</E> of a certificate or card. Therefore, § 205.20(e)(1) does not apply to the replacement of such certificates or cards. Certificates or cards issued as a replacement may bear a certificate or card expiration date of less than five years from the date of issuance of the replacement certificate or card. If the certificate or card expiration date for a replacement certificate or card is later than the date set forth in § 205.20(e)(2)(i), then pursuant to § 205.20(e)(2), the expiration date for the underlying funds at the time the replacement certificate or card is issued must be no earlier than the expiration date for the replacement certificate or card. For purposes of § 205.20(e)(2), funds are not considered to be loaded to a store gift card or general-use prepaid card solely because a replacement card has been issued or activated for use.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Disclosure of funds expiration—date not required.</E> Section 205.20(e)(3)(i) does not require disclosure of the precise date the funds will expire. It is sufficient to disclose, for example, “Funds expire 5 years from the date funds last loaded to the card.”; “Funds can be used 5 years from the date money was last added to the card.”; or “Funds do not expire.”</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Disclosure not required if no expiration date.</E> If the certificate or card and underlying funds do not expire, the disclosure required by § 205.20(e)(3)(i) need not be stated on the certificate or card. If the certificate or card and underlying funds expire at the same time, only one expiration date need be disclosed on the certificate or card.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Reference to toll-free telephone number and Web site.</E> If a certificate or card does not expire, or if the underlying funds are not available after the certificate or card expires, the disclosure required by § 205.20(e)(3)(ii) need not be stated on the certificate or card. <E T="03">See, however,</E> § 205.20(f)(2).</P>
            <P>6. <E T="03">Relationship to § 226.20(f)(2).</E> The same toll-free telephone number and Web site may be used to comply with §§ 226.20(e)(3)(ii) and (f)(2). Neither a toll-free number nor a Web site must be maintained or disclosed if no fees are imposed in connection with a certificate or card, and the certificate or card and the underlying funds do not expire.</P>
            <P>7. <E T="03">Distinguishing between certificate or card expiration and funds expiration.</E> If applicable, a disclosure must be made on the certificate or card that notifies a consumer that the certificate or card expires, but the funds either do not expire or expire later than the certificate or card, and that the consumer may contact the issuer for a replacement card. The disclosure must be made with equal prominence and in close proximity to the certificate or card expiration date. The close proximity requirement does not apply to oral disclosures. In the case of a certificate or card, close proximity means that the disclosure must be on the same side as the certificate or card expiration date. For example, if the disclosure is the same type size and is located immediately next to or directly above or below the certificate or card expiration date, without any intervening text or graphical displays, the disclosures would be deemed to be equally prominent and in close proximity. The disclosure need not be embossed on the certificate or card to be deemed equally prominent, even if the expiration date is embossed on the certificate or card. The disclosure may state on the front of the card, for example, “Funds expire after card. Call for replacement card.” or “Funds do not expire. Call for new card after 09/2016.” Disclosures made pursuant to § 205.20(e)(3)(iii)(A) may also fulfill the requirements of § 205.20(e)(3)(i). For example, making a disclosure that “Funds do not expire” to comply with § 205.20(e)(3)(iii)(A) also fulfills the requirements of § 205.20(e)(3)(i).</P>
            <P>8. <E T="03">Expiration date safe harbor.</E> A non-reloadable certificate or card that bears an expiration date that is at least seven years from the date of manufacture need not state the disclosure required by § 205.20(e)(3)(iii). <PRTPAGE P="171"/>However, § 205.20(e)(1) still prohibits the sale or issuance of such certificate or card unless there are policies and procedures in place to provide a consumer with a reasonable opportunity to purchase the certificate or card with at least five years remaining until the certificate or card expiration date. In addition, under § 205.20(e)(2), the funds may not expire before the certificate or card expiration date, even if the expiration date of the certificate or card bears an expiration date that is more than five years at the date of purchase. For purposes of this safe harbor, the date of manufacture is the date on which the certificate or card expiration date is printed on the certificate or card.</P>
            <P>9. <E T="03">Relationship between §§ 205.20(d)(2), (e)(3), and (f)(2).</E> In addition to any disclosures required to be made under § 205.20(e)(3), any applicable disclosures under §§ 205.20(d)(2) and (f)(2) must also be provided on the certificate or card.</P>
            <P>10. <E T="03">Replacement or remaining balance of an expired certificate or card.</E> When a certificate or card expires, but the underlying funds have not expired, an issuer, at its option in accordance with applicable state law, may provide either a replacement certificate or card or otherwise provide the certificate or card holder, for example, by check, with the remaining balance on the certificate or card. In either case, the issuer may not charge a fee for the service.</P>
            <P>11. <E T="03">Replacement of a lost or stolen certificate or card not required.</E> Section 205.20(e)(4) does not require the replacement of a certificate or card that has been lost or stolen.</P>
            <P>12. <E T="03">Date of issuance or loading.</E> For purposes of § 205.20(e)(2)(i), a certificate or card is not issued or loaded with funds until the certificate or card is activated for use.</P>
            <P>13. <E T="03">Application of expiration date provisions after redemption of certificate or card.</E> The requirement that funds underlying a certificate or card must not expire for at least five years from the date of issuance or date of last load ceases to apply once the certificate or card has been fully redeemed, even if the underlying funds are not used to contemporaneously purchase a specific good or service. For example, some certificates or cards can be used to purchase music, media, or virtual goods. Once redeemed by a consumer, the entire balance on the certificate or card is debited from the certificate or card and credited or transferred to another “account” established by the merchant of such goods or services. The consumer can then make purchases of songs, media, or virtual goods from the merchant using that “account” either at the time the value is transferred from the certificate or card or at a later time. Under these circumstances, once the card has been fully redeemed and the “account” credited with the amount of the underlying funds, the five-year minimum expiration term no longer applies to the underlying funds. However, if the consumer only partially redeems the value of the certificate or card, the five-year minimum expiration term requirement continues to apply to the funds remaining on the certificate or card.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">20(f) Additional Disclosure Requirements for Gift Certificates or Cards</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Reference to toll-free telephone number and Web site.</E> If a certificate or card does not have any fees, the disclosure under § 205.20(f)(2) is not required on the certificate or card. <E T="03">See, however,</E> § 205.20(e)(3)(ii).</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Relationship to § 226.20(e)(3)(ii).</E> The same toll-free telephone number and Web site may be used to comply with §§ 226.20(e)(3)(ii) and (f)(2). Neither a toll-free number nor a Web site must be maintained or disclosed if no fees are imposed in connection with a certificate or card, and both the certificate or card and underlying funds do not expire.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Relationship between §§ 205.20(d)(2), (e)(3), and (f)(2).</E> In addition to any disclosures required pursuant to § 205.20(f)(2), any applicable disclosures under §§ 205.20(d)(2) and (e)(3) must also be provided on the certificate or card.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">20(g) Compliance Dates</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Period of eligibility for loyalty, award, or promotional programs.</E> For purposes of § 205.20(g)(2), the period of eligibility is the time period during which a consumer must engage in a certain action or actions to meet the terms of eligibility for a loyalty, award, or promotional program and obtain the card, code, or other device. Under § 205.20(g)(2), a gift card issued pursuant to a loyalty, award, or promotional program that began prior to August 22, 2010 need not state the disclosures in § 205.20(a)(4)(iii) regardless of whether the consumer became eligible to receive the gift card prior to August 22, 2010, or after that date. For example, a product manufacturer may provide a $20 rebate card to a consumer if the consumer purchases a particular product and submits a fully completed entry between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2010. Similarly, a merchant may provide a $20 gift card to a consumer if the consumer makes $200 worth of qualifying purchases between June 1, 2010 and October 30, 2010. Under both examples, gift cards provided pursuant to these loyalty, award, or promotional programs need not state the disclosures in § 205.20(a)(4)(iii) to qualify for the exclusion in § 205.20(b)(3) for loyalty, award, or promotional gift cards because the period of eligibility for each program began prior to August 22, 2010.</P>

            <P>1. <E T="03">Application to certificates or cards produced prior to April 1, 2010.</E> Certificates or <PRTPAGE P="172"/>cards produced prior to April 1, 2010 may be sold to a consumer on or after August 22, 2010 without satisfying the requirements of § 205.20(c)(3), (d)(2), (e)(1), (e)(3), and (f) through January 30, 2011, provided that issuers of such certificates or cards comply with the additional substantive and disclosure requirements of §§ 205.20(h)(1)(i) through (iv). Issuers of certificates or cards produced prior to April 1, 2010 need not satisfy these additional requirements if the certificates or cards fully comply with the rule (§§ 205.20(a) through (f)). For example, the in-store signage and other disclosures required by § 205.20(h)(2) do not apply to gift cards produced prior to April 1, 2010 that do not have fees and do not expire, and which otherwise comply with the rule.</P>

            <P>1. <E T="03">Disclosures through third parties.</E> Issuers may make the disclosures required by § 205.20(h)(2) through a third party, such as a retailer or merchant. For example, an issuer may have a merchant install in-store signage with the disclosures required by § 205.20(h)(2) on the issuer's behalf.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Appendix A—Model Disclosure Clauses and Forms</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Review of forms.</E> The Board will not review or approve disclosure forms or statements for financial institutions. However, the Board has issued model clauses for institutions to use in designing their disclosures. If an institution uses these clauses accurately to reflect its service, the institution is protected from liability for failure to make disclosures in proper form.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Use of forms.</E> The appendix contains model disclosure clauses for optional use by financial institutions to facilitate compliance with the disclosure requirements of sections 205.5(b)(2) and (b)(3), 205.6(a), 205.7, 205.8(b), 205.14(b)(1)(ii), 205.15(d)(1) and (d)(2), and 205.18(c)(1) and (c)(2). The use of appropriate clauses in making disclosures will protect a financial institution from liability under sections 915 and 916 of the act provided the clauses accurately reflect the institution's EFT services.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Altering the clauses.</E> Financial institutions may use clauses of their own design in conjunction with the Board's model clauses. The inapplicable words or portions of phrases in parentheses should be deleted. The catchlines are not part of the clauses and need not be used. Financial institutions may make alterations, substitutions, or additions in the clauses to reflect the services offered, such as technical changes (including the substitution of a trade name for the word “card,” deletion of inapplicable services, or substitution of lesser liability limits). Several of the model clauses include references to a telephone number and address. Where two or more of these clauses are used in a disclosure, the telephone number and address may be referenced and need not be repeated.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Authority and purpose.</E> This part (Regulation F, 12 CFR part 206) is issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) under authority of section 23 of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 371b-2). The purpose of this part is to limit the risks that the failure of a depository institution would pose to insured depository institutions.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Scope.</E> This part applies to all depository institutions insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.</P>
            <CITA>[Reg. F, 57 FR 60106, Dec. 18, 1992, as amended by Reg. F, 68 FR 53283, Sept. 10, 2003]</CITA>

            <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>As used in this part, unless the context requires otherwise:</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Bank</E> means an insured depository institution, as defined in section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 <PRTPAGE P="173"/>U.S.C. 1813), and includes an insured national bank, state bank, District bank, or savings association, and an insured branch of a foreign bank.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Commonly-controlled correspondent</E> means a correspondent that is commonly controlled with the bank and for which the bank is subject to liability under section 5(e) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. A correspondent is considered to be commonly controlled with the bank if:</P>
            <P>(1) 25 percent or more of any class of voting securities of the bank and the correspondent are owned, directly or indirectly, by the same depository institution or company; or</P>
            <P>(2) Either the bank or the correspondent owns 25 percent or more of any class of voting securities of the other.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Correspondent</E> means a U.S. depository institution or a foreign bank, as defined in this part, to which a bank has exposure, but does not include a commonly controlled correspondent.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Exposure</E> means the potential that an obligation will not be paid in a timely manner or in full. “Exposure” includes credit and liquidity risks, including operational risks, related to intraday and interday transactions.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Foreign bank</E> means an institution that: (1) Is organized under the laws of a country other than the United States;</P>
            <P>(2) Engages in the business of banking;</P>
            <P>(3) Is recognized as a bank by the bank supervisory or monetary authorities of the country of the bank's organization;</P>
            <P>(4) Receives deposits to a substantial extent in the regular course of business; and</P>
            <P>(5) Has the power to accept demand deposits.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Primary federal supervisor</E> has the same meaning as the term “appropriate Federal banking agency” in section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813).</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Total capital</E> means the total of a bank's Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital under the risk-based capital guidelines provided by the bank's primary federal supervisor. For an insured branch of a foreign bank organized under the laws of a country that subscribes to the principles of the Basel Capital Accord, “total capital” means total Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital as calculated under the standards of that country. For an insured branch of a foreign bank organized under the laws of a country that does not subscribe to the principles of the Basel Capital Accord, “total capital” means total Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital as calculated under the provisions of the Accord.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">U.S. depository institution</E> means a bank, as defined in § 206.2(a) of this part, other than an insured branch of a foreign bank.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Prudential standards.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> A bank shall establish and maintain written policies and procedures to prevent excessive exposure to any individual correspondent in relation to the condition of the correspondent.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Standards for selecting correspondents.</E> (1) A bank shall establish policies and procedures that take into account credit and liquidity risks, including operational risks, in selecting correspondents and terminating those relationships.</P>
            <P>(2) Where exposure to a correspondent is significant, the policies and procedures shall require periodic reviews of the financial condition of the correspondent and shall take into account any deterioration in the correspondent's financial condition. Factors bearing on the financial condition of the correspondent include the capital level of the correspondent, level of nonaccrual and past due loans and leases, level of earnings, and other factors affecting the financial condition of the correspondent. Where public information on the financial condition of the correspondent is available, a bank may base its review of the financial condition of a correspondent on such information, and is not required to obtain non-public information for its review. However, for those foreign banks for which there is no public source of financial information, a bank will be required to obtain information for its review.</P>

            <P>(3) A bank may rely on another party, such as a bank rating agency or <PRTPAGE P="174"/>the bank's holding company, to assess the financial condition of or select a correspondent, provided that the bank's board of directors has reviewed and approved the general assessment or selection criteria used by that party.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Internal limits on exposure.</E> (1) Where the financial condition of the correspondent and the form or maturity of the exposure create a significant risk that payments will not be made in full or in a timely manner, a bank's policies and procedures shall limit the bank's exposure to the correspondent, either by the establishment of internal limits or by other means. Limits shall be consistent with the risk undertaken, considering the financial condition and the form and maturity of exposure to the correspondent. Limits may be fixed as to amount or flexible, based on such factors as the monitoring of exposure and the financial condition of the correspondent. Different limits may be set for different forms of exposure, different products, and different maturities.</P>
            <P>(2) A bank shall structure transactions with a correspondent or monitor exposure to a correspondent, directly or through another party, to ensure that its exposure ordinarily does not exceed the bank's internal limits, including limits established for credit exposure, except for occasional excesses resulting from unusual market disturbances, market movements favorable to the bank, increases in activity, operational problems, or other unusual circumstances. Generally, monitoring may be done on a retrospective basis. The level of monitoring required depends on:</P>
            <P>(i) The extent to which exposure approaches the bank's internal limits;</P>
            <P>(ii) The volatility of the exposure; and</P>
            <P>(iii) The financial condition of the correspondent.</P>
            <P>(3) A bank shall establish appropriate procedures to address excesses over its internal limits.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Review by board of directors.</E> The policies and procedures established under this section shall be reviewed and approved by the bank's board of directors at least annually.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Credit exposure.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Limits on credit exposure.</E> (1) The policies and procedures on exposure established by a bank under § 206.3(c) of this part shall limit a bank's interday credit exposure to an individual correspondent to not more than 25 percent of the bank's total capital, unless the bank can demonstrate that its correspondent is at least adequately capitalized, as defined in § 206.5(a) of this part.</P>
            <P>(2) Where a bank is no longer able to demonstrate that a correspondent is at least adequately capitalized for the purposes of § 206.4(a) of this part, including where the bank cannot obtain adequate information concerning the capital ratios of the correspondent, the bank shall reduce its credit exposure to comply with the requirements of § 206.4(a)(1) of this part within 120 days after the date when the current Report of Condition and Income or other relevant report normally would be available.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Calculation of credit exposure.</E> Except as provided in §§ 206.4 (c) and (d) of this part, the credit exposure of a bank to a correspondent shall consist of the bank's assets and off-balance sheet items that are subject to capital requirements under the capital adequacy guidelines of the bank's primary federal supervisor, and that involve claims on the correspondent or capital instruments issued by the correspondent. For this purpose, off-balance sheet items shall be valued on the basis of current exposure. The term “credit exposure” does not include exposure related to the settlement of transactions, intraday exposure, transactions in an agency or similar capacity where losses will be passed back to the principal or other party, or other sources of exposure that are not covered by the capital adequacy guidelines.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Netting.</E> Transactions covered by netting agreements that are valid and enforceable under all applicable laws may be netted in calculating credit exposure.<PRTPAGE P="175"/>
            </P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Exclusions.</E> A bank may exclude the following from the calculation of credit exposure to a correspondent:</P>
            <P>(1) Transactions, including reverse repurchase agreements, to the extent that the transactions are secured by government securities or readily marketable collateral, as defined in paragraph (f) of this section, based on the current market value of the collateral;</P>
            <P>(2) The proceeds of checks and other cash items deposited in an account at a correspondent that are not yet available for withdrawal;</P>
            <P>(3) Quality assets, as defined in paragraph (f) of this section, on which the correspondent is secondarily liable, or obligations of the correspondent on which a creditworthy obligor in addition to the correspondent is available, including but not limited to:</P>
            <P>(i) Loans to third parties secured by stock or debt obligations of the correspondent;</P>
            <P>(ii) Loans to third parties purchased from the correspondent with recourse;</P>
            <P>(iii) Loans or obligations of third parties backed by stand-by letters of credit issued by the correspondent; or</P>
            <P>(iv) Obligations of the correspondent backed by stand-by letters of credit issued by a creditworthy third party;</P>
            <P>(4) exposure that results from the merger with or acquisition of another bank for one year after that merger or acquisition is consummated; and</P>
            <P>(5) The portion of the bank's exposure to the correspondent that is covered by federal deposit insurance.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Credit exposure of subsidiaries.</E> In calculating credit exposure to a correspondent under this part, a bank shall include credit exposure to the correspondent of any entity that the bank is required to consolidate on its Report of Condition and Income or Thrift Financial Report.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> As used in this section:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Government securities</E> means obligations of, or obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the United States government or any department, agency, bureau, board, commission, or establishment of the United States, or any corporation wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by the United States.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Readily marketable collateral</E> means financial instruments or bullion that may be sold in ordinary circumstances with reasonable promptness at a fair market value determined by quotations based on actual transactions on an auction or a similarly available daily bid- ask-price market.</P>
            <P>(3)(i) <E T="03">Quality asset</E> means an asset:</P>
            <P>(A) That is not in a nonaccrual status;</P>
            <P>(B) On which principal or interest is not more than thirty days past due; and</P>
            <P>(C) Whose terms have not been renegotiated or compromised due to the deteriorating financial conditions of the additional obligor.</P>
            <P>(ii) An asset is not considered a “quality asset” if any other loans to the primary obligor on the asset have been classified as “substandard,” “doubtful,” or “loss,” or treated as “other loans specially mentioned” in the most recent report of examination or inspection of the bank or an affiliate prepared by either a federal or a state supervisory agency.</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Frequency of monitoring capital levels.</E> A bank shall obtain information to demonstrate that a correspondent is at least adequately capitalized on a quarterly basis, either from the most recently available Report of Condition and Income, Thrift Financial Report, <PRTPAGE P="176"/>financial statement, or bank rating report for the correspondent. For a foreign bank correspondent for which quarterly financial statements or reports are not available, a bank shall obtain such information on as frequent a basis as such information is available.

            <P>(1) <E T="03">Total risk-based capital ratio</E> means the ratio of qualifying total capital to weighted risk assets.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio</E> means the ratio of Tier 1 capital to weighted risk assets.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Definition of covered agreement.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General definition of covered agreement.</E> A covered agreement is any contract, arrangement, or understanding that meets all of the following criteria—</P>
            <P>(1) The agreement is in writing.</P>
            <P>(2) The parties to the agreement include—</P>
            <P>(i) One or more insured depository institutions or affiliates of an insured depository institution; and</P>
            <P>(ii) One or more nongovernmental entities or persons (referred to hereafter as NGEPs).</P>
            <P>(3) The agreement provides for the insured depository institution or any affiliate to—</P>
            <P>(i) Provide to one or more individuals or entities (whether or not parties to the agreement) cash payments, grants, or other consideration (except loans) that have an aggregate value of more than $10,000 in any calendar year; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Make to one or more individuals or entities (whether or not parties to the agreement) loans that have an aggregate principal amount of more than $50,000 in any calendar year.</P>

            <P>(4) The agreement is made pursuant to, or in connection with, the fulfillment of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (12 U.S.C. 2901 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) (CRA), as defined in § 207.4.</P>
            <P>(5) The agreement is with a NGEP that has had a CRA communication as described in § 207.3 prior to entering into the agreement.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Examples concerning written arrangements or understandings</E>—(1) <E T="03">Example 1.</E> A NGEP meets with an insured depository institution and states that the institution needs to make more community development investments in the NGEP's community. The NGEP and insured depository institution do not reach an agreement concerning the community development investments the institution should make in the community, and the parties do not reach any mutual arrangement or understanding. Two weeks later, the institution unilaterally issues a press release announcing that it has established a general goal of making $100 million of community development grants in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods served by the insured depository institution over the next 5 years. The NGEP is not identified in the press release. The press release is not a written arrangement or understanding.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Example 2.</E> A NGEP meets with an insured depository institution and states that the institution needs to offer new loan programs in the NGEP's community. The NGEP and the insured depository institution reach a mutual arrangement or understanding that the institution will provide additional loans in the NGEP's community. The institution tells the NGEP that it will issue a press release announcing the program. Later, the insured depository institution issues a press release announcing the loan program. The press release incorporates the key terms of the understanding reached between the <PRTPAGE P="178"/>NGEP and the insured depository institution. The written press release reflects the mutual arrangement or understanding of the NGEP and the insured depository institution and is, therefore, a written arrangement or understanding.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Example 3.</E> An NGEP sends a letter to an insured depository institution requesting that the institution provide a $15,000 grant to the NGEP. The insured depository institution responds in writing and agrees to provide the grant in connection with its annual grant program. The exchange of letters constitutes a written arrangement or understanding.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Loan agreements that are not covered agreements.</E> A covered agreement does not include—</P>
            <P>(1) Any individual loan that is secured by real estate; or</P>
            <P>(2) Any specific contract or commitment for a loan or extension of credit to an individual, business, farm, or other entity, or group of such individuals or entities, if—</P>
            <P>(i) The funds are loaned at rates that are not substantially below market rates; and</P>
            <P>(ii) The loan application or other loan documentation does not indicate that the borrower intends or is authorized to use the borrowed funds to make a loan or extension of credit to one or more third parties.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Examples concerning loan agreements</E>—(1) <E T="03">Example 1.</E> An insured depository institution provides an organization with a $1 million loan that is documented in writing and is secured by real estate owned or to-be-acquired by the organization. The agreement is an individual mortgage loan and is exempt from coverage under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, regardless of the interest rate on the loan or whether the organization intends or is authorized to re-loan the funds to a third party.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Example 2.</E> An insured depository institution commits to provide a $500,000 line of credit to a small business that is documented by a written agreement. The loan is made at rates that are within the range of rates offered by the institution to similarly situated small businesses in the market and the loan documentation does not indicate that the small business intends or is authorized to re-lend the borrowed funds. The agreement is exempt from coverage under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Example 3.</E> An insured depository institution offers small business loans that are guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA). A small business obtains a $75,000 loan, documented in writing, from the institution under the institution's SBA loan program. The loan documentation does not indicate that the borrower intends or is authorized to re-lend the funds. Although the rate charged on the loan is well below that charged by the institution on commercial loans, the rate is within the range of rates that the institution would charge a similarly situated small business for a similar loan under the SBA loan program. Accordingly, the loan is not made at substantially below market rates and is exempt from coverage under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Example 4.</E> A bank holding company enters into a written agreement with a community development organization that provides that insured depository institutions owned by the bank holding company will make $250 million in small business loans in the community over the next 5 years. The written agreement is not a specific contract or commitment for a loan or an extension of credit and, thus, is not exempt from coverage under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Each small business loan made by the insured depository institution pursuant to this general commitment would, however, be exempt from coverage if the loan is made at rates that are not substantially below market rates and the loan documentation does not indicate that the borrower intended or was authorized to re-lend the funds.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Agreements that include exempt loan agreements.</E> If an agreement includes a loan, extension of credit or loan commitment that, if documented separately, would be exempt under paragraph (c) of this section, the exempt loan, extension of credit or loan commitment may be excluded for purposes of determining whether the agreement is a covered agreement.<PRTPAGE P="179"/>
            </P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Determining annual value of agreements that lack schedule of disbursements.</E> For purposes of paragraph (a)(3) of this section, a multi-year agreement that does not include a schedule for the disbursement of payments, grants, loans or other consideration by the insured depository institution or affiliate, is considered to have a value in the first year of the agreement equal to all payments, grants, loans and other consideration to be provided at any time under the agreement.</P>

These examples are not exclusive and assume that the communication occurs within the relevant time period as described in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section and the appropriate representatives have knowledge of the communication as specified in paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Example 1.</E> A NGEP files a written comment with a Federal banking agency that states than an insured depository institution successfully addresses the credit needs of its community. The written comment is in response to a general request from the agency for comments on an application of the insured depository institution to open a new branch and a copy of the comment is provided to the institution.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Example 2.</E> A NGEP meets with an executive officer of an insured depository institution and states that the institution must improve its CRA performance.</P>

            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Example 4.</E> A bank holding company files an application with a Federal banking agency to acquire an insured depository institution. Two weeks later, the NGEP meets with an executive officer of the bank holding company to discuss the adequacy of the performance under the CRA of the target insured depository institution. The insured depository institution was an affiliate of the bank holding company at the time the NGEP met with the target institution. (See § 207.11(a).) Accordingly, the NGEP had a CRA communication with an affiliate of the bank holding company.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Examples of actions that are not CRA communications.</E> The following are examples of actions that are not by themselves CRA communications. These examples are not exclusive.</P>

            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Example 2.</E> A NGEP makes a statement concerning an insured depository institution or affiliate at a widely attended conference or seminar regarding a general topic.

            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Example 4.</E> A NGEP discusses with an insured depository institution or affiliate whether particular loans, services, investments, community development activities, or other activities are generally eligible for consideration by a Federal banking agency under the CRA. The NGEP and insured depository institution or affiliate do not discuss the adequacy of the CRA performance of the insured depository institution or affiliate.</P>
            <P>(v) <E T="03">Example 5.</E> A NGEP engaged in the sale or purchase of loans in the secondary market sends a general offering circular to financial institutions offering to sell or purchase a portfolio of loans. An insured depository institution that receives the offering circular discusses with the NGEP the types of loans included in the loan pool, whether such loans are generally eligible for consideration under the CRA, and which loans are made to borrowers in the institution's local community. The NGEP and insured depository institution do not discuss the adequacy of the institution's CRA performance.</P>

            <P>(2) <E T="03">More detailed reporting of uses of funds or resources permitted</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> If a NGEP allocated and used funds received under a covered agreement for a specific purpose, the NGEP may fulfill the requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section with respect to such funds by providing—</P>
            <P>(A) A brief description of each specific purpose for which the funds or other resources were used; and</P>
            <P>(B) The amount of funds or resources used during the fiscal year for each specific purpose.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Specific purpose defined.</E> A NGEP allocates and uses funds for a specific purpose if the NGEP receives and uses the funds for a purpose that is more specific and limited than the categories listed in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Use of other reports.</E> The annual report filed by a NGEP may consist of or incorporate a report prepared for any other purpose, such as the Internal Revenue Service Return of Organization Exempt From Income Tax on Form 990, or any other Internal Revenue Service form, state tax form, report to members or shareholders, audited or unaudited financial statements, audit report, or other report, so long as the annual report filed by the <PRTPAGE P="185"/>NGEP contains all of the information required by this paragraph (d).</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Consolidated reports permitted.</E> A NGEP that is a party to 2 or more covered agreements may file with each relevant supervisory agency a single consolidated annual report covering all the covered agreements. Any consolidated report must contain all the information required by this paragraph (d). The information reported under paragraphs (d)(1)(iv) and (d)(2) of this section may be reported on an aggregate basis for all covered agreements.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Examples of annual report requirements for NGEPs</E>—(i) <E T="03">Example 1.</E> A NGEP receives an unrestricted grant of $15,000 under a covered agreement, includes the funds in its general operating budget and uses the funds during its fiscal year. The NGEP's annual report for the fiscal year must provide the name and mailing address of the NGEP, information sufficient to identify the covered agreement, and state that the NGEP received $15,000 during the fiscal year. The report must also indicate the total expenditures made by the NGEP during the fiscal year for compensation, administrative expenses, travel expenses, entertainment expenses, consulting and professional fees, and other expenses and uses. The NGEP's annual report may provide this information by submitting an Internal Revenue Service Form 990 that includes the required information. If the Internal Revenue Service Form does not include information for all of the required categories listed in this part, the NGEP must report the total expenditures in the remaining categories either by providing that information directly or by providing another form or report that includes the required information.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Example 2.</E> An organization receives $15,000 from an insured depository institution under a covered agreement and allocates and uses the $15,000 during the fiscal year to purchase computer equipment to support its functions. The organization's annual report must include the name and address of the organization, information sufficient to identify the agreement, and a statement that the organization received $15,000 during the year. In addition, since the organization allocated and used the funds for a specific purpose that is more narrow and limited than the categories of expenses included in the detailed, itemized list of expenses, the organization would have the option of providing either the total amount it used during the year for each category of expenses included in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section, or a statement that it used the $15,000 to purchase computer equipment and a brief description of the equipment purchased.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Example 3.</E> A community group receives $50,000 from an insured depository institution under a covered agreement. During its fiscal year, the community group specifically allocates and uses $5,000 of the funds to pay for a particular business trip and uses the remaining $45,000 for general operating expenses. The group's annual report for the fiscal year must include the name and address of the group, information sufficient to identify the agreement, and a statement that the group received $50,000. Because the group did not allocate and use all of the funds for a specific purpose, the group's annual report must provide the total amount of funds it used during the year for each category of expenses included in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section. The group's annual report also could state that it used $5,000 for a particular business trip and include a brief description of the trip.</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Example 4.</E> A community development organization is a party to two separate covered agreements with two unaffiliated insured depository institutions. Under each agreement, the organization receives $15,000 during its fiscal year and uses the funds to support its activities during that year. If the organization elects to file a consolidated annual report, the consolidated report must identify the organization and the two covered agreements, state that the organization received $15,000 during the fiscal year under each agreement, and provide the total amount that the organization used during the year for each category of expenses included in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="186"/>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For the purposes of this section:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Capital surplus</E> means the total of surplus as reportable in the bank's Reports of Condition and Income and surplus on perpetual preferred stock.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Permanent capital</E> means the total of the bank's perpetual preferred stock and related surplus, common stock and surplus, and minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries, as reportable in the Reports of Condition and Income.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Limitations.</E> The limitations in this section on the payment of dividends and withdrawal of capital apply to all cash and property dividends or distributions on common or preferred stock. The limitations do not apply to dividends paid in the form of common stock.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Earnings limitations on payment of dividends.</E> (1) A member bank may not declare or pay a dividend if the total of all dividends declared during the calendar year, including the proposed dividend, exceeds the sum of the bank's net income (as reportable in its Reports of Condition and Income) during the current calendar year and the retained net income of the prior two calendar years, unless the dividend has been approved by the Board.</P>
              <P>(2) “Retained net income” in a calendar year is equal to the bank's net income (as reported in its Report of Condition and Income for such year), less any dividends declared during such year. <SU>3</SU>
                <FTREF/> The bank's net income during the current year and its retained net income from the prior two calendar years is reduced by any net losses incurred in the current or prior two years and any required transfers to surplus or to a fund for the retirement of preferred stock. <SU>4</SU>

                <P>
                  <SU>3</SU> In the case of dividends in excess of net income for the year, a bank generally is not required to carry forward negative amounts resulting from such excess. Instead, the bank may attribute the excess to the prior two years, attributing the excess first to the earlier year and then to the immediately preceding year. If the excess is greater than the bank's previously undistributed net income for the preceding two years, prior Board approval of the dividend is required and a negative amount would be carried forward in future dividend calculations. However, in determining any such request for approval, the Board could consider any request for different treatment of such negative amount, including advance waivers for future periods. This applies only to earnings deficits that result from dividends declared in excess of net income for the year and does not apply to other types of current earnings deficits.</P>

              <P>(2) A member bank may not permit any portion of its permanent capital to be withdrawn unless the withdrawal has been approved by the Board and by at least two-thirds of the shareholders of each class of stock outstanding.</P>
              <P>(3) If a member bank has capital surplus in excess of that required by law, the excess amount may be transferred to the bank's undivided profits account and be available for the payment of dividends if:</P>
              <P>(i) The amount transferred came from the earnings of prior periods, excluding earnings transferred as a result of stock dividends;</P>
              <P>(ii) The bank's board of directors approves the transfer of funds; and</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Branching.</E> (1) To the extent authorized by state law, a member bank may establish and maintain branches (including interstate branches) subject to the same limitations and restrictions that apply to the establishment and maintenance of national bank branches (12 U.S.C. 36 and 1831u), except that approval of such branches shall be obtained from the Board rather than from the Comptroller of the Currency.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Branch applications.</E> A State member bank wishing to establish a branch in the United States or its territories must file an application in accordance with the Board's Rules of Procedure, located at 12 CFR 262.3, and must comply with the public notice and comment rules contained in paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) of this section.

              <P>(4) <E T="03">CRA performance.</E> In the case of branches with deposit-taking capability, the bank's performance under the Community Reinvestment Act (12 U.S.C. 2901 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) and Regulation BB (12 CFR part 228); and</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Investment in bank premises.</E> Whether the bank's investment in bank premises in establishing the branch is consistent with § 208.21.</P>

              <P>(i) An eligible bank; and</P>
              <P>(ii) A bank that cannot be determined to be an eligible bank because it has not received CAMELS compliance or CRA ratings from a bank regulatory authority, if it is controlled by a bank holding company that meets the criteria for expedited processing under § 225.14(c) of Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.14(c)).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Expedited procedures.</E> A completed domestic branch application filed with the appropriate Reserve Bank will be deemed approved on the fifth day after the close of the comment period, unless the Board or the appropriate Reserve Bank notifies the bank that the application is approved prior to that date (but in no case will an application be approved before the third day after the close of the public comment period) or the Board or the appropriate Federal Reserve Bank notifies the bank that the application is not eligible for expedited review for any reason, including, without limitation, that:</P>
              <P>(i) The bank or bank holding company does not meet the criteria under § 208.6(c)(1);</P>
              <P>(ii) The application contains a material error or is otherwise deficient; or</P>
              <P>(iii) The application or the notice required under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, raises significant supervisory, Community Reinvestment Act, compliance, policy or legal issues that have not been resolved, or a timely substantive adverse comment is submitted. A comment will be considered substantive unless it involves individual complaints, or raises frivolous, previously considered, or wholly unsubstantiated claims or irrelevant issues.</P>

A bank is not required to open a branch approved under either a consolidated or single branch application.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Duration of branch approval.</E> Branch approvals remain valid for one year unless the Board or the appropriate Reserve Bank notifies the bank that in its judgment, based on reports of condition, examinations, or other information, there has been a change in the bank's condition, financial or otherwise, that warrants reconsideration of the approval.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Branch closings.</E> A member bank shall comply with section 42 of the FDI Act (FDI Act), 12 U.S.C. 1831r-1, with regard to branch closings.</P>

              <P>(i) May order that a bank's covered interstate branch or branches be closed unless the bank provides reasonable assurances to the satisfaction of the Board, after an opportunity for public comment, that the bank has an acceptable plan under which the bank will reasonably help to meet the credit needs of the communities served by the bank in the host state; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Will not permit the bank to open a new branch in the host state that would be considered to be a covered interstate branch unless the bank provides reasonable assurances to the satisfaction of the Board, after an opportunity for public comment, that the bank will reasonably help to meet the credit needs of the community that the new branch will serve.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Notice prior to closure of a covered interstate branch.</E> Before exercising the Board's authority to order the bank to close a covered interstate branch, the Board will issue to the bank a notice of the Board's intent to order the closure and will schedule a hearing within 60 days of issuing the notice.</P>

              <EXTRACT>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">Notice of Special Flood Hazards and Availability of Federal Disaster Relief Assistance</HD>
                <P>We are giving you this notice to inform you that:</P>
                <P>The building or mobile home securing the loan for which you have applied is or will be located in an area with special flood hazards.</P>

                <P>The area has been identified by the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as a special flood hazard area using FEMA's <E T="03">Flood Insurance Rate Map</E> or the <E T="03">Flood Hazard Boundary Map</E> for the following community: ___. This area has a one percent (1%) chance of a flood equal to or exceeding the base flood elevation (a 100-year flood) in any given year. During the life of a 30-year mortgage loan, the risk of a 100-year flood in a special flood hazard area is 26 percent (26%).</P>
                <P>Federal law allows a lender and borrower jointly to request the Administrator of FEMA to review the determination of whether the property securing the loan is located in a special flood hazard area. If you would like to make such a request, please contact us for further information.</P>
                <P>__ The community in which the property securing the loan is located participates in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Federal law will not allow us to make you the loan that you have applied for if you do not purchase flood insurance. The flood insurance must be maintained for the life of the loan. If you fail to purchase or renew flood insurance on the property, Federal law authorizes and requires us to purchase the flood insurance for you at your expense.</P>

                <P>• At a minimum, flood insurance purchased must cover <E T="03">the lesser of:</E>
                </P>
                <P>(1) the outstanding principal balance of the loan; <E T="03">or</E>
                </P>
                <P>(2) the maximum amount of coverage allowed for the type of property under the NFIP.</P>
                <P>Flood insurance coverage under the NFIP is limited to the building or mobile home and any personal property that secures your loan and not the land itself.</P>
                <P>• Federal disaster relief assistance (usually in the form of a low-interest loan) may be available for damages incurred in excess of your flood insurance if your community's participation in the NFIP is in accordance with NFIP requirements.</P>

                <P>• Although you may not be required to maintain flood insurance on all structures, <PRTPAGE P="208"/>you may still wish to do so, and your mortgage lender may still require you to do so to protect the collateral securing the mortgage. If you choose not to maintain flood insurance on a structure and it floods, you are responsible for all flood losses relating to that structure.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">Availability of Private Flood Insurance Coverage</HD>
                <P>Flood insurance coverage under the NFIP may be purchased through an insurance agent who will obtain the policy either directly through the NFIP or through an insurance company that participates in the NFIP. Flood insurance that provides the same level of coverage as a standard flood insurance policy under the NFIP may be available from private insurers that do not participate in the NFIP. You should compare the flood insurance coverage, deductibles, exclusions, conditions, and premiums associated with flood insurance policies issued on behalf of the NFIP and policies issued on behalf of private insurance companies and contact an insurance agent as to the availability, cost, and comparisons of flood insurance coverage.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">[Escrow Requirement for Residential Loans</HD>
                <P>Federal law may require a lender or its servicer to escrow all premiums and fees for flood insurance that covers any residential building or mobile home securing a loan that is located in an area with special flood hazards. If your lender notifies you that an escrow account is required for your loan, then you must pay your flood insurance premiums and fees to the lender or its servicer with the same frequency as you make loan payments for the duration of your loan. These premiums and fees will be deposited in the escrow account, which will be used to pay the flood insurance provider.]</P>
                <P>__ Flood insurance coverage under the NFIP is not available for the property securing the loan because the community in which the property is located does not participate in the NFIP. In addition, if the non-participating community has been identified for at least one year as containing a special flood hazard area, properties located in the community will not be eligible for Federal disaster relief assistance in the event of a Federally declared flood disaster.</P>

                <P>• Your payments will be deposited in an escrow account to be paid to the flood insurance provider.</P>
                <P>• The escrow amount for flood insurance will be added to the regular mortgage payment that you make to your lender or its servicer.</P>
                <P>• The payments you make into the escrow account will accumulate over time and the funds will be used to pay your flood insurance policy when your lender or servicer receives a notice from your flood insurance provider that the flood insurance premium is due.</P>

              <P>(d) <E T="03">Disclosure of capital categories.</E> The assignment of a bank under this subpart within a particular capital category is for purposes of implementing and applying the provisions of section 38.

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Schedule for filing plan</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> A member bank shall file a written capital restoration plan with the appropriate Reserve Bank within 45 days of the date that the bank receives notice or is deemed to have notice that the bank is undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized, unless the Board notifies the bank in writing that the plan is to be filed within a different period. An adequately capitalized bank that has been required, pursuant to § 208.43(c), to comply with supervisory actions as if the bank were undercapitalized is not required to submit a capital restoration plan solely by virtue of the reclassification.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Additional capital restoration plans.</E> Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a bank that has already submitted and is operating under a capital restoration plan approved under section 38 and this subpart is not required to submit an additional capital restoration plan based on a revised calculation of its capital measures or a reclassification of the institution <PRTPAGE P="224"/>under § 208.43(c), unless the Board notifies the bank that it must submit a new or revised capital plan. A bank that is notified that it must submit a new or revised capital restoration plan shall file the plan in writing with the appropriate Reserve Bank within 45 days of receiving such notice, unless the Board notifies the bank in writing that the plan is to be filed within a different period.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Contents of plan.</E> All financial data submitted in connection with a capital restoration plan shall be prepared in accordance with the instructions provided on the Call Report, unless the Board instructs otherwise. The capital restoration plan shall include all of the information required to be filed under section 38(e)(2) of the FDI Act. A bank that is required to submit a capital restoration plan as the result of a reclassification of the bank pursuant to § 208.43(c) shall include a description of the steps the bank will take to correct the unsafe or unsound condition or practice. No plan shall be accepted unless it includes any performance guarantee described in section 38(e)(2)(C) of that Act by each company that controls the bank.</P>

The Board may extend the time within which notice regarding approval of a plan shall be provided.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Disapproval of capital plan.</E> If the Board does not approve a capital restoration plan, the bank shall submit a revised capital restoration plan within the time specified by the Board. Upon receiving notice that its capital restoration plan has not been approved, any undercapitalized member bank (as defined in § 208.43(b)(3)) shall be subject to all of the provisions of section 38 and this subpart applicable to significantly undercapitalized institutions. These provisions shall be applicable until such time as the Board approves a new or revised capital restoration plan submitted by the bank.</P>

              <P>(f) <E T="03">Failure to implement capital restoration plan.</E> Any undercapitalized member bank that fails in any material respect to implement a capital restoration plan shall be subject to all of the provisions of section 38 and this subpart applicable to significantly undercapitalized institutions.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Amendment of capital plan.</E> A bank that has filed an approved capital restoration plan may, after prior written notice to and approval by the Board, amend the plan to reflect a change in circumstance. Until such time as a proposed amendment has been approved, the bank shall implement the capital restoration plan as approved prior to the proposed amendment.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Notice to FDIC.</E> Within 45 days of the effective date of Board approval of a capital restoration plan, or any amendment to a capital restoration plan, the Board shall provide a copy of the plan or amendment to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Performance guarantee by companies that control a bank</E>—(1) <E T="03">Limitation on Liability.</E> (i) <E T="03">Amount limitation.</E> The aggregate liability under the guarantee provided under section 38 and this subpart for all companies that control a specific member bank that is required to submit a capital restoration plan under this subpart shall be limited to the lesser of:</P>
              <P>(A) An amount equal to 5.0 percent of the bank's total assets at the time the bank was notified or deemed to have notice that the bank was undercapitalized; or</P>
              <P>(B) The amount necessary to restore the relevant capital measures of the bank to the levels required for the bank to be classified as adequately capitalized, as those capital measures and levels are defined at the time that the bank initially fails to comply with a capital restoration plan under this subpart.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Limit on duration.</E> The guarantee and limit of liability under section 38 and this subpart shall expire after the <PRTPAGE P="225"/>Board notifies the bank that it has remained adequately capitalized for each of four consecutive calendar quarters. The expiration or fulfillment by a company of a guarantee of a capital restoration plan shall not limit the liability of the company under any guarantee required or provided in connection with any capital restoration plan filed by the same bank after expiration of the first guarantee.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Collection on guarantee.</E> Each company that controls a bank shall be jointly and severally liable for the guarantee for such bank as required under section 38 and this subpart, and the Board may require and collect payment of the full amount of that guarantee from any or all of the companies issuing the guarantee.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Failure to provide guarantee.</E> In the event that a bank that is controlled by a company submits a capital restoration plan that does not contain the guarantee required under section 38(e)(2) of the FDI Act, the bank shall, upon submission of the plan, be subject to the provisions of section 38 and this subpart that are applicable to banks that have not submitted an acceptable capital restoration plan.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Failure to perform guarantee.</E> Failure by any company that controls a bank to perform fully its guarantee of any capital plan shall constitute a material failure to implement the plan for purposes of section 38(f) of the FDI Act. Upon such failure, the bank shall be subject to the provisions of section 38 and this subpart that are applicable to banks that have failed in a material respect to implement a capital restoration plan.</P>

Such procedures may include, but are not limited to: maintaining a camera that records activity in the banking office; using identification devices, such as prerecorded serial-numbered bills, or chemical and electronic devices; and retaining a record of any robbery, burglary, or larceny committed against the bank;</P>
              <P>(iii) Provide for initial and periodic training of officers and employees in their responsibilities under the security program and in proper employee conduct during and after a burglary, robbery, or larceny; and</P>

              <P>(d) <E T="03">Annual reports.</E> The security officer for each member bank shall report at least annually to the bank's board of directors on the implementation, administration, and effectiveness of the security program.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Suspicious activity reports.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> This section ensures that a member bank files a Suspicious Activity Report when it detects a known or suspected violation of Federal law, or a suspicious transaction related to a money laundering activity or a violation of the Bank Secrecy Act. This section applies to all member banks.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For the purposes of this section:</P>

              <P>(1) <E T="03">Insider abuse involving any amount.</E> Whenever the member bank detects any known or suspected Federal criminal violation, or pattern of criminal violations, committed or attempted against the bank or involving a transaction or transactions conducted through the bank, where the bank believes that it was either an actual or potential victim of a criminal violation, or series of criminal violations, or that the bank was used to facilitate a criminal transaction, and the bank has a substantial basis for identifying one of its directors, officers, employees, agents or other institution-affiliated parties as having committed or aided in the commission of a criminal act regardless of the amount involved in the violation.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Violations aggregating $5,000 or more where a suspect can be identified.</E> Whenever the member bank detects any known or suspected Federal criminal violation, or pattern of criminal violations, committed or attempted against the bank or involving a transaction or transactions conducted through the bank and involving or aggregating $5,000 or more in funds or other assets, where the bank believes that it was either an actual or potential victim of a criminal violation, or series of criminal violations, or that the bank was used to facilitate a criminal transaction, and the bank has a substantial basis for identifying a possible suspect or group of suspects. If it is determined prior to filing this report that the identified suspect or group of suspects has used an “alias,” then information regarding the true identity of the suspect or group of suspects, as well as alias identifiers, such as drivers' licenses or social security numbers, addresses and telephone numbers, must be reported.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Violations aggregating $25,000 or more regardless of a potential suspect.</E> Whenever the member bank detects any known or suspected Federal criminal violation, or pattern of criminal violations, committed or attempted against the bank or involving a transaction or transactions conducted through the bank and involving or aggregating $25,000 or more in funds or other assets, where the bank believes that it was either an actual or potential victim of a criminal violation, or series of criminal violations, or that the bank was used to facilitate a criminal transaction, even though there is no substantial basis for identifying a possible suspect or group of suspects.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Transactions aggregating $5,000 or more that involve potential money laundering or violations of the Bank Secrecy Act.</E> Any transaction (which for purposes of this paragraph (c)(4) means a deposit, withdrawal, transfer between accounts, exchange of currency, loan, extension of credit, purchase or sale of any stock, bond, certificate of deposit, or other monetary instrument or investment security, or any other payment, transfer, or delivery by, through, or to a financial institution, by whatever means effected) conducted or attempted by, at or through the member bank and involving or aggregating $5,000 or more in funds or other assets, if the bank knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect that:</P>

              <P>(i) The transaction involves funds derived from illegal activities or is intended or conducted in order to hide or disguise funds or assets derived from illegal activities (including, without limitation, the ownership, nature, <PRTPAGE P="229"/>source, location, or control of such funds or assets) as part of a plan to violate or evade any law or regulation or to avoid any transaction reporting requirement under federal law;</P>
              <P>(ii) The transaction is designed to evade any regulations promulgated under the Bank Secrecy Act; or</P>
              <P>(iii) The transaction has no business or apparent lawful purpose or is not the sort in which the particular customer would normally be expected to engage, and the bank knows of no reasonable explanation for the transaction after examining the available facts, including the background and possible purpose of the transaction.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Time for reporting.</E> A member bank is required to file a SAR no later than 30 calendar days after the date of initial detection of facts that may constitute a basis for filing a SAR. If no suspect was identified on the date of detection of the incident requiring the filing, a member bank may delay filing a SAR for an additional 30 calendar days to identify a suspect. In no case shall reporting be delayed more than 60 calendar days after the date of initial detection of a reportable transaction. In situations involving violations requiring immediate attention, such as when a reportable violation is on-going, the financial institution shall immediately notify, by telephone, an appropriate law enforcement authority and the Board in addition to filing a timely SAR.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Reports to state and local authorities.</E> Member banks are encouraged to file a copy of the SAR with state and local law enforcement agencies where appropriate.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Exceptions.</E> (1) A member bank need not file a SAR for a robbery or burglary committed or attempted that is reported to appropriate law enforcement authorities.</P>
              <P>(2) A member bank need not file a SAR for lost, missing, counterfeit, or stolen securities if it files a report pursuant to the reporting requirements of 17 CFR 240.17f-1.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Retention of records.</E> A member bank shall maintain a copy of any SAR filed and the original or business record equivalent of any supporting documentation for a period of five years from the date of the filing of the SAR. Supporting documentation shall be identified and maintained by the bank as such, and shall be deemed to have been filed with the SAR. A member bank must make all supporting documentation available to appropriate law enforcement agencies upon request.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Notification to board of directors.</E> The management of a member bank shall promptly notify its board of directors, or a committee thereof, of any report filed pursuant to this section.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Compliance.</E> Failure to file a SAR in accordance with this section and the instructions may subject the member bank, its directors, officers, employees, agents, or other institution affiliated parties to supervisory action.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Confidentiality of SARs.</E> SARs are confidential. Any member bank subpoenaed or otherwise requested to disclose a SAR or the information contained in a SAR shall decline to produce the SAR or to provide any information that would disclose that a SAR has been prepared or filed citing this section, applicable law (e.g., 31 U.S.C. 5318(g)), or both, and notify the Board.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Safe harbor.</E> The safe harbor provisions of 31 U.S.C. 5318(g), which exempts any member bank that makes a disclosure of any possible violation of law or regulation from liability under any law or regulation of the United States, or any constitution, law or regulation of any state or political subdivision, covers all reports of suspected or known criminal violations and suspicious activities to law enforcement and financial institution supervisory authorities, including supporting documentation, regardless of whether such reports are filed pursuant to this section or are filed on a voluntary basis.</P>

              <P>This Appendix provides examples to aid in the understanding of activities that would cause an employee of a bank to fall within or outside the definition of mortgage loan originator. The examples in this Appendix are not all inclusive. They illustrate only the issue described and do not illustrate any other issues that may arise under this subpart. For purposes of the examples below, the term “loan” refers to a residential mortgage loan.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Taking a loan application.</E> The following examples illustrate when an employee takes, or does not take, a loan application.</P>
              <P>(1) Taking an application includes: receiving information provided in connection with a request for a loan to be used to determine whether the consumer qualifies for a loan, even if the employee:</P>
              <P>(i) Has received the consumer's information indirectly in order to make an offer or negotiate a loan;</P>
              <P>(ii) Is not responsible for verifying information;</P>
              <P>(iii) Is inputting information into an online application or other automated system on behalf of the consumer; or</P>
              <P>(iv) Is not engaged in approval of the loan, including determining whether the consumer qualifies for the loan.</P>
              <P>(2) Taking an application does not include any of the following activities performed solely or in combination:</P>
              <P>(i) Contacting a consumer to verify the information in the loan application by obtaining documentation, such as tax returns or payroll receipts;</P>
              <P>(ii) Receiving a loan application through the mail and forwarding it, without review, to loan approval personnel;</P>
              <P>(iii) Assisting a consumer who is filling out an application by clarifying what type of information is necessary for the application or otherwise explaining the qualifications or criteria necessary to obtain a loan product;</P>
              <P>(iv) Describing the steps that a consumer would need to take to provide information to be used to determine whether the consumer qualifies for a loan or otherwise explaining the loan application process;</P>
              <P>(v) In response to an inquiry regarding a prequalified offer that a consumer has received from a bank, collecting only basic identifying information about the consumer and forwarding the consumer to a mortgage loan originator; or</P>
              <P>(vi) Receiving information in connection with a modification to the terms of an existing loan to a borrower as part of the bank's loss mitigation efforts when the borrower is reasonably likely to default.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Offering or negotiating terms of a loan.</E> The following examples are designed to illustrate when an employee offers or negotiates terms of a loan, and conversely, what does not constitute offering or negotiating terms of a loan.</P>
              <P>(1) Offering or negotiating the terms of a loan includes:</P>
              <P>(i) Presenting a loan offer to a consumer for acceptance, either verbally or in writing, including, but not limited to, providing a disclosure of the loan terms after application under the Truth in Lending Act, even if:</P>
              <P>(A) Further verification of information is necessary;</P>
              <P>(B) The offer is conditional;</P>
              <P>(C) Other individuals must complete the loan process; or</P>

              <P>(D) Only the rate approved by the bank's loan approval mechanism function for a specific loan product is communicated without authority to negotiate the rate.<PRTPAGE P="246"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) Responding to a consumer's request for a lower rate or lower points on a pending loan application by presenting to the consumer a revised loan offer, either verbally or in writing, that includes a lower interest rate or lower points than the original offer.</P>
              <P>(2) Offering or negotiating terms of a loan does not include solely or in combination:</P>

              <P>(i) Providing general explanations or descriptions in response to consumer queries regarding qualification for a specific loan product, such as explaining loan terminology (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> debt-to-income ratio); lending policies (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the loan-to-value ratio policy of the bank); or product-related services;</P>
              <P>(ii) In response to a consumer's request, informing a consumer of the loan rates that are publicly available, such as on the bank's Web site, for specific types of loan products without communicating to the consumer whether qualifications are met for that loan product;</P>
              <P>(iii) Collecting information about a consumer in order to provide the consumer with information on loan products for which the consumer generally may qualify, without presenting a specific loan offer to the consumer for acceptance, either verbally or in writing;</P>
              <P>(iv) Arranging the loan closing or other aspects of the loan process, including communicating with a consumer about those arrangements, provided that communication with the consumer only verifies loan terms already offered or negotiated;</P>
              <P>(v) Providing a consumer with information unrelated to loan terms, such as the best days of the month for scheduling loan closings at the bank;</P>
              <P>(vi) Making an underwriting decision about whether the consumer qualifies for a loan;</P>
              <P>(vii) Explaining or describing the steps or process that a consumer would need to take in order to obtain a loan offer, including qualifications or criteria that would need to be met without providing guidance specific to that consumer's circumstances; or</P>
              <P>(viii) Communicating on behalf of a mortgage loan originator that a written offer, including disclosures provided pursuant to the Truth in Lending Act, has been sent to a consumer without providing any details of that offer.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Offering or negotiating a loan for compensation or gain.</E> The following examples illustrate when an employee does or does not offer or negotiate terms of a loan “for compensation or gain.”</P>
              <P>(1) Offering or negotiating terms of a loan for compensation or gain includes engaging in any of the activities in paragraph (b)(1) of this Appendix in the course of carrying out employment duties, even if the employee does not receive a referral fee or commission or other special compensation for the loan.</P>
              <P>(2) Offering or negotiating terms of a loan for compensation or gain does not include engaging in a seller-financed transaction for the employee's personal property that does not involve the bank.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Sale of bank's money orders off premises as establishment of branch office.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Board of Governors has been asked to consider whether the appointment by a member bank of an agent to sell the bank's money orders, at a location other than the premises of the bank, constitutes the establishment of a branch office.</P>
              <P>(b) Section 5155 of the Revised Statutes (12 U.S.C. 36), which is also applicable to member banks, defines the term branch as including “any branch bank, branch office, branch agency, additional office, or any branch place of business * * * at which deposits are received, or checks paid, or money lent.” The basic question is whether the sale of a bank's money orders by an agent amounts to the receipt of deposits at a branch place of business within the meaning of this statute.</P>
              <P>(c) Money orders are classified as deposits for certain purposes. However, they bear a strong resemblance to traveler's checks that are issued by banks and sold off premises. In both cases, the purchaser does not intend to establish a deposit account in the bank, although a liability on the bank's part is created. Even though they result in a deposit liability, the Board is of the opinion that the issuance of a bank's money orders by an authorized agent does not involve the receipt of deposits at a “branch place of business” and accordingly does not require the Board's permission to establish a branch.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Obligations concerning institutional customers.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) As a result of broadened authority provided by the Government Securities Act Amendments of 1993 (15 U.S.C. 78o-3 and 78o-5), the Board is adopting sales practice rules for the government securities market, a market with a <PRTPAGE P="247"/>particularly broad institutional component. Accordingly, the Board believes it is appropriate to provide further guidance to banks on their suitability obligations when making recommendations to institutional customers.</P>
              <P>(b) The Board's Suitability Rule, § 208.37(d), is fundamental to fair dealing and is intended to promote ethical sales practices and high standards of professional conduct. Banks' responsibilities include having a reasonable basis for recommending a particular security or strategy, as well as having reasonable grounds for believing the recommendation is suitable for the customer to whom it is made. Banks are expected to meet the same high standards of competence, professionalism, and good faith regardless of the financial circumstances of the customer.</P>
              <P>(c) In recommending to a customer the purchase, sale, or exchange of any government security, the bank shall have reasonable grounds for believing that the recommendation is suitable for the customer upon the basis of the facts, if any, disclosed by the customer as to the customer's other security holdings and financial situation and needs.</P>
              <P>(d) The interpretation in this section concerns only the manner in which a bank determines that a recommendation is suitable for a particular institutional customer. The manner in which a bank fulfills this suitability obligation will vary, depending on the nature of the customer and the specific transaction. Accordingly, the interpretation in this section deals only with guidance regarding how a bank may fulfill customer-specific suitability obligations under § 208.37(d). <SU>8</SU>
                <FTREF/>
              </P>
              <FTNT>
                <P>
                  <SU>8</SU> The interpretation in this section does not address the obligation related to suitability that requires that a bank have”* * * a ‘reasonable basis’ to believe that the recommendation could be suitable for at least some customers.” In the Matter of the Application of F.J. Kaufman and Company of Virginia and Frederick J. Kaufman, Jr., 50 SEC 164 (1989).</P>
              </FTNT>
              <P>(e) While it is difficult to define in advance the scope of a bank's suitability obligation with respect to a specific institutional customer transaction recommended by a bank, the Board has identified certain factors that may be relevant when considering compliance with § 208.37(d). These factors are not intended to be requirements or the only factors to be considered but are offered merely as guidance in determining the scope of a bank's suitability obligations.</P>
              <P>(f) The two most important considerations in determining the scope of a bank's suitability obligations in making recommendations to an institutional customer are the customer's capability to evaluate investment risk independently and the extent to which the customer is exercising independent judgement in evaluating a bank's recommendation. A bank must determine, based on the information available to it, the customer's capability to evaluate investment risk. In some cases, the bank may conclude that the customer is not capable of making independent investment decisions in general. In other cases, the institutional customer may have general capability, but may not be able to understand a particular type of instrument or its risk. This is more likely to arise with relatively new types of instruments, or those with significantly different risk or volatility characteristics than other investments generally made by the institution. If a customer is either generally not capable of evaluating investment risk or lacks sufficient capability to evaluate the particular product, the scope of a bank's customer-specific obligations under § 208.37(d) would not be diminished by the fact that the bank was dealing with an institutional customer. On the other hand, the fact that a customer initially needed help understanding a potential investment need not necessarily imply that the customer did not ultimately develop an understanding and make an independent investment decision.</P>

              <P>(g) A bank may conclude that a customer is exercising independent judgement if the customer's investment decision will be based on its own independent assessment of the opportunities and risks presented by a potential investment, market factors and other investment considerations. Where the bank has reasonable grounds for concluding that the institutional customer <PRTPAGE P="248"/>is making independent investment decisions and is capable of independently evaluating investment risk, then a bank's obligations under § 208.25(d) for a particular customer are fulfilled. <SU>9</SU>
                <FTREF/> Where a customer has delegated decision-making authority to an agent, such as an investment advisor or a bank trust department, the interpretation in this section shall be applied to the agent.</P>
              <FTNT>
                <P>
                  <SU>9</SU> <E T="03">See</E> footnote 8 in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              </FTNT>
              <P>(h) A determination of capability to evaluate investment risk independently will depend on an examination of the customer's capability to make its own investment decisions, including the resources available to the customer to make informed decisions. Relevant considerations could include:</P>
              <P>(1) The use of one or more consultants, investment advisers, or bank trust departments;</P>
              <P>(2) The general level of experience of the institutional customer in financial markets and specific experience with the type of instruments under consideration;</P>
              <P>(3) The customer's ability to understand the economic features of the security involved;</P>
              <P>(4) The customer's ability to independently evaluate how market developments would affect the security; and</P>
              <P>(5) The complexity of the security or securities involved.</P>
              <P>(i) A determination that a customer is making independent investment decisions will depend on the nature of the relationship that exists between the bank and the customer. Relevant considerations could include:</P>
              <P>(1) Any written or oral understanding that exists between the bank and the customer regarding the nature of the relationship between the bank and the customer and the services to be rendered by the bank;</P>
              <P>(2) The presence or absence of a pattern of acceptance of the bank's recommendations;</P>
              <P>(3) The use by the customer of ideas, suggestions, market views and information obtained from other government securities brokers or dealers or market professionals, particularly those relating to the same type of securities; and</P>
              <P>(4) The extent to which the bank has received from the customer current comprehensive portfolio information in connection with discussing recommended transactions or has not been provided important information regarding its portfolio or investment objectives.</P>
              <P>(j) Banks are reminded that these factors are merely guidelines that will be utilized to determine whether a bank has fulfilled its suitability obligation with respect to a specific institutional customer transaction and that the inclusion or absence of any of these factors is not dispositive of the determination of suitability. Such a determination can only be made on a case-by-case basis taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances of a particular bank/customer relationship, assessed in the context of a particular transaction.</P>
              <P>(k) For purposes of the interpretation in this section, an institutional customer shall be any entity other than a natural person. In determining the applicability of the interpretation in this section to an institutional customer, the Board will consider the dollar value of the securities that the institutional customer has in its portfolio and/or under management. While the interpretation in this section is potentially applicable to any institutional customer, the guidance contained in this section is more appropriately applied to an institutional customer with at least $10 million invested in securities in the aggregate in its portfolio and/or under management.</P>

              <P>Each institution's policies must be comprehensive, and consistent with safe and sound lending practices, and must ensure that the institution operates within limits and according to standards that are reviewed and approved at least annually by the board of directors. Real estate lending is an integral part of many institutions' business plans and, when undertaken in a prudent manner, will not be subject to examiner criticism.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Loan Portfolio Management Considerations</HD>

              <P>The lending policy should contain a general outline of the scope and distribution of the institution's credit facilities and the manner in which real estate loans are made, serviced, and collected. In particular, the institution's policies on real estate lending should:
              </P>
              <P>• Identify the geographic areas in which the institution will consider lending.</P>
              <P>• Establish a loan portfolio diversification policy and set limits for real estate loans by type and geographic market (e.g., limits on higher risk loans).</P>
              <P>• Identify appropriate terms and conditions by type of real estate loan.</P>
              <P>• Establish loan origination and approval procedures, both generally and by size and type of loan.</P>
              <P>• Establish prudent underwriting standards that are clear and measurable, including loan-to-value limits, that are consistent with these supervisory guidelines.</P>
              <P>• Establish review and approval procedures for exception loans, including loans with loan-to-value percentages in excess of supervisory limits.</P>
              <P>• Establish loan administration procedures, including documentation, disbursement, collateral inspection, collection, and loan review.</P>
              <P>• Establish real estate appraisal and evaluation programs.</P>

              <P>• Require that management monitor the loan portfolio and provide timely and adequate reports to the board of directors.
              </P>

              <P>The institution should consider both internal and external factors in the formulation of its loan policies and strategic plan. Factors that should be considered include:
              </P>
              <P>• The size and financial condition of the institution.</P>
              <P>• The expertise and size of the lending staff.</P>
              <P>• The need to avoid undue concentrations of risk.</P>
              <P>• Compliance with all real estate related laws and regulations, including the Community Reinvestment Act, anti-discrimination laws, and for savings associations, the Qualified Thrift Lender test.</P>
              <P>• Market conditions.
              </P>

              <P>The institution should monitor conditions in the real estate markets in its lending area so that it can react quickly to changes in market conditions that are relevant to its lending decisions. Market supply and demand factors that should be considered include:
              </P>
              <P>• Demographic indicators, including population and employment trends.</P>
              <P>• Zoning requirements.</P>
              <P>• Current and projected vacancy, construction, and absorption rates.</P>
              <P>• Current and projected lease terms, rental rates, and sales prices, including concessions.</P>
              <P>• Current and projected operating expenses for different types of projects.</P>
              <P>• Economic indicators, including trends and diversification of the lending area.</P>
              <P>• Valuation trends, including discount and direct capitalization rates.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Underwriting Standards</HD>

              <P>Prudently underwritten real estate loans should reflect all relevant credit factors, including:
              </P>
              <P>• The capacity of the borrower, or income from the underlying property, to adequately service the debt.</P>
              <P>• The value of the mortgaged property.</P>
              <P>• The overall creditworthiness of the borrower.</P>

              <P>• Any additional collateral or credit enhancements (such as guarantees, mortgage insurance or takeout commitments).
              </P>

              <P>The lending policies should reflect the level of risk that is acceptable to the board of directors and provide clear and measurable underwriting standards that enable the institution's lending staff to evaluate these credit factors. The underwriting standards should address:
              </P>
              <P>• The maximum loan amount by type of property.<PRTPAGE P="250"/>

                  <SU>2</SU> A loan-to-value limit has not been established for permanent mortgage or home equity loans on owner-occupied, 1- to 4-family residential property. However, for any such loan with a loan-to-value ratio that equals or exceeds 90 percent at origination, an institution should require appropriate credit enhancement in the form of either mortgage insurance or readily marketable collateral.</TNOTE>
              </GPOTABLE>
              <P>The supervisory loan-to-value limits should be applied to the underlying property that collateralizes the loan. For loans that fund multiple phases of the same real estate project (e.g., a loan for both land development and construction of an office building), the appropriate loan-to-value limit is the limit applicable to the final phase of the project funded by the loan; however, loan disbursements should not exceed actual development or construction outlays. In situations where a loan is fully cross-collateralized by two or more properties or is secured by a collateral pool of two or more properties, the appropriate maximum loan amount under supervisory loan-to-value limits is the sum of the value of each property, less senior liens, multiplied by the appropriate loan-to-value limit for each property. To ensure that collateral margins remain within the supervisory limits, lenders should redetermine conformity whenever collateral substitutions are made to the collateral pool.</P>
              <P>In establishing internal loan-to-value limits, each lender is expected to carefully consider the institution-specific and market factors listed under “Loan Portfolio Management Considerations,” as well as any other relevant factors, such as the particular subcategory or type of loan. For any subcategory of loans that exhibits greater credit risk than the overall category, a lender should consider the establishment of an internal loan-to-value limit for that subcategory that is lower than the limit for the overall category.</P>

              <P>The loan-to-value ratio is only one of several pertinent credit factors to be considered when underwriting a real estate loan. Other credit factors to be taken into account are <PRTPAGE P="251"/>highlighted in the “Underwriting Standards” section above. Because of these other factors, the establishment of these supervisory limits should not be interpreted to mean that loans at these levels will automatically be considered sound.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Loans in Excess of the Supervisory Loan-to-Value Limits</HD>
              <P>The agencies recognize that appropriate loan-to-value limits vary not only among categories of real estate loans but also among individual loans. Therefore, it may be appropriate in individual cases to originate or purchase loans with loan-to-value ratios in excess of the supervisory loan-to-value limits, based on the support provided by other credit factors. Such loans should be identified in the institutions's records, and their aggregate amount reported at least quarterly to the institution's board of directors. (See additional reporting requirements described under “Exceptions to the General Policy.”)</P>
              <P>The aggregate amount of all loans in excess of the supervisory loan-to-value limits should not exceed 100 percent of total capital. <SU>2</SU>
                <FTREF/> Moreover, within the aggregate limit, total loans for all commercial, agricultural, multifamily or other non-1-to-4 family residential properties should not exceed 30 percent of total capital. An institution will come under increased supervisory scrutiny as the total of such loans approaches these levels.</P>

                  <SU>2</SU> For advanced approaches banks (as defined in 12 CFR 208.41) and, after January 1, 2015, for all state member banks, the term “total capital” refers to that term as defined in subpart A of 12 CFR part 217. For insured state nonmember banks and state savings associations, “total capital” refers to that term defined in subpart A of 12 CFR part 324. For national banks and Federal savings associations, the term “total capital” refers to that term as defined in subpart A of 12 CFR part 3. Prior to January 1, 2015, for state member banks that are not advanced approaches banks (as defined in 12 CFR 208.41), the term “total capital” means “total risk-based capital” as defined in appendix A to 12 CFR part 208. For insured state non-member banks, “total capital” refers to that term described in table I of appendix A to 12 CFR part 325. For national banks, the term “total capital” is defined at 12 CFR 3.2(e). For savings associations, the term “total capital” is defined at 12 CFR 567.5(c).</P>
              </FTNT>
              <P>In determining the aggregate amount of such loans, institutions should: (a) Include all loans secured by the same property if any one of those loans exceeds the supervisory loan-to-value limits; and (b) include the recourse obligation of any such loan sold with recourse. Conversely, a loan should no longer be reported to the directors as part of aggregate totals when reduction in principal or senior liens, or additional contribution of collateral or equity (e.g., improvements to the real property securing the loan), bring the loan-to-value ratio into compliance with supervisory limits.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Excluded Transactions</HD>
              <P>The agencies also recognize that there are a number of lending situations in which other factors significantly outweigh the need to apply the supervisory loan-to-value limits. These include:</P>
              <P>• Loans guaranteed or insured by the U.S. government or its agencies, provided that the amount of the guaranty or insurance is at least equal to the portion of the loan that exceeds the supervisory loan-to-value limit.</P>
              <P>• Loans backed by the full faith and credit of a state government, provided that the amount of the assurance is at least equal to the portion of the loan that exceeds the supervisory loan-to-value limit.</P>
              <P>• Loans guaranteed or insured by a state, municipal or local government, or an agency thereof, provided that the amount of the guaranty or insurance is at least equal to the portion of the loan that exceeds the supervisory loan-to-value limit, and provided that the lender has determined that the guarantor or insurer has the financial capacity and willingness to perform under the terms of the guaranty or insurance agreement.</P>
              <P>• Loans that are to be sold promptly after origination, without recourse, to a financially responsible third party.</P>
              <P>• Loans that are renewed, refinanced, or restructured without the advancement of new funds or an increase in the line of credit (except for reasonable closing costs), or loans that are renewed, refinanced, or restructured in connection with a workout situation, either with or without the advancement of new funds, where consistent with safe and sound banking practices and part of a clearly defined and well-documented program to achieve orderly liquidation of the debt, reduce risk of loss, or maximize recovery on the loan.</P>
              <P>• Loans that facilitate the sale of real estate acquired by the lender in the ordinary course of collecting a debt previously contracted in good faith.</P>
              <P>• Loans for which a lien on or interest in real property is taken as additional collateral through an abundance of caution by the lender (e.g., the institution takes a blanket lien on all or substantially all of the assets of the borrower, and the value of the real property is low relative to the aggregate value of all other collateral).</P>

              <P>• Loans, such as working capital loans, where the lender does not rely principally on real estate as security and the extension of <PRTPAGE P="252"/>credit is not used to acquire, develop, or construct permanent improvements on real property.</P>
              <P>• Loans for the purpose of financing permanent improvements to real property, but not secured by the property, if such security interest is not required by prudent underwriting practice.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Exceptions to the General Lending Policy</HD>
              <P>Some provision should be made for the consideration of loan requests from creditworthy borrowers whose credit needs do not fit within the institution's general lending policy. An institution may provide for prudently underwritten exceptions to its lending policies, including loan-to-value limits, on a loan-by-loan basis. However, any exceptions from the supervisory loan-to-value limits should conform to the aggregate limits on such loans discussed above.</P>
              <P>The board of directors is responsible for establishing standards for the review and approval of exception loans. Each institution should establish an appropriate internal process for the review and approval of loans that do not conform to its own internal policy standards. The approval of any such loan should be supported by a written justification that clearly sets forth all of the relevant credit factors that support the underwriting decision. The justification and approval documents for such loans should be maintained as a part of the permanent loan file. Each institution should monitor compliance with its real estate lending policy and individually report exception loans of a significant size to its board of directors.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">Supervisory Review of Real Estate Lending Policies and Practices</HD>
              <P>The real estate lending policies of institutions will be evaluated by examiners during the course of their examinations to determine if the policies are consistent with safe and sound lending practices, these guidelines, and the requirements of the regulation. In evaluating the adequacy of the institution's real estate lending policies and practices, examiners will take into consideration the following factors:</P>
              <P>• The nature and scope of the institution's real estate lending activities.</P>
              <P>• The size and financial condition of the institution.</P>
              <P>• The quality of the institution's management and internal controls.</P>
              <P>• The expertise and size of the lending and loan administration staff.</P>
              <P>• Market conditions.</P>
              <P>Lending policy exception reports will also be reviewed by examiners during the course of their examinations to determine whether the institutions' exceptions are adequately documented and appropriate in light of all of the relevant credit considerations. An excessive volume of exceptions to an institution's real estate lending policy may signal a weakening of its underwriting practices, or may suggest a need to revise the loan policy.</P>

              <P>i. Section 39 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act <SU>1</SU>
                <FTREF/> (FDI Act) requires each Federal banking agency (collectively, the agencies) to establish certain safety and soundness standards by regulation or by guideline for all insured depository institutions. Under section 39, the agencies must establish three types of standards: (1) Operational and managerial standards; (2) compensation standards; and (3) such standards relating to asset quality, earnings, and stock valuation as they determine to be appropriate.</P>
              <FTNT>
                <P>
                  <SU>1</SU> Section 39 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1831p-1) was added by section 132 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA), Pub. L. 102-242, 105 Stat. 2236 (1991), and amended by section 956 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, Pub. L. 102-550, 106 Stat. 3895 (1992) and section 318 of the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103-325, 108 Stat. 2160 (1994).</P>
              </FTNT>
              <P>ii. Section 39(a) requires the agencies to establish operational and managerial standards relating to: (1) Internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems, in accordance with section 36 of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1831m); (2) loan documentation; (3) credit underwriting; (4) interest rate exposure; (5) asset growth; and (6) compensation, fees, and benefits, in accordance with subsection (c) of section 39. Section 39(b) requires the agencies to establish standards relating to asset quality, earnings, and stock valuation that the agencies determine to be appropriate.</P>

              <P>iii. Section 39(c) requires the agencies to establish standards prohibiting as an unsafe and unsound practice any compensatory arrangement that would provide any executive officer, employee, director, or principal shareholder of the institution with excessive compensation, fees or benefits and any compensatory arrangement that could lead to material financial loss to an institution. Section 39(c) also requires that the agencies establish standards that specify when compensation is excessive.<PRTPAGE P="254"/>
              </P>
              <P>iv. If an agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard established by guideline under subsection (a) or (b) of section 39, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. In the event that an institution fails to submit an acceptable plan within the time allowed by the agency or fails in any material respect to implement an accepted plan, the agency must, by order, require the institution to correct the deficiency. The agency may, and in some cases must, take other supervisory actions until the deficiency has been corrected.</P>
              <P>v. The agencies have adopted amendments to their rules and regulations to establish deadlines for submission and review of compliance plans. <SU>2</SU>

              <P>vi. The following Guidelines set out the safety and soundness standards that the agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. The agencies believe that the standards adopted in these Guidelines serve this end without dictating how institutions must be managed and operated. These standards are designed to identify potential safety and soundness concerns and ensure that action is taken to address those concerns before they pose a risk to the deposit insurance funds.</P>

These Guidelines address standards for developing and implementing administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity of customer information. These Guidelines also address standards with respect to the proper disposal of consumer information, pursuant to sections 621 and 628 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681s and 1681w).</P>

Pursuant to §§ 211.9 and 211.24 of this chapter, these guidelines also apply to customer information maintained by or on behalf of Edge corporations, agreement corporations, and uninsured state-licensed branches or agencies of a foreign bank. These Guidelines also apply to the proper disposal of consumer information by or on behalf of such entities.</P>
              <P>B. <E T="03">Preservation of Existing Authority.</E> Neither section 39 nor these Guidelines in any way limit the authority of the Board to address unsafe or unsound practices, violations of law, unsafe or unsound conditions, or other practices. The Board may take action under section 39 and these Guidelines independently of, in conjunction with, or in addition to, any other enforcement action available to the Board.</P>

While all parts of the bank are not required to implement a uniform set of policies, all elements of the information security program must be coordinated. A bank also shall ensure that each of its subsidiaries is subject to a comprehensive information security program. The bank may fulfill this requirement either by including a subsidiary within the scope of the bank's comprehensive information security program or by causing the subsidiary to implement a separate comprehensive information security program in accordance with the standards and procedures in sections II and III of this appendix that apply to banks.</P>
              <P>B. <E T="03">Objectives.</E> A bank's information security program shall be designed to:</P>
              <P>1. Ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information;</P>
              <P>2. Protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information;</P>

              <P>Section 501(b) of the GLBA required the Agencies to establish appropriate standards for financial institutions subject to their jurisdiction that include administrative, technical, and physical safeguards, to protect the security and confidentiality of customer information. Accordingly, the Agencies issued Security Guidelines requiring every financial institution to have an information security program designed to:</P>
              <P>1. Ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information;</P>
              <P>2. Protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information; and</P>

              <P>2. Following the assessment of these risks, the Security Guidelines require a financial institution to design a program to address the identified risks. The particular security measures an institution should adopt will depend upon the risks presented by the complexity and scope of its business. At a minimum, the financial institution is required to consider the specific security measures enumerated in the Security Guidelines, <SU>4</SU>

              <P>2. Where an incident of unauthorized access to customer information involves customer information systems maintained by an institution's service providers, it is the responsibility of the financial institution to notify the institution's customers and regulator. However, an institution may authorize or contract with its service provider to notify the institution's customers or regulator on its behalf.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Customer Notice</HD>
              <P>Financial institutions have an affirmative duty to protect their customers' information against unauthorized access or use. Notifying customers of a security incident involving the unauthorized access or use of the customer's information in accordance with the standard set forth below is a key part of that duty. Timely notification of customers is important to manage an institution's reputation risk. Effective notice also may reduce an institution's legal risk, assist in maintaining good customer relations, and enable the institution's customers to take steps to protect themselves against the consequences of identity theft. When customer notification is warranted, an institution may not forgo notifying its customers of an incident because the institution believes that it may be potentially embarrassed or inconvenienced by doing so.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Standard for Providing Notice</HD>
              <P>When a financial institution becomes aware of an incident of unauthorized access to sensitive customer information, the institution should conduct a reasonable investigation to promptly determine the likelihood that the information has been or will be misused. If the institution determines that misuse of its information about a customer has occurred or is reasonably possible, it should notify the affected customer as soon as possible. Customer notice may be delayed if an appropriate law enforcement agency determines that notification will interfere with a criminal investigation and provides the institution with a written request for the delay. However, the institution should notify its customers as soon as notification will no longer interfere with the investigation.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Sensitive Customer Information</HD>

              <P>Under the Guidelines, an institution must protect against unauthorized access to or use of customer information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. Substantial harm or inconvenience is most likely to result from improper access to <E T="03">sensitive customer information</E> because this type of information is most likely to be misused, as in the commission of identity theft. For purposes of this Guidance, <E T="03">sensitive customer information</E> means a customer's name, address, or telephone number, in conjunction with the customer's social security number, driver's license number, account number, credit or debit card number, or a personal identification number or password that would permit access to the customer's account. <E T="03">Sensitive customer information</E> also includes any combination of components of customer information that would allow someone to log onto or access the customer's account, such as user name and password or password and account number.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Affected Customers</HD>
              <P>If a financial institution, based upon its investigation, can determine from its logs or other data precisely which customers' information has been improperly accessed, it may limit notification to those customers with regard to whom the institution determines that misuse of their information has occurred or is reasonably possible. However, there may be situations where the institution determines that a group of files has been accessed improperly, but is unable to identify which specific customers' information has been accessed. If the circumstances of the unauthorized access lead the institution to determine that misuse of the information is reasonably possible, it should notify all customers in the group.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Content of Customer Notice</HD>
              <P>1. Customer notice should be given in a clear and conspicuous manner. The notice should describe the incident in general terms and the type of customer information that was the subject of unauthorized access or use. It also should generally describe what the institution has done to protect the customers' information from further unauthorized access. In addition, it should include a telephone number that customers can call for further information and assistance. <SU>14</SU>
                <FTREF/> The <PRTPAGE P="262"/>notice also should remind customers of the need to remain vigilant over the next twelve to twenty-four months, and to promptly report incidents of suspected identity theft to the institution. The notice should include the following additional items, when appropriate:</P>
              <FTNT>
                <P>
                  <SU>14</SU> The institution should, therefore, ensure that it has reasonable policies and procedures in place, including trained personnel, to respond appropriately to customer inquiries and requests for assistance.</P>
              </FTNT>
              <P>a. A recommendation that the customer review account statements and immediately report any suspicious activity to the institution;</P>
              <P>b. A description of fraud alerts and an explanation of how the customer may place a fraud alert in the customer's consumer reports to put the customer's creditors on notice that the customer may be a victim of fraud;</P>
              <P>c. A recommendation that the customer periodically obtain credit reports from each nationwide credit reporting agency and have information relating to fraudulent transactions deleted;</P>
              <P>d. An explanation of how the customer may obtain a credit report free of charge; and</P>
              <P>e. Information about the availability of the FTC's online guidance regarding steps a consumer can take to protect against identity theft. The notice should encourage the customer to report any incidents of identity theft to the FTC, and should provide the FTC's Web site address and toll-free telephone number that customers may use to obtain the identity theft guidance and report suspected incidents of identity theft. <SU>15</SU>
                <FTREF/>

The institution may also refer customers to any materials developed pursuant to section 151(b) of the FACT Act (educational materials developed by the FTC to teach the public how to prevent identity theft).</P>
              </FTNT>
              <P>2. The Agencies encourage financial institutions to notify the nationwide consumer reporting agencies prior to sending notices to a large number of customers that include contact information for the reporting agencies.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Delivery of Customer Notice</HD>
              <P>Customer notice should be delivered in any manner designed to ensure that a customer can reasonably be expected to receive it. For example, the institution may choose to contact all customers affected by telephone or by mail, or by electronic mail for those customers for whom it has a valid e-mail address and who have agreed to receive communications electronically.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Each Reserve Bank shall receive and handle items in accordance with this subpart, and shall issue operating circulars governing the details of its handling of items and other matters deemed appropriate by the Reserve Bank. The circulars may, among other things, classify cash items and noncash items, require separate sorts and letters, provide different closing times for the receipt of different classes or types of items, provide for instructions by an Administrative Reserve Bank to other Reserve Banks, set forth terms of services, and establish procedures for adjustments on a Reserve Bank's books, including amounts, waiver of expenses, and payment of compensation. As deemed appropriate by the Reserve Bank, the circulars may also require the sender to provide warranties and indemnities that only items and any noncash items the Reserve Banks have agreed to handle will be sent to the Reserve Banks. The Reserve Banks may provide to a subsequent collecting bank and to the paying bank any warranties and indemnities provided by <PRTPAGE P="270"/>the sender pursuant to this paragraph (a).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Binding effect.</E> This subpart, together with subparts C and D of part 229 and the operating circulars of the Reserve Banks, are binding on all parties interested in an item handled by any Reserve Bank.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Government items.</E> As depositaries and fiscal agents of the United States, Reserve Banks handle certain items payable by the United States or certain Federal agencies as cash or noncash items. To the extent provided by regulations issued by, and arrangements made with, the United States Treasury Department and other Government departments and agencies, the handling of such items is governed by this subpart. The Reserve Banks shall include in their operating circulars such information regarding these regulations and arrangements as the Reserve Banks deem appropriate.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Government senders.</E> Except as otherwise provided by statutes of the United States, or regulations issued or arrangements made thereunder, this subpart and the operating circulars of the Reserve Banks apply to the following when acting as a sender: a department, agency, instrumentality, independent establishment, or office of the United States, or a wholly owned or controlled Government corporation, that maintains or uses an account with a Reserve Bank.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Foreign items.</E> A Reserve Bank also may receive and handle certain items payable outside a Federal Reserve District, as provided in its operating circulars. The handling of such items in a state is governed by this subpart, and the handling of such items outside a state is governed by the local law.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Relation to other law.</E> The provisions of this subpart supersede any inconsistent provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code, of any other state law, or of part 229 of this title, but only to the extent of the inconsistency.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Sender's agreement; recovery by Reserve Bank.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Sender's agreement.</E> The warranties, indemnities, authorizations, and agreements made pursuant to this paragraph (a) may not be disclaimed <PRTPAGE P="271"/>and are made whether or not the item bears an indorsement of the sender. By sending an item to a Reserve Bank, the sender does all of the following.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Authorization to handle item.</E> The sender authorizes the sender's Administrative Reserve Bank and any other Reserve Bank or collecting bank to which the item is sent to handle the item (and authorizes any Reserve Bank that handles settlement for the item to make accounting entries), subject to this subpart and to the Reserve Banks' operating circulars, and warrants its authority to give this authorization.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Warranties for all items.</E> The sender warrants to each Reserve Bank handling the item that—</P>
              <P>(i) The sender is a person entitled to enforce the item or authorized to obtain payment of the item on behalf of a person entitled to enforce the item;</P>
              <P>(ii) The item has not been altered; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The item bears all indorsements applied by parties that previously handled the item for forward collection or return.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Warranties and indemnities as set forth in Regulation CC and U.C.C.</E> As applicable and unless otherwise provided, the sender of an item makes to each Reserve Bank that handles the item all the warranties and indemnities set forth in and subject to the terms of subparts C and D of part 229 of this chapter (Regulation CC) and Article 4 of the U.C.C. The sender makes all the warranties set forth in and subject to the terms of 4-207 of the U.C.C. for an electronic check as if it were an item subject to the U.C.C.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Warranties and indemnities as set forth in Reserve Bank operating circulars.</E> The sender makes any warranties and indemnities regarding the sending of items as set forth in an operating circular issued in accordance with § 210.3(a).</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Sender's liability to Reserve Bank.</E> (i) Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(5)(ii) and (iii) of this section, the sender agrees to indemnify each Reserve Bank for any loss or expense sustained (including attorneys' fees and expenses of litigation) resulting from—</P>
              <P>(A) The sender's lack of authority to make the warranty in paragraph (a)(1) of this section;</P>
              <P>(B) Any action taken by the Reserve Bank within the scope of its authority in handling the item; or</P>
              <P>(C) Any warranty or indemnity made by the Reserve Bank under § 210.6(b), part 229 of this chapter, the U.C.C., or, regarding the sending of items, an operating circular issued in accordance with § 210.3(a).</P>
              <P>(ii) A sender's liability for warranties and indemnities that the Reserve Bank makes for a substitute check, a paper or electronic representation thereof, or for an electronic check is subject to the following conditions and limitations—</P>
              <P>(A) A sender of an original check shall not be liable under paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section for any amount that the Reserve Bank pays under subpart D of part 229 of this chapter, or under § 229.34 of this chapter with respect to an electronic check, absent the sender's agreement to the contrary; and</P>
              <P>(B) Nothing in this subpart alters the liability of a sender of a substitute check or paper or electronic representation of a substitute check under subpart D of part 229 of this chapter, or a sender of an electronic check under § 229.34 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(iii) A sender shall not be liable for any amount that the Reserve Bank pays under this subpart or part 229 of this chapter that is attributable to the Reserve Bank's own lack of good faith or failure to exercise ordinary care.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Sender's liability under other law.</E> Nothing in paragraph (a) of this section limits any warranty or indemnity by a sender (or a person that handled an item prior to the sender) arising under state law or regulation (such as the U.C.C.), other federal law or regulation (such as part 229 of this chapter), or an agreement with a Reserve Bank.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Recovery by Reserve Bank.</E> (1) A Reserve Bank that has handled an item may recover as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section if an action or proceeding is brought against (or if defense is tendered to) the Reserve Bank based on—</P>

              <P>(i) The alleged failure of the sender to have the authority to make the warranty and agreement in paragraph (a)(1) of this section;<PRTPAGE P="272"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) Any action by the Reserve Bank within the scope of its authority in handling the item; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Any warranty or indemnity made by the Reserve Bank under § 210.6(b), part 229 of this chapter, or the U.C.C.</P>
              <P>(2) Upon entry of a final judgment or decree in an action or proceeding described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a Reserve Bank may recover from the sender the amount of attorneys' fees and other expenses of litigation incurred, as well as any amount the Reserve Bank is required to pay because of the judgment or decree or the tender of defense, together with interest thereon.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Methods of recovery.</E> (1) The Reserve Bank may recover the amount stated in paragraph (c) of this section by charging any account on its books that is maintained or used by the sender (or by charging a Reserve Bank sender), if—</P>
              <P>(i) The Reserve Bank made seasonable written demand on the sender to assume defense of the action or proceeding; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The sender has not made any other arrangement for payment that is acceptable to the Reserve Bank.</P>
              <P>(2) The Reserve Bank is not responsible for defending the action or proceeding before using this method of recovery. A Reserve Bank that has been charged under this paragraph (d) may recover from its sender in the manner and under the circumstances set forth in this paragraph (d).</P>
              <P>(3) A Reserve Bank's failure to avail itself of the remedy provided in this paragraph (d) does not prejudice its enforcement in any other manner of the indemnity agreement referred to in paragraph (a)(5) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Security interest.</E> When a sender sends an item to a Reserve Bank, the sender and any prior collecting bank grant to the sender's Administrative Reserve Bank a security interest in all of their respective assets in the possession of, or held for the account of, any Reserve Bank to secure their respective obligations due or to become due to the Administrative Reserve Bank under this subpart or subpart C or D of part 229 of this chapter (Regulation CC). The security interest attaches when a warranty is breached or any other obligation to the Reserve Bank is incurred. If the Reserve Bank, in its sole discretion, deems itself insecure and gives notice thereof to the sender or prior collecting bank, or if the sender or prior collecting bank suspends payments or is closed, the Reserve Bank may take any action authorized by law to recover the amount of an obligation, including, but not limited to, the exercise of rights of set off, the realization on any available collateral, and any other rights it may have as a creditor under applicable law.</P>

              <P>(3) <E T="03">Reliance on routing designation appearing on item.</E> A Reserve Bank may present or send an item based on the routing number or other designation of a paying bank or nonbank payor appearing in any form on the item when the Reserve Bank receives it. A Reserve Bank shall not be responsible for any delay resulting from its acting on <PRTPAGE P="273"/>any designation, whether inscribed by magnetic ink or by other means, and whether or not the designation acted on is consistent with any other designation appearing on the item.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Warranties and liability.</E> The following provisions apply when a Reserve Bank presents or sends an item.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Warranties for all items.</E> The Reserve Bank warrants to a subsequent collecting bank and to the paying bank and any other payor that—</P>
              <P>(i) The Reserve Bank is a person entitled to enforce the item (or is authorized to obtain payment of the item on behalf of a person that is either entitled to enforce the item or authorized to obtain payment on behalf of a person entitled to enforce the item);</P>
              <P>(ii) The item has not been altered; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The item bears all indorsements applied by parties that previously handled the item for forward collection or return.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Warranties and indemnities as set forth in Reserve Bank operating circulars.</E> The Reserve Bank makes any warranties and indemnities regarding the sending of items as set forth in an operating circular issued in accordance with § 210.3(a).</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Warranties and indemnities as set forth in Regulation CC and U.C.C.</E> As applicable and unless otherwise provided, the Reserve Bank makes all the warranties and indemnities set forth in and subject to the terms of subparts C and D of part 229 of this chapter (Regulation CC) and Article 4 of the U.C.C. The Reserve Bank makes all the warranties set forth in and subject to the terms of 4-207 of the U.C.C. for an electronic check as if it were an item subject to the U.C.C.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Indemnity for substitute check created from an electronic check.</E> (i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, the Reserve Bank shall indemnify the bank to which it transfers or presents an electronic check (the recipient bank) for the amount of any losses that the recipient bank incurs under subpart D of part 229 of this chapter (Regulation CC) for an indemnity that the recipient bank was required to make under subpart D of part 229 of this chapter in connection with a substitute check later created from the electronic check.</P>
              <P>(ii) The Reserve Bank shall not be liable under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section for any amount that the recipient bank pays under subpart D of part 229 of this chapter that is attributable to the lack of good faith or failure to exercise ordinary care of the recipient bank or a person that handled the item, in any form, after the recipient bank.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Time for commencing action against Reserve Bank.</E> (1) A claim against a Reserve Bank for lack of good faith or failure to exercise ordinary care shall be barred unless the action on the claim is commenced within two years after the claim accrues. Such a claim accrues on the date when a Reserve Bank's alleged failure to exercise ordinary care or to act in good faith first results in damages to the claimant.</P>
              <P>(2) A claim that arises under paragraph (b)(3) of this section shall be barred unless the action on the claim is commenced within one year after the claim accrues. Such a claim accrues as of the date on which the claimant first learns, or by which the claimant reasonably should have learned, of the facts and circumstances giving rise to the claim.</P>
              <P>(3) This paragraph (c) does not alter the time limit for claims under § 229.38(g) of this chapter (which include claims for breach of warranty under § 229.34 of this chapter) or subpart D of part 229 of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Settlement through Administrative Reserve Bank.</E> A paying bank shall settle for an item under this subpart with its Administrative Reserve Bank, whether or not the paying bank received the item from that Reserve Bank. A paying bank's settlement with its Administrative Reserve Bank is deemed to be settlement with the Reserve Bank from which the paying bank received the item. A paying bank may settle for an item using any account on a Reserve Bank's books by agreement with its Administrative Reserve Bank, any other Reserve Bank holding the settlement account, and the account-holder. The paying bank remains responsible for settlement if the Reserve Bank holding the settlement account does not, for any reason, obtain settlement in that account.</P>

              <P>(ii) If the paying bank fails to settle for or return a cash item in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, it shall be subject to any applicable overdraft charges. Settlement under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section satisfies the settlement requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</P>

              <P>(A) On that day, settle for the item so that the proceeds of the settlement are available to its Administrative Reserve Bank, or return the item, by the latest of the next clock hour or clock half-hour that is at least one half-hour after it ordinarily would have received the item, 8:30 a.m. eastern time, or such later time as provided in the Reserve Banks' operating circulars; or</P>
              <P>(B) On the next day that is a banking day for both the paying bank and the Reserve Bank, settle for the item so that the proceeds of the settlement are available to its Administrative Reserve Bank by 8:30 a.m. eastern time on that day or such later time as provided in the Reserve Banks' operating circulars; and compensate the Reserve Bank for the value of the float associated with the item in accordance with procedures provided in the Reserve Bank's operating circular.</P>
              <P>(ii) If a paying bank closes voluntarily so that it does not receive a cash item on a day that is a banking day for a Reserve Bank, and the Reserve Bank makes a cash item available to the paying bank on that day, the paying bank is not considered to have received the item until its next banking day, but it shall be subject to any applicable overdraft charges if it fails to settle for or return the item in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. The settlement requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section do not apply to a paying bank that settles in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.</P>

              <P>(ii) Settle for the item so that the proceeds of the settlement are available to its Administrative Reserve Bank by 8:30 a.m. eastern time on the Reserve Bank's next banking day or such later time as provided in the Reserve Bank's operating circular, or return the item by midnight of the day it receives the item. If the paying bank fails to settle for or return a cash item in accordance with this paragraph (b)(4)(ii), it shall be subject to any applicable overdraft charges. Settlement under this paragraph (b)(4)(ii) satisfies the settlement requirements of paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section.</P>

A paying bank may not set off against the amount of a settlement <PRTPAGE P="276"/>under this section the amount of a claim with respect to another cash item, cash letter, or other claim under § 229.34 of this chapter (Regulation CC) or other law.</P>

              <P>(a) Each Reserve Bank shall publish a time schedule indicating when the amount of any cash item or returned check received by it is counted toward the balance maintained to satisfy a reserve balance requirement for purposes of part 204 of this chapter (Regulation D) and becomes available for use by the sender or paying or returning bank. The Reserve Bank that holds the settlement account shall give either immediate or deferred credit to a sender, a paying bank, or a returning bank (other than a foreign correspondent) in accordance with the time schedule of the receiving Reserve Bank. A Reserve Bank ordinarily gives credit to a foreign correspondent only when the Reserve Bank receives payment of the item in actually and finally collected funds, but, in its discretion, a Reserve Bank may give immediate or deferred credit in accordance with its time schedule.</P>
              <P>(b) Notwithstanding its time schedule, a Reserve Bank may refuse at any time to permit the use of credit given by it for any cash item or returned check, and may defer availability after credit is received by the Reserve Bank for a period of time that is reasonable under the circumstances.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Return of items</E>—(1) <E T="03">Return of cash items handled by Reserve Banks.</E> A paying bank that receives a cash item from a Reserve Bank, other than for immediate payment over the counter, and that settles for the item as provided in § 210.9(b), may, before it has finally paid the item, return the item to any Reserve Bank (unless its Administrative Reserve Bank directs it to return the item to a specific Reserve Bank) in accordance with subpart C of part 229 of this chapter (Regulation CC), the Uniform Commercial Code, and the Reserve Banks' operating circulars. A paying bank that receives a cash item from a Reserve Bank also may return the item prior to settlement, in accordance with § 210.9(b) and the Reserve Banks' operating circulars. The rules or practices of a clearinghouse through which the item was presented, or a special collection agreement under which the item was presented, may not extend these return times, but may provide for a shorter return time.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Return of checks not handled by Reserve Banks.</E> A paying bank that receives a check, other than from a Reserve Bank, and that determines not to pay the check, may send the returned check to any Reserve Bank (unless its Administrative Reserve Bank directs it to send the returned check to a specific Reserve Bank) in accordance with subpart C of part 229 of this chapter (Regulation CC), the Uniform Commercial Code, and the Reserve Banks' operating circulars. A returning bank may send a returned check to any Reserve Bank (unless its Administrative Reserve Bank directs it to send the returned check to a specific Reserve Bank) in accordance with subpart C of part 229 of this chapter (Regulation CC), the Uniform Commercial Code, and the Reserve Banks' operating circulars.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Handling of returned checks.</E> (1) The following parties, in the following order, are deemed to have handled a returned check sent to a Reserve Bank under paragraph (a) of this section—</P>

              <P>(ii) The paying bank's or returning bank's Administrative Reserve Bank;</P>
              <P>(iii) The Reserve Bank that receives the returned check from the paying or returning bank (if different from the paying bank's or returning bank's Administrative Reserve Bank); and</P>
              <P>(iv) Another Reserve Bank, if any, that receives the returned check from a Reserve Bank.</P>
              <P>(2) A Reserve Bank that is not described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is not a person that handles a returned check and is not a returning bank with respect to a returned check.</P>
              <P>(3) The identity and order of the parties under paragraph (b)(1) of this section determine the relationships and the rights and liabilities of the parties under this subpart, part 229 of this chapter (Regulation CC), and the Uniform Commercial Code.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Paying bank's and returning bank's agreement.</E> The warranties, indemnities, authorizations, and agreements made pursuant to this paragraph (c) may not be disclaimed and are made whether or not the returned check bears an indorsement of the paying bank or returning bank. By sending a returned check to a Reserve Bank, the paying bank or returning bank does all of the following.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Authorization to handle returned check.</E> The paying bank or returning bank authorizes the paying bank's or returning bank's Administrative Reserve Bank, and any other Reserve Bank or returning bank to which the returned check is sent, to handle the returned check (and authorizes any Reserve Bank that handles settlement for the returned check to make accounting entries) subject to this subpart and to the Reserve Banks' operating circulars.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Warranties for all returned checks.</E> The paying bank or returning bank warrants to each Reserve Bank handling a returned check that the returned check bears all indorsements applied by parties that previously handled the returned check for forward collection or return.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Warranties and indemnities as set forth in Regulation CC.</E> As applicable <PRTPAGE P="278"/>and unless otherwise provided, a paying bank or returning bank makes to each Reserve Bank that handles the returned check all the warranties and indemnities set forth in and subject to the terms of subparts C and D of part 229 of this chapter (Regulation CC).</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Paying bank or returning bank's liability to Reserve Bank.</E> (i) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) and (iii) of this section, a paying bank or returning bank agrees to indemnify each Reserve Bank for any loss or expense (including attorneys' fees and expenses of litigation) resulting from—</P>
              <P>(A) The paying or returning bank's lack of authority to give the authorization in paragraph (c)(1) of this section;</P>
              <P>(B) Any action taken by a Reserve Bank within the scope of its authority in handling the returned check; or</P>
              <P>(C) Any warranty or indemnity made by the Reserve Bank under paragraph (e) of this section or part 229 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(ii) A paying bank's or returning bank's liability for warranties and indemnities that a Reserve Bank makes for a returned check that is a substitute check, a paper or electronic representation thereof, or an electronic returned check is subject to the following conditions and limitations—</P>
              <P>(A) A paying bank or returning bank that sent an original returned check shall not be liable for any amount that a Reserve Bank pays under subpart D of part 229 of this chapter, or under § 229.34 of this chapter with respect to an electronic returned check, absent the paying bank's or returning bank's agreement to the contrary; and</P>
              <P>(B) Nothing in this subpart alters the liability under subpart D of part 229 of this chapter of a paying bank or returning bank that sent a substitute check or a paper or electronic representation of a substitute check or under § 229.34 of this chapter of a paying bank or returning bank that sent an electronic returned check; and</P>
              <P>(iii) A paying bank or returning bank shall not be liable for any amount that the Reserve Bank pays under this subpart or part 229 of this chapter that is attributable to the Reserve Bank's own lack of good faith or failure to exercise ordinary care.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Paying bank or returning bank's liability under other law.</E> Nothing in paragraph (c) of this section limits any warranty or indemnity by a returning bank or paying bank (or a person that handled an item prior to that bank) arising under state law or regulation (such as the U.C.C.), other federal law or regulation (such as part 229 of this chapter), or an agreement with a Reserve Bank.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Warranties by and liability of Reserve Bank</E>—(1) <E T="03">Warranties and indemnities.</E> The following provisions apply when a Reserve Bank handles a returned check under this subpart.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Warranties for all items.</E> The Reserve Bank warrants to the bank to which it sends the returned check that the returned check bears all indorsements applied by parties that previously handled the returned check for forward collection or return.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Warranties and indemnities as set forth in Regulation CC.</E> As applicable and unless otherwise provided, the Reserve Bank makes all the warranties and indemnities set forth in and subject to the terms of subparts C and D of part 229 of this chapter (Regulation CC).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Indemnity for substitute check created from electronic returned check.</E> (i) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, the Reserve Bank shall indemnify the bank to which it transfers or presents an electronic returned check (the recipient bank) for the amount of any losses that the recipient bank incurs under subpart D of part 229 of this chapter (Regulation CC) for an indemnity that the recipient bank was required to make under subpart D of part 229 of this chapter in connection with a substitute check later created from the electronic returned check.</P>
              <P>(ii) The Reserve Bank shall not be liable under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section for any amount that the recipient bank pays under subpart D of part 229 of this chapter that is attributable to the lack of good faith or failure to exercise ordinary care of the recipient bank or a person that handled the item, in any form, after the recipient bank.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Liability of Reserve Bank.</E> A Reserve Bank shall not have or assume <PRTPAGE P="279"/>any other liability to any person except—</P>
              <P>(i) For the Reserve Bank's own lack of good faith or failure to exercise ordinary care;</P>
              <P>(ii) As provided in this paragraph (e); and</P>
              <P>(iii) As provided in subparts C and D of part 229 of this chapter (Regulation CC).</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Recovery by Reserve Bank.</E> (1) A Reserve Bank that has handled a returned check may recover as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section if an action or proceeding is brought against (or if defense is tendered to) the Reserve Bank based on—</P>
              <P>(i) The alleged failure of the paying bank or returning bank to have the authority to give the authorization in paragraph (c)(1) of this section;</P>
              <P>(ii) Any action by the Reserve Bank within the scope of its authority in handling the returned check; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Any warranty or indemnity made by the Reserve Bank under paragraph (e) of this section or part 229 of this chapter; and</P>
              <P>(2) Upon entry of a final judgment or decree in an action or proceeding described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, a Reserve Bank may recover from the paying bank or returning bank the amount of attorneys' fees and other expenses of litigation incurred, as well as any amount the Reserve Bank is required to pay because of the judgment or decree or the tender of defense, together with interest thereon.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Methods of recovery.</E> (1) The Reserve Bank may recover the amount stated in paragraph (f) of this section by charging any account on its books that is maintained or used by the paying bank or returning bank (or by charging another returning Reserve Bank), if—</P>
              <P>(i) The Reserve Bank made seasonable written demand on the paying bank or returning bank to assume defense of the action or proceeding; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The paying bank or returning bank has not made any other arrangement for payment that is acceptable to the Reserve Bank.</P>
              <P>(2) The Reserve Bank is not responsible for defending the action or proceeding before using this method of recovery. A Reserve Bank that has been charged under this paragraph (g) may recover from the paying or returning bank in the manner and under the circumstances set forth in this paragraph (g).</P>
              <P>(3) A Reserve Bank's failure to avail itself of the remedy provided in this paragraph (g) does not prejudice its enforcement in any other manner of the indemnity agreement referred to in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Reserve Bank's responsibility.</E> A Reserve Bank shall handle a returned check, or a notice of nonpayment, in accordance with subpart C of part 229 and its operating circular.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Settlement.</E> A subsequent returning bank or depositary bank shall settle with its Administrative Reserve Bank for returned checks in the same manner and by the same time as for cash items presented for payment under this subpart. Settlement with its Administrative Reserve Bank is deemed to be settlement with the Reserve Bank from which the returning bank or depositary bank received the item.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Security interest.</E> When a paying or returning bank sends a returned check to a Reserve Bank, the paying bank, returning bank, and any prior returning bank grant to the paying bank's or returning bank's Administrative Reserve Bank a security interest in all of their respective assets in the possession of, or held for the account of, any Reserve Bank, to secure their respective obligations due or to become due to the Administrative Reserve Bank under this subpart or subpart C of part 229 of this chapter (Regulation CC). The security interest attaches when a warranty is breached or any other obligation to the Reserve Bank is incurred. If the Reserve Bank, in its sole discretion, deems itself insecure and gives notice thereof to the paying bank, returning bank, or prior returning bank, or if the paying bank, returning bank, or prior returning bank suspends payments or is closed, the Reserve Bank may take any action authorized by law to recover the amount of an obligation, including, but not limited to, the exercise of rights of set off, the realization on any available collateral, and any <PRTPAGE P="280"/>other rights it may have as a creditor under applicable law.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Authority and purpose.</E> This subpart provides rules to govern funds transfers through the Fedwire Funds Service, and has been issued pursuant to the Federal Reserve Act—section 13 (12 U.S.C. 342), paragraph (f) of section 19 (12 U.S.C. 464), paragraph 14 of section 16 (12 U.S.C. 248(o)), and paragraphs (i) and (j) of section 11 (12 U.S.C. 248(i) and (j))—and other laws and has the force and effect of federal law. This subpart is not a funds-transfer system rule as defined in Section 4A-501(b) of Article 4A.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Scope.</E> (1) This subpart incorporates the provisions of Article 4A set forth in appendix B to this subpart. In the event of an inconsistency between the provisions of the sections of this subpart and appendix B to this subpart, the provisions of the sections of this subpart shall prevail. In the event of an inconsistency between the provisions this subpart and section 919 of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, section 919 of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act shall prevail.</P>

              <P>(2) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (b)(3) and (4) of this section, including Article 4A as set forth in appendix B to this subpart, and operating circulars of the Reserve Banks issued in accordance with paragraph (c) of <PRTPAGE P="281"/>this section, this subpart governs the rights and obligations of:</P>
              <P>(i) Federal Reserve Banks sending or receiving payment orders;</P>
              <P>(ii) Senders that send payment orders directly to a Federal Reserve Bank;</P>
              <P>(iii) Receiving banks that receive payment orders directly from a Federal Reserve Bank;</P>
              <P>(iv) Beneficiaries that receive payment for payment orders sent to a Federal Reserve Bank by means of credit to an account maintained or used at a Federal Reserve Bank; and</P>
              <P>(v) Other parties to a funds transfer any part of which is carried out through Fedwire to the same extent as if this subpart were considered a funds-transfer system rule under Article 4A.</P>
              <P>(3) This subpart governs a funds transfer that is sent through the Fedwire Funds Service, as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, even though a portion of the funds transfer is governed by the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, but the portion of such funds transfer that is governed by the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (other than section 919 governing remittance transfers) is not governed by this subpart.</P>
              <P>(4) In the event that any portion of this Subpart establishes rights or obligations with respect to the availability of funds that are also governed by the Expedited Funds Availability Act or the Board's Regulation CC, Availability of Funds and Collection of Checks, those provisions of the Expedited Funds Availability Act or Regulation CC shall apply and the portion of this Subpart, including Article 4A as incorporated herein, shall not apply.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Operating Circulars.</E> Each Federal Reserve Bank shall issue an Operating Circular consistent with this Subpart that governs the details of its funds-transfer operations and other matters it deems appropriate. Among other things, the Operating Circular may: set cut-off hours and funds-transfer business days; address available security procedures; specify format and media requirements for payment orders; identify messages that are not payment orders; and impose charges for funds-transfer services.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Government senders, receiving banks, and beneficiaries.</E> Except as otherwise expressly provided by the statutes of the United States, the parties specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) through (v) of this section include:</P>
              <P>(1) A department, agency, instrumentality, independent establishment, or office of the United States, or a wholly-owned or controlled Government corporation;</P>
              <P>(2) An international organization;</P>
              <P>(3) A foreign central bank; and</P>
              <P>(4) A department, agency, instrumentality, independent establishment, or office of a foreign government, or a wholly-owned or controlled corporation of a foreign government.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Financial messaging standards.</E> Financial messaging standards (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> ISO 20022), including the financial messaging components, elements, technical documentation, tags, and terminology used to implement those standards, do not confer or connote legal status or responsibilities. This subpart, including Article 4A as set forth in appendix B to this subpart, and the operating circulars of the Reserve Banks issued in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section govern the rights and obligations of parties to funds transfers sent through the Fedwire Funds Service as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. To the extent there is any inconsistency between a financial messaging standard adopted by the Fedwire Funds Service and this subpart, this subpart shall prevail.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Payment of sender's obligation to a Federal Reserve Bank.</E> A sender (other than a Federal Reserve Bank), by maintaining or using an account with a Federal Reserve Bank, authorizes the sender's Federal Reserve Bank to obtain payment for the sender's payment orders by debiting the amount of the payment order from the sender's account.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Overdrafts.</E> (1) A sender does not have the right to an overdraft in the sender's account. In the event an overdraft is created, the overdraft shall be due and payable immediately without the need for a demand by the Federal Reserve Bank, at the earliest of the following times:</P>
              <P>(i) At the end of the funds-transfer business day;</P>
              <P>(ii) At the time the Federal Reserve Bank, in its sole discretion, deems itself insecure and gives notice thereof to the sender; or</P>
              <P>(iii) At the time the sender suspends payments or is closed.</P>

              <P>(2) The sender shall have in its account, at the time the overdraft is due and payable, a balance of actually and finally collected funds sufficient to cover the aggregate amount of all its obligations to the Federal Reserve Bank, whether the obligations result from the execution of a payment order or otherwise.<PRTPAGE P="283"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) To secure any overdraft, as well as any other obligation due or to become due to its Federal Reserve Bank, each sender, by sending a payment order to a Federal Reserve Bank that is accepted by the Federal Reserve Bank, grants to the Federal Reserve Bank a security interest in all of the sender's assets in the possession of, or held for the account of, the Federal Reserve Bank. The security interest attaches when an overdraft, or any other obligation to the Federal Reserve Bank, becomes due and payable.</P>
              <P>(4) A Federal Reserve Bank may take any action authorized by law to recover the amount of an overdraft that is due and payable, including, but not limited to, the exercise of rights of set off, the realization on any available collateral, and any other rights it may have as a creditor under applicable law.</P>
              <P>(5) If a sender, other than a government sender described in § 210.25(d), incurs an overdraft in its account as a result of a debit to the account by a Federal Reserve Bank under paragraph (a) of this section, the account will be subject to any applicable overdraft charges, regardless of whether the overdraft has become due and payable. A Federal Reserve Bank may debit a sender's account under paragraph (a) of this section immediately on acceptance of the payment order.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Review of payment orders.</E> A sender, by sending a payment order to a Federal Reserve Bank, agrees that for the purposes of sections 4A-204(a) and 4A-304 of Article 4A, a reasonable time to notify a Federal Reserve Bank of the relevant facts concerning an unauthorized or erroneously executed payment order is within 30 calendar days after the sender receives notice that the payment order was accepted or executed, or that the sender's account was debited with respect to the payment order.</P>

              <P>(2) If the sender or receiving bank that is the recipient of interest payment is not the party entitled to compensation under Article 4A, the sender or receiving bank shall pass through the benefit of the interest payment by making an interest payment, as of the day the interest payment is effected, to the party entitled to compensation. The interest payment that is made to the party entitled to compensation shall not be less than the value of the interest payment that was provided by the Federal Reserve Bank to the sender or receiving bank.

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix A to Subpart B of Part 210—Commentary</HD>
              <P>The Commentary provides background material to explain the intent of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) in adopting a particular provision in the subpart and to help readers interpret that provision. In some comments, examples are offered. The Commentary constitutes an official Board interpretation of subpart B of this part. Commentary is not provided for every provision of subpart B of this part, as some provisions are self-explanatory.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 210.25—Authority, Purpose, and Scope</HD>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Authority and purpose.</E> Section 210.25(a) states that the purpose of subpart B of this part is to provide rules to govern funds transfers through Fedwire and recites the Board's rulemaking authority for this subpart. Subpart B of this part is federal law and is not a “funds-transfer system rule,” as defined in section 4A-501(b) of Article 4A, Funds Transfers, of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), as set forth in appendix B of this subpart. Certain provisions of Article 4A may not be varied by a funds-transfer system rule, but under section 4A-107, regulations of the Board and Operating Circulars of the Federal Reserve Banks supersede inconsistent provisions of Article 4A to the extent of the inconsistency. In addition, regulations of the Board may preempt inconsistent provisions of state law. Accordingly, subpart B of this part supersedes or preempts inconsistent provisions of state law. It does not affect state law governing funds transfers that <PRTPAGE P="285"/>does not conflict with the provisions of subpart B of this part, such as Article 4A, as enacted in any state, as it applies to parties to funds transfers through Fedwire whose rights are not governed by subpart B of this part.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Scope.</E> (1) Subpart B of this part incorporates the provisions of Article 4A set forth in appendix B of this part. The provisions set forth expressly in the sections of subpart B of this part supersede or preempt any inconsistent provisions of Article 4A as set forth in appendix B of this part or as enacted in any state. The official comments to Article 4A are not incorporated in subpart B of this part or this commentary to subpart B of this part, but the official comments may be useful in interpreting Article 4A. Because section 4A-105 refers to other provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code, e.g., definitions in article 1 of the UCC, these other provisions of the UCC, as approved by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws and the American Law Institute, from time to time, are also incorporated in subpart B of this part. Subpart B of this part applies to any party to a Fedwire funds transfer that is in privity with a Federal Reserve Bank. These parties include a sender (bank or nonbank) that sends a payment order directly to a Federal Reserve Bank, a receiving bank that receives a payment order directly from a Federal Reserve Bank, and a beneficiary that receives credit to an account that it uses or maintains at a Federal Reserve Bank for a payment order sent to a Federal Reserve Bank. Other parties to a funds transfer are covered by this subpart to the same extent that this subpart would apply to them if this subpart were a “funds-transfer system rule” under Article 4A that selected subpart B of this part as the governing law.</P>
              <P>(2) The scope of the applicability of a funds-transfer system rule under Article 4A is specified in section 4A-501(b), and the scope of the choice of law provision is specified in section 4A-507(c). Under section 4A-507(c), a choice of law provision is binding on the participants in a funds-transfer system and certain other parties having notice that the funds-transfer system might be used for the funds transfer and of the choice of law provision. The Uniform Commercial Code provides that a person has notice when the person has actual knowledge, receives notification, or has reason to know from all the facts and circumstances known to the person at the time in question. (See UCC § 1-201(25).) However, under sections 4A-507(b) and 4A-507(d), a choice of law by agreement of the parties takes precedence over a choice of law made by funds-transfer system rule.</P>
              <P>(3) If originators, receiving banks, and beneficiaries that are not in privity with a Federal Reserve Bank have the notice contemplated by Section 4A-507(c) or if those parties agree to be bound by subpart B of this part, subpart B of this part generally would apply to payment orders between those remote parties, including participants in other funds-transfer systems. For example, a funds transfer may be sent from an originator's bank through a funds-transfer system other than Fedwire to a receiving bank which, in turn, sends a payment order through Fedwire to execute the funds transfer. Similarly, a Federal Reserve Bank may execute a payment order through Fedwire to a receiving bank that sends it through a funds-transfer system other than Fedwire to a beneficiary's bank. In the first example, if the originator's bank has notice that Fedwire may be used to effect part of the funds transfer, the sending of the payment order through the other funds-transfer system to the receiving bank will be governed by subpart B of this part unless the parties to the payment order have agreed otherwise. In the second example, if the beneficiary's bank has notice that Fedwire may be used to effect part of the funds transfer, the sending of the payment order to the beneficiary's bank through the other funds-transfer system will be governed by subpart B of this part unless the parties have agreed otherwise. In both cases, the other funds-transfer system's rules would also apply to, at a minimum, the portion of these funds transfers going through that funds transfer system. Because subpart B of this part is federal law, to the extent of any inconsistency, subpart B of this part will take precedence over any funds-transfer system rule applicable to the remote sender or receiving bank or to a Federal Reserve Bank. If remote parties to a funds transfer, a portion of which is sent through Fedwire, have expressly selected by agreement a law other than subpart B of this part under section 4A-507(b), subpart B of this part would not take precedence over the choice of law made by the agreement even though the remote parties had notice that Fedwire may be used and of the governing law. (See 4A-507(d).) In addition, subpart B of this part would not apply to a funds transfer sent through another funds-transfer system where no Federal Reserve Bank handles the funds transfer, even though settlement for the funds transfer is made by means of a separate net settlement or funds transfer through Fedwire.</P>

              <P>(4) Under section 4A-108, Article 4A does not apply to a funds transfer, any part of which is governed by the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) (15 U.S.C. 1693 <E T="03">et seq.</E>). In general, Fedwire funds transfers to or from consumer accounts are exempt from the EFTA and Regulation E (12 CFR part 205). A funds transfer from a consumer originator or a funds transfer to a consumer beneficiary could be carried out in part through Fedwire and in part through an automated clearinghouse or other means that is subject <PRTPAGE P="286"/>to the EFTA or Regulation E. In these cases, subpart B would not govern the portion of the funds transfer that is governed by the EFTA or Regulation E. (See the commentary to section 210.26(i) in this appendix, “Payment Order”.)</P>
              <P>(5) Section 919 of the EFTA, however, governs “remittance transfers,” which may include Fedwire funds transfers. Section 919 of the EFTA sets out the obligations of remittance transfer providers with respect to consumer senders of remittance transfers. Section 919 of the EFTA generally does not affect the rights and obligations of financial institutions involved in a remittance transfer. To the extent that a Fedwire funds transfer is a “remittance transfer” governed by section 919 of the EFTA, it continues to be governed by subpart B, except that, in the event of an inconsistency between the provisions of subpart B and section 919 of the EFTA, section 919 of the EFTA shall prevail. For example, a consumer may initiate a remittance transfer governed by EFTA section 919 from the consumer's account at a depository institution, and the depository institution may initiate that transfer by sending a payment order to a Reserve Bank through the Fedwire funds system. If the consumer subsequently exercised the right to cancel the remittance transfer and obtain a refund under the terms of EFTA section 919, the depository institution would be required to comply with section 919 even if the institution does not have a right to reverse the payment order sent to the Reserve Bank under subpart B.</P>
              <P>(6) Finally, section 4A-404(a) provides that a beneficiary's bank is obliged to pay the amount of a payment order to the beneficiary on the payment date unless acceptance of the payment order occurs on the payment date after the close of the funds-transfer business day of the bank. The Expedited Funds Availability Act provides that funds received by a bank by wire transfer shall be available for withdrawal not later than the banking day after the business day on which such funds are received (12 U.S.C. 4002(a)). That act also preempts any provision of state law that was not effective on September 1, 1989, that is inconsistent with that act or its implementing Regulation CC (12 CFR 229). Accordingly, the Expedited Funds Availability Act and Regulation CC may preempt section 4A-404(a) as enacted in any state. In order to ensure that section 4A-404(a), or other provisions of Article 4A, as incorporated in subpart B of this part, do not take precedence over provisions of the Expedited Funds Availability Act, this section provides that where subpart B of this part establishes rights or obligations that are also governed by the Expedited Funds Availability Act or Regulation CC, the Expedited Funds Availability Act or Regulation CC provision shall apply and subpart B of this part shall not apply.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Operating Circulars.</E> The Federal Reserve Banks issue Operating Circulars consistent with this Subpart that contain additional provisions applicable to payment orders sent through Fedwire. Under section 4A-107, these Operating Circulars supersede inconsistent provisions of Article 4A, as set forth in appendix B and as enacted in any state. These Operating Circulars are not funds-transfer system rules, but, by their terms, they are binding on all parties covered by this Subpart.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Government senders, receiving banks, and beneficiaries.</E> This section clarifies that unless a statute of the United States provides otherwise, subpart B of this part applies to governmental entities, domestic or foreign, including foreign central banks as specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Financial messaging standards.</E> This paragraph makes clear that financial messaging standards, including the financial messaging components, elements, technical documentation, tags, and terminology used to implement those standards, do not confer or connote legal status or responsibilities. Instead, subpart B of this part and Federal Reserve Bank operating circulars govern the rights and obligations of parties to funds transfers sent through the Fedwire Funds Service as provided in § 210.25(b). Thus, to the extent there is any inconsistency between a financial messaging standard adopted by the Fedwire Funds Service and subpart B of this part, subpart B of this part, including Article 4A as adopted in appendix B to subpart B of this part, will prevail. In the ISO 20022 financial messaging standard, for example, the term <E T="03">agent</E> is used to refer to a variety of bank parties to a funds transfer (<E T="03">e.g., debtor agent,</E>
                <E T="03">creditor agent, intermediary agent</E>). Notwithstanding use of that term in the standard and in message tags, such banks are not the agents of any party to a funds transfer and owe no duty to any other party to such a funds transfer except as provided in subpart B of this part (including Article 4A) or by express agreement. The ISO 20022 financial messaging standard also permits information to be carried in a funds-transfer message regarding persons that are not parties to that funds transfer (<E T="03">e.g., ultimate debtor,</E>
                <E T="03">ultimate creditor, initiating party</E>) for regulatory, compliance, remittance, or other purposes. An “ultimate debtor” is not an “originator” as defined in Article 4A. The relationship between the ultimate debtor and the originator (what the ISO 20022 standard calls the “debtor”) is determined by law other than Article 4A.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 210.26—Definitions</HD>
              <P>Article 4A defines many terms (e.g., <E T="03">beneficiary, intermediary bank, receiving bank, security procedure</E>) used in this subpart. These <PRTPAGE P="287"/>terms are defined or listed in sections 4A-103 through 4A-105. These terms, such as the term <E T="03">bank</E> (defined in section 4A-105(d)(2)), may differ from comparable terms in subpart A of this part. As subpart B of this part incorporates consistent provisions of Article 4A, it incorporates these definitions unless these terms are expressly defined otherwise in subpart B of this part. This subpart modifies the definitions of two Article 4A terms, <E T="03">beneficiary's bank</E> and <E T="03">payment order.</E> This subpart also defines terms not defined in Article 4A.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Article 4A. Article 4A</E> means the version of that article of the Uniform Commercial Code set forth in appendix B of this subpart. It does not refer to the law of any particular state unless the context indicates otherwise. Subject to the express provisions of this Subpart, this version of Article 4A is incorporated into this Subpart and made federal law for transactions covered by this subpart.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">As of adjustments.</E> As of adjustments are memorandum items that affect a bank's reserve or clearing balance for the purpose of meeting the required balance, but do not represent funds that can be used for other purposes. As discussed in the Commentary to § 210.32(b), the Federal Reserve Banks generally provide as of adjustments as a means of effecting interest payments or charges.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Beneficiary's bank.</E> The definition of <E T="03">beneficiary's bank</E> in subpart B of this part differs from the section 4A-103(a)(3) definition. The subpart B definition clarifies that where a Federal Reserve Bank functions as the beneficiary's bank, it need not be identified in the payment order as the beneficiary's bank and that a Federal Reserve Bank that receives a payment order as beneficiary is also the beneficiary's bank with respect to that payment order.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Fedwire.</E> Fedwire refers to the funds-transfer system owned and operated by the Federal Reserve Banks that is governed by this Subpart. The term does not refer to any particular computer, telecommunications facility, or funds transfer, but to the system as a whole, which may include transfers by telephone or by written instrument in particular circumstances. Fedwire does not include the system used for automated clearing house transfers.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Off-line bank.</E> Most Fedwire payment orders are transmitted electronically from a sender to a Federal Reserve Bank or from a Federal Reserve Bank to a receiving bank. Banks transmitting payment orders to Federal Reserve Banks electronically are often referred to as on-line banks. Some Fedwire participants, however, transmit payment orders to a Federal Reserve Bank or receive payment orders from a Federal Reserve Bank orally by telephone, or, in unusual circumstances, in writing. A bank that does not use either a terminal or a computer that links it electronically to a terminal or computer at its Federal Reserve Bank to send payment orders through Fedwire is an off-line bank.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Payment Order.</E> (1) The definition of “payment order” in subpart B of this part differs from the section 4A-103(a)(1) definition. The subpart B definition clarifies that, for the purposes of subpart B of this part, automated clearinghouse transfers and certain messages that are transmitted through Fedwire are not payment orders. Federal Reserve Banks and banks participating in Fedwire send various types of messages relating to payment orders or to other matters, through Fedwire, that are not intended to be payment orders. Under the subpart B definition, these messages, and messages involved with automated clearinghouse transfers, are not “payment orders” and therefore are not governed by this subpart. The operating circulars of the Federal Reserve Banks specify those messages that may be transmitted through Fedwire but that are not payment orders.</P>
              <P>(2) In some cases, messages sent through Fedwire, such as certain requests for credit transfer, may be payment orders under Article 4A, but are not treated as payment orders under subpart B because they are not an instruction to a Federal Reserve Bank to pay money.</P>
              <P>(3) This subpart and Article 4A govern a payment order even though the originator's or beneficiary's account may be a consumer account established primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. Under section 4A-108, Article 4A does not apply to a funds transfer any part of which is governed by the Electronic Fund Transfer Act. That act, and Regulation E (12 CFR part 205) implementing it, do not apply to funds transfers through Fedwire (see 15 U.S.C. 1693a(6)(B) and 12 CFR 205.3(b)), except that section 919 of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act may govern a Fedwire funds transfer that is a “remittance transfer.” Such remittance transfers that are Fedwire funds transfers continue to be governed by this subpart. Thus, this subpart applies to all funds transfers through Fedwire even though some such transfers involve originators or beneficiaries that are consumers.

              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 210.27—Reliance on Identifying Number</HD>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Reliance by a Federal Reserve Bank on number to identify intermediary bank or beneficiary's bank.</E> Section 4A-208 provides that a receiving bank, such as a Federal Reserve Bank, may rely on the routing number of an intermediary bank or the beneficiary's bank specified in a payment order as identifying the appropriate intermediary bank or beneficiary's bank, even if the payment order identifies another bank by name, provided that the receiving bank does not know of the inconsistency. Under section 4A-208(b)(2), if <PRTPAGE P="288"/>the sender of the payment order is not a bank, a receiving bank may rely on the number only if the sender had notice before the receiving bank accepted the sender's order that the receiving bank might rely on the number. This section provides this notice to entities that are not banks, such as the Department of the Treasury, that send payment orders directly to a Federal Reserve Bank.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Reliance by a Federal Reserve Bank on number to identify beneficiary.</E> Section 4A-207 provides that a beneficiary's bank, such as a Federal Reserve Bank, may rely on the number identifying a beneficiary, such as the beneficiary's account number, specified in a payment order as identifying the appropriate beneficiary, even if the payment order identifies another beneficiary by name, provided that the beneficiary's bank does not know of the inconsistency. Under section 4A-207(c)(2), if the originator is not a bank, an originator is not obliged to pay for a payment order if the originator did not have notice that the beneficiary's bank might rely on the identifying number and the person paid on the basis of the identifying number was not entitled to receive payment. This section of subpart B provides this notice to entities that are not banks, such as the Department of the Treasury, that are originators of payment orders sent directly by the originators to a Federal Reserve Bank, where that Federal Reserve Bank or another Federal Reserve Bank is the beneficiary's bank (<E T="03">see also</E> section 4A-402(b), providing that a sender must pay a beneficiary's bank for a payment order accepted by the beneficiary's bank).</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 210.28—Agreement of Sender</HD>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Payment of sender's obligation to a Federal Reserve Bank.</E> When a sender issues a payment order to a Federal Reserve Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank issues a conforming order implementing the sender's payment order, under section 4A-403, the sender is indebted to the Federal Reserve Bank for the amount of the payment order. A sender, other than a Federal Reserve Bank, that maintains or uses an account at a Federal Reserve Bank authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank to debit that account so that the Federal Reserve Bank can obtain payment for the payment order.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Overdrafts.</E> (1) In some cases, debits to a sender's account will create an overdraft in the sender's account. The Board and the Federal Reserve Banks have established policies concerning when a Federal Reserve Bank will permit a bank to incur an overdraft in its account at a Federal Reserve Bank. These policies do not give a bank or other sender a right to an overdraft in its account. Subpart B clarifies that a sender does not have a right to such an overdraft. If an overdraft arises, it becomes immediately due and payable at the earliest of: The end of the funds-transfer business day of the Federal Reserve Bank; the time the Federal Reserve Bank in its sole discretion, deems itself insecure and gives notice to the sender; or the time that the sender suspends payments or is closed by governmental action, such as the appointment of a receiver. In some cases, a Federal Reserve Bank extends its Fedwire operations beyond its cut-off hour for that funds-transfer business day. For the purposes of this section, unless otherwise specified by the Federal Reserve Bank making such an extension, an overdraft becomes due and payable at the end of the extended operating hours. An overdraft becomes due and payable prior to a Federal Reserve Bank's cut-off hour if the Federal Reserve Bank deems itself insecure and gives notice to the sender. Notice that the Federal Reserve Bank deems itself insecure may be given in accordance with the provisions on notice in section 1-201(27) of the UCC, in accordance with any other applicable law or agreement, or by any other reasonable means. An overdraft also becomes due and payable at the time that a bank is closed or suspends payments. For example, an overdraft becomes due and payable if a receiver is appointed for the bank or the bank is prevented from making payments by governmental order. The Federal Reserve Bank need not make demand on the sender for the overdraft to become due and payable.</P>
              <P>(2) A sender must cover any overdraft and any other obligation of the sender to the Federal Reserve Bank by the time the overdraft becomes due and payable. By sending a payment order to a Federal Reserve Bank, the sender grants a security interest to the Federal Reserve Bank in any assets of the sender held by, or for the account of, the Federal Reserve Bank in order to secure all obligations due or to become due to the Federal Reserve Bank. The security interest attaches when the overdraft, or other obligation of the sender to the Federal Reserve Bank, becomes due and payable. The security interest does not apply to assets held by the sender as custodian or trustee for the sender's customers or third parties. Once an overdraft is due and payable, a Federal Reserve Bank may exercise its right of set off, liquidate collateral, or take other similar action to satisfy the overdrafting bank's obligation owed to the Federal Reserve Bank.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Review of payment orders.</E> (1) Under section 4A-204, a receiving bank is required to refund the principal amount of an unauthorized payment order that the sender was not obliged to pay, together with interest on the refundable amount calculated from the date that the receiving bank received payment to the date of the refund. The sender is not entitled to compensation in the form of interest if the sender fails to exercise ordinary care to determine that the order was not authorized and to notify the receiving bank <PRTPAGE P="289"/>within a reasonable period of time after the sender receives a notice that the payment order was accepted or that the sender's account was debited with respect to the order. Similarly, under section 4A-304, if a sender of a payment order that was erroneously executed does not notify the bank receiving the payment order within a reasonable time, the bank is not liable to the sender for compensation in the form of interest on any amount refundable to the sender. Section 210.28(c) establishes 30 calendar days as the reasonable period of time for the purposes of these provisions of Article 4A.</P>
              <P>(2) Section 4A-505 provides that a customer must object to a debit to its account by a receiving bank within one year after the customer received notification reasonably identifying the payment order. Subpart B of this part does not vary this one-year period.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 210.29—Agreement of Receiving Bank</HD>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Off-line banks.</E> (1) Generally, an on-line bank receiving payment orders or advices of credit for payment orders from a Federal Reserve Bank receives the payment orders or advices electronically a short time after the corresponding payment orders are received by the on-line bank's Federal Reserve Bank. An off-line bank receiving payment orders or advices of credit from a Federal Reserve Bank does not have an electronic connection with the Federal Reserve Bank; therefore, payment orders or advices are transmitted either by telephone on the day the payment order is received by the receiving bank's Federal Reserve Bank, or sent by courier or mail along with the off-line bank's daily account statement, on the funds-transfer business day following the day the payment order is received by the off-line bank's Federal Reserve Bank.</P>
              <P>(2) Under section 4A-302(a)(2), a Federal Reserve Bank must transmit payment orders at a time and by means reasonably necessary to allow payment to the beneficiary on the payment date, or as soon thereafter as is feasible. Therefore, where an off-line receiving bank is an intermediary bank or beneficiary's bank in a payment order, its Federal Reserve Bank attempts to transmit the payment order to the off-line bank by telephone on the day the payment order is received by the Federal Reserve Bank. A Federal Reserve Bank can generally identify these payment orders from the type code designated in the payment order.</P>
              <P>(3) Under section 4A-404(b), if a payment order instructs payment to the account of the beneficiary, the beneficiary's bank must notify the beneficiary of the receipt of a payment order before midnight of the next funds-transfer business day following the payment date. Where an off-line bank is the beneficiary of a payment order, telephone notice by a Federal Reserve Bank to the off-line bank of the receipt of the order is not required by Article 4A because the Federal Reserve Bank sends notice to the off-line bank by courier or mail, along with its daily account statement, on the day after the payment order is received by its Federal Reserve Bank. Payment orders for which an off-line bank is the beneficiary of the order are generally designated as settlement transactions.</P>
              <P>(4) If an off-line receiving bank maintains an account for another bank, the off-line bank may receive payment orders designated as settlement transactions in its capacity as beneficiary's bank or intermediary bank. A Federal Reserve Bank cannot readily distinguish these payment orders from settlement transactions for which the off-line bank is the beneficiary of the order. If an off-line bank notifies its Federal Reserve Bank that it maintains an account for another bank, the Federal Reserve Bank will attempt to telephone the off-line bank with respect to all settlement transactions received by such bank, whether the off-line bank is the beneficiary, the beneficiary's bank, or an intermediary bank in the payment order. Under this section, an off-line bank that does not expressly notify its Federal Reserve Bank in writing that it maintains an account for another bank warrants to that Federal Reserve Bank that it does not act as an intermediary bank or a beneficiary's bank for a bank beneficiary with respect to payment orders received through Fedwire.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 210.30—Payment Orders</HD>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Rejection.</E> (1) A sender must make arrangements with its Federal Reserve Bank before it can send payment orders to the Federal Reserve Bank. Federal Reserve Banks reserve the right to reject or impose conditions on the acceptance of payment orders for any reason. For example, a Federal Reserve Bank might reject or impose conditions on accepting a payment order where a sender does not have sufficient funds in its account with the Federal Reserve Bank to cover the amount of the sender's payment order and other obligations of the sender due or to become due to the Federal Reserve Bank. A Federal Reserve Bank may require a sender to execute a written agreement concerning security procedures or other matters before the sender may send payment orders to the Federal Reserve Bank.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Selection of an intermediary bank.</E> (1) Under section 4A-302, if a receiving bank (other than a beneficiary's bank), such as a Federal Reserve Bank, accepts a payment order, it must issue a payment order that complies with the sender's order. The sender's order may include instructions concerning an intermediary bank to be used that must be followed by a receiving bank (<E T="03">see</E> section 4A-302(a)(1)). If the sender does not designate any intermediary bank in its <PRTPAGE P="290"/>payment order, the receiving bank may select an intermediary bank through which the sender's payment order can be expeditiously issued to the beneficiary's bank so long as the receiving bank exercises ordinary care in selecting the intermediary bank (<E T="03">see</E> section 4A-302(b)).</P>
              <P>(2) This section provides that in an interdistrict transfer, a Federal Reserve Bank is authorized and directed to select another Federal Reserve Bank as an intermediary bank. A sender may, however, instruct a Federal Reserve Bank to use a particular intermediary bank by designating that bank as the bank to be credited by that Federal Reserve Bank (or the second Federal Reserve Bank in the case of an interdistrict transfer) in its payment order, in which case the Federal Reserve Bank will send the payment order to that bank if that bank receives payment orders through Fedwire. A sender may not instruct a Federal Reserve Bank to use its discretion to select an intermediary bank other than a Federal Reserve Bank or an intermediary bank designated by the sender. In addition, a sender may not instruct a Federal Reserve Bank to use a funds-transfer system or means of transmission other than Fedwire unless the sender and the Federal Reserve Bank agree in writing to the use of the funds-transfer system or means of transmission.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Same-day execution.</E> Generally, Fedwire is a same-day value transfer system through which funds may be transferred from the originator to the beneficiary on the same funds-transfer business day. A sender may not send a payment order to a Federal Reserve Bank that specifies an execution date or payment date later than the day on which the payment order is issued, unless the sender of the order and the Federal Reserve Bank agree in writing to the arrangement.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 210.31—Payment by a Federal Reserve Bank to a Receiving Bank or Beneficiary</HD>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Payment to a receiving bank.</E> (1) Under section 4A-402, when a Federal Reserve Bank executes a sender's payment order by issuing a conforming order to a receiving bank that accepts the payment order, the Federal Reserve Bank must pay the receiving bank the amount of the payment order. Section 210.29(a) authorizes a Federal Reserve Bank to make the payment by crediting the account at the Federal Reserve Bank maintained or used by the receiving bank. Section 210.31(a) provides that the payment occurs when the receiving bank's account is credited or when the payment order is sent by the Federal Reserve Bank to the receiving bank, whichever is earlier. Ordinarily, payment will occur during the funds-transfer business day a short time after the payment order is received, even if the receiving bank is an off-line bank. This credit is final and irrevocable when made and constitutes final settlement under section 4A-403. Payment does not waive a Federal Reserve Bank's right of recovery under the applicable law of mistake and restitution (<E T="03">see</E> § 210.32(c)), affect a Federal Reserve Bank's right to apply the funds to any obligation due or to become due to the Federal Reserve Bank, or affect legal process or claims by third parties on the funds.</P>
              <P>(2) This section on final payment does not apply to settlement for payment orders between Federal Reserve Banks. These payment orders are settled by other means.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Payment to a beneficiary.</E> Section 210.31(b) specifies when a Federal Reserve Bank makes payment to a beneficiary for which it is the beneficiary's bank. As in the case of payment to a receiving bank, this payment occurs at the earlier of the time that the Federal Reserve Bank credits the beneficiary's account or sends notice of the credit to the beneficiary, and is final and irrevocable when made.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 210.32—Federal Reserve Bank Liability; Payment of Interest</HD>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Damages.</E> (1) Under section 4A-305(d), damages for failure of a receiving bank to execute a payment order that it was obligated to execute by express agreement are limited to expenses in the transaction and incidental expenses and interest and do not include additional damages, including consequential damages, unless they are provided for in an express written agreement of the receiving bank. This section clarifies that in connection with the handling of payment orders, Federal Reserve Banks may not agree to be liable for consequential damages under this provision and shall not be liable for damages other than those that may be due under Article 4A to parties governed by this subpart. Any agreement in conflict with these provisions would not be effective, because it would be in violation of subpart B.</P>
              <P>(2) This section does not affect the ability of other parties to a funds transfer to agree to be liable for consequential damages, the liability of a Federal Reserve Bank under section 4A-404, or the liability to parties governed by subpart B for claims not based on the handling of a payment order under this subpart.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Payment of interest.</E> (1) Under article 4A, a Federal Reserve Bank may be required to pay compensation in the form of interest to another party in connection with its handling of a funds transfer. For example, payment of compensation in the form of interest is required in certain situations pursuant to sections 4A-204 (relating to refund of payment and duty of customer to report with respect to unauthorized payment order), 4A-209 (relating to acceptance of payment order), 4A-210 (relating to rejection of payment order), 4A-304 (relating to duty of sender to <PRTPAGE P="291"/>report erroneously executed payment order), 4A-305 (relating to liability for late or improper execution or failure to execute a payment order), 4A-402 (relating to obligation of sender to pay receiving bank), and 4A-404 (relating to obligation of beneficiary's bank to pay and give notice to beneficiary).</P>
              <P>(2) Section 210.32(b) requires Federal Reserve Banks to provide compensation through an explicit interest payment. Under section 4A-506(a), the amount of such interest may be determined by agreement between the sender and receiving bank or by funds-transfer system rule. If there is no such agreement, under section 4A-506(b), the amount of interest is based on the federal funds rate. Similarly, compensation in the form of explicit interest will be paid to government senders, receiving banks, or beneficiaries described in § 210.25(d) if they are entitled to interest under this subpart. A Federal Reserve Bank may also, in its discretion, pay explicit interest directly to a remote party to a Fedwire funds transfer that is entitled to interest, rather than providing compensation to its direct sender or receiving bank.</P>
              <P>(3) If a bank that received an explicit interest payment is not the party entitled to interest compensation under article 4A, the bank must pass the benefit of the explicit interest payment made to it to the party that is entitled to compensation in the form of interest from a Federal Reserve Bank. The benefit may be passed on either in the form of a direct payment of interest or in the form of a compensating balance, if the party entitled to interest agrees to accept the other form of compensation, and the value of the compensating balance is at least equivalent to the value of the explicit interest that otherwise would have been provided.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Nonwaiver of right of recovery.</E> Several sections of Article 4A allow for a party to a funds transfer to make a claim pursuant to the applicable law of mistake and restitution. Nothing in subpart B of this part or any Operating Circular issued under subpart B of this part waives any such claim. A Federal Reserve Bank, however, may waive such a claim by express written agreement in order to settle litigation or for other purposes.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 4A-106. Time Payment Order is Received</HD>
              <P>(a) The time of receipt of a payment order or communication canceling or amending a payment order is determined by the rules applicable to receipt of a notice stated in section 1-201(27). A receiving bank may fix a cut-off time or times on a funds-transfer business day for the receipt and processing of payment orders and communications canceling or amending payment orders. Different cut-off times may apply to payment orders, cancellations, or amendments, or to different categories of payment orders, cancellations, or amendments. A cut-off time may apply to senders generally or different cut-off times may apply to different senders or categories of payment orders. If a payment order or communication canceling or amending a payment order is received after the close of a funds-transfer business day or after the appropriate cut-off time on a funds-transfer business day, the receiving bank may treat the payment order or communication as received at the opening of the next funds-transfer business day.</P>
              <P>(b) If this Article refers to an execution date or payment date or states a day on which a receiving bank is required to take action, and the date or day does not fall on a funds-transfer business day, the next day that is a funds-transfer business day is treated as the date or day stated, unless the contrary is stated in this Article.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 4A-107. Federal Reserve Regulations and Operating Circulars</HD>
              <P>Regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and operating circulars of the Federal Reserve Banks supersede any inconsistent provision of this Article to the extent of the inconsistency.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 4A-108. Exclusion of Consumer Transactions Governed by Federal Law</HD>

              <P>This Article does not apply to a funds transfer any part of which is governed by the Electronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978 (title XX, Pub. L. 95-630, 92 Stat. 3728, 15 U.S.C. 1693 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) as amended from time to time.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 4A-201. Security Procedure</HD>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Security procedure</E> means a procedure established by agreement of a customer and a receiving bank for the purpose of (i) verifying that a payment order or communication <PRTPAGE P="293"/>amending or canceling a payment order is that of the customer, or (ii) detecting error in the transmission or the content of the payment order or communication. A security procedure may require the use of algorithms or other codes, identifying words or numbers, encryption, callback procedures, or similar security devices. Comparison of a signature on a payment order or communication with an authorized specimen signature of the customer is not by itself a security procedure.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 4A-202. Authorized and Verified Payment Orders</HD>
              <P>(a) A payment order received by the receiving bank is the authorized order of the person identified as sender if that person authorized the order or is otherwise bound by it under the law of agency.</P>
              <P>(b) If a bank and its customer have agreed that the authenticity of payment orders issued to the bank in the name of the customer as sender will be verified pursuant to a security procedure, a payment order received by the receiving bank is effective as the order of the customer, whether or not authorized, if (i) the security procedure is a commercially reasonable method of providing security against unauthorized payment orders, and (ii) the bank proves that it accepted the payment order in good faith and in compliance with the security procedure and any written agreement or instruction of the customer restricting acceptance of payment orders issued in the name of the customer. The bank is not required to follow an instruction that violates a written agreement with the customer or notice of which is not received at a time and in a manner affording the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it before the payment order is accepted.</P>
              <P>(c) Commercial reasonableness of a security procedure is a question of law to be determined by considering the wishes of the customer expressed to the bank, the circumstances of the customer known to the bank, including the size, type, and frequency of payment orders normally issued by the customer to the bank, alternative security procedures offered to the customer, and security procedures in general use by customers and receiving banks similarly situated. A security procedure is deemed to be commercially reasonable if (i) the security procedure was chosen by the customer after the bank offered, and the customer refused, a security procedure that was commercially reasonable for that customer, and (ii) the customer expressly agreed in writing to be bound by any payment order, whether or not authorized, issued in its name and accepted by the bank in compliance with the security procedure chosen by the customer.</P>
              <P>(d) The term <E T="03">sender</E> in this Article includes the customer in whose name a payment order is issued if the order is the authorized order of the customer under subsection (a), or it is effective as the order of the customer under subsection (b).</P>
              <P>(e) This section applies to amendments and cancellations of payment orders to the same extent it applies to payment orders.</P>
              <P>(f) Except as provided in this section and in section 4A-203(a)(1), rights and obligations arising under this section or section 4A-203 may not be varied by agreement.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 4A-203. Unenforceability of Certain Verified Payment Orders</HD>
              <P>(a) If an accepted payment order is not, under section 4A-202(a), an authorized order of a customer identified as sender, but is effective as an order of the customer pursuant to section 4A-202(b), the following rules apply:</P>
              <P>(1) By express written agreement, the receiving bank may limit the extent to which it is entitled to enforce or retain payment of the payment order.</P>
              <P>(2) The receiving bank is not entitled to enforce or retain payment of the payment order if the customer proves that the order was not caused, directly or indirectly, by a person (i) entrusted at any time with duties to act for the customer with respect to payment orders or the security procedure, or (ii) who obtained access to transmitting facilities of the customer or who obtained, from a source controlled by the customer and without authority of the receiving bank, information facilitating breach of the security procedure, regardless of how the information was obtained or whether the customer was at fault. Information includes any access device, computer software, or the like.</P>
              <P>(b) This section applies to amendments of payment orders to the same extent it applies to payment orders.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 4A-204. Refund of Payment and Duty of Customer To Report with Respect to Unauthorized Payment Order</HD>

              <P>(a) If a receiving bank accepts a payment order issued in the name of its customer as sender which is (i) not authorized and not effective as the order of the customer under section 4A-202, or (ii) not enforceable, in whole or in part, against the customer under section 4A-203, the bank shall refund any payment of the payment order received from the customer to the extent the bank is not entitled to enforce payment and shall pay interest on the refundable amount calculated from the date the bank received payment to the date of the refund. However, the customer is not entitled to interest from the bank on the amount to be refunded if the customer fails to exercise ordinary care to determine that the order was not authorized by the customer and to notify the bank of the relevant facts within a reasonable time <PRTPAGE P="294"/>not exceeding 90 days after the date the customer received notification from the bank that the order was accepted or that the customer's account was debited with respect to the order. The bank is not entitled to any recovery from the customer on account of a failure by the customer to give notification as stated in this section.</P>
              <P>(b) Reasonable time under subsection (a) may be fixed by agreement as stated in section 1-204(1), but the obligation of a receiving bank to refund payment as stated in subsection (a) may not otherwise be varied by agreement.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 4A-205. Erroneous Payment Orders</HD>
              <P>(a) If an accepted payment order was transmitted pursuant to a security procedure for the detection of error and the payment order (i) erroneously instructed payment to a beneficiary not intended by the sender, (ii) erroneously instructed payment in an amount greater than the amount intended by the sender, or (iii) was an erroneously transmitted duplicate of a payment order previously sent by the sender, the following rules apply:</P>
              <P>(1) If the sender proves that the sender or a person acting on behalf of the sender pursuant to section 4A-206 complied with the security procedure and that the error would have been detected if the receiving bank had also complied, the sender is not obliged to pay the order to the extent stated in paragraphs (2) and (3).</P>
              <P>(2) If the funds transfer is completed on the basis of an erroneous payment order described in clause (i) or (iii) of subsection (a), the sender is not obliged to pay the order and the receiving bank is entitled to recover from the beneficiary any amount paid to the beneficiary to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution.</P>
              <P>(3) If the funds transfer is completed on the basis of a payment order described in clause (ii) of subsection (a), the sender is not obliged to pay the order to the extent the amount received by the beneficiary is greater than the amount intended by the sender. In that case, the receiving bank is entitled to recover from the beneficiary the excess amount received to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution.</P>
              <P>(b) If (i) the sender of an erroneous payment order described in subsection (a) is not obliged to pay all or part of the order, and (ii) the sender receives notification from the receiving bank that the order was accepted by the bank or that the sender's account was debited with respect to the order, the sender has a duty to exercise ordinary care, on the basis of information available to the sender, to discover the error with respect to the order and to advise the bank of the relevant facts within a reasonable time, not exceeding 90 days, after the bank's notification was received by the sender. If the bank proves that the sender failed to perform that duty, the sender is liable to the bank for the loss the bank proves it incurred as a result of the failure, but the liability of the sender may not exceed the amount of the sender's order.</P>
              <P>(c) This section applies to amendments to payment orders to the same extent it applies to payment orders.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 4A-206. Transmission of Payment Order Through Funds-Transfer or Other Communication System</HD>
              <P>(a) If a payment order addressed to a receiving bank is transmitted to a funds-transfer system or other third-party communication system for transmittal to the bank, the system is deemed to be an agent of the sender for the purpose of transmitting the payment order to the bank. If there is a discrepancy between the terms of the payment order transmitted to the system and the terms of the payment order transmitted by the system to the bank, the terms of the payment order of the sender are those transmitted by the system. This section does not apply to a funds-transfer system of the Federal Reserve Banks.</P>
              <P>(b) This section applies to cancellations and amendments of payment orders to the same extent it applies to payment orders.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 4A-207. Misdescription of Beneficiary</HD>
              <P>(a) Subject to subsection (b), if, in a payment order received by the beneficiary's bank, the name, bank account number, or other identification of the beneficiary refers to a nonexistent or unidentifiable person or account, no person has rights as a beneficiary of the order and acceptance of the order cannot occur.</P>
              <P>(b) If a payment order received by the beneficiary's bank identifies the beneficiary both by name and by an identifying or bank account number and the name and number identify different persons, the following rules apply:</P>
              <P>(1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), if the beneficiary's bank does not know that the name and number refer to different persons, it may rely on the number as the proper identification of the beneficiary of the order. The beneficiary's bank need not determine whether the name and number refer to the same person.</P>
              <P>(2) If the beneficiary's bank pays the person identified by name or knows that the name and number identify different persons, no person has rights as beneficiary except the person paid by the beneficiary's bank if that person was entitled to receive payment from the originator of the funds transfer. If no person has rights as beneficiary, acceptance of the order cannot occur.</P>

              <P>(c) If (i) a payment order described in subsection (b) is accepted, (ii) the originator's <PRTPAGE P="295"/>payment order described the beneficiary inconsistently by name and number, and (iii) the beneficiary's bank pays the person identified by number as permitted by subsection (b)(1), the following rules apply:</P>
              <P>(1) If the originator is a bank, the originator is obliged to pay its order.</P>
              <P>(2) If the originator is not a bank and proves that the person identified by number was not entitled to receive payment from the originator, the originator is not obliged to pay its order unless the originator's bank proves that the originator, before acceptance of the originator's order, had notice that payment of a payment order issued by the originator might be made by the beneficiary's bank on the basis of an identifying or bank account number even if it identifies a person different from the named beneficiary. Proof of notice may be made by any admissible evidence. The originator's bank satisfies the burden of proof if it proves that the originator, before the payment order was accepted, signed a writing stating the information to which the notice relates.</P>
              <P>(d) In a case governed by subsection (b)(1), if the beneficiary's bank rightfully pays the person identified by number and that person was not entitled to receive payment from the originator, the amount paid may be recovered from that person to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) If the originator is obliged to pay its payment order as stated in subsection (c), the originator has the right to recover.</P>
              <P>(2) If the originator is not a bank and is not obliged to pay its payment order, the originator's bank has the right to recover.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 4A-208. Misdescription of Intermediary Bank or Beneficiary's Bank</HD>
              <P>(a) This subsection applies to a payment order identifying an intermediary bank or the beneficiary's bank only by an identifying number.</P>
              <P>(1) The receiving bank may rely on the number as the proper identification of the intermediary or beneficiary's bank and need not determine whether the number identifies a bank.</P>
              <P>(2) The sender is obliged to compensate the receiving bank for any loss and expenses incurred by the receiving bank as a result of its reliance on the number in executing or attempting to execute the order.</P>
              <P>(b) This subsection applies to a payment order identifying an intermediary bank or the beneficiary's bank both by name and an identifying number if the name and number identify different persons.</P>
              <P>(1) If the sender is a bank, the receiving bank may rely on the number as the proper identification of the intermediary or beneficiary's bank if the receiving bank, when it executes the sender's order, does not know that the name and number identify different persons. The receiving bank need not determine whether the name and number refer to the same person or whether the number refers to a bank. The sender is obliged to compensate the receiving bank for any loss and expenses incurred by the receiving bank as a result of its reliance on the number in executing or attempting to execute the order.</P>
              <P>(2) If the sender is not a bank and the receiving bank proves that the sender, before the payment order was accepted, had notice that the receiving bank might rely on the number as the proper identification of the intermediary or beneficiary's bank even if it identifies a person different from the bank identified by name, the rights and obligations of the sender and the receiving bank are governed by subsection (b)(1), as though the sender were a bank. Proof of notice may be made by any admissible evidence. The receiving bank satisfies the burden of proof if it proves that the sender, before the payment order was accepted, signed a writing stating the information to which the notice relates.</P>
              <P>(3) Regardless of whether the sender is a bank, the receiving bank may rely on the name as the proper identification of the intermediary or beneficiary's bank if the receiving bank, at the time it executes the sender's order, does not know that the name and number identify different persons. The receiving bank need not determine whether the name and number refer to the same person.</P>
              <P>(4) If the receiving bank knows that the name and number identify different persons, reliance on either the name or the number in executing the sender's payment order is a breach of the obligation stated in section 4A-302(a)(1).</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 4A-209. Acceptance of Payment Order</HD>
              <P>(a) Subject to subsection (d), a receiving bank other than the beneficiary's bank accepts a payment order when it executes the order.</P>
              <P>(b) Subject to subsections (c) and (d), a beneficiary's bank accepts a payment order at the earliest of the following times:</P>
              <P>(1) When the bank (i) pays the beneficiary as stated in section 4A-405(a) or 4A-405(b), or (ii) notifies the beneficiary of receipt of the order or that the account of the beneficiary has been credited with respect to the order unless the notice indicates that the bank is rejecting the order or that funds with respect to the order may not be withdrawn or used until receipt of payment from the sender of the order;</P>
              <P>(2) When the bank receives payment of the entire amount of the sender's order pursuant to section 4A-403(a)(1) or 4A-403(a)(2); or</P>

              <P>(3) The opening of the next funds-transfer business day of the bank following the payment date of the order if, at that time, the amount of the sender's order is fully covered <PRTPAGE P="296"/>by a withdrawable credit balance in an authorized account of the sender or the bank has otherwise received full payment from the sender, unless the order was rejected before that time or is rejected within (i) one hour after that time, or (ii) one hour after the opening of the next business day of the sender following the payment date if that time is later. If notice of rejection is received by the sender after the payment date and the authorized account of the sender does not bear interest, the bank is obliged to pay interest to the sender on the amount of the order for the number of days elapsing after the payment date to the day the sender receives notice or learns that the order was not accepted, counting that day as an elapsed day. If the withdrawable credit balance during that period falls below the amount of the order, the amount of interest payable is reduced accordingly.</P>
              <P>(c) Acceptance of a payment order cannot occur before the order is received by the receiving bank. Acceptance does not occur under subsection (b)(2) or (b)(3) if the beneficiary of the payment order does not have an account with the receiving bank, the account has been closed, or the receiving bank is not permitted by law to receive credits for the beneficiary's account.</P>
              <P>(d) A payment order issued to the originator's bank cannot be accepted until the payment date if the bank is the beneficiary's bank, or the execution date if the bank is not the beneficiary's bank. If the originator's bank executes the originator's payment order before the execution date or pays the beneficiary of the originator's payment order before the payment date and the payment order is subsequently canceled pursuant to section 4A-211(b), the bank may recover from the beneficiary any payment received to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 4A-210. Rejection of Payment Order</HD>
              <P>(a) A payment order is rejected by the receiving bank by a notice of rejection transmitted to the sender orally, electronically, or in writing. A notice of rejection need not use any particular words and is sufficient if it indicates that the receiving bank is rejecting the order or will not execute or pay the order. Rejection is effective when the notice is given if transmission is by a means that is reasonable in the circumstances. If notice of rejection is given by a means that is not reasonable, rejection is effective when the notice is received. If an agreement of the sender and receiving bank establishes the means to be used to reject a payment order, (i) any means complying with the agreement is reasonable and (ii) any means not complying is not reasonable unless no significant delay in receipt of the notice resulted from the use of the noncomplying means.</P>
              <P>(b) This subsection applies if a receiving bank other than the beneficiary's bank fails to execute a payment order despite the existence on the execution date of a withdrawable credit balance in an authorized account of the sender sufficient to cover the order. If the sender does not receive notice of rejection of the order on the execution date and the authorized account of the sender does not bear interest, the bank is obliged to pay interest to the sender on the amount of the order for the number of days elapsing after the execution date to the earlier of the day the order is canceled pursuant to section 4A-211(d) or the day the sender receives notice or learns that the order was not executed, counting the final day of the period as an elapsed day. If the withdrawable credit balance during that period falls below the amount of the order, the amount of interest is reduced accordingly.</P>

If a security procedure is in effect between the sender and the receiving bank, the communication is not effective to cancel or amend the order unless the communication is verified pursuant to the security procedure or the bank agrees to the cancellation or amendment.</P>
              <P>(b) Subject to subsection (a), a communication by the sender canceling or amending a payment order is effective to cancel or amend the order if notice of the communication is received at a time and in a manner affording the receiving bank a reasonable opportunity to act on the communication before the bank accepts the payment order.</P>
              <P>(c) After a payment order has been accepted, cancellation or amendment of the order is not effective unless the receiving bank agrees or a funds-transfer system rule allows cancellation or amendment without agreement of the bank.</P>

              <P>(1) The receiving bank is obliged to issue, on the execution date, a payment order complying with the sender's order and to follow the sender's instructions concerning (i) any intermediary bank or funds-transfer system to be used in carrying out the funds transfer, or (ii) the means by which payment orders are to be transmitted in the funds transfer. If the originator's bank issues a payment order to an intermediary bank, the originator's bank is obliged to instruct the intermediary bank according to the instruction of the originator. An intermediary bank in the funds transfer is similarly bound by an instruction given to it by the sender of the payment order it accepts.</P>

              <P>(2) If the sender's instruction states that the funds transfer is to be carried out telephonically or by wire transfer or otherwise indicates that the funds transfer is to be carried out by the most expeditious means, the <PRTPAGE P="298"/>receiving bank is obliged to transmit its payment order by the most expeditious available means, and to instruct any intermediary bank accordingly. If a sender's instruction states a payment date, the receiving bank is obliged to transmit its payment order at a time and by means reasonably necessary to allow payment to the beneficiary on the payment date or as soon thereafter as is feasible.</P>
              <P>(b) Unless otherwise instructed, a receiving bank executing a payment order may (i) use any funds-transfer system if use of that system is reasonable in the circumstances, and (ii) issue a payment order to the beneficiary's bank or to an intermediary bank through which a payment order conforming to the sender's order can expeditiously be issued to the beneficiary's bank if the receiving bank exercises ordinary care in the selection of the intermediary bank. A receiving bank is not required to follow an instruction of the sender designating a funds-transfer system to be used in carrying out the funds transfer if the receiving bank, in good faith, determines that it is not feasible to follow the instruction or that following the instruction would unduly delay completion of the funds transfer.</P>
              <P>(c) Unless subsection (a)(2) applies or the receiving bank is otherwise instructed, the bank may execute a payment order by transmitting its payment order by first class mail or by any means reasonable in the circumstances. If the receiving bank is instructed to execute the sender's order by a particular means, the receiving bank may issue its payment order by transmitting its payment order by the means stated or by any means as expeditious as the means stated.</P>
              <P>(d) Unless instructed by the sender, (i) the receiving bank may not obtain payment of its charges for services and expenses in connection with the execution of the sender's order by issuing a payment order in an amount equal to the amount of the sender's order less the amount of the charges, and (ii) may not instruct a subsequent receiving bank to obtain payment of its charges in the same manner.</P>

If the error is not corrected, the issuer of the erroneous order is entitled to receive or retain payment from the sender of the order it accepted only to the extent of the amount of the erroneous order.

With respect to a payment order issued to a receiving bank other than the beneficiary's bank, acceptance of the order by the receiving bank obliges the sender to pay the bank the amount of the sender's order. Payment by the sender is not due until the execution date of the sender's order. The obligation of that sender to pay its payment order is excused if the funds transfer is not completed by acceptance by the beneficiary's bank of a payment order instructing payment to the beneficiary of that sender's payment order.</P>

              <P>(a) Payment of the sender's obligation under section 4A-402 to pay the receiving bank occurs as follows:</P>

              <P>(1) If the sender is a bank, payment occurs when the receiving bank receives final settlement of the obligation through a Federal Reserve Bank or through a funds-transfer system.<PRTPAGE P="300"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) If the sender is a bank and the sender (i) credited an account of the receiving bank with the sender, or (ii) caused an account of the receiving bank in another bank to be credited, payment occurs when the credit is withdrawn or, if not withdrawn, at midnight of the day on which the credit is withdrawable and the receiving bank learns of that fact.</P>
              <P>(3) If the receiving bank debits an account of the sender with the receiving bank, payment occurs when the debit is made to the extent the debit is covered by a withdrawable credit balance in the account.</P>
              <P>(b) If the sender and receiving bank are members of a funds-transfer system that nets obligations multilaterally among participants, the receiving bank receives final settlement when settlement is complete in accordance with the rules of the system. The obligation of the sender to pay the amount of a payment order transmitted through the funds-transfer system may be satisfied, to the extent permitted by the rules of the system, by setting off and applying against the sender's obligation the right of the sender to receive payment from the receiving bank of the amount of any other payment order transmitted to the sender by the receiving bank through the funds-transfer system. The aggregate balance of obligations owed by each sender to each receiving bank in the funds-transfer system may be satisfied, to the extent permitted by the rules of the system, by setting off and applying against that balance the aggregate balance of obligations owed to the sender by other members of the system. The aggregate balance is determined after the right of setoff stated in the second sentence of this subsection has been exercised.</P>
              <P>(c) If two banks transmit payment orders to each other under an agreement that settlement of the obligations of each bank to the other under section 4A-402 will be made at the end of the day or other period, the total amount owed with respect to all orders transmitted by one bank shall be set off against the total amount owed with respect to all orders transmitted by the other bank.

Payment is due on the payment date of the order, but if acceptance occurs on the payment date after the close of the funds-transfer business day of the bank, payment is due on the next funds-transfer business day. If the bank refuses to pay after demand by the beneficiary and receipt of notice of particular circumstances that will give rise to consequential damages as a result of nonpayment, the beneficiary may recover damages resulting from the refusal to pay to the extent the bank had notice of the damages, unless the bank proves that it did not pay because of a reasonable doubt concerning the right of the beneficiary to payment.</P>
              <P>(b) If a payment order accepted by the beneficiary's bank instructs payment to an account of the beneficiary, the bank is obliged to notify the beneficiary of receipt of the order before midnight of the next funds-transfer business day following the payment date. If the payment order does not instruct payment to an account of the beneficiary, the bank is required to notify the beneficiary only if notice is required by the order. Notice may be given by first class mail or any other means reasonable in the circumstances. If the bank fails to give the required notice, the bank is obliged to pay interest to the beneficiary on the amount of the payment order from the day notice should have been given until the day the beneficiary learned of receipt of the payment order by the bank. No other damages are recoverable. Reasonable attorney's fees are also recoverable if demand for interest is made and refused before an action is brought on the claim.</P>
              <P>(c) The right of a beneficiary to receive payment and damages as stated in subsection (a) may not be varied by agreement or a funds-transfer system rule. The right of a beneficiary to be notified as stated in subsection (b) may be varied by agreement of the beneficiary or by a funds-transfer system rule if the beneficiary is notified of the rule before initiation of the funds transfer.</P>

              <P>(b) If the beneficiary's bank does not credit an account of the beneficiary of a payment order, the time when payment of the bank's obligation under section 4A-404(a) occurs is governed by principles of law that determine when an obligation is satisfied.</P>

              <P>(c) Except as stated in subsections (d) and (e), if the beneficiary's bank pays the beneficiary of a payment order under a condition <PRTPAGE P="301"/>to payment or agreement of the beneficiary giving the bank the right to recover payment from the beneficiary if the bank does not receive payment of the order, the condition to payment or agreement is not enforceable.</P>
              <P>(d) A funds-transfer system rule may provide that payments made to beneficiaries of funds transfer made through the system are provisional until receipt of payment by the beneficiary's bank of the payment order it accepted. A beneficiary's bank that makes a payment that is provisional under the rule is entitled to refund from the beneficiary if (i) the rule requires that both the beneficiary and the originator be given notice of the provisional nature of the payment before the funds transfer is initiated, (ii) the beneficiary, the beneficiary's bank and the originator's bank agreed to be bound by the rule, and (iii) the beneficiary's bank did not receive payment of the payment order that it accepted. If the beneficiary is obliged to refund payment to the beneficiary's bank, acceptance of the payment order by the beneficiary's bank is nullified and no payment by the originator of the funds transfer to the beneficiary occurs under section 4A-406.</P>
              <P>(e) This subsection applies to a funds transfer that includes a payment order transmitted over a funds-transfer system that (i) nets obligations-multilaterally among participants, and (ii) has in effect a loss-sharing agreement among participants for the purpose of providing funds necessary to complete settlement of the obligations of one or more participants that do not meet their settlement obligations. If the beneficiary's bank in the funds transfer accepts a payment order and the system fails to complete settlement pursuant to its rules with respect to any payment order in the funds transfer, (i) the acceptance by the beneficiary's bank is nullified and no person has any right or obligation based on the acceptance, (ii) the beneficiary's bank is entitled to recover payment from the beneficiary, (iii) no payment by the originator to the beneficiary occurs under section 4A-406, and (iv) subject to section 4A-402(e), each sender in the funds transfer is excused from its obligation to pay its payment order under section 4A-402(c) because the funds transfer has not been completed.</P>

              <P>(b) If payment under subsection (a) is made to satisfy an obligation, the obligation is discharged to the same extent discharge would result from payment to the beneficiary of the same amount in money, unless (i) the payment under subsection (a) was made by a means prohibited by the contract of the beneficiary with respect to the obligation, (ii) the beneficiary, within a reasonable time after receiving notice of receipt of the order by the beneficiary's bank, notified the originator of the beneficiary's refusal of the payment, (iii) funds with respect to the order were not withdrawn by the beneficiary or applied to a debt of the beneficiary, and (iv) the beneficiary would suffer a loss that could reasonably have been avoided if payment had been made by a means complying with the contract. If payment by the originator does not result in discharge under this section, the originator is subrogated to the rights of the beneficiary to receive payment from the beneficiary's bank under section 4A-404(a).</P>
              <P>(c) For the purpose of determining whether discharge of an obligation occurs under subsection (b), if the beneficiary's bank accepts a payment order in an amount equal to the amount of the originator's payment order less charges of one or more receiving banks in the funds transfer, payment to the beneficiary is deemed to be in the amount of the originator's order unless upon demand by the beneficiary the originator does not pay the beneficiary the amount of the deducted charges.</P>

For the purpose of determining rights with respect to the creditor process, if the receiving bank accepts the payment order the balance in the authorized account is deemed to be reduced by the amount of the payment order to the extent the bank did not otherwise receive payment of the order, unless the creditor process is served at a time and in a manner affording the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it before the bank accepts the payment order.</P>

              <P>(3) If creditor process with respect to the beneficiary's account has been served and the bank has had a reasonable opportunity to act on it, the bank may not reject the payment order except for a reason unrelated to the service of process.</P>
              <P>(d) Creditor process with respect to a payment by the originator to the beneficiary pursuant to a funds transfer may be served only on the beneficiary's bank with respect to the debt owned by that bank to the beneficiary. Any other bank served with the creditor process is not obliged to act with respect to the process.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 4A-503. Injunction or Restraining Order with Respect to Funds Transfer</HD>
              <P>For proper cause and in compliance with applicable law, a court may restrain (i) a person from issuing a payment order to initiate a funds transfer, (ii) an originator's bank from executing the payment order of the originator, or (iii) the beneficiary's bank from releasing funds to the beneficiary or the beneficiary from withdrawing the funds. A court may not otherwise restrain a person from issuing a payment order, paying or receiving payment of a payment order, or otherwise acting with respect to a funds transfer.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 4A-504. Order In Which Items and Payment Orders May Be Charged to Account; Order of Withdrawals from Account</HD>
              <P>(a) If a receiving bank has received more than one payment order of the sender or one or more payment orders and other items that are payable from the sender's account, the bank may charge the sender's account with respect to the various orders and items in any sequence.</P>
              <P>(b) In determining whether a credit to an account has been withdrawn by the holder of the account or applied to a debt of the holder of the account, credits first made to the account are first withdrawn or applied.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 4A-505. Preclusion of Objection to Debit of Customer's Account</HD>
              <P>If a receiving bank has received payment from its customer with respect to a payment order issued in the name of the customer as sender and accepted by the bank, and the customer received notification reasonably identifying the order, the customer is precluded from asserting that the bank is not entitled to retain the payment unless the customer notifies the bank of the customer's objection to the payment within one year after the notification was received by the customer.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 4A-506. Rate of Interest</HD>
              <P>(a) If, under this Article, a receiving bank is obliged to pay interest with respect to a payment order issued to the bank, the amount payable may be determined (i) by agreement of the sender and receiving bank, or (ii) by a funds-transfer system rule if the payment order is transmitted through a funds-transfer system.</P>

              <P>(b) If the amount of interest is not determined by an agreement or rule as stated in subsection (a), the amount is calculated by multiplying the applicable Federal Funds rate by the amount on which interest is payable, and then multiplying the product by the number of days for which interest is payable. The applicable Federal Funds rate is the average of the Federal Funds rates published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for each of the days for which interest is payable divided by 360. The Federal Funds rate for any day on which a published rate is not available is the same as the published <PRTPAGE P="303"/>rate for the next preceding day for which there is a published rate. If a receiving bank that accepted a payment order is required to refund payment to the sender of the order because the funds transfer was not completed, but the failure to complete was not due to any fault by the bank, the interest payable is reduced by a percentage equal to the reserve requirement on deposits of the receiving bank.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">Section 4A-507. Choice of Law</HD>
              <P>(a) The following rules apply unless the affected parties otherwise agree or subsection (c) applies:</P>
              <P>(1) The rights and obligations between the sender of a payment order and the receiving bank are governed by the law of the jurisdiction in which the receiving bank is located.</P>
              <P>(2) The rights and obligations between the beneficiary's bank and the beneficiary are governed by the law of the jurisdiction in which the beneficiary's bank is located.</P>
              <P>(3) The issue of when payment is made pursuant to a funds transfer by the originator to the beneficiary is governed by the law of the jurisdiction in which the beneficiary's bank is located.</P>
              <P>(b) If the parties described in each paragraph of subsection (a) have made an agreement selecting the law of a particular jurisdiction to govern rights and obligations between each other, the law of that jurisdiction governs those rights and obligations, whether or not the payment order or the funds transfer bears a reasonable relation to that jurisdiction.</P>
              <P>(c) A funds-transfer system rule may select the law of a particular jurisdiction to govern (i) rights and obligations between participating banks with respect to payment orders transmitted or processed through the system, or (ii) the rights and obligations of some or all parties to a funds transfer any part of which is carried out by means of the system. A choice of law made pursuant to clause (i) is binding on participating banks. A choice of law made pursuant to clause (ii) is binding on the originator, other sender, or a receiving bank having notice that the funds-transfer system might be used in the funds transfer and of the choice of law by the system when the originator, other sender, or receiving bank issued or accepted a payment order. The beneficiary of a funds transfer is bound by the choice of law if, when the funds transfer is initiated, the beneficiary has notice that the funds-transfer system might be used in the funds transfer and of the choice of law by the system. The law of a jurisdiction selected pursuant to this subsection may govern, whether or not that law bears a reasonable relation to the matter in issue.</P>
              <P>(d) In the event of inconsistency between an agreement under subsection (b) and a choice-of-law rule under subsection (c), the agreement under subsection (b) prevails.</P>
              <P>(e) If a funds transfer is made by use of more than one funds-transfer system and there is inconsistency between choice-of-law rules of the systems, the matter in issue is governed by the law of the selected jurisdiction that has the most significant relationship to the matter in issue.</P>

              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Basis for determining comprehensive consolidated supervision.</E> In determining whether a foreign bank and any parent foreign bank is subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision, the Board shall determine whether the foreign bank is supervised or regulated in such a manner that its home country supervisor receives sufficient information on the worldwide operations of the foreign bank (including the relationships of the bank to any affiliate) to assess the foreign bank's overall financial condition and compliance with law and regulation. In making such a determination, the Board shall assess, among other factors, the extent to which the home country supervisor:</P>
              <P>(A) Ensures that the foreign bank has adequate procedures for monitoring and controlling its activities worldwide;</P>
              <P>(B) Obtains information on the condition of the foreign bank and its subsidiaries and offices outside the home country through regular reports of examination, audit reports, or otherwise;</P>
              <P>(C) Obtains information on the dealings and relationship between the foreign bank and its affiliates, both foreign and domestic;</P>
              <P>(D) Receives from the foreign bank financial reports that are consolidated on a worldwide basis, or comparable information that permits analysis of the foreign bank's financial condition on a worldwide, consolidated basis;</P>
              <P>(E) Evaluates prudential standards, such as capital adequacy and risk asset exposure, on a worldwide basis.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Determination of comprehensive consolidated supervision not required in certain circumstances.</E> (A) If the Board is unable to find, under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, that a foreign bank is subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision, the Board may, nevertheless, approve an application by the foreign bank if:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The home country supervisor is actively working to establish arrangements for the consolidated supervision of such bank; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) All other factors are consistent with approval.</P>

              <P>(B) In deciding whether to use its discretion under this paragraph (c)(1)(iii), the Board also shall consider whether the foreign bank has adopted and implemented procedures to combat money laundering. The Board also may take into account whether the home country supervisor is developing a <PRTPAGE P="334"/>legal regime to address money laundering or is participating in multilateral efforts to combat money laundering. In approving an application under this paragraph (c)(1)(iii), the Board, after requesting and taking into consideration the views of the licensing authority, may impose any conditions or restrictions relating to the activities or business operations of the proposed branch, agency, or commercial lending company subsidiary, including restrictions on sources of funding. The Board shall coordinate with the licensing authority in the implementation of such conditions or restrictions.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Additional standards.</E> In acting on any application under this subpart, the Board may take into account:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Consent of home country supervisor.</E> Whether the home country supervisor of the foreign bank has consented to the proposed establishment of the branch, agency, or commercial lending company subsidiary;</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Financial resources.</E> The financial resources of the foreign bank (including the foreign bank's capital position, projected capital position, profitability, level of indebtedness, and future prospects) and the condition of any U.S. office of the foreign bank;</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Managerial resources.</E> The managerial resources of the foreign bank, including the competence, experience, and integrity of the officers and directors; the integrity of its principal shareholders; management's experience and capacity to engage in international banking; and the record of the foreign bank and its management of complying with laws and regulations, and of fulfilling any commitments to, and any conditions imposed by, the Board in connection with any prior application;</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Sharing information with supervisors.</E> Whether the foreign bank's home country supervisor and the home country supervisor of any parent of the foreign bank share material information regarding the operations of the foreign bank with other supervisory authorities;</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Assurances to Board.</E> (A) Whether the foreign bank has provided the Board with adequate assurances that information will be made available to the Board on the operations or activities of the foreign bank and any of its affiliates that the Board deems necessary to determine and enforce compliance with the IBA, the BHC Act, and other applicable federal banking statutes.</P>
              <P>(B) These assurances shall include a statement from the foreign bank describing the laws that would restrict the foreign bank or any of its parents from providing information to the Board;</P>
              <P>(vi) <E T="03">Measures for prevention of money laundering.</E> Whether the foreign bank has adopted and implemented procedures to combat money laundering, whether there is a legal regime in place in the home country to address money laundering, and whether the home country is participating in multilateral efforts to combat money laundering;</P>
              <P>(vii) <E T="03">Compliance with U.S. law.</E> Whether the foreign bank and its U.S. affiliates are in compliance with applicable U.S. law, and whether the applicant has established adequate controls and procedures in each of its offices to ensure continuing compliance with U.S. law, including controls directed to detection of money laundering and other unsafe or unsound banking practices; and (viii) The needs of the community and the history of operation of the foreign bank and its relative size in its home country, provided that the size of the foreign bank is not the sole factor in determining whether an office of a foreign bank should be approved.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Additional standards for certain interstate applications.</E> (i) As specified in section 5(a)(3) of the IBA (12 U.S.C. 3103(a)(3)), the Board may not approve an application by a foreign bank to establish a branch, other than a limited branch, outside the home state of the foreign bank under section 5(a)(1) or (2) of the IBA (12 U.S.C. 3103(a)(1), (2)) unless the Board:</P>
              <P>(A) Determines that the foreign bank's financial resources, including the capital level of the bank, are equivalent to those required for a domestic bank to be approved for branching under section 5155 of the Revised Statutes (12 U.S.C. 36) and section 44 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) (12 U.S.C. 1831u);</P>

              <P>(ii) As specified in section 5(a)(7) of the IBA (12 U.S.C. 3103(a)(7)), the Board may not approve an application to establish a branch through a change in status of an agency or limited branch outside the foreign bank's home state unless:</P>
              <P>(A) The establishment and operation of such branch is permitted by such state; and</P>
              <P>(B) Such agency or branch has been in operation in such state for a period of time that meets the state's minimum age requirement permitted under section 44(a)(5) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 183u(a)(5)).</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Board conditions on approval.</E> The Board may impose any conditions on its approval as it deems necessary, including a condition which may permit future termination by the Board of any activities or, in the case of a federal branch or a federal agency, by the Comptroller, based on the inability of the foreign bank to provide information on its activities or those of its affiliates that the Board deems necessary to determine and enforce compliance with U.S. banking laws.</P>

The standard regarding supervision by the foreign bank's home country supervisor (as set out in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A) of this section) will be met, in the case of a representative office application, if the Board makes a finding that the applicant bank is subject to a supervisory framework that is consistent with the activities of the proposed representative office, taking into account the nature of such activities and the operating record of the applicant.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Special-purpose foreign government-owned banks.</E> A foreign government-owned organization engaged in banking activities in its home country that are not commercial in nature may apply to the Board for a determination that the organization is not a foreign bank for purposes of this section.

              <P>(2) For purposes of this paragraph (g), an office of a foreign bank located outside the United States is “managed or controlled” by a state-licensed branch or agency if a majority of the responsibility for business decisions, including but not limited to decisions with regard to lending or asset management or funding or liability management, or the responsibility for recordkeeping in respect of assets or liabilities for that non-U.S. office, resides at the state-licensed branch or agency.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Grounds for termination</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> Under sections 7(e) and 10(b) of the IBA (12 U.S.C. 3105(d), 3107(b)), the Board may order a foreign bank to terminate the activities of its representative office, state branch, state agency, or commercial lending company subsidiary if the Board finds that:</P>
              <P>(i) The foreign bank is not subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision in accordance with § 211.24(c)(1), and the home country supervisor is not making demonstrable progress in establishing arrangements for the consolidated supervision of the foreign bank; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Both of the following criteria are met:</P>
              <P>(A) There is reasonable cause to believe that the foreign bank, or any of its affiliates, has committed a violation of law or engaged in an unsafe or unsound banking practice in the United States; and</P>
              <P>(B) As a result of such violation or practice, the continued operation of the foreign bank's representative office, state branch, state agency, or commercial lending company subsidiary would not be consistent with the public interest, or with the purposes of the IBA, the BHC Act, or the FDIA.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Additional ground.</E> The Board also may enforce any condition imposed in connection with an order issued under § 211.24.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Factor.</E> In making its findings under this section, the Board may take into account the needs of the community, the history of operation of the foreign bank, and its relative size in its home country, provided that the size of the foreign bank shall not be the sole determining factor in a decision to terminate an office.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Consultation with relevant state supervisor.</E> Except in the case of termination pursuant to the expedited procedure in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the Board shall request and consider the views of the relevant state supervisor before issuing an order terminating the activities of a state branch, state agency, representative office, or commercial lending company subsidiary under this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Termination procedures</E>—(1) <E T="03">Notice and hearing.</E> Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, an order issued under paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be issued only after notice to the relevant state supervisor and the foreign bank and after an opportunity for a hearing.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Procedures for hearing.</E> Hearings under this section shall be conducted pursuant to the Board's Rules of Practice for Hearings (12 CFR part 263).</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Expedited procedure.</E> The Board may act without providing an opportunity for a hearing, if it determines that expeditious action is necessary in order to protect the public interest. When the Board finds that it is necessary to act without providing an opportunity for a hearing, the Board, solely in its discretion, may:</P>

              <P>(i) Provide the foreign bank that is the subject of the termination order <PRTPAGE P="338"/>with notice of the intended termination order;</P>
              <P>(ii) Grant the foreign bank an opportunity to present a written submission opposing issuance of the order; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Take any other action designed to provide the foreign bank with notice and an opportunity to present its views concerning the order.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Termination of federal branch or federal agency.</E> The Board may transmit to the Comptroller a recommendation that the license of a federal branch or federal agency be terminated if the Board has reasonable cause to believe that the foreign bank or any affiliate of the foreign bank has engaged in conduct for which the activities of a state branch or state agency may be terminated pursuant to this section.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Voluntary termination.</E> A foreign bank shall notify the Board at least 30 days prior to terminating the activities of any office. Notice pursuant to this paragraph (f) is in addition to, and does not satisfy, any other federal or state requirements relating to the termination of an office or the requirement for prior notice of the closing of a branch, pursuant to section 39 of the FDIA (12 U.S.C. 1831p).</P>

              <P>(A) Any of the individual components of the ROCA supervisory rating of a branch or agency of a foreign bank is rated “3” or worse;</P>
              <P>(B) The results of any off-site surveillance indicate a deterioration in the condition of the office;</P>
              <P>(C) The size, relative importance, and role of a particular office when reviewed in the context of the foreign bank's entire U.S. operations otherwise necessitate an annual examination; and</P>

              <P>(3) Is conducted as agent rather than as principal, provided that the activity is one that could be conducted by a state-chartered bank headquartered in the same state in which the branch or agency is licensed; or</P>
              <P>(4) Any other activity that the Board has determined may be conducted by any state branch or state agency of a foreign bank without further application to the Board.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Contents of application.</E> An application submitted pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section shall be in letter form and shall contain the following information:</P>

              <P>(5) Any other information that the Reserve Bank deems appropriate.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Factors considered in determination.</E> (1) The Board shall consider the following factors in determining whether a proposed activity is consistent with sound banking practice:</P>

              <P>(e) <E T="03">Application procedures.</E> Applications pursuant to this section shall be filed with the appropriate Federal Reserve Bank. An application shall not be deemed complete until it contains all the information requested by the Reserve Bank and has been accepted. Approval of such an application may be conditioned on the applicant's agreement to conduct the activity subject to specific conditions or limitations.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Divestiture or cessation.</E> (1) If an application for permission to continue to conduct an activity is not approved by the Board or, if applicable, the FDIC, the applicant shall submit a detailed written plan of divestiture or cessation <PRTPAGE P="341"/>of the activity to the appropriate Federal Reserve Bank within 60 days of the disapproval.</P>
              <P>(i) The divestiture or cessation plan shall describe in detail the manner in which the applicant will divest itself of or cease the activity, and shall include a projected timetable describing how long the divestiture or cessation is expected to take.</P>
              <P>(ii) Divestiture or cessation shall be complete within one year from the date of the disapproval, or within such shorter period of time as the Board shall direct.</P>
              <P>(2) If a foreign bank operating a state branch or state agency chooses not to apply to the Board for permission to continue to conduct an activity that is not permissible for a federal branch, or which is rendered impermissible due to a subsequent change in statute, regulation, official bulletin or circular, written order or interpretation, or decision of a court of competent jurisdiction, the foreign bank shall submit a written plan of divestiture or cessation, in conformance with paragraph (f)(1) of this section within 60 days of the effective date of this part or of such change or decision.</P>

              <P>(5) Whether the foreign bank's home country supervisor has any objection to the bank continuing to operate in the United States;</P>
              <P>(6) Whether the foreign bank's home country supervisor and the home country supervisor of any parent of the foreign bank share material information regarding the operations of the foreign bank with other supervisory authorities;</P>
              <P>(7) The relationship of the U.S. operations to the other operations of the foreign bank, including whether the foreign bank maintains funds in its U.S. offices that are in excess of amounts due to its U.S. offices from the foreign bank's non-U.S. offices;</P>

              <P>(16) Any other information relevant to the safety and soundness of the U.S. operations of the foreign bank.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Restrictions on U.S. operations</E>—(1) <E T="03">Terms of agreement.</E> Any foreign bank that the Board determines is not subject to CCS may be required to enter into an agreement to conduct its U.S. operations subject to such restrictions as the Board, having considered the criteria set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, determines to be appropriate in order to ensure the safety and soundness of its U.S. operations.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Failure to enter into or comply with agreement.</E> A foreign bank that is required by the Board to enter into an agreement pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section and either fails to do so, or fails to comply with the terms of such agreement, may be subject to:</P>

              <SUBJECT>Allocated transfer risk reserve.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Establishment of Allocated Transfer Risk Reserve.</E> A banking institution shall establish an allocated transfer risk reserve (ATRR) for specified international assets when required by the Board in accordance with this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Procedures and standards</E>—(1) <E T="03">Joint agency determination.</E> At least annually, the Federal banking agencies shall determine jointly, based on the standards set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Which international assets subject to transfer risk warrant establishment of an ATRR;</P>
              <P>(ii) The amount of the ATRR for the specified assets; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Whether an ATRR established for specified assets may be reduced.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Standards for requiring ATRR</E>—(i) <E T="03">Evaluation of assets.</E> The Federal banking agencies shall apply the following criteria in determining whether an ATRR is required for particular international assets:</P>
              <P>(A) Whether the quality of a banking institution's assets has been impaired by a protracted inability of public or private obligors in a foreign country to make payments on their external indebtedness as indicated by such factors, among others, as whether:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Such obligors have failed to make full interest payments on external indebtedness; or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Such obligors have failed to comply with the terms of any restructured indebtedness; or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) A foreign country has failed to comply with any International Monetary Fund or other suitable adjustment program; or</P>
              <P>(B) Whether no definite prospects exist for the orderly restoration of debt service.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Determination of amount of ATRR.</E> (A) In determining the amount of the ATRR, the Federal banking agencies shall consider:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The length of time the quality of the asset has been impaired;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Recent actions taken to restore debt service capability;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Prospects for restored asset quality; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) Such other factors as the Federal banking agencies may consider relevant to the quality of the asset.</P>

              <P>(B) The initial year's provision for the ATRR shall be ten percent of the principal amount of each specified international asset, or such greater or <PRTPAGE P="346"/>lesser percentage determined by the Federal banking agencies. Additional provision, if any, for the ATRR in subsequent years shall be fifteen percent of the principal amount of each specified international asset, or such greater or lesser percentage determined by the Federal banking agencies.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Board notification.</E> Based on the joint agency determinations under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the Board shall notify each banking institution holding assets subject to an ATRR:</P>
              <P>(i) Of the amount of the ATRR to be established by the institution for specified international assets; and</P>
              <P>(ii) That an ATRR established for specified assets may be reduced.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Accounting treatment of ATRR</E>—(1) <E T="03">Charge to current income.</E> A banking institution shall establish an ATRR by a charge to current income and the amounts so charged shall not be included in the banking institution's capital or surplus.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Separate accounting.</E> A banking institution shall account for an ATRR separately from the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses, and shall deduct the ATRR from “gross loans and leases” to arrive at “net loans and leases.” The ATRR must be established for each asset subject to the ATRR in the percentage amount specified.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Consolidation.</E> A banking institution shall establish an ATRR, as required, on a consolidated basis. For banks, consolidation should be in accordance with the procedures and tests of significance set forth in the instructions for preparation of <E T="03">Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income</E> (FFIEC 031 and 041). For bank holding companies, the consolidation shall be in accordance with the principles set forth in the “Instructions to Consolidated Financial Statements for Bank Holding Companies” (Form F.R. Y-9C). Edge and Agreement corporations engaged in banking shall report in accordance with instructions for preparation of the Report of Condition for Edge and Agreement Corporations (Form F.R. 2886b).</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Alternative accounting treatment.</E> A banking institution need not establish an ATRR if it writes down in the period in which the ATRR is required, or has written down in prior periods, the value of the specified international assets in the requisite amount for each such asset. For purposes of this paragraph, international assets may be written down by a charge to the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses or a reduction in the principal amount of the asset by application of interest payments or other collections on the asset; provided, that only those international assets that may be charged to the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles may be written down by a charge to the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses. However, the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses must be replenished in such amount necessary to restore it to a level which adequately provides for the estimated losses inherent in the banking institution's loan portfolio.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Reduction of ATRR.</E> A banking institution may reduce an ATRR when notified by the Board or, at any time, by writing down such amount of the international asset for which the ATRR was established.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Status of certain offices for purposes of the International Banking Act restrictions on interstate banking operations.</SUBJECT>

                <P>The Board has considered the question of whether a foreign bank's California office that may accept deposits from certain foreign sources (e.g., a United States citizen residing abroad) is a branch or an agency for the purposes of the grandfather provisions of section 5 of the International Banking Act of 1978 (12 U.S.C. 3103(b)). The question has arisen as a result of the definitions in the International Banking Act of <E T="03">branch</E> and <E T="03">agency,</E> and the limited deposit-taking capabilities of certain California offices of foreign banks.</P>
                <P>The International Banking Act defines <E T="03">agency</E> as “any office * * * at which deposits may not be accepted from citizens or residents of the United States,” and defines <E T="03">branch</E> as “any office * * * of a foreign bank * * * at which deposits are received” (12 U.S.C. 3101(1) and (3)). Offices of foreign banks in California prior to the International Banking Act were generally prohibited from accepting deposits by the requirement of State law that such offices obtain Federal deposit insurance (Cal. Fin. Code 1756); until the passage of the International Banking Act an office of a foreign bank could not obtain such insurance. California law, however, permits offices of foreign banks, with the approval of the Banking Department, to accept deposits from any person that resides, is domiciled, and maintains its principal place of business in a foreign country (Cal. Fin. Code 1756.2). Thus, under a literal reading of the definitions of <E T="03">branch</E> and <E T="03">agency</E> contained in the International Banking Act, a foreign bank's California office that accepts deposits from certain foreign sources (e.g., a U.S. citizen residing abroad), is a branch rather than an agency.</P>

                <P>Section 5 of the International Banking Act establishes certain limitations on the expansion of the domestic deposit-taking capabilities of a foreign bank outside its home State. It also grandfathers offices established or applied for prior to July 27, 1978, and permits a foreign bank to select its home State from among the States in which it operated branches and agencies on the grandfather date. If a foreign bank's office that was established or applied for prior to June 27, 1978, is a <E T="03">branch</E> as defined in the International Banking Act, then it is grandfathered as a branch. Accordingly, a foreign bank could designate a State other than California as its home State and subsequently convert its California office to a full domestic deposit-taking facility by obtaining Federal deposit insurance. If, however, the office is determined to be an <E T="03">agency,</E> then it is grandfathered as such and the foreign bank may not expand its deposit-taking capabilities in California without declaring California its home State.<PRTPAGE P="348"/>
                </P>
                <P>In the Board's view, it would be inconsistent with the purposes and the legislative history of the International Banking Act to enable a foreign bank to expand its domestic interstate deposit-taking capabilities by grandfathering these California offices as branches because of their ability to receive certain foreign source deposits. The Board also notes that such deposits are of the same general type that may be received by an Edge Corporation and, hence in accordance with section 5(a) of the International Banking Act, by branches established and operated outside a foreign bank's home State. It would be inconsistent with the structure of the interstate banking provisions of the International Banking Act to grandfather as full deposit-taking offices those facilities whose activities have been determined by Congress to be appropriate for a foreign bank's out-of-home State branches.</P>
                <P>Accordingly, the Board, in administering the interstate banking provisions of the IBA, regards as agencies those offices of foreign banks that do not accept domestic deposits but that may accept deposits from any person that resides, is domiciled, and maintains its principal place of business in a foreign country.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Investments by United States Banking Organizations in foreign companies that transact business in the United States.</SUBJECT>
                <P>Section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 611, the “Edge Act”) provides for the establishment of corporations to engage in international or foreign banking or other international or foreign financial operations (“Edge Corporations”). Congress has declared that Edge Corporations are to serve the purpose of stimulating the provision of international banking and financing services throughout the United States and are to have powers sufficiently broad to enable them to compete effectively with foreign-owned institutions in the United States and abroad. The Board was directed by the International Banking Act of 1978 (12 U.S.C. 3101) to revise its regulations governing Edge Corporations in order to accomplish these and other objectives and was further directed to modify or eliminate any interpretations that impede the attainment of these purposes.</P>
                <P>One of the powers of Edge Corporations is that of investing in foreign companies. Under the relevant statutes, however, an Edge Corporation is prohibited from investing in foreign companies that engage in the general business of buying or selling goods, wares, merchandise or commodities in the United States. In addition, an Edge Corporation may not invest in foreign companies that transact any business in the United States that is not, in the Board's judgment, “incidental” to its international or foreign business. The latter limitation also applies to investments by bank holding companies (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(13)) and member banks (12 U.S.C. 601).</P>
                <P>The Board has been asked to determine whether an Edge Corporation's minority investment (involving less than 25 percent of the voting shares) in a foreign company would continue to be permissible after the foreign company establishes or acquires a United States subsidiary that engages in domestic activities that are closely related to banking. The Board has also been asked to determine whether an Edge Corporation's minority investment in a foreign bank would continue to be permissible after the foreign bank establishes a branch in the United States that engages in domestic banking activities. In the latter case, the branch would be located outside the State in which the Edge Corporation and its parent bank are located.</P>

                <P>In the past the Board, in exercising its discretionary authority to determine those activities that are permissible in the United States, has followed the policy that an Edge Corporation could not hold even a minority interest in a foreign company that engaged, directly or indirectly, in any purely domestic business in the United States. The United States activities considered permissible were those internationally related activities that Edge Corporations may engage in directly. If this policy were applied to the subject requests, the Edge Corporations would be required to divest their interests in the foreign companies notwithstanding the <PRTPAGE P="349"/>fact that, in each case, the Edge Corporation, as a minority investor, did not control the decision to undertake activities in the United States, and that even after the United States activities are undertaken the business of the foreign company will remain predominantly outside the United States.</P>
                <P>International banking and finance have undergone considerable growth and change in recent years. It is increasingly common, for example, for United States institutions to have direct or indirect offices in foreign countries and to engage in activities at those offices that are domestically as well as internationally oriented. In this climate, United States banking organizations would be placed at a competitive disadvantage if their minority investments in foreign companies were limited to those companies that do no domestic business in the United States. Moreover, continued adherence to the existing policy would be contrary to the declaration in the International Banking Act of 1978 that Edge Corporations' powers are to be sufficiently broad to enable them to compete effectively in the United States and abroad. Furthermore, where the activities to be conducted in the United States by the foreign company are banking or closely related to banking, it does not appear that any regulatory or supervisory purpose would be served by prohibiting a minority investment in the foreign firm by a United States banking organization.</P>
                <P>In view of these considerations, the Board has reviewed its policy relating to the activities that may be engaged in the United States by foreign companies (including foreign banks) in which Edge Corporations, member banks, and bank holding companies invest. As a result of that review, the Board has determined that it would be appropriate to interpret sections 25 and 25(a)of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 601, 611) and section 4(c)(13) of the Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(13)) generally to allow United States banking organizations, with the prior consent of the Board, to acquire and hold investments in foreign companies that do business in the United States subject to the following conditions:</P>
                <P>(1) The foreign company is engaged predominantly in business outside the United States or in internationally related activities in the United States;*<FTREF/>
                </P>
                <FTNT>
                  <P>*This condition would ordinarily not be met where a foreign company merely maintains a majority of its business in international activities. Each case will be scrutinized to ensure that the activities in the United States do not alter substantially the international orientation of the foreign company's business.</P>
                </FTNT>
                <P>(2) The direct or indirect activities of the foreign company in the United States are either banking or closely related to banking; and</P>

                <P>(3) The United States banking organization does not own 25 percent or more of the voting stock of, or otherwise control, the foreign company.
                </P>
                <FP>In considering whether to grant its consent for such investments, the Board would also review the proposals to ensure that they are consistent with the purposes of the Bank Holding Company Act and the Federal Reserve Act.</FP>

                <SUBJECT>Data processing activities.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Introduction.</E> As a result of a recent proposal by a bank holding company to engage in data processing activities abroad, the Board has considered the scope of permissible data processing activities under Regulation K (12 CFR part 211). This question has arisen as a result of the fact that § 211.5(d)(10) of Regulation K does not specifically indicate the scope of data processing as a permissible activity abroad.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Scope of data processing activities.</E> (1) Prior to 1979, the Board authorized specific banking organizations to engage in data processing activities abroad with the expectation that such activity would be primarily related to financial activities. When Regulation K was issued in 1979, data processing was included as a permissible activity abroad. Although the regulation did <PRTPAGE P="350"/>not provide specific guidance on the scope of this authority, the Board has considered such authority to be coextensive with the authority granted in specific cases prior to the issuance of Regulation K, which relied on the fact that most of the activity would relate to financial data. Regulation K does not address related activities such as the manufacture of hardware or the provision of software or related or incidental services.</P>
                <P>(2) In 1979, when the activity was included in Regulation K for the first time, the data processing authority in Regulation K was somewhat broader than that permissible in the United States under Regulation Y (12 CFR part 225) at that time, as the Regulation K authority permitted limited non-financial data processing. In 1979, Regulation Y authorized only financial data processing activities for third parties, with very limited exceptions. By 1997, however, the scope of data processing activities under Regulation Y was expanded such that bank holding companies are permitted to derive up to 30 percent of their data processing revenues from processing data that is not financial, banking, or economic. Moreover, in other respects, the Regulation Y provision is broader than the data processing provision in Regulation K.</P>
                <P>(3) In light of the fact that the permissible scope of data processing activities under Regulation Y is now equal to, and in some respects, broader than the activity originally authorized under Regulation K, the Board believes that § 211.5(d)(10) should be read to encompass all of the activities permissible under § 225.28(b)(14) of Regulation Y. In addition, the limitations of that section would also apply to § 211.5(d)(10).</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Applications.</E> If a U.S. banking organization wishes to engage abroad in data processing or data transmission activities beyond those described in Regulation Y, it must apply for the Board's prior consent under § 211.5(d)(20) of Regulation K. In addition, if any investor has commenced activities beyond those permitted under § 225.28(b)(14) of Regulation Y in reliance on Regulation K, it should consult with staff of the Board to determine whether such activities have been properly authorized under Regulation K.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Introduction.</E> A number of foreign banks that are subject to the Bank Holding Company Act (“BHC Act”) have participated as co-managers in the underwriting of securities to be distributed in the United States despite the fact that the foreign banks in question do not have authority to engage in underwriting activity in the United States under either the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLB Act”) or section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)). This interpretation clarifies the scope of existing restrictions on underwriting by such foreign banks with respect to securities that are distributed in the United States.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Underwriting transactions engaged in by foreign banks.</E> (1) In the transactions in question, a foreign bank typically becomes a member of the underwriting syndicate for securities that are registered and intended to be distributed in the United States. The lead underwriter, usually a registered U.S. broker-dealer not affiliated with the foreign bank, agrees to be responsible for distributing the securities being underwritten. The underwriting obligation is assumed by a foreign office or affiliate of the foreign bank.</P>
                <P>(2) The foreign banks have used their U.S. offices or affiliates to act as liaison with the U.S. issuer and the lead underwriter in the United States, to prepare documentation and to provide other services in connection with the underwriting. In some cases, the U.S. offices or affiliates that assisted the foreign bank with the underwriting receive a substantial portion of the revenue generated by the foreign bank's participation in the underwriting. In other cases, the U.S. offices receive “credit” from the head office of the foreign bank for their assistance in generating profits arising from the underwriting.</P>

                <P>(3) By assuming the underwriting risk and booking the underwriting fees in their foreign offices or affiliates, the <PRTPAGE P="351"/>foreign banks are able to take advantage of an exemption under U.S. securities laws; a foreign underwriter is not required to register in the United States if the underwriter either does not distribute any of the securities in the United States or distributes them only through a registered broker-dealer.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Permissible scope of underwriting activities.</E> (1) A foreign bank that is subject to the BHC Act may engage in underwriting activities in the United States only if it has been authorized under section 4 of the Act. The foreign banks in question have argued that they are not engaged in underwriting activity in the United States because the underwriting activity takes place only outside the United States where the transaction is booked. The foreign banks refer to Regulation K, which defines “engaged in business” or “engaged in activities” to mean conducting an activity through an office or subsidiary in the United States. Because the underwriting is not booked in a U.S. office or subsidiary, the banks assert that the activity cannot be considered conducted in the United States.</P>
                <P>(2) The Board believes that the position taken by the foreign banks is not supported by the Board's regulations or policies. Section 225.124 of the Board's Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.124(d)) states that a foreign bank will not be considered to be engaged in the activity of underwriting in the United States if the shares to be underwritten are distributed outside the United States. In the transactions in question, all of the securities to be underwritten by the foreign banks are distributed in the United States.</P>
                <P>(3) Regulation K (12 CFR part 211) was amended in 1985 to provide clarification that a foreign bank may not own or control voting shares of a foreign company that directly underwrites, sells or distributes securities in the United States (emphasis added). 12 CFR 211.23(f)(5)(ii). In proposing this latter provision, the Board clarified that no part of the prohibited underwriting process may take place in the United States and that the prohibition on the activity does not depend on the activity being conducted through an office or subsidiary in the United States. Moreover, in the transactions in question, there was significant participation by U.S. offices and affiliates of the foreign banks in the underwriting process. In some transactions, the foreign office at which the transactions were booked did not have any documentation on the particular transactions; all documentation was maintained in the United States office. In all cases, the U.S. offices or affiliates provided virtually all technical support for participation in the underwriting process and benefitted from profits generated by the activity.</P>
                <P>(4) The fact that some technological and regulatory constraints on the delivery of cross-border services into the United States have been eliminated since the Regulation K definition of “engaged in business” was adopted in 1979 creates greater scope for banking organizations to deal with customers outside the U.S. bank regulatory framework. The definition in Regulation K, however, does not authorize foreign banking organizations to evade regulatory restrictions on securities activities in the United States by directly underwriting securities to be distributed in the United States or by using U.S. offices and affiliates to facilitate the prohibited activity. In the GLB Act, Congress established a framework within which both domestic and foreign banking organizations may underwrite and deal in securities in the United States. The GLB Act requires that banking organizations meet certain financial and managerial requirements in order to be able to engage in these activities in the United States. The Board believes the practices described above undermine this legislative framework and constitute an evasion of the requirements of the GLB Act and the Board's Regulation K. Foreign banking organizations that wish to conduct securities underwriting activity in the United States have long had the option of obtaining section 20 authority and now have the option of obtaining financial holding company status.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Conclusion.</E> The Board finds that the underwriting of securities to be distributed in the United States is an activity conducted in the United States, regardless of the location at which the <PRTPAGE P="352"/>underwriting risk is assumed and the underwriting fees are booked. Consequently, any banking organization that wishes to engage in such activity must either be a financial holding company under the GLB Act or have authority to engage in underwriting activity under section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act (so-called “section 20 authority”). Revenue generated by underwriting bank-ineligible securities in such transactions should be attributed to the section 20 company for those foreign banks that operate under section 20 authority.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Authority.</E> This part is issued under the provisions of the Depository Institution Management Interlocks Act (Interlocks Act) (12 U.S.C. 3201 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), as amended.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The purpose of the Interlocks Act and this part is to foster competition by generally prohibiting a management official from serving two nonaffiliated depository organizations in situations where the management interlock likely would have an anticompetitive effect.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Scope.</E> This part applies to management officials of state member banks, bank holding companies, and their affiliates.</P>

            <P>(2) For purposes of section 202(3)(B) of the Interlocks Act (12 U.S.C. 3201(3)(B)), an affiliate relationship based on common ownership does not exist if the Board determines, after giving the affected persons the opportunity to respond, that the asserted affiliation was established in order to avoid the prohibitions of the Interlocks Act and does not represent a true commonality of interest between the depository organizations. In making this determination, the Board considers, among other things, whether a person, including members of his or her immediate family, whose shares are necessary to constitute the group owns a nominal percentage of the shares of one of the organizations and the percentage is substantially disproportionate to that person's ownership of shares in the other organization.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Area median income</E> means:</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Authority.</E> The regulation in this part, known as Regulation M, is issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to implement the consumer leasing provisions of the Truth in Lending Act, which is title I of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, as amended (15 U.S.C. 1601 <E T="03">et seq.</E>). Information collection requirements contained in this regulation have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. 3501 <E T="03">et seq.</E> and have been assigned OMB control number 7100-0202.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Scope and purpose.</E> This part applies to all persons that are lessors of personal property under consumer leases as those terms are defined in § 213.2(e)(1) and (h). The purpose of this part is:</P>
            <P>(1) To ensure that lessees of personal property receive meaningful disclosures that enable them to compare lease terms with other leases and, where appropriate, with credit transactions;</P>
            <P>(2) To limit the amount of balloon payments in consumer lease transactions; and</P>
            <P>(3) To provide for the accurate disclosure of lease terms in advertising.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Enforcement and liability.</E> Section 108 of the act contains the administrative enforcement provisions. Sections 112, 130, 131, and 185 of the act contain the liability provisions for failing to comply with the requirements of the act and this part.</P>

            <P>(2) The highest offer for disposition of the leased property; or</P>
            <P>(3) The fair market value of the leased property at the end of the lease term.</P>
            <P>(n) <E T="03">Residual value</E> means the value of the leased property at the end of the lease term, as estimated or assigned at consummation by the lessor, used in calculating the base periodic payment.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 213.3</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>General disclosure requirements.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General requirements.</E> A lessor shall make the disclosures required by § 213.4, as applicable. The disclosures <PRTPAGE P="358"/>shall be made clearly and conspicuously in writing in a form the consumer may keep, in accordance with this section. The disclosures required by this part may be provided to the lessee in electronic form, subject to compliance with the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act) (15 U.S.C. § 7001 <E T="03">et seq.</E>). For an advertisement accessed by the consumer in electronic form, the disclosures required by § 213.7 may be provided to the consumer in electronic form in the advertisement, without regard to the consumer consent or other provisions of the E-Sign Act.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Form of disclosures.</E> The disclosures required by § 213.4 shall be given to the lessee together in a dated statement that identifies the lessor and the lessee; the disclosures may be made either in a separate statement that identifies the consumer lease transaction or in the contract or other document evidencing the lease. Alternatively, the disclosures required to be segregated from other information under paragraph (a)(2) of this section may be provided in a separate dated statement that identifies the lease, and the other required disclosures may be provided in the lease contract or other document evidencing the lease. In a lease of multiple items, the property description required by § 213.4(a) may be given in a separate statement that is incorporated by reference in the disclosure statement required by this paragraph.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Segregation of certain disclosures.</E> The following disclosures shall be segregated from other information and shall contain only directly related information: §§ 213.4(b) through (f), (g)(2), (h)(3), (i)(1), (j), and (m)(1). The headings, content, and format for the disclosures referred to in this paragraph (a)(2) shall be provided in a manner substantially similar to the applicable model form in appendix A of this part.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Timing of disclosures.</E> A lessor shall provide the disclosures to the lessee prior to the consummation of a consumer lease.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Language of disclosures.</E> The disclosures required by § 213.4 may be made in a language other than English provided that they are made available in English upon the lessee's request.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Additional information; nonsegregated disclosures.</E> Additional information may be provided with any disclosure not listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, but it shall not be stated, used, or placed so as to mislead or confuse the lessee or contradict, obscure, or detract attention from any disclosure required by this part.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Multiple lessors or lessees.</E> When a transaction involves more than one lessor, the disclosures required by this part may be made by one lessor on behalf of all the lessors. When a lease involves more than one lessee, the lessor may provide the disclosures to any lessee who is primarily liable on the lease.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Use of estimates.</E> If an amount or other item needed to comply with a required disclosure is unknown or unavailable after reasonable efforts have been made to ascertain the information, the lessor may use a reasonable estimate that is based on the best information available to the lessor, is clearly identified as an estimate, and is not used to circumvent or evade any disclosures required by this part.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Effect of subsequent occurrence.</E> If a required disclosure becomes inaccurate because of an event occurring after consummation, the inaccuracy is not a violation of this part.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Minor variations.</E> A lessor may disregard the effects of the following in making disclosures:</P>
            <P>(1) That payments must be collected in whole cents;</P>
            <P>(2) That dates of scheduled payments may be different because a scheduled date is not a business day;</P>
            <P>(3) That months have different numbers of days; and</P>
            <P>(4) That February 29 occurs in a leap year.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Renegotiation.</E> A renegotiation occurs when a consumer lease subject to this part is satisfied and replaced by a new lease undertaken by the same consumer. A renegotiation requires new disclosures, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Extension.</E> An extension is a continuation, agreed to by the lessor and the lessee, of an existing consumer lease beyond the originally scheduled end of the lease term, except when the continuation is the result of a renegotiation. An extension that exceeds six months requires new disclosures, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Assumption.</E> New disclosures are not required when a consumer lease is assumed by another person, whether or not the lessor charges an assumption fee.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Exceptions.</E> New disclosures are not required for the following, even if they meet the definition of a renegotiation or an extension:</P>
            <P>(1) A reduction in the rent charge;</P>
            <P>(2) The deferment of one or more payments, whether or not a fee is charged;</P>
            <P>(3) The extension of a lease for not more than six months on a month-to-month basis or otherwise;</P>
            <P>(4) A substitution of leased property with property that has a substantially equivalent or greater economic value, provided no other lease terms are changed;</P>
            <P>(5) The addition, deletion, or substitution of leased property in a multiple-item lease, provided the average periodic payment does not change by more than 25 percent; or</P>
            <P>(6) An agreement resulting from a court proceeding.</P>

If a lessor cannot comply with a state law without violating a provision of this part, the state law is inconsistent within the meaning of section 186(a) of the act and is preempted, unless the state law gives greater protection and benefit to the consumer. A state, through an official having primary enforcement or interpretative responsibilities for the state consumer leasing law, may apply to the Board for a preemption determination.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Exemptions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Application.</E> A state may apply to the Board for an exemption from the requirements of the act and this part for any class of lease transactions within the state. The Board will grant such an exemption if the Board determines that:</P>
            <P>(i) The class of leasing transactions is subject to state law requirements substantially similar to the act and this part or that lessees are afforded greater protection under state law; and</P>

            <P>(2) <E T="03">Enforcement and liability.</E> After an exemption has been granted, the requirements of the applicable state law (except for additional requirements not imposed by federal law) will constitute the requirements of the act and this part. No exemption will extend to the civil liability provisions of sections 130, 131, and 185 of the act.</P>

Good faith compliance with this commentary affords protection from liability under section 130(f) of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1640(f)). Section 130(f) protects lessors from civil liability for any act done or omitted in good faith in conformity with any interpretation issued by a duly authorized official or employee of the Federal Reserve System.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Procedures for requesting interpretations.</E> Under appendix C of Regulation M, anyone may request an official staff interpretation. Interpretations that are adopted will be incorporated in this commentary following publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> No official staff interpretations are expected to be issued other than by means of this commentary.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Comment designations.</E> Each comment in the commentary is identified by a number and the regulatory section or paragraph that it interprets. The comments are designated with as much specificity as possible according to the particular regulatory provision addressed. For example, some of the comments to § 213.4(f) are further divided by subparagraph, such as comment 4(f)(1)-1 and comment 4(f)(2)-1. In other cases, comments have more general application and are designated, for example, as comment 4(a)-1. This introduction may be cited as comments I-1 through I-4. An appendix may be cited as comment app. A-1.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Illustrations.</E> Lists that appear in the commentary may be exhaustive or illustrative; the appropriate construction should be clear from the context. Illustrative lists are introduced by phrases such as “including,” “such as,” “to illustrate,” and “for example.”</P>

The regulation does not apply to a foreign branch of a U.S. bank or to a leasing company leasing to a U.S. citizen residing or visiting abroad or to a foreign national abroad.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2(b) Advertisement</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Coverage.</E> The term advertisement includes messages inviting, offering, or otherwise generally announcing to prospective customers the availability of consumer leases, whether in visual, oral, print or electronic media. Examples include:</P>
            <P>i. Messages in newspapers, magazines, leaflets, catalogs, and fliers.</P>
            <P>ii. Messages on radio, television, and public address systems.</P>
            <P>iii. Direct mail literature.</P>
            <P>iv. Printed material on any interior or exterior sign or display, in any window display, in any point-of-transaction literature or price tag that is delivered or made available to a lessee or prospective lessee in any manner whatsoever.</P>
            <P>v. Telephone solicitations.</P>
            <P>vi. On-line messages, such as those on the Internet.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Exclusions.</E> The term does not apply to the following:</P>
            <P>i. Direct personal contacts, including follow-up letters, cost estimates for individual lessees, or oral or written communications relating to the negotiation of a specific transaction.</P>
            <P>ii. Informational material distributed only to businesses.</P>
            <P>iii. Notices required by federal or state law, if the law mandates that specific information be displayed and only the mandated information is included in the notice.</P>
            <P>iv. News articles controlled by the news medium.</P>
            <P>v. Market research or educational materials that do not solicit business.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Persons covered.</E> See the commentary to § 213.7(a).</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2(d) Closed-End Lease</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">General.</E> In closed-end leases, sometimes referred to as “walk-away” leases, the lessee is not responsible for the residual value of the leased property at the end of the lease term.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2(e) Consumer lease</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Primary purposes.</E> A lessor must determine in each case if the leased property will be used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. If a question exists as to the primary purpose for a lease, the fact that a lessor gives disclosures is not controlling on the question of whether the transaction is covered. The primary purpose of a lease is determined before or at consummation and a lessor need not provide Regulation M disclosures where there is a subsequent change in the primary use.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Period of time.</E> To be a consumer lease, the initial term of the lease must be more than four months. Thus, a lease of personal property for four months, three months or on a month-to-month or week-to-week basis (even though the lease actually extends beyond four months) is not a consumer lease and is not subject to the disclosure requirements of the regulation. However, a lease that imposes a penalty for not continuing the lease beyond four months is considered to have a term of more than four months. To illustrate:<PRTPAGE P="371"/>
            </P>
            <P>i. A three-month lease extended on a month-to-month basis and terminated after one year is not subject to the regulation.</P>
            <P>ii. A month-to-month lease with a penalty, such as the forfeiture of a security deposit for terminating before one year, is subject to the regulation.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Total contractual obligation.</E> The total contractual obligation is not necessarily the same as the total of payments disclosed under § 213.4(e). The total contractual obligation includes nonrefundable amounts a lessee is contractually obligated to pay to the lessor, but excludes items such as:</P>
            <P>i. Residual value amounts or purchase-option prices;</P>
            <P>ii. Amounts collected by the lessor but paid to a third party, such as taxes, licenses, and registration fees.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Credit sale.</E> The regulation does not cover a lease that meets the definition of a credit sale in Regulation Z, 12 CFR 226.2(a)(16), which is defined, in part, as a bailment or lease (unless terminable without penalty at any time by the consumer) under which the consumer:</P>
            <P>i. Agrees to pay as compensation for use a sum substantially equivalent to, or in excess of, the total value of the property and services involved; and</P>
            <P>ii. Will become (or has the option to become), for no additional consideration or for nominal consideration, the owner of the property upon compliance with the agreement.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Agricultural purpose.</E> Agricultural purpose means a purpose related to the production, harvest, exhibition, marketing, transportation, processing, or manufacture of agricultural products by a natural person who cultivates, plants, propagates, or nurtures those agricultural products, including but not limited to the acquisition of personal property and services used primarily in farming. Agricultural products include horticultural, viticultural, and dairy products, livestock, wildlife, poultry, bees, forest products, fish and shellfish, and any products thereof, including processed and manufactured products, and any and all products raised or produced on farms and any processed or manufactured products thereof.</P>
            <P>6. <E T="03">Organization or other entity.</E> A consumer lease does not include a lease made to an organization such as a corporation or a government agency or instrumentality. Such a lease is not covered by the regulation even if the leased property is used (by an employee, for example) primarily for personal, family or household purposes, or is guaranteed by or subsequently assigned to a natural person.</P>
            <P>7. <E T="03">Leases of personal property incidental to a service.</E> The following leases of personal property are deemed incidental to a service and thus are not subject to the regulation:</P>
            <P>i. Home entertainment systems requiring the consumer to lease equipment that enables a television to receive the transmitted programming.</P>
            <P>ii. Security alarm systems requiring the installation of leased equipment intended to monitor unlawful entries into a home and in some cases to provide fire protection.</P>
            <P>iii. Propane gas service where the consumer must lease a propane tank to receive the service.</P>
            <P>8. <E T="03">Safe deposit boxes.</E> The lease of a safe deposit box is not a consumer lease under § 213.2(e).</P>
            <P>9. <E T="03">Threshold amount.</E> A consumer lease is exempt from the requirements of this part if the total contractual obligation exceeds the threshold amount in effect at the time of consummation. The threshold amount in effect during a particular time period is the amount stated in comment 2(e)-11 for that period. The threshold amount is adjusted effective January 1 of each year by any annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) that was in effect on the preceding June 1. Comment 2(e)-11 will be amended to provide the threshold amount for the upcoming year after the annual percentage change in the CPI-W that was in effect on June 1 becomes available. Any increase in the threshold amount will be rounded to the nearest $100 increment. For example, if the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W would result in a $950 increase in the threshold amount, the threshold amount will be increased by $1,000. However, if the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W would result in a $949 increase in the threshold amount, the threshold amount will be increased by $900. If a consumer lease is exempt from the requirements of this Part because the total contractual obligation exceeds the threshold amount in effect at the time of consummation, the lease remains exempt regardless of a subsequent increase in the threshold amount.</P>
            <P>10. <E T="03">No increase in the CPI-W.</E> If the CPI-W in effect on June 1 does not increase from the CPI-W in effect on June 1 of the previous year, the threshold amount effective the following January 1 through December 31 will not change from the previous year. When this occurs, for the years that follow, the threshold is calculated based on the annual percentage change in the CPI-W applied to the dollar amount that would have resulted, after rounding, if decreases and any subsequent increases in the CPI-W had been taken into account.</P>
            <P>i. <E T="03">Net increases.</E> If the resulting amount calculated, after rounding, is greater than the current threshold, then the threshold effective January 1 the following year will increase accordingly.</P>
            <P>ii. <E T="03">Net decreases.</E> If the resulting amount calculated, after rounding, is equal to or less than the current threshold, then the threshold effective January 1 the following year <PRTPAGE P="372"/>will not change, but future increases will be calculated based on the amount that would have resulted.</P>
            <P>11. <E T="03">Threshold.</E> For purposes of § 213.2(e)(1), the threshold amount in effect during a particular period is the amount stated below for that period.</P>
            <P>i. Prior to July 21, 2011, the threshold amount is $25,000.</P>
            <P>ii. From July 21, 2011 through December 31, 2011, the threshold amount is $50,000.</P>
            <P>iii. From January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012, the threshold amount is $51,800.</P>
            <P>iv. From January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2013, the threshold amount is $53,000.</P>
            <P>v. From January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014, the threshold amount is $53,500.</P>
            <P>vi. From January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015, the threshold amount is $54,600.</P>
            <P>vii. From January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016, the threshold amount is $54,600.</P>
            <P>viii. From January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017, the threshold amount is $54,600.</P>
            <P>ix. From January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018, the threshold amount is $55,800.</P>
            <P>x. From January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019, the threshold amount is $57,200.</P>

            <P>1. <E T="03">Guarantors.</E> Guarantors are not lessees for purposes of the regulation.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2(h) Lessor</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Arranger of a lease.</E> To “arrange” for the lease of personal property means to provide or offer to provide a lease that is or will be extended by another person under a business or other relationship pursuant to which the person arranging the lease (a) receives or will receive a fee, compensation, or other consideration for the service or (b) has knowledge of the lease terms and participates in the preparation of the contract documents required in connection with the lease. To illustrate:</P>
            <P>i. An automobile dealer who, pursuant to a business relationship, completes the necessary lease agreement before forwarding it for execution to the leasing company (to whom the obligation is payable on its face) is “arranging” for the lease.</P>
            <P>ii. An automobile dealer who, without receiving a fee for the service, refers a customer to a leasing company that will prepare all relevant contract documents is not “arranging” for the lease.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Consideration.</E> The term “other consideration” as used in comment 2(h)-1 refers to an actual payment corresponding to a fee or similar compensation and not to intangible benefits, such as the advantage of increased business, which may flow from the relationship between the parties.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Assignees.</E> An assignee may be a lessor for purposes of the regulation in circumstances where the assignee has substantial involvement in the lease transaction. See cf. <E T="03">Ford Motor Credit Co.</E> v. <E T="03">Cenance,</E> 452 U.S. 155 (1981) (held that an assignee was a creditor for purposes of the pre-1980 Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z because of its substantial involvement in the credit transaction).</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2(j) Organization</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Coverage.</E> The term “organization” includes joint ventures and persons operating under a business name.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2(l) Personal Property</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Coverage.</E> Whether property is personal property depends on state or other applicable law. For example, a mobile home or houseboat may be considered personal property in one state but real property in another.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2(m) Realized Value</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">General.</E> Realized value refers to either the retail or wholesale value of the leased property at early termination or at the end of the lease term. It is not a required disclosure. Realized value is relevant only to leases in which the lessee's liability at early termination or at the end of the lease term typically is based on the difference between the residual value (or the adjusted lease balance) of the leased property and its realized value.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Options.</E> Subject to the contract and to state or other applicable law, the lessor may calculate the realized value in determining the lessee's liability at the end of the lease term or at early termination in one of the three ways stated in § 213.2(m). If the lessor sells the property prior to making the determination about liability, the price received for the property (or the fair market value) is the realized value. If the lessor does not sell the property prior to making that determination, the highest offer or the fair market value is the realized value.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Determination of realized value.</E> Disposition charges are not subtracted in determining the realized value but amounts attributable to taxes may be subtracted.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Offers.</E> In determining the highest offer for disposition, the lessor may disregard offers that an offeror has withdrawn or is unable or unwilling to perform.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Lessor's appraisal.</E> See commentary to § 213.4(l).</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2(o) Security Interest and Security</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Disclosable interests.</E> For purposes of disclosure, a security interest is an interest taken by the lessor to secure performance of the lessee's obligation. For example, if a bank that is not a lessor makes a loan to a leasing company and takes assignments of consumer leases generated by that company <PRTPAGE P="373"/>to secure the loan, the bank's security interest in the lessor's receivables is not a security interest for purposes of this regulation.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">General coverage.</E> An interest the lessor may have in leased property must be disclosed only if it is considered a security interest under state or other applicable law. The term includes, but is not limited to, security interests under the Uniform Commercial Code; real property mortgages, deeds of trust, and other consensual or confessed liens whether or not recorded; mechanic's, materialman's, artisan's, and other similar liens; vendor's liens in both real and personal property; liens on property arising by operation of law; and any interest in a lease when used to secure payment or performance of an obligation.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Insurance exception.</E> The lessor's right to insurance proceeds or unearned insurance premiums is not a security interest for purposes of this regulation.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 213.3—General Disclosure Requirements</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">3(a) General Requirements</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Basis of disclosures.</E> Disclosures must reflect the terms of the legal obligation between the parties. For example:</P>
            <P>i. In a three-year lease with no penalty for termination after a one-year minimum term, disclosures are based on the full three-year term of the lease. The one-year minimum term is only relevant to the early termination provisions of §§ 213.4 (g)(1), (k) and (l).</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Clear and conspicuous standard.</E> The clear and conspicuous standard requires that disclosures be reasonably understandable. For example, the disclosures must be presented in a way that does not obscure the relationship of the terms to each other; appendix A of this part contains model forms that meet this standard. In addition, although no minimum typesize is required, the disclosures must be legible, whether typewritten, handwritten, or printed by computer.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Multipurpose disclosure forms.</E> A lessor may use a multipurpose disclosure form provided the lessor is able to designate the specific disclosures applicable to a given transaction, consistent with the requirement that disclosures be clearly and conspicuously provided.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Number of transactions.</E> Lessors have flexibility in handling lease transactions that may be viewed as multiple transactions. For example:</P>
            <P>i. When a lessor leases two items to the same lessee on the same day, the lessor may disclose the leases as either one or two lease transactions.</P>
            <P>ii. When a lessor sells insurance or other incidental services in connection with a lease, the lessor may disclose in one of two ways: as a single lease transaction (in which case Regulation M, not Regulation Z, disclosures are required) or as a lease transaction and a credit transaction.</P>
            <P>iii. When a lessor includes an outstanding lease or credit balance in a lease transaction, the lessor may disclose the outstanding balance as part of a single lease transaction (in which case Regulation M, not Regulation Z, disclosures are required) or as a lease transaction and a credit transaction.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">3(a)(1) Form of Disclosures</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Cross-references.</E> Lessors may include in the nonsegregated disclosures a cross-reference to items in the segregated disclosures rather than repeat those items. A lessor may include in the segregated disclosures numeric or alphabetic designations as cross-references to related information so long as such references do not obscure or detract from the segregated disclosures.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Identification of parties.</E> While disclosures must be made clearly and conspicuously, lessors are not required to use the word “lessor” and “lessee” to identify the parties to the lease transaction.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Lessor's address.</E> The lessor must be identified by name; an address (and telephone number) may be provided.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Multiple lessors and lessees.</E> In transactions involving multiple lessors and multiple lessees, a single lessor may make all the disclosures to a single lessee as long as the disclosure statement identifies all the lessors and lessees.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Lessee's signature.</E> The regulation does not require that the lessee sign the disclosure statement, whether disclosures are separately provided or are part of the lease contract. Nevertheless, to provide evidence that disclosures are given before a lessee becomes obligated on the lease transaction, the lessor may, for example, ask the lessee to sign the disclosure statement or an acknowledgement of receipt, may place disclosures that are included in the lease documents above the lessee's signature, or include instructions alerting a lessee to read the disclosures prior to signing the lease.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">3(a)(2) Segregation of Certain Disclosures</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Location.</E> The segregated disclosures referred to in § 213.3(a)(2) may be provided on a separate document and the other required disclosures may be provided in the lease contract, so long as all disclosures are given at the same time. Alternatively, all disclosures may be provided in a separate document or in the lease contract.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Additional information among segregated disclosures.</E> The disclosures required to be segregated may contain only the information required or permitted to be included among the segregated disclosures.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Substantially similar.</E> See commentary to appendix A of this part.<PRTPAGE P="374"/>
            </P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">3(a)(3) Timing of Disclosures</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Consummation.</E> When a contractual relationship is created between the lessor and the lessee is a matter to be determined under state or other applicable law.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">3(b) Additional Information; Nonsegregated Disclosures</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">State law disclosures.</E> A lessor may include in the nonsegregated disclosures any state law disclosures that are not inconsistent with the act and regulation under § 213.9 as long as, in accordance with the standard set forth in § 213.3(b) for additional information, the state law disclosures are not used or placed to mislead or confuse or detract from any disclosure required by the regulation.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">3(c) Multiple Lessors or Lessees</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Multiple lessors.</E> If a single lessor provides disclosures to a lessee on behalf of several lessors, all disclosures for the transaction must be given, even if the lessor making the disclosures would not otherwise have been obligated to make a particular disclosure.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">3(d) Use of Estimates</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">3(d)(1) Standard</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Time of estimated disclosure.</E> The lessor may, after making a reasonable effort to obtain information, use estimates to make disclosures if necessary information is unknown or unavailable at the time the disclosures are made.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Basis of estimates.</E> Estimates must be made on the basis of the best information reasonably available at the time disclosures are made. The “reasonably available” standard requires that the lessor, acting in good faith, exercise due diligence in obtaining information. The lessor may rely on the representations of other parties. For example, the lessor might look to the consumer to determine the purpose for which leased property will be used, to insurance companies for the cost of insurance, or to an automobile manufacturer or dealer for the date of delivery. See commentary to § 213.4(n) for estimating official fees and taxes.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Residual value of leased property at termination.</E> In an open-end lease where the lessee's liability at the end of the lease term is based on the residual value of the leased property as determined at consummation, the estimate of the residual value must be reasonable and based on the best information reasonably available to the lessor (see § 213.4(m)). A lessor should generally use an accepted trade publication listing estimated current or future market prices for the leased property unless other information or a reasonable belief based on its experience provides the better information. For example:</P>
            <P>i. An automobile lessor offering a three-year open-end lease assigns a wholesale value to the vehicle at the end of the lease term. The lessor may disclose as an estimate a wholesale value derived from a generally accepted trade publication listing current wholesale values.</P>
            <P>ii. Same facts as above, except that the lessor discloses an estimated value derived by adjusting the residual value quoted in the trade publication because, in its experience, the trade publication values either understate or overstate the prices actually received in local used-vehicle markets. The lessor may adjust estimated values quoted in trade publications if the lessor reasonably believes based on its experience that the values are understated or overstated.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Retail or wholesale value.</E> The lessor may choose either a retail or a wholesale value in estimating the value of leased property at termination of an open-end lease provided the choice is consistent with the lessor's general practice when determining the value of the property at the end of the lease term. The lessor should indicate whether the value disclosed is a retail or wholesale value.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Labelling estimates.</E> Generally, only the disclosure for which the exact information is unknown is labelled as an estimate. Nevertheless, when several disclosures are affected because of the unknown information, the lessor has the option of labelling as an estimate every affected disclosure or only the disclosure primarily affected.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">3(e) Effect of Subsequent Occurrence</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Subsequent occurrences.</E> Examples of subsequent occurrences include:</P>
            <P>i. An agreement between the lessee and lessor to change from a monthly to a weekly payment schedule.</P>
            <P>ii. An increase in official fees or taxes.</P>
            <P>iii. An increase in insurance premiums or coverage caused by a change in the law.</P>
            <P>iv. Late delivery of an automobile caused by a strike.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Redisclosure.</E> When a disclosure becomes inaccurate because of a subsequent occurrence, the lessor need not make new disclosures unless new disclosures are required under § 213.5.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Lessee's failure to perform.</E> The lessor does not violate the regulation if a previously given disclosure becomes inaccurate when a lessee fails to perform obligations under the contract and a lessor takes actions that are necessary and proper in such circumstances to protect its interest. For example, the addition of insurance or a security interest by the lessor because the lessee has not performed obligations contracted for in the lease is not a violation of the regulation.<PRTPAGE P="375"/>

            <P>1. <E T="03">Consummation.</E> See commentary to § 213.3(a)(3).</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Capitalized cost reduction.</E> A capitalized cost reduction is a payment in the nature of a downpayment on the leased property that reduces the amount to be capitalized over the term of the lease. This amount does not include any amounts included in a periodic payment paid at lease signing or delivery.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">“Negative” equity trade-in allowance.</E> If an amount owed on a prior lease or credit balance exceeds the agreed upon value of a trade-in, the difference is not reflected as a negative trade-in allowance under § 213.4(b). The lessor may disclose the trade-in allowance as zero or not applicable, or may leave a blank line.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Rebates.</E> Only rebates applied toward an amount due at lease signing or delivery are required to be disclosed under § 213.4(b).</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Balance sheet approach.</E> In motor-vehicle leases, the total for the column labeled “total amount due at lease signing or delivery” must equal the total for the column labeled “how the amount due at lease signing or delivery will be paid.”</P>
            <P>6. <E T="03">Amounts to be paid in cash.</E> The term cash is intended to include payments by check or other payment methods in addition to currency; however, a lessor may add a line item under the column “how the amount due at lease signing or delivery will be paid” for non-currency payments such as credit cards.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">4(c) Payment Schedule and Total Amount of Periodic Payments</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Periodic payments.</E> The phrase “number, amount, and due dates or periods of payments” requires the disclosure of all payments that are made at regular or irregular intervals and generally derived from rent, capitalized or amortized amounts such as depreciation, and other amounts that are collected by the lessor at the same interval(s), including, for example, taxes, maintenance, and insurance charges. Other periodic payments may, but need not, be disclosed under § 213.4(c).</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">4(d) Other charges</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Coverage.</E> Section 213.4(d) requires the disclosure of charges that are anticipated by the parties incident to the normal operation of the lease agreement. If a lessor is unsure whether a particular fee is an “other charge,” the lessor may disclose the fee as such without violating § 213.4(d) or the segregation rule under § 213.3(a)(2).</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Excluded charges.</E> This section does not require disclosure of charges that are imposed when the lessee terminates early, fails to abide by, or modifies the terms of the existing lease agreement, such as charges for:</P>
            <P>i. Late payment.</P>
            <P>ii. Default.</P>
            <P>iii. Early termination.</P>
            <P>iv. Deferral of payments.</P>
            <P>v. Extension of the lease.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Third-party fees and charges.</E> Third-party fees or charges collected by the lessor on behalf of third parties, such as taxes, are not disclosed under § 213.4(d).</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Relationship to other provisions.</E> The other charges mentioned in this paragraph are charges that are not required to be disclosed under some other provision of § 213.4. To illustrate:</P>
            <P>i. The price of a mechanical breakdown protection (MBP) contract is sometimes disclosed as an “other charge.” Nevertheless, the price of MBP is sometimes reflected in the periodic payment disclosure under § 213.4(c) or in states where MBP is regarded as insurance, the cost is be disclosed in accordance with § 213.4(o).</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Lessee's liabilities at the end of the lease term.</E> Liabilities that the lessor imposes upon the lessee at the end of the scheduled lease term and that must be disclosed under § 213.4(d) include disposition and “pick-up” charges.</P>
            <P>6. <E T="03">Optional “disposition” charges.</E> Disposition and similar charges that are anticipated by the parties as an incident to the normal operation of the lease agreement must be disclosed under § 213.4(d). If, under a lease agreement, a lessee may return leased property to various locations, and the lessor charges a disposition fee depending upon the location chosen, under § 213.4(d), the lessor must disclose the highest amount charged. In such circumstances, the lessor may also include a brief explanation of the fee structure in the segregated disclosure. For example, if no fee or a lower fee is imposed for returning a leased vehicle to the originating dealer as opposed to another location, that fact may be disclosed. By contrast, if the terms of the lease treat the return of the leased property to a location outside the lessor's service area as a default, the fee imposed is not disclosed as an “other charge,” although it may be required to be disclosed under § 213.4(q).</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">4(f)(1) Gross Capitalized Cost</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Agreed upon value of the vehicle.</E> The agreed upon value of a motor vehicle includes the amount of capitalized items such as charges for vehicle accessories and options, and delivery or destination charges. The lessor may also include taxes and fees for title, licenses, and registration that are capitalized. Charges for service or maintenance contracts, insurance products, guaranteed automobile protection, or an outstanding balance on a prior lease or credit transaction are not included in the agreed upon value.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Itemization of the gross capitalized cost.</E> The lessor may choose to provide the itemization of the gross capitalized cost only on request or may provide the itemization as a matter of course. In the latter case, the lessor need not provide a statement of the lessee's option to receive an itemization. The gross capitalized cost must be itemized by type and amount. The lessor may include in the itemization an identification of the items and amounts of some or all of the items contained in the agreed upon value of the vehicle. The itemization must be provided at the same time as the other disclosures required by § 213.4, but it may not be included among the segregated disclosures.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">4(f)(7) Total of Base Periodic Payment</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Accuracy of disclosure.</E> If the periodic payment calculation under § 213.4(f) has been calculated correctly, the amount disclosed under § 213.4(f)(7)—the total of base periodic payments—is correct for disclosure purposes even if that amount differs from the base periodic payment disclosed under § 213.4(f)(9) multiplied by the number of lease payments disclosed under § 213.4(f)(8), when the difference is due to rounding.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">4(f)(8) Lease Payment</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Lease Term.</E> The lease term may be disclosed among the segregated disclosures.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">4(g) Early Termination</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">4(g)(1) Conditions and Disclosure of Charges</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Reasonableness of charges.</E> See the commentary to § 213.4(q).</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Description of the method.</E> Section 213.4(g)(1) requires a full description of the method of determining an early termination charge. The lessor should attempt to provide consumers with clear and understandable descriptions of its early termination charges. Descriptions that are full, accurate, and not intended to be misleading will comply with § 213.4(g)(1), even if the descriptions are complex. In providing a full description of an early termination method, a lessor may use the name of a generally accepted method of computing the unamortized cost portion (also known as the “adjusted lease balance”) of its early termination charges. For example, a lessor may state that the “constant yield” method will be utilized in obtaining the adjusted lease balance, but must specify how that figure, and any other term or figure, is used in computing the total early termination charge imposed upon the consumer. Additionally, if a lessor refers to a named method in this manner, the lessor must provide a written explanation of that method if requested by the consumer. The lessor has the option of providing the explanation as a matter of course in the lease documents or on a separate document.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Timing of written explanation of a named method.</E> While a lessor may provide an address or telephone number for the consumer to request a written explanation of the named method used to calculate the adjusted leased balance, if at consummation a consumer requests such an explanation, the lessor must provide a written explanation at that time. If a consumer requests an explanation after consummation, the lessor must provide a written explanation within a reasonable time after the request is made.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Default.</E> When default is a condition for early termination of a lease, default charges must be disclosed under § 213.4(g)(1). See the commentary to § 213.4(q).</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Lessee's liability at early termination.</E> When the lessee is liable for the difference between the unamortized cost and the realized value at early termination, the method of determining the amount of the difference must be disclosed under § 213.4(g)(1).</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">4(h) Maintenance Responsibilities</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Standards for wear and use.</E> No disclosure is required if a lessor does not set standards or impose charges for wear and use (such as excess mileage).</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">4(i) Purchase Option</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Mandatory disclosure of no purchase option.</E> Generally the lessor need only make the specific required disclosures that apply to a transaction. In the case of a purchase option disclosure, however, a lessor must disclose affirmatively that the lessee has no option to purchase the leased property if the purchase option is inapplicable.<PRTPAGE P="377"/>
            </P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Existence of purchase option.</E> Whether a purchase option exists under the lease is determined by state or other applicable law. The lessee's right to submit a bid to purchase property at termination of the lease is not an option to purchase under § 213.4(i) if the lessor is not required to accept the lessee's bid and the lessee does not receive preferential treatment.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Purchase-option fee.</E> A purchase-option fee is disclosed under § 213.4(i), not § 213.4(d). The fee may be separately itemized or disclosed as part of the purchase-option price.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Official fees and taxes.</E> Official fees such as those for taxes, licenses, and registration charged in connection with the exercise of a purchase option may be disclosed under § 213.4(i) as part of the purchase-option price (with or without a reference to their inclusion in that price) or may be separately disclosed and itemized by category. Alternatively, a lessor may provide a statement indicating that the purchase-option price does not include fees for tags, taxes, and registration.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Purchase-option price.</E> Lessors must disclose the purchase-option price as a sum certain or as a sum certain to be determined at a future date by reference to a readily available independent source. The reference should provide sufficient information so that the lessee will be able to determine the actual price when the option becomes available. Statements of a purchase price as the “negotiated price” or the “fair market value” do not comply with the requirements of § 213.4(i).</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">4(j) Statement referencing nonsegregated disclosures</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Content.</E> A lessor may delete inapplicable items from the disclosure. For example, if a lease contract does not include a security interest, the reference to a security interest may be omitted.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">4(l) Right of appraisal</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Disclosure inapplicable.</E> The lessee does not have the right to an independent appraisal merely because the lessee is liable at the end of the lease term or at early termination for unreasonable wear or use. Thus, the disclosure under § 213.4(l) does not apply. For example:</P>
            <P>i. The automobile lessor might expect a lessee to return an undented car with four good tires at the end of the lease term. Even though it may hold the lessee liable for the difference between a dented car with bald tires and the value of a car in reasonably good repair, the disclosure under § 213.4(l) is not required.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Lessor's appraisal.</E> If the lessor obtains an appraisal of the leased property to determine its realized value, that appraisal does not suffice for purposes of section 183(c) of the act; the lessor must disclose the lessee's right to an independent appraisal under § 213.4(l).</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Retail or wholesale.</E> In providing the disclosures in § 213.4(l), a lessor must indicate whether the wholesale or retail appraisal value will be used.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Time restriction on appraisal.</E> The regulation does not specify a time period in which the lessee must exercise the appraisal right. The lessor may require a lessee to obtain the appraisal within a reasonable time after termination of the lease.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">4(m) Liability at end of Lease Term Based on Residual Value</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Open-end leases.</E> Section 213.4(m) applies only to open-end leases.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Lessor's payment of attorney's fees.</E> Section 183(a) of the act requires that the lessor pay the lessee's attorney's fees in all actions under § 213.4(m), whether successful or not.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">4(m)(1) Rent and other charges</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">General.</E> This disclosure is intended to represent the cost of financing an open-end lease based on charges and fees that the lessor requires the lessee to pay. Examples of disclosable charges, in addition to the rent charge, include acquisition, disposition, or assignment fees. Charges imposed by a third party whose services are not required by the lessor (such as official fees and voluntary insurance) are not included in the § 213.4(m)(1) disclosure.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">4(m)(2) Excess liability</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Coverage.</E> The disclosure limiting the lessee's liability for the value of the leased property does not apply in the case of early termination.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Leases with a minimum term.</E> If a lease has an alternative minimum term, the disclosures governing the liability limitation are not applicable for the minimum term.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Charges not subject to rebuttable presumption.</E> The limitation on liability applies only to liability at the end of the lease term that is based on the difference between the residual value of the leased property and its realized value. The regulation does not preclude a lessor from recovering other charges from the lessee at the end of the lease term. Examples of such charges include:</P>
            <P>i. Disposition charges.</P>
            <P>ii. Excess mileage charges.</P>
            <P>iii. Late payment and default charges.</P>

            <P>iv. In simple-interest accounting leases, amount by which the unamortized cost exceeds the residual value because the lessee has not made timely payments.<PRTPAGE P="378"/>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">4(n) Fees and taxes</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Treatment of certain taxes.</E> Taxes paid in connection with the lease are generally disclosed under § 213.4(n), but there are exceptions. To illustrate:</P>
            <P>i. Taxes paid by lease signing or delivery are disclosed under § 213.4(b) and § 213.4(n).</P>
            <P>ii. Taxes that are part of the scheduled payments are reflected in the disclosure under § 213.4(c), (f), and (n).</P>
            <P>iii. A tax payable by the lessor that is passed on to the consumer and is reflected in the lease documentation must be disclosed under § 213.4(n). A tax payable by the lessor and absorbed as a cost of doing business need not be disclosed.</P>
            <P>iv. Taxes charged in connection with the exercise of a purchase option are disclosed under § 213.4(i), not § 213.4(n).</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Estimates.</E> In disclosing the total amount of fees and taxes under § 213.4(n), lessors may need to base the disclosure on estimated tax rates or amounts and are afforded great flexibility in doing so. Where a rate is applied to the future value of leased property, lessors have flexibility in estimating that value, including, but not limited to, using the mathematical average of the agreed upon value and the residual value or published valuation guides; or a lessor could prepare estimates using the agreed upon value and disclose a reasonable estimate of the total fees and taxes. Lessors may include a statement that the actual total of fees and taxes may be higher or lower depending on the tax rates in effect or the value of the leased property at the time a fee or tax is assessed.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">4(o) Insurance</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Coverage.</E> If insurance is obtained through the lessor, information on the type and amount of insurance coverage (whether voluntary or required) as well as the cost, must be disclosed.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Lessor's insurance.</E> Insurance purchased by the lessor primarily for its own benefit, and absorbed as a business expense and not separately charged to the lessee, need not be disclosed under § 213.4(o) even if it provides an incidental benefit to the lessee.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Mechanical breakdown protection and other products.</E> Whether products purchased in conjunction with a lease, such as mechanical breakdown protection (MBP) or guaranteed automobile protection (GAP), should be treated as insurance is determined by state or other applicable law. In states that do not treat MBP or GAP as insurance, § 213.4(o) disclosures are not required. In such cases the lessor may, however, disclose this information in accordance with the additional information provision in § 213.3(b). For MBP insurance contracts not capped by a dollar amount, lessors may describe coverage by referring to a limitation by mileage or time period, for example, by indicating that the mechanical breakdown contract insures parts of the automobile for up to 100,000 miles.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">4(p) Warranties or Guarantees</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Brief identification.</E> The statement identifying warranties may be brief and need not describe or list all warranties applicable to specific parts such as for air conditioning, radio, or tires in an automobile. For example, manufacturer's warranties may be identified simply by a reference to the standard manufacturer's warranty. If a lessor provides a comprehensive list of warranties that may not all apply, to comply with § 213.4(p) the lessor must indicate which warranties apply or, alternatively, which warranties do not apply.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Warranty disclaimers.</E> Although a disclaimer of warranties is not required by the regulation, the lessor may give a disclaimer as additional information in accordance with § 213.3(b).</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">State law.</E> Whether an express warranty or guaranty exists is determined by state or other law.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">4(q) Penalties and Other Charges for Delinquency</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Collection costs.</E> The automatic imposition of collection costs or attorney fees upon default must be disclosed under § 213.4(q). Collection costs or attorney fees that are not imposed automatically, but are contingent upon expenditures in conjunction with a collection proceeding or upon the employment of an attorney to effect collection, need not be disclosed.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Charges for early termination.</E> When default is a condition for early termination of a lease, default charges must also be disclosed under § 213.4(g)(1). The § 213.4(q) and (g)(1) disclosures may, but need not, be combined. Examples of combined disclosures are provided in the model lease disclosure forms in appendix A.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Simple-interest leases.</E> In a simple-interest accounting lease, the additional rent charge that accrues on the lease balance when a periodic payment is made after the due date does not constitute a penalty or other charge for late payment. Similarly, continued accrual of the rent charge after termination of the lease because the lessee fails to return the leased property does not constitute a default charge. But in either case, if the additional charge accrues at a rate higher than the normal rent charge, the lessor must disclose the amount of or the method of determining the additional charge under § 213.4(q).</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Extension charges.</E> Extension charges that exceed the rent charge in a simple-interest accounting lease or that are added separately are disclosed under § 213.4(q).<PRTPAGE P="379"/>
            </P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Reasonableness of charges.</E> Pursuant to section 183(b) of the act, penalties or other charges for delinquency, default, or early termination may be specified in the lease but only in an amount that is reasonable in light of the anticipated or actual harm caused by the delinquency, default, or early termination, the difficulties of proof of loss, and the inconvenience or nonfeasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 213.5—Renegotiations, Extensions and Assumptions</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Coverage.</E> Section 213.5 applies only to existing leases that are covered by the regulation. It does not apply to the renegotiation or extension of leases with an initial term of four months or less, because such leases are not covered by the definition of consumer lease in.</P>
            <P>§ 213.2(e). Whether and when a lease is satisfied and replaced by a new lease is determined by state or other applicable law.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">5(a) Renegotiations</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Basis of disclosures.</E> Lessors have flexibility in making disclosures so long as they reflect the legal obligation under the renegotiated lease. For example, assume that a 24-month lease is replaced by a 36-month lease. The initial lease began on January 1, 1998, and was renegotiated and replaced on July 1, 1998, so that the new lease term ends on January 1, 2001.</P>
            <P>i. If the renegotiated lease covers the 36-month period beginning January 1, 1998, the new disclosures would reflect all payments made by the lessee on the initial lease and all payments on the renegotiated lease. In this example, since the renegotiated lease covers a 36-month period beginning January 1, 1998, the disclosures must reflect payments made since that date. On the model form, the “total of base periodic payments” disclosed under § 213.4(f)(7) should reflect periodic payments to be made over the entire 36-month term. Payments received since January 1, 1998, are added as a new line item disclosed as “total of payments received” and are subtracted from the “total of base periodic payments” in calculating a new item disclosed as the “total of base periodic payments remaining.” For example, if 6 monthly payments of $300 were received since January 1, 1998, the disclosure form should include a “total of base periodic payments” line from which $1,800 is subtracted to arrive at the “total of base periodic payments remaining.” The remainder of the disclosures would not change.</P>
            <P>ii. If the renegotiated lease covers only the remaining 30 months, from July 1, 1998, to January 1, 2001, the disclosures would reflect only the charges incurred in connection with the renegotiation and the payments for the remaining period.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">5(b) Extensions</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Time of extension disclosures.</E> If a consumer lease is extended for a specified term greater than six months, new disclosures are required at the time the extension is agreed upon. If the lease is extended on a month-to-month basis and the cumulative extensions exceed six months, new disclosures are required at the commencement of the seventh month and at the commencement of each seventh month thereafter for as long as the extensions continue. If a consumer lease is extended for terms of varying durations, one of which will exceed six months beyond the originally scheduled termination date of the lease, new disclosures are required at the commencement of the term that will exceed six months beyond the originally scheduled termination date.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Content of disclosures for month-to-month extensions.</E> The disclosures for a lease extended on a month-to-month basis for more than six months should reflect the month-to-month nature of the transaction.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Basis of disclosures.</E> The disclosures should be based on the extension period, including any upfront costs paid in connection with the extension. For example, assume that initially a lease ends on March 1, 1999. In January 1999, agreement is reached to extend the lease until October 1, 1999. The disclosure would include any extension fee paid in January and the periodic payments for the seven-month extension period beginning in March.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 213.7—Advertising</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">7(a) General Rule</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Persons covered.</E> All “persons” must comply with the advertising provisions in this section, not just those that meet the definition of a lessor in § 213.2(h). Thus, automobile dealers, merchants, and others who are not themselves lessors must comply with the advertising provisions of the regulation if they advertise consumer lease transactions. Pursuant to section 184(b) of the act, however, owners and personnel of the media in which an advertisement appears or through which it is disseminated are not subject to civil liability for violations under section 185(b) of the act.<PRTPAGE P="380"/>
            </P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">“Usually and customarily.”</E> Section 213.7(a) does not prohibit the advertising of a single item or the promotion of a new leasing program, but prohibits the advertising of terms that are not and will not be available. Thus, an advertisement may state terms that will be offered for only a limited period or terms that will become available at a future date.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Total contractual obligation of advertised lease.</E> Section 213.7 applies to advertisements for consumer leases, as defined in § 213.2(e). Under § 213.2(e), a consumer lease is exempt from the requirements of this Part if the total contractual obligation exceeds the threshold amount in effect at the time of consummation. See comment 2(e)-9. Accordingly, § 213.7 does not apply to an advertisement for a specific consumer lease if the total contractual obligation for that lease exceeds the threshold amount in effect when the advertisement is made. If a lessor promotes multiple consumer leases in a single advertisement, the entire advertisement must comply with § 213.7 unless all of the advertised leases are exempt under § 213.2(e). For example</P>
            <P>A. Assume that, in an advertisement, a lessor states that certain terms apply to a consumer lease for a specific automobile. The total contractual obligation of the advertised lease exceeds the threshold amount in effect when the advertisement is made. Although the advertisement does not refer to any other lease, some or all of the advertised terms for the exempt lease also apply to other leases offered by the lessor with total contractual obligations that do not exceed the applicable threshold amount. The advertisement is not required to comply with § 213.7 because it refers only to an exempt lease.</P>
            <P>B. Assume that, in an advertisement, a lessor states certain terms (such as the amount due at lease signing) that will apply to consumer leases for automobiles of a particular brand. However, the advertisement does not refer to a specific lease. The total contractual obligations of the leases for some of the automobiles will exceed the threshold amount in effect when the advertisement is made, but the total contractual obligations of the leases for other automobiles will not exceed the threshold. The entire advertisement must comply with § 213.7 because it refers to terms for consumer leases that are not exempt.</P>
            <P>C. Assume that, in a single advertisement, a lessor states that certain terms apply to consumer leases for two different automobiles. The total contractual obligation of the lease for the first automobile exceeds the threshold amount in effect when the advertisement is made, but the total contractual obligation of the lease for the second automobile does not exceed the threshold. The entire advertisement must comply with § 213.7 because it refers to a consumer lease that is not exempt.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">7(b) Clear and Conspicuous Standard</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Standard.</E> The disclosures in an advertisement in any media must be reasonably understandable. For example, very fine print in a television advertisement or detailed and very rapidly stated information in a radio advertisement does not meet the clear and conspicuous standard if consumers cannot see and read or hear, and cannot comprehend, the information required to be disclosed.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">7(b)(1) Amount due at Lease Signing or Delivery</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Itemization not required.</E> Only a total of amounts due at lease signing or delivery is required to be disclosed, not an itemization of its component parts. Such an itemization is provided in any transaction-specific disclosures provided under § 213.4.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Prominence rule.</E> Except for a periodic payment, oral or written references to components of the total due at lease signing or delivery (for example, a reference to a capitalized cost reduction, where permitted) may not be more prominent than the disclosure of the total amount due at lease signing or delivery.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">7(b)(2) Advertisement of a Lease Rate</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Location of statement.</E> The notice required to accompany a percentage rate stated in an advertisement must be placed in close proximity to the rate without any other intervening language or symbols. For example, a lessor may not place an asterisk next to the rate and place the notice elsewhere in the advertisement. In addition, with the exception of the notice required by § 213.4(s), the rate cannot be more prominent than any other § 213.4 disclosure stated in the advertisement.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">7(c) Catalogs or Other Multi-Page Advertisements; Electronic Advertisements</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">General rule.</E> The multiple-page advertisements referred to in § 213.7(c) are advertisements consisting of a series of numbered pages—for example, a supplement to a newspaper. A mailing comprising several separate flyers or pieces of promotional material in a single envelope is not a single multiple-page advertisement.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Cross references.</E> A catalog or other multiple-page advertisement or an electronic advertisement (such as an advertisement appearing on an Internet Web site) is a single advertisement (requiring only one set of lease disclosures) if it contains a table, chart, or schedule with the disclosures required under § 213.7(d)(2)(i) through (v). If one of the triggering terms listed in § 213.7(d)(1) appears in a catalog, or in a multiple-page or <PRTPAGE P="381"/>electronic advertisement, it must clearly direct the consumer to the page or location where the table, chart, or schedule begins. For example, in an electronic advertisement, a term triggering additional disclosures may be accompanied by a link that directly connects the consumer to the additional information.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">7(d)(1) Triggering Terms</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Typical example.</E> When any triggering term appears in a lease advertisement, the additional terms enumerated in § 213.7(d)(2) (i) through (v) must also appear. In a multi-lease advertisement, an example of one or more typical leases with a statement of all the terms applicable to each may be used. The examples must be labeled as such and must reflect representative lease terms that are made available by the lessor to consumers.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">7(d)(2) Additional Terms</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Third-party fees that vary by state or locality.</E> The disclosure of a periodic payment or total amount due at lease signing or delivery may:</P>
            <P>i. Exclude third-party fees, such as taxes, licenses, and registration fees and disclose that fact; or</P>
            <P>ii. Provide a periodic payment or total that includes third-party fees based on a particular state or locality as long as that fact and the fact that fees may vary by state or locality are disclosed.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">7(e) Alternative Disclosures—Merchandise Tags</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Multiple-item leases.</E> Multiple-item leases that utilize merchandise tags requiring additional disclosures may use the alternate disclosure rule.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">7(f) Alternative Disclosures—Television or Radio Advertisements</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">7(f)(1) Toll-Free Number or Print Advertisement</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Publication in general circulation.</E> A reference to a written advertisement appearing in a newspaper circulated nationally, for example, USA Today or the Wall Street Journal, may satisfy the general circulation requirement in § 213.7(f)(1)(ii).</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Toll-free number, local or collect calls.</E> In complying with the disclosure requirements of § 213.7(f)(1)(i), a lessor must provide a toll-free number for nonlocal calls made from an area code other than the one used in the lessor's dialing area. Alternatively, a lessor may provide any telephone number that allows a consumer to reverse the phone charges when calling for information.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Multi-purpose number.</E> When an advertised toll-free number responds with a recording, lease disclosures must be provided early in the sequence to ensure that the consumer receives the required disclosures. For example, in providing several dialing options—such as providing directions to the lessor's place of business—the option allowing the consumer to request lease disclosures should be provided early in the telephone message to ensure that the option to request disclosures is not obscured by other information.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Statement accompanying toll free number.</E> Language must accompany a telephone and television number indicating that disclosures are available by calling the toll-free number, such as “call 1-800-000-0000 for details about costs and terms.”</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 213.8—Record Retention</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Manner of retaining evidence.</E> A lessor must retain evidence of having performed required actions and of having made required disclosures. Such records may be retained in paper form, on microfilm, microfiche, or computer, or by any other method designed to reproduce records accurately. The lessor need retain only enough information to reconstruct the required disclosures or other records.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 213.9—Relation to State Laws</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Exemptions granted.</E> Effective October 1, 1982, the Board granted the following exemptions from portions of the Consumer Leasing Act:</P>
            <P>i. <E T="03">Maine.</E> Lease transactions subject to the Maine Consumer Credit Code and its implementing regulations are exempt from chapters 2, 4, and 5 of the federal act. (The exemption does not apply to transactions in which a federally chartered institution is a lessor.)</P>
            <P>ii. <E T="03">Oklahoma.</E> Lease transactions subject to the Oklahoma Consumer Credit Code are exempt from chapters 2 and 5 of the federal act. (The exemption does not apply to sections 132 through 135 of the federal act, nor does it apply to transactions in which a federally chartered institution is a lessor.)</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Appendix A—Model Forms</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Permissible changes.</E> Although use of the model forms is not required, lessors using them properly will be deemed to be in compliance with the regulation. Generally, lessors may make certain changes in the format or content of the forms and may delete any disclosures that are inapplicable to a transaction without losing the act's protection from liability. For example, the model form based on monthly periodic payments may be modified for single-payment lease transactions or for quarterly or other regular or irregular periodic payments. The model form may also be modified to reflect that a transaction is an extension. The content, format, and headings for the segregated disclosures must be substantially similar to <PRTPAGE P="382"/>those contained in the model forms; therefore, any changes should be minimal. The changes to the model forms should not be so extensive as to affect the substance and the clarity of the disclosures.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Examples of acceptable changes.</E>
            </P>
            <P>i. Using the first person, instead of the second person, in referring to the lessee.</P>
            <P>ii. Using “lessee,” “lessor,” or names instead of pronouns.</P>
            <P>iii. Rearranging the sequence of the nonsegregated disclosures.</P>
            <P>iv. Incorporating certain state “plain English” requirements.</P>
            <P>v. Deleting or blocking out inapplicable disclosures, filling in “N/A” (not applicable) or “0,” crossing out, leaving blanks, checking a box for applicable items, or circling applicable items (this should facilitate use of multipurpose standard forms).</P>
            <P>vi. Adding language or symbols to indicate estimates.</P>
            <P>vii. Adding numeric or alphabetic designations.</P>
            <P>viii. Rearranging the disclosures into vertical columns, except for § 213.4 (b) through (e) disclosures.</P>
            <P>ix. Using icons and other graphics.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Model closed-end or net vehicle lease disclosure.</E> Model A-2 is designed for a closed-end or net vehicle lease. Under the “Early Termination and Default” provision a reference to the lessee's right to an independent appraisal of the leased vehicle under § 213.4(l) is included for those closed-end leases in which the lessee's liability at early termination is based on the vehicle's realized value.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Model furniture lease disclosures.</E> Model A-3 is a closed-end lease disclosure statement designed for a typical furniture lease. It does not include a disclosure of the appraisal right at early termination required under § 213.4(l) because few closed-end furniture leases base the lessee's liability at early termination on the realized value of the leased property. The disclosure should be added if it is applicable.</P>

              <P>In order that the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System may perform its statutory duty of exercising special supervision over all relationships and transactions of any kind entered into by any Federal Reserve Bank with any foreign bank or banker or with any group of foreign banks or bankers or with any foreign State, each Federal Reserve Bank shall promptly submit to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in writing full information concerning all existing relationships and transactions of any kind heretofore entered into by such Federal Reserve Bank with any foreign bank or banker or with any group of foreign banks or bankers or with any foreign State and copies of all written agreements between it and any foreign bank or banker or any group of foreign banks or bankers or any foreign State which are now in force, unless copies have heretofore been furnished to the Board.

              <SUBJECT>Purpose, applicability, reservations of authority, and timing.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> This part establishes minimum capital requirements and overall capital adequacy standards for entities described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. This part includes methodologies for calculating minimum capital requirements, public disclosure requirements related to the capital requirements, and transition provisions for the application of this part.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Limitation of authority.</E> Nothing in this part shall be read to limit the authority of the Board to take action under other provisions of law, including action to address unsafe or unsound practices or conditions, deficient capital levels, or violations of law or regulation, under section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, section 8 of the Bank Holding Company Act, or section 10 of the Home Owners' Loan Act.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> (1) This part applies on a consolidated basis to every Board-regulated institution that is:</P>
              <P>(i) A state member bank;</P>

              <P>(ii) A bank holding company domiciled in the United States that is not <PRTPAGE P="397"/>subject to 12 CFR part 225, appendix C, provided that the Board may by order apply any or all of this part 217 to any bank holding company, based on the institution's size, level of complexity, risk profile, scope of operations, or financial condition; or</P>
              <P>(iii) A covered savings and loan holding company domiciled in the United States, other than a savings and loan holding company that meets the requirements of 12 CFR part 225, appendix C, as if the savings and loan holding company were a bank holding company and the savings association were a bank. For purposes of compliance with the capital adequacy requirements and calculations in this part, savings and loan holding companies that do not file the FR Y-9C should follow the instructions to the FR Y-9C.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Minimum capital requirements and overall capital adequacy standards.</E> Each Board-regulated institution must calculate its minimum capital requirements and meet the overall capital adequacy standards in subpart B of this part.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Regulatory capital.</E> Each Board-regulated institution must calculate its regulatory capital in accordance with subpart C of this part.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Risk-weighted assets.</E> (i) Each Board-regulated institution must use the methodologies in subpart D of this part (and subpart F of this part for a market risk Board-regulated institution) to calculate standardized total risk-weighted assets.</P>
              <P>(ii) Each advanced approaches Board-regulated institution must use the methodologies in subpart E (and subpart F of this part for a market risk Board-regulated institution) to calculate advanced approaches total risk-weighted assets.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Disclosures.</E> (i) Except for an advanced approaches Board-regulated institution that is making public disclosures pursuant to the requirements in subpart E of this part, each Board-regulated institution with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more must make the public disclosures described in subpart D of this part.</P>
              <P>(ii) Each market risk Board-regulated institution must make the public disclosures described in subpart F of this part.</P>
              <P>(iii) Each advanced approaches Board-regulated institution must make the public disclosures described in subpart E of this part.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Reservation of authority.</E> (1) <E T="03">Additional capital in the aggregate.</E> The Board may require a Board-regulated institution to hold an amount of regulatory capital greater than otherwise required under this part if the Board determines that the Board-regulated institution's capital requirements under this part are not commensurate with the Board-regulated institution's credit, market, operational, or other risks.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Regulatory capital elements.</E> (i) If the Board determines that a particular common equity tier 1, additional tier 1, or tier 2 capital element has characteristics or terms that diminish its ability to absorb losses, or otherwise present safety and soundness concerns, the Board may require the Board-regulated institution to exclude all or a portion of such element from common equity tier 1 capital, additional tier 1 capital, or tier 2 capital, as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(ii) Notwithstanding the criteria for regulatory capital instruments set forth in subpart C of this part, the Board may find that a capital element may be included in a Board-regulated institution's common equity tier 1 capital, additional tier 1 capital, or tier 2 capital on a permanent or temporary basis consistent with the loss absorption capacity of the element and in accordance with § 217.20(e).</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Risk-weighted asset amounts.</E> If the Board determines that the risk-weighted asset amount calculated under this part by the Board-regulated institution for one or more exposures is not commensurate with the risks associated with those exposures, the Board may require the Board-regulated institution to assign a different risk-weighted asset amount to the exposure(s) or to deduct the amount of the exposure(s) from its regulatory capital.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Total leverage.</E> If the Board determines that the total leverage exposure, or the amount reflected in the Board-regulated institution's reported average total consolidated assets, for an on- or off-balance sheet exposure calculated by a Board-regulated institution under § 217.10 is inappropriate for <PRTPAGE P="398"/>the exposure(s) or the circumstances of the Board-regulated institution, the Board may require the Board-regulated institution to adjust this exposure amount in the numerator and the denominator for purposes of the leverage ratio calculations.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Consolidation of certain exposures.</E> The Board may determine that the risk-based capital treatment for an exposure or the treatment provided to an entity that is not consolidated on the Board-regulated institution's balance sheet is not commensurate with the risk of the exposure and the relationship of the Board-regulated institution to the entity. Upon making this determination, the Board may require the Board-regulated institution to treat the exposure or entity as if it were consolidated on the balance sheet of the Board-regulated institution for purposes of determining the Board-regulated institution's risk-based capital requirements and calculating the Board-regulated institution's risk-based capital ratios accordingly. The Board will look to the substance of, and risk associated with, the transaction, as well as other relevant factors the Board deems appropriate in determining whether to require such treatment.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Other reservation of authority.</E> With respect to any deduction or limitation required under this part, the Board may require a different deduction or limitation, provided that such alternative deduction or limitation is commensurate with the Board-regulated institution's risk and consistent with safety and soundness.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Notice and response procedures.</E> In making a determination under this section, the Board will apply notice and response procedures in the same manner and to the same extent as the notice and response procedures in 12 CFR 263.202.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Timing.</E> (1) Subject to the transition provisions in subpart G of this part, an advanced approaches Board-regulated institution that is not a savings and loan holding company must:</P>
              <P>(i) Except as described in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section, beginning on January 1, 2014, calculate advanced approaches total risk-weighted assets in accordance with subpart E and, if applicable, subpart F of this part and, beginning on January 1, 2015, calculate standardized total risk-weighted assets in accordance with subpart D and, if applicable, subpart F of this part;</P>
              <P>(ii) From January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014:</P>
              <P>(A) Calculate risk-weighted assets in accordance with the general risk-based capital rules under 12 CFR parts 208 or 225, appendix A, and, if applicable, appendix E (state member banks or bank holding companies, respectively) <SU>1</SU>

              <P>(f) <E T="03">Failure of a QCCP to satisfy the rule's requirements.</E> If a Board-regulated institution determines that a CCP ceases to be a QCCP due to the failure of the CCP to satisfy one or more of the requirements set forth in paragraphs (2)(i) through (2)(iii) of the definition of a QCCP in § 217.2, the Board-regulated institution may continue to treat the CCP as a QCCP for up to three months following the determination. If the CCP fails to remedy the relevant deficiency within three months after the initial determination, or the CCP fails to satisfy the requirements set forth in paragraphs (2)(i) through (2)(iii) of the definition of a QCCP continuously for a three-month period after remedying the relevant deficiency, a Board-regulated institution <PRTPAGE P="421"/>may not treat the CCP as a QCCP for the purposes of this part until after the Board-regulated institution has determined that the CCP has satisfied the requirements in paragraphs (2)(i) through (2)(iii) of the definition of a QCCP for three continuous months.</P>

              <P>(B) The mean of the off-balance sheet exposures calculated as of the last day of each of the most recent three months, minus the applicable deductions under § 217.22(a), (c), and (d).</P>
              <P>(ii) For purposes of this part, <E T="03">total leverage exposure</E> means the sum of the items described in paragraphs (c)(4)(ii)(A) through (H) of this section, as adjusted pursuant to paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(I) for a clearing member Board-regulated institution:</P>

              <P>(A) The balance sheet carrying value of all of the Board-regulated institution's on-balance sheet assets, <E T="03">plus</E> the value of securities sold under a repurchase transaction or a securities lending transaction that qualifies for sales treatment under U.S. GAAP, <E T="03">less</E> amounts deducted from tier 1 capital under § 217.22(a), (c), and (d), and <E T="03">less</E> the value of securities received in security-for-security repo-style transactions, where the Board-regulated institution acts as a securities lender and includes the securities received in its on-balance sheet assets but has not sold or re-hypothecated the securities received;</P>
              <P>(B) The PFE for each derivative contract or each single-product netting set of derivative contracts (including a cleared transaction except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(I) of this section and, at the discretion of the Board-supervised institution, excluding a forward agreement treated as a derivative contract that is part of a repurchase or reverse repurchase or a securities borrowing or lending transaction that qualifies for sales treatment under U.S. GAAP), to which the Board-regulated institution is a counterparty as determined under § 217.34, but without regard to § 217.34(b), provided that:</P>
              <P>(1) A Board-regulated institution may choose to exclude the PFE of all credit derivatives or other similar instruments through which it provides credit protection when calculating the PFE under § 217.34, but without regard to § 217.34(b), provided that it does not adjust the net-to-gross ratio (NGR); and</P>

              <P>(2) A Board-regulated institution that chooses to exclude the PFE of credit derivatives or other similar instruments through which it provides credit protection pursuant to paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(B)(<E T="03">1</E>) of this section must do so consistently over time for the calculation of the PFE for all such instruments;</P>
              <P>(C) The amount of cash collateral that is received from a counterparty to a derivative contract and that has offset the mark-to-fair value of the derivative asset, or cash collateral that is posted to a counterparty to a derivative contract and that has reduced the Board-regulated institution's on-balance sheet assets, unless such cash collateral is all or part of variation margin that satisfies the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) For derivative contracts that are not cleared through a QCCP, the cash collateral received by the recipient counterparty is not segregated (by law, regulation or an agreement with the counterparty);</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Variation margin is calculated and transferred on a daily basis based on the mark-to-fair value of the derivative contract;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) The variation margin transferred under the derivative contract or the governing rules for a cleared transaction is the full amount that is necessary to fully extinguish the net current credit exposure to the counterparty of the derivative contracts, subject to the threshold and minimum transfer amounts applicable to the counterparty under the terms of the derivative contract or the governing rules for a cleared transaction;<PRTPAGE P="423"/>
              </P>
              <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) The variation margin is in the form of cash in the same currency as the currency of settlement set forth in the derivative contract, provided that for the purposes of this paragraph, currency of settlement means any currency for settlement specified in the governing qualifying master netting agreement and the credit support annex to the qualifying master netting agreement, or in the governing rules for a cleared transaction;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) The derivative contract and the variation margin are governed by a qualifying master netting agreement between the legal entities that are the counterparties to the derivative contract or by the governing rules for a cleared transaction, and the qualifying master netting agreement or the governing rules for a cleared transaction must explicitly stipulate that the counterparties agree to settle any payment obligations on a net basis, taking into account any variation margin received or provided under the contract if a credit event involving either counterparty occurs;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">6</E>) The variation margin is used to reduce the current credit exposure of the derivative contract, calculated as described in § 217.34(a), and not the PFE; and</P>
              <P>(7) For the purpose of the calculation of the NGR described in § 217.34(a)(2)(ii)(B), variation margin described in paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(C)(6) of this section may not reduce the net current credit exposure or the gross current credit exposure;</P>
              <P>(D) The effective notional principal amount (that is, the apparent or stated notional principal amount multiplied by any multiplier in the derivative contract) of a credit derivative, or other similar instrument, through which the Board-regulated institution provides credit protection, provided that:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The Board-regulated institution may reduce the effective notional principal amount of the credit derivative by the amount of any reduction in the mark-to-fair value of the credit derivative if the reduction is recognized in common equity tier 1 capital;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The Board-regulated institution may reduce the effective notional principal amount of the credit derivative by the effective notional principal amount of a purchased credit derivative or other similar instrument, provided that the remaining maturity of the purchased credit derivative is equal to or greater than the remaining maturity of the credit derivative through which the Board-regulated institution provides credit protection and that:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) With respect to a credit derivative that references a single exposure, the reference exposure of the purchased credit derivative is to the same legal entity and ranks <E T="03">pari passu</E> with, or is junior to, the reference exposure of the credit derivative through which the Board-regulated institution provides credit protection; or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) With respect to a credit derivative that references multiple exposures, the reference exposures of the purchased credit derivative are to the same legal entities and rank <E T="03">pari passu</E> with the reference exposures of the credit derivative through which the Board-regulated institution provides credit protection, and the level of seniority of the purchased credit derivative ranks <E T="03">pari passu</E> to the level of seniority of the credit derivative through which the Board-regulated institution provides credit protection;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">iii</E>) Where a Board-regulated institution has reduced the effective notional amount of a credit derivative through which the Board-regulated institution provides credit protection in accordance with paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(D)(<E T="03">1</E>) of this section, the Board-regulated institution must also reduce the effective notional principal amount of a purchased credit derivative used to offset the credit derivative through which the Board-regulated institution provides credit protection, by the amount of any increase in the mark-to-fair value of the purchased credit derivative that is recognized in common equity tier 1 capital; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">iv</E>) Where the Board-regulated institution purchases credit protection through a total return swap and records the net payments received on a credit derivative through which the Board-regulated institution provides credit protection in net income, but does not record offsetting deterioration in the mark-to-fair value of the credit derivative through which the Board-<PRTPAGE P="424"/>regulated institution provides credit protection in net income (either through reductions in fair value or by additions to reserves), the Board-regulated institution may not use the purchased credit protection to offset the effective notional principal amount of the related credit derivative through which the Board-regulated institution provides credit protection;</P>

              <P>(E) Where a Board-regulated institution acting as a principal has more than one repo-style transaction with the same counterparty and has offset the gross value of receivables due from a counterparty under reverse repurchase transactions by the gross value of payables under repurchase transactions due to the same counterparty, the gross value of receivables associated with the repo-style transactions <E T="03">less</E> any on-balance sheet receivables amount associated with these repo-style transactions included under paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, unless the following criteria are met:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The offsetting transactions have the same explicit final settlement date under their governing agreements;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The right to offset the amount owed to the counterparty with the amount owed by the counterparty is legally enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceeding; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Under the governing agreements, the counterparties intend to settle net, settle simultaneously, or settle according to a process that is the functional equivalent of net settlement, (that is, the cash flows of the transactions are equivalent, in effect, to a single net amount on the settlement date), where both transactions are settled through the same settlement system, the settlement arrangements are supported by cash or intraday credit facilities intended to ensure that settlement of both transactions will occur by the end of the business day, and the settlement of the underlying securities does not interfere with the net cash settlement;</P>
              <P>(F) The counterparty credit risk of a repo-style transaction, including where the Board-regulated institution acts as an agent for a repo-style transaction and indemnifies the customer with respect to the performance of the customer's counterparty in an amount limited to the difference between the fair value of the security or cash its customer has lent and the fair value of the collateral the borrower has provided, calculated as follows:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) If the transaction is not subject to a qualifying master netting agreement, the counterparty credit risk (E*) for transactions with a counterparty must be calculated on a transaction by transaction basis, such that each transaction <E T="03">i</E> is treated as its own netting set, in accordance with the following formula, where E<E T="52">i</E> is the fair value of the instruments, gold, or cash that the Board-regulated institution has lent, sold subject to repurchase, or provided as collateral to the counterparty, and C<E T="52">i</E> is the fair value of the instruments, gold, or cash that the Board-regulated institution has borrowed, purchased subject to resale, or received as collateral from the counterparty:
              </P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">E<E T="52">i</E>* = max {0, [E<E T="52">i</E>—C<E T="52">i</E>]}; and</FP>
              
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) If the transaction is subject to a qualifying master netting agreement, the counterparty credit risk (E*) must be calculated as the greater of zero and the total fair value of the instruments, gold, or cash that the Board-regulated institution has lent, sold subject to repurchase or provided as collateral to a counterparty for all transactions included in the qualifying master netting agreement (ΣE<E T="52">i</E>), <E T="03">less</E> the total fair value of the instruments, gold, or cash that the Board-regulated institution borrowed, purchased subject to resale or received as collateral from the counterparty for those transactions (ΣC<E T="52">i</E>), in accordance with the following formula:
              </P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">E* = max {0, [ΣE<E T="52">i</E>− ΣC<E T="52">i</E>]}</FP>
              

              <P>(G) If a Board-regulated institution acting as an agent for a repo-style transaction provides a guarantee to a customer of the security or cash its customer has lent or borrowed with respect to the performance of the customer's counterparty and the guarantee is not limited to the difference between the fair value of the security or cash its customer has lent and the fair value of the collateral the borrower has provided, the amount of the <PRTPAGE P="425"/>guarantee that is greater than the difference between the fair value of the security or cash its customer has lent and the value of the collateral the borrower has provided;</P>
              <P>(H) The credit equivalent amount of all off-balance sheet exposures of the Board-regulated institution, excluding repo-style transactions, repurchase or reverse repurchase or securities borrowing or lending transactions that qualify for sales treatment under U.S. GAAP, and derivative transactions, determined using the applicable credit conversation factor under § 217.33(b), provided, however, that the minimum credit conversion factor that may be assigned to an off-balance sheet exposure under this paragraph is 10 percent; and</P>
              <P>(I) For a Board-regulated institution that is a clearing member:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) A clearing member Board-regulated institution that guarantees the performance of a clearing member client with respect to a cleared transaction must treat its exposure to the clearing member client as a derivative contract for purposes of determining its total leverage exposure;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) A clearing member Board-regulated institution that guarantees the performance of a CCP with respect to a transaction cleared on behalf of a clearing member client must treat its exposure to the CCP as a derivative contract for purposes of determining its total leverage exposure;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) A clearing member Board-regulated institution that does not guarantee the performance of a CCP with respect to a transaction cleared on behalf of a clearing member client may exclude its exposure to the CCP for purposes of determining its total leverage exposure;</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Capital conservation buffer.</E> (1) <E T="03">Composition of the capital conservation buffer.</E> The capital conservation buffer is composed solely of common equity tier 1 capital.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Eligible retained income.</E> The eligible retained income of a Board-regulated institution is the Board-regulated institution's net income for the four calendar quarters preceding the current calendar quarter, based on the Board-regulated institution's quarterly Call Report, for a state member bank, or the FR Y-9C, for a bank holding company or savings and loan holding company, as applicable, net of any distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income. Net income, as reported in the Call Report or the FR Y-9C, as applicable, reflects discretionary bonus payments <PRTPAGE P="426"/>and certain distributions that are expense items (and their associated tax effects).</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Maximum payout ratio.</E> The maximum payout ratio is the percentage of eligible retained income that a Board-regulated institution can pay out in the form of distributions and discretionary bonus payments during the current calendar quarter. The maximum payout ratio is based on the Board-regulated institution's capital conservation buffer, calculated as of the last day of the previous calendar quarter, as set forth in Table 1 to § 217.11.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Maximum payout amount.</E> A Board-regulated institution's maximum payout amount for the current calendar quarter is equal to the Board-regulated institution's eligible retained income, multiplied by the applicable maximum payout ratio, as set forth in Table 1 to § 217.11.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Private sector credit exposure.</E> Private sector credit exposure means an exposure to a company or an individual that is not an exposure to a sovereign, the Bank for International Settlements, the European Central Bank, the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund, a MDB, a PSE, or a GSE.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Maximum leverage payout ratio.</E> The maximum leverage payout ratio is the percentage of eligible retained income that a global systemically important BHC can pay out in the form of distributions and discretionary bonus payments during the current calendar quarter. The maximum leverage payout ratio is based on the global systemically important BHC's leverage buffer, calculated as of the last day of the previous calendar quarter, as set forth in Table 2 of this section.</P>
              <P>(vi) <E T="03">Maximum leverage payout amount.</E> A global systemically important BHC's maximum leverage payout amount for the current calendar quarter is equal to the global systemically important BHC's eligible retained income, multiplied by the applicable maximum leverage payout ratio, as set forth in Table 2 of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Calculation of capital conservation buffer.</E> (i) A Board-regulated institution's capital conservation buffer is equal to the lowest of the following ratios, calculated as of the last day of the previous calendar quarter based on the Board-regulated institution's most recent Call Report, for a state member bank, or FR Y-9C, for a bank holding company or savings and loan holding company, as applicable:</P>
              <P>(A) The Board-regulated institution's common equity tier 1 capital ratio minus the Board-regulated institution's minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio requirement under § 217.10;</P>
              <P>(B) The Board-regulated institution's tier 1 capital ratio minus the Board-regulated institution's minimum tier 1 capital ratio requirement under § 217.10; and</P>
              <P>(C) The Board-regulated institution's total capital ratio minus the Board-regulated institution's minimum total capital ratio requirement under § 217.10; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(3)(i)(A)-(C) of this section, if the Board-regulated institution's common equity tier 1, tier 1 or total capital ratio is less than or equal to the Board-regulated institution's minimum common equity tier 1, tier 1 or total capital ratio requirement under § 217.10, respectively, the Board-regulated institution's capital conservation buffer is zero.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Limits on distributions and discretionary bonus payments.</E> (i) A Board-regulated institution shall not make distributions or discretionary bonus payments or create an obligation to make such distributions or payments during the current calendar quarter that, in the aggregate, exceed the maximum payout amount or, as applicable, the maximum leverage payout amount.</P>
              <P>(ii) A Board-regulated institution with a capital conservation buffer that is greater than 2.5 percent plus 100 percent of its applicable countercyclical capital buffer in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, and 100 percent of its applicable GSIB surcharge, in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, and, if applicable, that has a leverage buffer that is greater than 2.0 percent, in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, is not subject to a maximum payout amount under this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Negative eligible retained income.</E> Except as provided in paragraph <PRTPAGE P="427"/>(a)(4)(iv) of this section, a Board-regulated institution may not make distributions or discretionary bonus payments during the current calendar quarter if the Board-regulated institution's:</P>
              <P>(A) Eligible retained income is negative; and</P>
              <P>(B) Capital conservation buffer was less than 2.5 percent, or, if applicable, leverage buffer was less than 2.0 percent, as of the end of the previous calendar quarter.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Prior approval.</E> Notwithstanding the limitations in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section, the Board may permit a Board-regulated institution to make a distribution or discretionary bonus payment upon a request of the Board-regulated institution, if the Board determines that the distribution or discretionary bonus payment would not be contrary to the purposes of this section, or to the safety and soundness of the Board-regulated institution. In making such a determination, the Board will consider the nature and extent of the request and the particular circumstances giving rise to the request.</P>

              <P>(i) <E T="03">Extension of capital conservation buffer.</E> The countercyclical capital buffer amount is an extension of the capital conservation buffer as described in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Amount.</E> An advanced approaches Board-regulated institution has a countercyclical capital buffer amount determined by calculating the weighted average of the countercyclical capital buffer amounts established for the national jurisdictions where the Board-regulated institution's private sector <PRTPAGE P="428"/>credit exposures are located, as specified in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Weighting.</E> The weight assigned to a jurisdiction's countercyclical capital buffer amount is calculated by dividing the total risk-weighted assets for the Board-regulated institution's private sector credit exposures located in the jurisdiction by the total risk-weighted assets for all of the Board-regulated institution's private sector credit exposures. The methodology a Board-regulated institution uses for determining risk-weighted assets for purposes of this paragraph (b) must be the methodology that determines its risk-based capital ratios under § 217.10. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the risk-weighted asset amount for a private sector credit exposure that is a covered position under subpart F of this part is its specific risk add-on as determined under § 217.210 multiplied by 12.5.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Location.</E> (A) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(1)(iv)(B) and (b)(1)(iv)(C) of this section, the location of a private sector credit exposure is the national jurisdiction where the borrower is located (that is, where it is incorporated, chartered, or similarly established or, if the borrower is an individual, where the borrower resides).</P>
              <P>(B) If, in accordance with subparts D or E of this part, the Board-regulated institution has assigned to a private sector credit exposure a risk weight associated with a protection provider on a guarantee or credit derivative, the location of the exposure is the national jurisdiction where the protection provider is located.</P>
              <P>(C) The location of a securitization exposure is the location of the underlying exposures, or, if the underlying exposures are located in more than one national jurisdiction, the national jurisdiction where the underlying exposures with the largest aggregate unpaid principal balance are located. For purposes of this paragraph (b), the location of an underlying exposure shall be the location of the borrower, determined consistent with paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(A) of this section.</P>

              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Adjustment determination.</E> The Board will base its decision to adjust the countercyclical capital buffer amount under this section on a range of macroeconomic, financial, and supervisory information indicating an increase in systemic risk including, but not limited to, the ratio of credit to gross domestic product, a variety of asset prices, other factors indicative of relative credit and liquidity expansion or contraction, funding spreads, credit condition surveys, indices based on credit default swap spreads, options implied volatility, and measures of systemic risk.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Effective date of adjusted countercyclical capital buffer amount.</E> (A) <E T="03">Increase adjustment.</E> A determination by the Board under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section to increase the countercyclical capital buffer amount will be effective 12 months from the date of announcement, unless the Board establishes an earlier effective date and includes a statement articulating the reasons for the earlier effective date.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Decrease adjustment.</E> A determination by the Board to decrease the established countercyclical capital buffer amount under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section will be effective on the day following announcement of the final determination or the earliest date permissible under applicable law or regulation, whichever is later.</P>
              <P>(vi) <E T="03">Twelve month sunset.</E> The countercyclical capital buffer amount will return to zero percent 12 months after <PRTPAGE P="429"/>the effective date that the adjusted countercyclical capital buffer amount is announced, unless the Board announces a decision to maintain the adjusted countercyclical capital buffer amount or adjust it again before the expiration of the 12-month period.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Countercyclical capital buffer amount for foreign jurisdictions.</E> The Board will adjust the countercyclical capital buffer amount for private sector credit exposures to reflect decisions made by foreign jurisdictions consistent with due process requirements described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>

              <P>(1) Any common stock instruments (plus any related surplus) issued by the Board-regulated institution, net of treasury stock, and any capital instruments issued by mutual banking organizations, that meet all the following criteria:<PRTPAGE P="430"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) The instrument is paid-in, issued directly by the Board-regulated institution, and represents the most subordinated claim in a receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceeding of the Board-regulated institution;</P>
              <P>(ii) The holder of the instrument is entitled to a claim on the residual assets of the Board-regulated institution that is proportional with the holder's share of the Board-regulated institution's issued capital after all senior claims have been satisfied in a receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceeding;</P>
              <P>(iii) The instrument has no maturity date, can only be redeemed via discretionary repurchases with the prior approval of the Board, and does not contain any term or feature that creates an incentive to redeem;</P>
              <P>(iv) The Board-regulated institution did not create at issuance of the instrument through any action or communication an expectation that it will buy back, cancel, or redeem the instrument, and the instrument does not include any term or feature that might give rise to such an expectation;</P>
              <P>(v) Any cash dividend payments on the instrument are paid out of the Board-regulated institution's net income, retained earnings, or surplus related to common stock, and are not subject to a limit imposed by the contractual terms governing the instrument. State member banks are subject to other legal restrictions on reductions in capital resulting from cash dividends, including out of the capital surplus account, under 12 U.S.C. 324 and 12 CFR 208.5.</P>
              <P>(vi) The Board-regulated institution has full discretion at all times to refrain from paying any dividends and making any other distributions on the instrument without triggering an event of default, a requirement to make a payment-in-kind, or an imposition of any other restrictions on the Board-regulated institution;</P>
              <P>(vii) Dividend payments and any other distributions on the instrument may be paid only after all legal and contractual obligations of the Board-regulated institution have been satisfied, including payments due on more senior claims;</P>
              <P>(viii) The holders of the instrument bear losses as they occur equally, proportionately, and simultaneously with the holders of all other common stock instruments before any losses are borne by holders of claims on the Board-regulated institution with greater priority in a receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceeding;</P>

                <P>(i) The reference exposure ranks <E T="03">pari passu</E> with, or is subordinated to, the hedged exposure; and</P>

                <P>(ii) The reference exposure and the hedged exposure are to the same legal entity, and legally enforceable cross-default or cross-acceleration clauses are in place to ensure payments under the credit derivative are triggered when the obligated party of the hedged <PRTPAGE P="457"/>exposure fails to pay under the terms of the hedged exposure.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Substitution approach</E>—(1) <E T="03">Full coverage.</E> If an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative meets the conditions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and the protection amount (P) of the guarantee or credit derivative is greater than or equal to the exposure amount of the hedged exposure, a Board-regulated institution may recognize the guarantee or credit derivative in determining the risk-weighted asset amount for the hedged exposure by substituting the risk weight applicable to the guarantor or credit derivative protection provider under § 217.32 for the risk weight assigned to the exposure.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Partial coverage.</E> If an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative meets the conditions in §§ 217.36(a) and 217.37(b) and the protection amount (P) of the guarantee or credit derivative is less than the exposure amount of the hedged exposure, the Board-regulated institution must treat the hedged exposure as two separate exposures (protected and unprotected) in order to recognize the credit risk mitigation benefit of the guarantee or credit derivative.</P>
                <P>(i) The Board-regulated institution may calculate the risk-weighted asset amount for the protected exposure under § 217.32, where the applicable risk weight is the risk weight applicable to the guarantor or credit derivative protection provider.</P>
                <P>(ii) The Board-regulated institution must calculate the risk-weighted asset amount for the unprotected exposure under § 217.32, where the applicable risk weight is that of the unprotected portion of the hedged exposure.</P>
                <P>(iii) The treatment provided in this section is applicable when the credit risk of an exposure is covered on a partial pro rata basis and may be applicable when an adjustment is made to the effective notional amount of the guarantee or credit derivative under paragraphs (d), (e), or (f) of this section.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Maturity mismatch adjustment.</E> (1) A Board-regulated institution that recognizes an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative in determining the risk-weighted asset amount for a hedged exposure must adjust the effective notional amount of the credit risk mitigant to reflect any maturity mismatch between the hedged exposure and the credit risk mitigant.</P>
                <P>(2) A maturity mismatch occurs when the residual maturity of a credit risk mitigant is less than that of the hedged exposure(s).</P>
                <P>(3) The residual maturity of a hedged exposure is the longest possible remaining time before the obligated party of the hedged exposure is scheduled to fulfil its obligation on the hedged exposure. If a credit risk mitigant has embedded options that may reduce its term, the Board-regulated institution (protection purchaser) must use the shortest possible residual maturity for the credit risk mitigant. If a call is at the discretion of the protection provider, the residual maturity of the credit risk mitigant is at the first call date. If the call is at the discretion of the Board-regulated institution (protection purchaser), but the terms of the arrangement at origination of the credit risk mitigant contain a positive incentive for the Board-regulated institution to call the transaction before contractual maturity, the remaining time to the first call date is the residual maturity of the credit risk mitigant.</P>
                <P>(4) A credit risk mitigant with a maturity mismatch may be recognized only if its original maturity is greater than or equal to one year and its residual maturity is greater than three months.</P>
                <P>(5) When a maturity mismatch exists, the Board-regulated institution must apply the following adjustment to reduce the effective notional amount of the credit risk mitigant: Pm = E × (t−0.25)/(T−0.25), where:</P>
                <P>(i) Pm = effective notional amount of the credit risk mitigant, adjusted for maturity mismatch;</P>

                <P>(A) The collateral must be subject to a collateral agreement for at least the life of the exposure;</P>

                <P>(B) The collateral must be revalued at least every six months; and<PRTPAGE P="459"/>

For repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, and securities lending and borrowing transactions, the collateral is the instruments, gold, and cash the Board-regulated institution has borrowed, purchased subject to resale, or taken as collateral from the counterparty under the transaction. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the risk weight assigned to the collateralized portion of the exposure may not be less than 20 percent.</P>
                <P>(ii) A Board-regulated institution must apply a risk weight to the unsecured portion of the exposure based on the risk weight applicable to the exposure under this subpart.</P>

                <P>(ii) A Board-regulated institution may assign a 10 percent risk weight to an exposure to an OTC derivative contract that is marked-to-market daily and subject to a daily margin maintenance requirement, to the extent that the contract is collateralized by an exposure to a sovereign that qualifies for a zero percent risk weight under § 217.32.</P>
                <P>(iii) A Board-regulated institution may assign a zero percent risk weight to the collateralized portion of an exposure where:</P>

                <P>(B) The financial collateral is an exposure to a sovereign that qualifies for a zero percent risk weight under § 217.32, and the Board-regulated institution has discounted the fair value of the collateral by 20 percent.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Collateral haircut approach</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> A Board-regulated institution may recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of financial collateral that secures an eligible margin loan, repo-style transaction, collateralized derivative contract, or single-product netting set of such transactions, and of any collateral that secures a repo-style transaction that is included in the Board-regulated institution's VaR-based measure under subpart F of this part by using the collateral haircut approach in this section. A Board-regulated institution may use the standard supervisory haircuts in paragraph (c)(3) of this section or, with prior written approval of the Board, its own estimates of haircuts according to paragraph (c)(4) of this section.</P>

                <P>(B) For collateralized derivative contracts and netting sets thereof, ΣE equals the exposure amount of the OTC derivative contract (or netting set) calculated under § 217.34 (a)(1) or (2).</P>
                <P>(ii) ΣC equals the value of the collateral (the sum of the current fair values of all instruments, gold and cash the Board-regulated institution has borrowed, purchased subject to resale, or taken as collateral from the counterparty under the transaction (or netting set));</P>

                <P>(iv) Hs equals the market price volatility haircut appropriate to the instrument or gold referenced in Es;</P>
                <P>(v) Efx equals the absolute value of the net position of instruments and cash in a currency that is different from the settlement currency (where the net position in a given currency equals the sum of the current fair values of any instruments or cash in the currency the Board-regulated institution has lent, sold subject to repurchase, or posted as collateral to the counterparty minus the sum of the current fair values of any instruments or cash in the currency the Board-regulated institution has borrowed, purchased subject to resale, or taken as collateral from the counterparty); and</P>
                <P>(vi) Hfx equals the haircut appropriate to the mismatch between the currency referenced in Efx and the settlement currency.</P>

                <P>(G) A Board-regulated institution must update its data sets and calculate haircuts no less frequently than quarterly and must also reassess data sets and haircuts whenever market prices change materially.</P>
                <P>(ii) With respect to debt securities that are investment grade, a Board-regulated institution may calculate haircuts for categories of securities. For a category of securities, the Board-regulated institution must calculate the haircut on the basis of internal volatility estimates for securities in that category that are representative of the securities in that category that the Board-regulated institution has lent, sold subject to repurchase, posted as collateral, borrowed, purchased subject to resale, or taken as collateral. In determining relevant categories, the Board-regulated institution must at a minimum take into account:</P>

                <P>(iv) Where an exposure or collateral (whether in the form of cash or securities) is denominated in a currency that differs from the settlement currency, the Board-regulated institution must calculate a separate currency mismatch haircut for its net position in each mismatched currency based on estimated volatilities of foreign exchange rates between the mismatched currency and the settlement currency.</P>
                <P>(v) A Board-regulated institution's own estimates of market price and foreign exchange rate volatilities may not take into account the correlations among securities and foreign exchange rates on either the exposure or collateral side of a transaction (or netting set) or the correlations among securities and foreign exchange rates between the exposure and collateral sides of the transaction (or netting set).</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For purposes of this section:</P>
                <P>(1) Delivery-versus-payment (DvP) transaction means a securities or commodities transaction in which the buyer is obligated to make payment only if the seller has made delivery of the securities or commodities and the seller is obligated to deliver the securities or commodities only if the buyer has made payment.</P>

                <P>(2) Payment-versus-payment (PvP) transaction means a foreign exchange transaction in which each counterparty is obligated to make a final transfer of one or more currencies only if the other counterparty has made a final transfer of one or more currencies.<PRTPAGE P="463"/>
                </P>
                <P>(3) A transaction has a normal settlement period if the contractual settlement period for the transaction is equal to or less than the market standard for the instrument underlying the transaction and equal to or less than five business days.</P>
                <P>(4) Positive current exposure of a Board-regulated institution for a transaction is the difference between the transaction value at the agreed settlement price and the current market price of the transaction, if the difference results in a credit exposure of the Board-regulated institution to the counterparty.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Scope.</E> This section applies to all transactions involving securities, foreign exchange instruments, and commodities that have a risk of delayed settlement or delivery. This section does not apply to:</P>
                <P>(1) Cleared transactions that are marked-to-market daily and subject to daily receipt and payment of variation margin;</P>
                <P>(2) Repo-style transactions, including unsettled repo-style transactions;</P>
                <P>(3) One-way cash payments on OTC derivative contracts; or</P>
                <P>(4) Transactions with a contractual settlement period that is longer than the normal settlement period (which are treated as OTC derivative contracts as provided in § 217.34).</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">System-wide failures.</E> In the case of a system-wide failure of a settlement, clearing system or central counterparty, the Board may waive risk-based capital requirements for unsettled and failed transactions until the situation is rectified.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Delivery-versus-payment (DvP) and payment-versus-payment (PvP) transactions.</E> A Board-regulated institution must hold risk-based capital against any DvP or PvP transaction with a normal settlement period if the Board-regulated institution's counterparty has not made delivery or payment within five business days after the settlement date. The Board-regulated institution must determine its risk-weighted asset amount for such a transaction by multiplying the positive current exposure of the transaction for the Board-regulated institution by the appropriate risk weight in Table 1 to § 217.38.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Operational criteria for traditional securitizations.</E> A Board-regulated institution that transfers exposures it has originated or purchased to a securitization SPE or other third party in connection with a traditional securitization may exclude the exposures from the calculation of its risk-weighted assets only if each condition in this section is satisfied. A Board-regulated institution that meets these conditions must hold risk-based capital against any credit risk it retains in connection with the securitization. A Board-regulated institution that fails to meet these conditions must hold risk-based capital against the transferred exposures as if they had not been securitized and must deduct from common equity tier 1 capital any after-tax gain-on-sale resulting from the transaction. The conditions are:</P>
                <P>(1) The exposures are not reported on the Board-regulated institution's consolidated balance sheet under GAAP;</P>
                <P>(2) The Board-regulated institution has transferred to one or more third parties credit risk associated with the underlying exposures;</P>
                <P>(3) Any clean-up calls relating to the securitization are eligible clean-up calls; and</P>
                <P>(4) The securitization does not:</P>
                <P>(i) Include one or more underlying exposures in which the borrower is permitted to vary the drawn amount within an agreed limit under a line of credit; and</P>
                <P>(ii) Contain an early amortization provision.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Operational criteria for synthetic securitizations.</E> For synthetic securitizations, a Board-regulated institution may recognize for risk-based capital purposes the use of a credit risk mitigant to hedge underlying exposures only if each condition in this paragraph (b) is satisfied. A Board-regulated institution that meets these conditions must hold risk-based capital against any credit risk of the exposures it retains in connection with the synthetic securitization. A Board-regulated institution that fails to meet these conditions or chooses not to recognize the credit risk mitigant for purposes of this section must instead hold risk-based capital against the underlying exposures as if they had not been synthetically securitized. The conditions are:</P>
                <P>(1) The credit risk mitigant is:</P>
                <P>(i) Financial collateral;</P>
                <P>(ii) A guarantee that meets all criteria as set forth in the definition of “eligible guarantee” in § 217.2, except for the criteria in paragraph (3) of that definition; or</P>
                <P>(iii) A credit derivative that meets all criteria as set forth in the definition of “eligible credit derivative” in § 217.2, except for the criteria in paragraph (3) of the definition of “eligible guarantee” in § 217.2.</P>
                <P>(2) The Board-regulated institution transfers credit risk associated with the underlying exposures to one or more third parties, and the terms and conditions in the credit risk mitigants employed do not include provisions that:</P>
                <P>(i) Allow for the termination of the credit protection due to deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying exposures;</P>
                <P>(ii) Require the Board-regulated institution to alter or replace the underlying exposures to improve the credit quality of the underlying exposures;</P>
                <P>(iii) Increase the Board-regulated institution's cost of credit protection in response to deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying exposures;</P>
                <P>(iv) Increase the yield payable to parties other than the Board-regulated institution in response to a deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying exposures; or</P>
                <P>(v) Provide for increases in a retained first loss position or credit enhancement provided by the Board-regulated institution after the inception of the securitization;</P>
                <P>(3) The Board-regulated institution obtains a well-reasoned opinion from legal counsel that confirms the enforceability of the credit risk mitigant in all relevant jurisdictions; and</P>

                <P>(4) Any clean-up calls relating to the securitization are eligible clean-up calls.<PRTPAGE P="465"/>

                <P>(c) <E T="03">Due diligence requirements for securitization exposures.</E> (1) Except for exposures that are deducted from common equity tier 1 capital and exposures subject to § 217.42(h), if a Board-regulated institution is unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Board a comprehensive understanding of the features of a securitization exposure that would materially affect the performance of the exposure, the Board-regulated institution must assign the securitization exposure a risk weight of 1,250 percent. The Board-regulated institution's analysis must be commensurate with the complexity of the securitization exposure and the materiality of the exposure in relation to its capital.</P>
                <P>(2) A Board-regulated institution must demonstrate its comprehensive understanding of a securitization exposure under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, for each securitization exposure by:</P>
                <P>(i) Conducting an analysis of the risk characteristics of a securitization exposure prior to acquiring the exposure, and documenting such analysis within three business days after acquiring the exposure, considering:</P>
                <P>(A) Structural features of the securitization that would materially impact the performance of the exposure, for example, the contractual cash flow waterfall, waterfall-related triggers, credit enhancements, liquidity enhancements, fair value triggers, the performance of organizations that service the exposure, and deal-specific definitions of default;</P>
                <P>(B) Relevant information regarding the performance of the underlying credit exposure(s), for example, the percentage of loans 30, 60, and 90 days past due; default rates; prepayment rates; loans in foreclosure; property types; occupancy; average credit score or other measures of creditworthiness; average LTV ratio; and industry and geographic diversification data on the underlying exposure(s);</P>
                <P>(C) Relevant market data of the securitization, for example, bid-ask spread, most recent sales price and historic price volatility, trading volume, implied market rating, and size, depth and concentration level of the market for the securitization; and</P>
                <P>(D) For resecuritization exposures, performance information on the underlying securitization exposures, for example, the issuer name and credit quality, and the characteristics and performance of the exposures underlying the securitization exposures; and</P>
                <P>(ii) On an on-going basis (no less frequently than quarterly), evaluating, reviewing, and updating as appropriate the analysis required under paragraph (c)(1) of this section for each securitization exposure.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Securitization risk weight approaches.</E> Except as provided elsewhere in this section or in § 217.41:</P>
                <P>(1) A Board-regulated institution must deduct from common equity tier 1 capital any after-tax gain-on-sale resulting from a securitization and apply a 1,250 percent risk weight to the portion of a CEIO that does not constitute after-tax gain-on-sale.</P>
                <P>(2) If a securitization exposure does not require deduction under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a Board-regulated institution may assign a risk weight to the securitization exposure using the simplified supervisory formula approach (SSFA) in accordance with §§ 217.43(a) through 217.43(d) and subject to the limitation under paragraph (e) of this section. Alternatively, a Board-regulated institution that is not subject to subpart F of this part may assign a risk weight to the securitization exposure using the gross-up approach in accordance with § 217.43(e), provided, however, that such Board-regulated institution must apply either the SSFA or the gross-up approach consistently across all of its securitization exposures, except as provided in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(3), and (a)(4) of this section.</P>

                <P>(3) If a securitization exposure does not require deduction under paragraph (a)(1) of this section and the Board-regulated institution cannot, or chooses not to apply the SSFA or the gross-up approach to the exposure, the Board-regulated institution must assign a risk weight to the exposure as described in § 217.44.<PRTPAGE P="466"/>
                </P>
                <P>(4) If a securitization exposure is a derivative contract (other than protection provided by a Board-regulated institution in the form of a credit derivative) that has a first priority claim on the cash flows from the underlying exposures (notwithstanding amounts due under interest rate or currency derivative contracts, fees due, or other similar payments), a Board-regulated institution may choose to set the risk-weighted asset amount of the exposure equal to the amount of the exposure as determined in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Total risk-weighted assets for securitization exposures.</E> A Board-regulated institution's total risk-weighted assets for securitization exposures equals the sum of the risk-weighted asset amount for securitization exposures that the Board-regulated institution risk weights under §§ 217.41(c), 217.42(a)(1), and 217.43, 217.44, or 217.45, and paragraphs (e) through (j) of this section, as applicable.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Exposure amount of a securitization exposure</E>—(1) <E T="03">On-balance sheet securitization exposures.</E> The exposure amount of an on-balance sheet securitization exposure (excluding an available-for-sale or held-to-maturity security where the Board-regulated institution has made an AOCI opt-out election under § 217.22(b)(2), a repo-style transaction, eligible margin loan, OTC derivative contract, or cleared transaction) is equal to the carrying value of the exposure.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">On-balance sheet securitization exposures held by a Board-regulated institution that has made an AOCI opt-out election.</E> The exposure amount of an on-balance sheet securitization exposure that is an available-for-sale or held-to-maturity security held by a Board-regulated institution that has made an AOCI opt-out election under § 217.22(b)(2) is the Board-regulated institution's carrying value (including net accrued but unpaid interest and fees), less any net unrealized gains on the exposure and plus any net unrealized losses on the exposure.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Off-balance sheet securitization exposures.</E> (i) Except as provided in paragraph (j) of this section, the exposure amount of an off-balance sheet securitization exposure that is not a repo-style transaction, eligible margin loan, cleared transaction (other than a credit derivative), or an OTC derivative contract (other than a credit derivative) is the notional amount of the exposure. For an off-balance sheet securitization exposure to an ABCP program, such as an eligible ABCP liquidity facility, the notional amount may be reduced to the maximum potential amount that the Board-regulated institution could be required to fund given the ABCP program's current underlying assets (calculated without regard to the current credit quality of those assets).</P>
                <P>(ii) A Board-regulated institution must determine the exposure amount of an eligible ABCP liquidity facility for which the SSFA does not apply by multiplying the notional amount of the exposure by a CCF of 50 percent.</P>
                <P>(iii) A Board-regulated institution must determine the exposure amount of an eligible ABCP liquidity facility for which the SSFA applies by multiplying the notional amount of the exposure by a CCF of 100 percent.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Repo-style transactions, eligible margin loans, and derivative contracts.</E> The exposure amount of a securitization exposure that is a repo-style transaction, eligible margin loan, or derivative contract (other than a credit derivative) is the exposure amount of the transaction as calculated under § 217.34 or § 217.37, as applicable.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Overlapping exposures.</E> If a Board-regulated institution has multiple securitization exposures that provide duplicative coverage to the underlying exposures of a securitization (such as when a Board-regulated institution provides a program-wide credit enhancement and multiple pool-specific liquidity facilities to an ABCP program), the Board-regulated institution is not required to hold duplicative risk-based capital against the overlapping position. Instead, the Board-regulated institution may apply to the overlapping position the applicable risk-based capital treatment that results in the highest risk-based capital requirement.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Implicit support.</E> If a Board-regulated institution provides support to a securitization in excess of the Board-<PRTPAGE P="467"/>regulated institution's contractual obligation to provide credit support to the securitization (implicit support):</P>
                <P>(1) The Board-regulated institution must include in risk-weighted assets all of the underlying exposures associated with the securitization as if the exposures had not been securitized and must deduct from common equity tier 1 capital any after-tax gain-on-sale resulting from the securitization; and</P>
                <P>(2) The Board-regulated institution must disclose publicly:</P>
                <P>(i) That it has provided implicit support to the securitization; and</P>
                <P>(ii) The risk-based capital impact to the Board-regulated institution of providing such implicit support.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Undrawn portion of a servicer cash advance facility.</E> (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart, a Board-regulated institution that is a servicer under an eligible servicer cash advance facility is not required to hold risk-based capital against potential future cash advance payments that it may be required to provide under the contract governing the facility.</P>
                <P>(2) For a Board-regulated institution that acts as a servicer, the exposure amount for a servicer cash advance facility that is not an eligible servicer cash advance facility is equal to the amount of all potential future cash advance payments that the Board-regulated institution may be contractually required to provide during the subsequent 12 month period under the contract governing the facility.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Interest-only mortgage-backed securities.</E> Regardless of any other provisions in this subpart, the risk weight for a non-credit-enhancing interest-only mortgage-backed security may not be less than 100 percent.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Small-business loans and leases on personal property transferred with retained contractual exposure.</E> (1) Regardless of any other provision of this subpart, a Board-regulated institution that has transferred small-business loans and leases on personal property (small-business obligations) with recourse must include in risk-weighted assets only its contractual exposure to the small-business obligations if all the following conditions are met:</P>
                <P>(i) The transaction must be treated as a sale under GAAP.</P>
                <P>(ii) The Board-regulated institution establishes and maintains, pursuant to GAAP, a non-capital reserve sufficient to meet the Board-regulated institution's reasonably estimated liability under the contractual obligation.</P>
                <P>(iii) The small-business obligations are to businesses that meet the criteria for a small-business concern established by the Small Business Administration under section 3(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632 et seq.).</P>
                <P>(iv)(A) In the case of a state member bank, the bank is well capitalized, as defined in 12 CFR 208.43. For purposes of determining whether a state member bank is well capitalized for purposes of this paragraph (h), the state member bank's capital ratios must be calculated without regard to the capital treatment for transfers of small-business obligations under this paragraph (h).</P>
                <P>(B) In the case of a bank holding company or savings and loan holding company, the bank holding company or savings and loan holding company is well capitalized, as defined in 12 CFR 225.2. For purposes of determining whether a bank holding company or savings and loan holding company is well capitalized for purposes of this paragraph (h), the bank holding company or savings and loan holding company's capital ratios must be calculated without regard to the capital treatment for transfers of small-business obligations with recourse specified in paragraph (k)(1) of this section.</P>
                <P>(2) The total outstanding amount of contractual exposure retained by a Board-regulated institution on transfers of small-business obligations receiving the capital treatment specified in paragraph (h)(1) of this section cannot exceed 15 percent of the Board-regulated institution's total capital.</P>

                <P>(3) If a Board-regulated institution ceases to be well capitalized under 12 CFR 208.43 or exceeds the 15 percent capital limitation provided in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, the capital treatment under paragraph (h)(1) of this section will continue to apply to any transfers of small-business obligations with retained contractual exposure that occurred during the time that the Board-regulated institution <PRTPAGE P="468"/>was well capitalized and did not exceed the capital limit.</P>
                <P>(4) The risk-based capital ratios of the Board-regulated institution must be calculated without regard to the capital treatment for transfers of small-business obligations specified in paragraph (h)(1) of this section for purposes of:</P>
                <P>(i) Determining whether a Board-regulated institution is adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized under the Board's prompt corrective action regulations; and</P>
                <P>(ii) Reclassifying a well-capitalized Board-regulated institution to adequately capitalized and requiring an adequately capitalized Board-regulated institution to comply with certain mandatory or discretionary supervisory actions as if the Board-regulated institution were in the next lower prompt-corrective-action category.</P>

                  <E T="03">-to-default credit derivatives</E>—(1) <E T="03">Protection provider.</E> A Board-regulated institution may assign a risk weight using the SSFA in § 217.43 to an n<SU>th</SU>-to-default credit derivative in accordance with this paragraph (i). A Board-regulated institution must determine its exposure in the n<SU>th</SU>-to-default credit derivative as the largest notional amount of all the underlying exposures.</P>
                <P>(2) For purposes of determining the risk weight for an n<SU>th</SU>-to-default credit derivative using the SSFA, the Board-regulated institution must calculate the attachment point and detachment point of its exposure as follows:</P>
                <P>(i) The attachment point (parameter A) is the ratio of the sum of the notional amounts of all underlying exposures that are subordinated to the Board-regulated institution's exposure to the total notional amount of all underlying exposures. The ratio is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one. In the case of a first-to-default credit derivative, there are no underlying exposures that are subordinated to the Board-regulated institution's exposure. In the case of a second-or-subsequent-to-default credit derivative, the smallest (n-1) notional amounts of the underlying exposure(s) are subordinated to the Board-regulated institution's exposure.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">General requirements for the SSFA.</E> To use the SSFA to determine the risk weight for a securitization exposure, a Board-regulated institution must have data that enables it to assign accurately the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section. Data used to assign the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section must be the most currently available data; if the contracts governing the underlying exposures of the securitization require payments on a monthly or quarterly basis, the data used to assign the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section must be no more than 91 calendar days old. A Board-regulated institution that does not have the appropriate data to assign the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section must assign a risk weight of 1,250 percent to the exposure.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">SSFA parameters.</E> To calculate the risk weight for a securitization exposure using the SSFA, a Board-regulated institution must have accurate information on the following five inputs to the SSFA calculation:</P>
                <P>(1) K<E T="52">G</E> is the weighted-average (with unpaid principal used as the weight for each exposure) total capital requirement of the underlying exposures calculated using this subpart. K<E T="52">G</E> is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one (that is, an average risk weight of 100 percent represents a value of K<E T="52">G</E> equal to 0.08).</P>
                <P>(2) Parameter W is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one. Parameter W is the ratio of the sum of the dollar amounts of any underlying exposures of the securitization that meet any of the criteria as set forth in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (vi) of this section to the balance, measured in dollars, of underlying exposures:</P>
                <P>(i) Ninety days or more past due;<PRTPAGE P="470"/>
                </P>
                <P>(ii) Subject to a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding;</P>
                <P>(iii) In the process of foreclosure;</P>
                <P>(iv) Held as real estate owned;</P>
                <P>(v) Has contractually deferred payments for 90 days or more, other than principal or interest payments deferred on:</P>
                <P>(A) Federally-guaranteed student loans, in accordance with the terms of those guarantee programs; or</P>
                <P>(B) Consumer loans, including non-federally-guaranteed student loans, provided that such payments are deferred pursuant to provisions included in the contract at the time funds are disbursed that provide for period(s) of deferral that are not initiated based on changes in the creditworthiness of the borrower; or</P>
                <P>(vi) Is in default.</P>
                <P>(3) Parameter A is the attachment point for the exposure, which represents the threshold at which credit losses will first be allocated to the exposure. Except as provided in § 217.42(i) for n<SU>th</SU>-to-default credit derivatives, parameter A equals the ratio of the current dollar amount of underlying exposures that are subordinated to the exposure of the Board-regulated institution to the current dollar amount of underlying exposures. Any reserve account funded by the accumulated cash flows from the underlying exposures that is subordinated to the Board-regulated institution's securitization exposure may be included in the calculation of parameter A to the extent that cash is present in the account. Parameter A is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one.</P>

                <P>(4) Parameter D is the detachment point for the exposure, which represents the threshold at which credit losses of principal allocated to the exposure would result in a total loss of principal. Except as provided in section 42(i) for n<SU>th</SU>-to-default credit derivatives, parameter D equals parameter A plus the ratio of the current dollar amount of the securitization exposures that are <E T="03">pari passu</E> with the exposure (that is, have equal seniority with respect to credit risk) to the current dollar amount of the underlying exposures. Parameter D is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one.</P>
                <P>(5) A supervisory calibration parameter, p, is equal to 0.5 for securitization exposures that are not resecuritization exposures and equal to 1.5 for resecuritization exposures.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Mechanics of the SSFA.</E> K<E T="52">G</E> and W are used to calculate K<E T="52">A</E>, the augmented value of K<E T="52">G</E>, which reflects the observed credit quality of the underlying exposures. K<E T="52">A</E> is defined in paragraph (d) of this section. The values of parameters A and D, relative to K<E T="52">A</E> determine the risk weight assigned to a securitization exposure as described in paragraph (d) of this section. The risk weight assigned to a securitization exposure, or portion of a securitization exposure, as appropriate, is the larger of the risk weight determined in accordance with this paragraph (c) or paragraph (d) of this section and a risk weight of 20 percent.</P>

                <P>(1) When the detachment point, parameter D, for a securitization exposure is less than or equal to K<E T="52">A</E>, the exposure must be assigned a risk weight of 1,250 percent.</P>

                <P>(2) When the attachment point, parameter A, for a securitization exposure is greater than or equal to K<E T="52">A</E>, the Board-regulated institution must calculate the risk weight in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
                <P>(3) When A is less than K<E T="52">A</E> and D is greater than K<E T="52">A</E>, the risk weight is a weighted-average of 1,250 percent and 1,250 percent times K<E T="52">SSFA</E> calculated in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.

                <P>(2) To use the gross-up approach, a Board-regulated institution must calculate the following four inputs:</P>

                <P>(i) Pro rata share, which is the par value of the Board-regulated institution's securitization exposure as a percent of the par value of the tranche in <PRTPAGE P="472"/>which the securitization exposure resides;</P>

                <P>(f) <E T="03">Limitations.</E> Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a Board-regulated institution must assign a risk weight of not less than 20 percent to a securitization exposure.</P>

                <P>(i) <E T="03">Community development equity exposures.</E> (A) For state member banks and bank holding companies, an equity exposure that qualifies as a community development investment under 12 U.S.C. 24 (Eleventh), excluding equity exposures to an unconsolidated small business investment company and equity exposures held through a consolidated small business investment company described in section 302 of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 (15 U.S.C. 682).</P>
                <P>(B) For savings and loan holding companies, an equity exposure that is designed primarily to promote community welfare, including the welfare of low- and moderate-income communities or families, such as by providing services or employment, and excluding equity exposures to an unconsolidated small business investment company and equity exposures held through a small business investment company described in section 302 of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 (15 U.S.C. 682).</P>

                <P>(A) To compute the aggregate adjusted carrying value of a Board-regulated institution's equity exposures for purposes of this section, the Board-regulated institution may exclude equity exposures described in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3)(i), and (b)(3)(ii) of this section, the equity exposure in a hedge pair with the smaller adjusted carrying value, and a proportion of each equity exposure to an investment fund equal to the proportion of the assets of the investment fund that are not equity exposures or that meet the criterion of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. If a Board-regulated institution does not know the actual holdings of the investment fund, the Board-regulated institution may calculate the proportion of the assets of the fund that are not equity exposures based on the terms of the prospectus, partnership agreement, or similar contract that defines the fund's permissible investments. If the sum of the investment limits for all exposure classes <PRTPAGE P="475"/>within the fund exceeds 100 percent, the Board-regulated institution must assume for purposes of this section that the investment fund invests to the maximum extent possible in equity exposures.</P>
                <P>(B) When determining which of a Board-regulated institution's equity exposures qualify for a 100 percent risk weight under this paragraph (b), a Board-regulated institution first must include equity exposures to unconsolidated small business investment companies or held through consolidated small business investment companies described in section 302 of the Small Business Investment Act, then must include publicly traded equity exposures (including those held indirectly through investment funds), and then must include non-publicly traded equity exposures (including those held indirectly through investment funds).</P>

If RVC is positive, the hedge is not effective and E equals 0. If RVC is negative and greater than or equal to −1 (that is, between zero and −1), then E equals the absolute value of RVC.

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Available approaches.</E> (1) Unless the exposure meets the requirements for a community development equity exposure under § 217.52(b)(3)(i), a Board-regulated institution must determine the risk-weighted asset amount of an equity exposure to an investment fund under the full look-through approach described in paragraph (b) of this section, the simple modified look-through approach described in paragraph (c) of this section, or the alterative modified look-through approach described paragraph (d) of this section, provided, however, that the minimum risk weight that may be assigned to an equity exposure under this section is 20 percent.</P>
                <P>(2) The risk-weighted asset amount of an equity exposure to an investment fund that meets the requirements for a community development equity exposure in § 217.52(b)(3)(i) is its adjusted carrying value.</P>
                <P>(3) If an equity exposure to an investment fund is part of a hedge pair and the Board-regulated institution does not use the full look-through approach, the Board-regulated institution must use the ineffective portion of the hedge pair as determined under § 217.52(c) as the adjusted carrying value for the equity exposure to the investment fund. The risk-weighted asset amount of the effective portion of the hedge pair is equal to its adjusted carrying value.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Full look-through approach.</E> A Board-regulated institution that is able to calculate a risk-weighted asset amount for its proportional ownership share of each exposure held by the investment fund (as calculated under this subpart as if the proportional ownership share of the adjusted carrying value of each exposure were held directly by the Board-regulated institution) may set the risk-weighted asset amount of the Board-regulated institution's exposure to the fund equal to the product of:</P>

                <P>(1) The aggregate risk-weighted asset amounts of the exposures held by the fund as if they were held directly by the Board-regulated institution; and<PRTPAGE P="477"/>

                <P>(c) <E T="03">Simple modified look-through approach.</E> Under the simple modified look-through approach, the risk-weighted asset amount for a Board-regulated institution's equity exposure to an investment fund equals the adjusted carrying value of the equity exposure multiplied by the highest risk weight that applies to any exposure the fund is permitted to hold under the prospectus, partnership agreement, or similar agreement that defines the fund's permissible investments (excluding derivative contracts that are used for hedging rather than speculative purposes and that do not constitute a material portion of the fund's exposures).</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Alternative modified look-through approach.</E> Under the alternative modified look-through approach, a Board-regulated institution may assign the adjusted carrying value of an equity exposure to an investment fund on a pro rata basis to different risk weight categories under this subpart based on the investment limits in the fund's prospectus, partnership agreement, or similar contract that defines the fund's permissible investments. The risk-weighted asset amount for the Board-regulated institution's equity exposure to the investment fund equals the sum of each portion of the adjusted carrying value assigned to an exposure type multiplied by the applicable risk weight under this subpart. If the sum of the investment limits for all exposure types within the fund exceeds 100 percent, the Board-regulated institution must assume that the fund invests to the maximum extent permitted under its investment limits in the exposure type with the highest applicable risk weight under this subpart and continues to make investments in order of the exposure type with the next highest applicable risk weight under this subpart until the maximum total investment level is reached. If more than one exposure type applies to an exposure, the Board-regulated institution must use the highest applicable risk weight. A Board-regulated institution may exclude derivative contracts held by the fund that are used for hedging rather than for speculative purposes and do not constitute a material portion of the fund's exposures.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Purpose and scope.</SUBJECT>
                <P>Sections 217.61-217.63 of this subpart establish public disclosure requirements related to the capital requirements described in subpart B of this part for a Board-regulated institution with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more as reported on the Board-regulated institution's most recent year-end Call Report, for a state member bank, or FR Y-9C, for a bank holding company or savings and loan holding company, as applicable that is not an advanced approaches Board-regulated institution making public disclosures pursuant to § 217.172. An advanced approaches Board-regulated institution that has not received approval from the Board to exit parallel run pursuant to § 217.121(d) is subject to the disclosure requirements described in §§ 217.62 and 217.63. Such a Board-regulated institution must comply with § 217.62 unless it is a consolidated subsidiary of a bank holding company, savings and loan holding company, or depository institution that is subject to these disclosure requirements or a subsidiary of a non-U.S. banking organization that is subject to comparable public disclosure requirements in its home jurisdiction. For purposes of this section, total consolidated assets are determined based on the average of the Board-regulated institution's total consolidated assets in the four most recent quarters as reported on the Call Report, for a state member bank, or FR Y-9C, for a bank holding company or savings and loan holding company, as applicable; or the average of the Board-regulated institution's total consolidated assets in the most recent consecutive quarters as reported quarterly on the Board-regulated institution's Call Report, for a state member bank, or FR Y-9C, for a bank holding company or savings and loan holding company, as applicable if the Board-regulated institution has not filed such a report for each of the most recent four quarters.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Disclosure requirements.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) A Board-regulated institution described in § 217.61 must provide timely public disclosures each calendar quarter of the information in the applicable tables in § 217.63. If a significant change occurs, such that the most recent reported amounts are no longer reflective of the Board-regulated institution's capital adequacy and risk profile, then a brief discussion of this change and its likely impact must be disclosed as soon as practicable thereafter. Qualitative disclosures that typically do not change each quarter (for example, a general summary of the Board-regulated institution's risk management objectives and policies, reporting system, and definitions) may be disclosed annually after the end of the fourth calendar quarter, provided that any significant changes are disclosed in the interim. The Board-regulated institution's management may provide all of the disclosures required by §§ 217.61 through 217.63 in one place on the Board-regulated institution's public Web site or may provide the disclosures in more than one public financial report or other regulatory reports, provided that the Board-regulated institution publicly provides a summary table specifically indicating the location(s) of all such disclosures.</P>
                <P>(b) A Board-regulated institution described in § 217.61 must have a formal disclosure policy approved by the board of directors that addresses its approach for determining the disclosures it makes. The policy must address the associated internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures. The board of directors and senior management are responsible for establishing and maintaining an effective internal control structure over financial reporting, including the disclosures required by this subpart, and must ensure that appropriate review of the disclosures takes place. One or more senior officers of the Board-regulated institution must attest that the disclosures meet the requirements of this subpart.</P>
                <P>(c) If a Board-regulated institution described in § 217.61 concludes that specific commercial or financial information that it would otherwise be required to disclose under this section would be exempt from disclosure by the Board under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), then the Board-regulated institution is not required to disclose that specific information pursuant to this section, but must disclose more general information about the subject matter of the requirement, together with the fact that, and the reason why, the specific items of information have not been disclosed.</P>

The Board-regulated institution must make these disclosures publicly available for each of the last three years (that is, twelve quarters) or such shorter period beginning on January 1, 2015.</P>
                <P>(b) A Board-regulated institution must publicly disclose each quarter the following:</P>
                <P>(1) Common equity tier 1 capital, additional tier 1 capital, tier 2 capital, tier 1 and total capital ratios, including the regulatory capital elements and all the regulatory adjustments and deductions needed to calculate the numerator of such ratios;</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> This subpart E establishes:</P>
              <P>(1) Minimum qualifying criteria for Board-regulated institutions using institution-specific internal risk measurement and management processes for calculating risk-based capital requirements; and</P>
              <P>(2) Methodologies for such Board-regulated institutions to calculate their total risk-weighted assets.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> (1) This subpart applies to:</P>
              <P>(i) A top-tier bank holding company or savings and loan holding company domiciled in the United States that:</P>
              <P>(A) Is not a consolidated subsidiary of another bank holding company or savings and loan holding company that uses 12 CFR part 217, subpart E, to calculate its risk-based capital requirements; and</P>
              <P>(B) That:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Has total consolidated assets (excluding assets held by an insurance underwriting subsidiary), as defined on schedule HC-K of the FR Y-9C, equal to $250 billion or more;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Has consolidated total on-balance sheet foreign exposure on its most recent year-end Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) 009 Report equal to $10 billion or more (where total on-balance sheet foreign exposure equals total foreign countries cross-border claims on an ultimate-risk basis, plus total foreign countries claims on local residents on an ultimate-risk basis, plus total foreign countries fair value of foreign exchange and derivative products), calculated in accordance with the FFIEC 009 Country Exposure Report;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Has a subsidiary depository institution that is required, or has elected, to use 12 CFR part 3, subpart E (OCC), 12 CFR part 217, subpart E (Board), or 12 CFR part 325, subpart E (FDIC) to calculate its risk-based capital requirements;</P>
              <P>(ii) A state member bank that:</P>
              <P>(A) Has total consolidated assets, as reported on the most recent year-end Consolidated Report of Condition and Income (Call Report), equal to $250 billion or more;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">B</E>) Has consolidated total on-balance sheet foreign exposure on its most recent year-end Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) 009 Report equal to $10 billion or more (where total on-balance sheet foreign exposure equals total foreign countries cross-border claims on an ultimate-risk basis, plus total foreign countries claims on local residents on an ultimate-risk basis, plus total foreign <PRTPAGE P="484"/>countries fair value of foreign exchange and derivative products), calculated in accordance with the FFIEC 009 Country Exposure Report;</P>
              <P>(C) Is a subsidiary of a depository institution that uses 12 CFR part 3, subpart E (OCC), 12 CFR part 217, subpart E (Board), or 12 CFR part 325, subpart E (FDIC) to calculate its risk-based capital requirements; or</P>
              <P>(D) Is a subsidiary of a bank holding company or savings and loan holding company that uses 12 CFR part 217, subpart E, to calculate its risk-based capital requirements; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Any Board-regulated institution that elects to use this subpart to calculate its risk-based capital requirements.</P>
              <P>(iv) Is a subsidiary of a bank holding company or savings and loan holding company that uses the advanced approaches pursuant to 12 CFR part 217 to calculate its total risk-weighted assets; or</P>
              <P>(v) Elects to use this subpart to calculate its total risk-weighted assets.</P>
              <P>(2) A bank that is subject to this subpart shall remain subject to this subpart unless the Board determines in writing that application of this subpart is not appropriate in light of the Board-regulated institution's asset size, level of complexity, risk profile, or scope of operations. In making a determination under this paragraph (b), the Board will apply notice and response procedures in the same manner and to the same extent as the notice and response procedures in 12 CFR 263.202.</P>
              <P>(3) A market risk Board-regulated institution must exclude from its calculation of risk-weighted assets under this subpart the risk-weighted asset amounts of all covered positions, as defined in subpart F of this part (except foreign exchange positions that are not trading positions, over-the-counter derivative positions, cleared transactions, and unsettled transactions).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Principle of conservatism.</E> Notwithstanding the requirements of this subpart, a Board-regulated institution may choose not to apply a provision of this subpart to one or more exposures provided that:</P>
              <P>(1) The Board-regulated institution can demonstrate on an ongoing basis to the satisfaction of the Board that not applying the provision would, in all circumstances, unambiguously generate a risk-based capital requirement for each such exposure greater than that which would otherwise be required under this subpart;</P>
              <P>(2) The Board-regulated institution appropriately manages the risk of each such exposure;</P>
              <P>(3) The Board-regulated institution notifies the Board in writing prior to applying this principle to each such exposure; and</P>
              <P>(4) The exposures to which the Board-regulated institution applies this principle are not, in the aggregate, material to the Board-regulated institution.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Qualification requirements.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Process and systems requirements.</E> (1) A Board-regulated institution must have a rigorous process for assessing its overall capital adequacy in relation to its risk profile and a comprehensive strategy for maintaining an appropriate level of capital.</P>
                <P>(2) The systems and processes used by a Board-regulated institution for risk-based capital purposes under this subpart must be consistent with the Board-regulated institution's internal risk management processes and management information reporting systems.</P>
                <P>(3) Each Board-regulated institution must have an appropriate infrastructure with risk measurement and management processes that meet the qualification requirements of this section and are appropriate given the Board-regulated institution's size and level of complexity. Regardless of whether the systems and models that generate the risk parameters necessary for calculating a Board-regulated institution's risk-based capital requirements are located at any affiliate of the Board-regulated institution, the Board-regulated institution itself must ensure that the risk parameters and reference data used to determine its risk-based capital requirements are representative of long run experience with respect to its own credit risk and operational risk exposures.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Risk rating and segmentation systems for wholesale and retail exposures.</E> (1)(i) A Board-regulated institution must have an internal risk rating and segmentation system that accurately, reliably, and meaningfully differentiates among degrees of credit risk for the Board-regulated institution's wholesale and retail exposures. When assigning an internal risk rating, a Board-regulated institution may consider a third-party assessment of credit risk, provided that the Board-regulated institution's internal risk rating assignment does not rely solely on the external assessment.</P>
                <P>(ii) If a Board-regulated institution uses multiple rating or segmentation systems, the Board-regulated institution's rationale for assigning an obligor or exposure to a particular system must be documented and applied in a manner that best reflects the obligor or exposure's level of risk. A Board-regulated institution must not inappropriately allocate obligors or exposures across systems to minimize regulatory capital requirements.</P>
                <P>(iii) In assigning ratings to wholesale obligors and exposures, including loss severity ratings grades to wholesale exposures, and assigning retail exposures to retail segments, a Board-regulated institution must use all relevant and material information and ensure that the information is current.</P>
                <P>(iv) When assigning an obligor to a PD rating or retail exposure to a PD segment, a Board-regulated institution must assess the obligor or retail borrower's ability and willingness to contractually perform, taking a conservative view of projected information.</P>
                <P>(2) For wholesale exposures:</P>

                <P>(i) A Board-regulated institution must have an internal risk rating system that accurately and reliably assigns each obligor to a single rating grade (reflecting the obligor's likelihood of default). A Board-regulated institution may elect, however, not to assign to a rating grade an obligor to whom the Board-regulated institution <PRTPAGE P="493"/>extends credit based solely on the financial strength of a guarantor, provided that all of the Board-regulated institution's exposures to the obligor are fully covered by eligible guarantees, the Board-regulated institution applies the PD substitution approach in § 217.134(c)(1) to all exposures to that obligor, and the Board-regulated institution immediately assigns the obligor to a rating grade if a guarantee can no longer be recognized under this part. The Board-regulated institution's wholesale obligor rating system must have at least seven discrete rating grades for non-defaulted obligors and at least one rating grade for defaulted obligors.</P>
                <P>(ii) Unless the Board-regulated institution has chosen to directly assign LGD estimates to each wholesale exposure, the Board-regulated institution must have an internal risk rating system that accurately and reliably assigns each wholesale exposure to a loss severity rating grade (reflecting the Board-regulated institution's estimate of the LGD of the exposure). A Board-regulated institution employing loss severity rating grades must have a sufficiently granular loss severity grading system to avoid grouping together exposures with widely ranging LGDs.</P>
                <P>(iii) A Board-regulated institution must have an effective process to obtain and update in a timely manner relevant and material information on obligor and exposure characteristics that affect PD, LGD and EAD.</P>
                <P>(3) For retail exposures:</P>
                <P>(i) A Board-regulated institution must have an internal system that groups retail exposures into the appropriate retail exposure subcategory and groups the retail exposures in each retail exposure subcategory into separate segments with homogeneous risk characteristics that provide a meaningful differentiation of risk. The Board-regulated institution's system must identify and group in separate segments by subcategories exposures identified in § 217.131(c)(2)(ii) and (iii).</P>
                <P>(ii) A Board-regulated institution must have an internal system that captures all relevant exposure risk characteristics, including borrower credit score, product and collateral types, as well as exposure delinquencies, and must consider cross-collateral provisions, where present.</P>
                <P>(iii) The Board-regulated institution must review and, if appropriate, update assignments of individual retail exposures to segments and the loss characteristics and delinquency status of each identified risk segment. These reviews must occur whenever the Board-regulated institution receives new material information, but generally no less frequently than quarterly, and, in all cases, at least annually.</P>
                <P>(4) The Board-regulated institution's internal risk rating policy for wholesale exposures must describe the Board-regulated institution's rating philosophy (that is, must describe how wholesale obligor rating assignments are affected by the Board-regulated institution's choice of the range of economic, business, and industry conditions that are considered in the obligor rating process).</P>
                <P>(5) The Board-regulated institution's internal risk rating system for wholesale exposures must provide for the review and update (as appropriate) of each obligor rating and (if applicable) each loss severity rating whenever the Board-regulated institution obtains relevant and material information on the obligor or exposure that affects PD, LGD and EAD, but no less frequently than annually.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Quantification of risk parameters for wholesale and retail exposures.</E> (1) The Board-regulated institution must have a comprehensive risk parameter quantification process that produces accurate, timely, and reliable estimates of the risk parameters on a consistent basis for the Board-regulated institution's wholesale and retail exposures.</P>

                <P>(2) A Board-regulated institution's estimates of PD, LGD, and EAD must incorporate all relevant, material, and available data that is reflective of the Board-regulated institution's actual wholesale and retail exposures and of sufficient quality to support the determination of risk-based capital requirements for the exposures. In particular, the population of exposures in the data used for estimation purposes, the lending standards in use when the data were generated, and other relevant characteristics, should closely match <PRTPAGE P="494"/>or be comparable to the Board-regulated institution's exposures and standards. In addition, a Board-regulated institution must:</P>
                <P>(i) Demonstrate that its estimates are representative of long run experience, including periods of economic downturn conditions, whether internal or external data are used;</P>
                <P>(ii) Take into account any changes in lending practice or the process for pursuing recoveries over the observation period;</P>
                <P>(iii) Promptly reflect technical advances, new data, and other information as they become available;</P>
                <P>(iv) Demonstrate that the data used to estimate risk parameters support the accuracy and robustness of those estimates; and</P>
                <P>(v) Demonstrate that its estimation technique performs well in out-of-sample tests whenever possible.</P>
                <P>(3) The Board-regulated institution's risk parameter quantification process must produce appropriately conservative risk parameter estimates where the Board-regulated institution has limited relevant data, and any adjustments that are part of the quantification process must not result in a pattern of bias toward lower risk parameter estimates.</P>
                <P>(4) The Board-regulated institution's risk parameter estimation process should not rely on the possibility of U.S. government financial assistance, except for the financial assistance that the U.S. government has a legally binding commitment to provide.</P>
                <P>(5) The Board-regulated institution must be able to demonstrate which variables have been found to be statistically significant with regard to EAD. The Board-regulated institution's EAD estimates must reflect its specific policies and strategies with regard to account management, including account monitoring and payment processing, and its ability and willingness to prevent further drawdowns in circumstances short of payment default. The Board-regulated institution must have adequate systems and procedures in place to monitor current outstanding amounts against committed lines, and changes in outstanding amounts per obligor and obligor rating grade and per retail segment. The Board-regulated institution must be able to monitor outstanding amounts on a daily basis.</P>
                <P>(6) At a minimum, PD estimates for wholesale obligors and retail segments must be based on at least five years of default data. LGD estimates for wholesale exposures must be based on at least seven years of loss severity data, and LGD estimates for retail segments must be based on at least five years of loss severity data. EAD estimates for wholesale exposures must be based on at least seven years of exposure amount data, and EAD estimates for retail segments must be based on at least five years of exposure amount data. If the Board-regulated institution has relevant and material reference data that span a longer period of time than the minimum time periods specified above, the Board-regulated institution must incorporate such data in its estimates, provided that it does not place undue weight on periods of favorable or benign economic conditions relative to periods of economic downturn conditions.</P>
                <P>(7) Default, loss severity, and exposure amount data must include periods of economic downturn conditions, or the Board-regulated institution must adjust its estimates of risk parameters to compensate for the lack of data from periods of economic downturn conditions.</P>
                <P>(8) The Board-regulated institution's PD, LGD, and EAD estimates must be based on the definition of default in § 217.101.</P>
                <P>(9) If a Board-regulated institution uses internal data obtained prior to becoming subject to this subpart E or external data to arrive at PD, LGD, or EAD estimates, the Board-regulated institution must demonstrate to the Board that the Board-regulated institution has made appropriate adjustments if necessary to be consistent with the definition of default in § 217.101. Internal data obtained after the Board-regulated institution becomes subject to this subpart E must be consistent with the definition of default in § 217.101.</P>

                <P>(10) The Board-regulated institution must review and update (as appropriate) its risk parameters and its risk <PRTPAGE P="495"/>parameter quantification process at least annually.</P>
                <P>(11) The Board-regulated institution must, at least annually, conduct a comprehensive review and analysis of reference data to determine relevance of the reference data to the Board-regulated institution's exposures, quality of reference data to support PD, LGD, and EAD estimates, and consistency of reference data to the definition of default in § 217.101.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Counterparty credit risk model.</E> A Board-regulated institution must obtain the prior written approval of the Board under § 217.132 to use the internal models methodology for counterparty credit risk and the advanced CVA approach for the CVA capital requirement.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Double default treatment.</E> A Board-regulated institution must obtain the prior written approval of the Board under § 217.135 to use the double default treatment.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Equity exposures model.</E> A Board-regulated institution must obtain the prior written approval of the Board under § 217.153 to use the internal models approach for equity exposures.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Operational risk.</E> (1) Operational risk management processes. A Board-regulated institution must:</P>
                <P>(i) Have an operational risk management function that:</P>
                <P>(A) Is independent of business line management; and</P>
                <P>(B) Is responsible for designing, implementing, and overseeing the Board-regulated institution's operational risk data and assessment systems, operational risk quantification systems, and related processes;</P>
                <P>(ii) Have and document a process (which must capture business environment and internal control factors affecting the Board-regulated institution's operational risk profile) to identify, measure, monitor, and control operational risk in the Board-regulated institution's products, activities, processes, and systems; and</P>
                <P>(iii) Report operational risk exposures, operational loss events, and other relevant operational risk information to business unit management, senior management, and the board of directors (or a designated committee of the board).</P>

                <P>(A) <E T="03">Internal operational loss event data.</E> The Board-regulated institution must have a systematic process for capturing and using internal operational loss event data in its operational risk data and assessment systems.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The Board-regulated institution's operational risk data and assessment systems must include a historical observation period of at least five years for internal operational loss event data (or such shorter period approved by the Board to address transitional situations, such as integrating a new business line).</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The Board-regulated institution must be able to map its internal operational loss event data into the seven operational loss event type categories.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) The Board-regulated institution may refrain from collecting internal operational loss event data for individual operational losses below established dollar threshold amounts if the Board-regulated institution can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Board that the thresholds are reasonable, do not exclude important internal operational loss event data, and permit the Board-regulated institution to capture substantially all the dollar value of the Board-regulated institution's operational losses.</P>
                <P>(B) <E T="03">External operational loss event data.</E> The Board-regulated institution must have a systematic process for determining its methodologies for incorporating external operational loss event data into its operational risk data and assessment systems.<PRTPAGE P="496"/>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Overview.</E> A Board-regulated institution must calculate its total wholesale and retail risk-weighted asset amount in four distinct phases:</P>
                <P>(1) Phase 1—categorization of exposures;</P>
                <P>(2) Phase 2—assignment of wholesale obligors and exposures to rating grades and segmentation of retail exposures;</P>
                <P>(3) Phase 3—assignment of risk parameters to wholesale exposures and segments of retail exposures; and</P>

                <P>(4) Phase 4—calculation of risk-weighted asset amounts.<PRTPAGE P="499"/>
                </P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Phase 1—Categorization.</E> The Board-regulated institution must determine which of its exposures are wholesale exposures, retail exposures, securitization exposures, or equity exposures. The Board-regulated institution must categorize each retail exposure as a residential mortgage exposure, a QRE, or another retail exposure. The Board-regulated institution must identify which wholesale exposures are HVCRE exposures, sovereign exposures, OTC derivative contracts, repo-style transactions, eligible margin loans, eligible purchased wholesale exposures, cleared transactions, default fund contributions, and unsettled transactions to which § 217.136 applies, and eligible guarantees or eligible credit derivatives that are used as credit risk mitigants. The Board-regulated institution must identify any on-balance sheet asset that does not meet the definition of a wholesale, retail, equity, or securitization exposure, any non-material portfolio of exposures described in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, and for bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies, any on-balance sheet asset that is held in a non-guaranteed separate account.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Phase 2—Assignment of wholesale obligors and exposures to rating grades and retail exposures to segments</E>—(1) <E T="03">Assignment of wholesale obligors and exposures to rating grades.</E>
                </P>
                <P>(i) The Board-regulated institution must assign each obligor of a wholesale exposure to a single obligor rating grade and must assign each wholesale exposure to which it does not directly assign an LGD estimate to a loss severity rating grade.</P>
                <P>(ii) The Board-regulated institution must identify which of its wholesale obligors are in default.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Segmentation of retail exposures.</E> (i) The Board-regulated institution must group the retail exposures in each retail subcategory into segments that have homogeneous risk characteristics.</P>
                <P>(ii) The Board-regulated institution must identify which of its retail exposures are in default. The Board-regulated institution must segment defaulted retail exposures separately from non-defaulted retail exposures.</P>
                <P>(iii) If the Board-regulated institution determines the EAD for eligible margin loans using the approach in § 217.132(b), the Board-regulated institution must identify which of its retail exposures are eligible margin loans for which the Board-regulated institution uses this EAD approach and must segment such eligible margin loans separately from other retail exposures.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Eligible purchased wholesale exposures.</E> A Board-regulated institution may group its eligible purchased wholesale exposures into segments that have homogeneous risk characteristics. A Board-regulated institution must use the wholesale exposure formula in Table 1 of this section to determine the risk-based capital requirement for each segment of eligible purchased wholesale exposures.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Phase 3—Assignment of risk parameters to wholesale exposures and segments of retail exposures.</E> (1) <E T="03">Quantification process.</E> Subject to the limitations in this paragraph (d), the Board-regulated institution must:</P>
                <P>(i) Associate a PD with each wholesale obligor rating grade;</P>
                <P>(ii) Associate an LGD with each wholesale loss severity rating grade or assign an LGD to each wholesale exposure;</P>
                <P>(iii) Assign an EAD and M to each wholesale exposure; and</P>
                <P>(iv) Assign a PD, LGD, and EAD to each segment of retail exposures.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Floor on PD assignment.</E> The PD for each wholesale obligor or retail segment may not be less than 0.03 percent, except for exposures to or directly and unconditionally guaranteed by a sovereign entity, the Bank for International Settlements, the International Monetary Fund, the European Commission, the European Central Bank, or a multilateral development bank, to which the Board-regulated institution assigns a rating grade associated with a PD of less than 0.03 percent.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Floor on LGD estimation.</E> The LGD for each segment of residential mortgage exposures may not be less than 10 percent, except for segments of residential mortgage exposures for which all or substantially all of the principal of each exposure is either:</P>

                <P>(i) Directly and unconditionally guaranteed by the full faith and credit of a sovereign entity; or<PRTPAGE P="500"/>
                </P>
                <P>(ii) Guaranteed by a contingent obligation of the U.S. government or its agencies, the enforceability of which is dependent upon some affirmative action on the part of the beneficiary of the guarantee or a third party (for example, meeting servicing requirements).</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Eligible purchased wholesale exposures.</E> A Board-regulated institution must assign a PD, LGD, EAD, and M to each segment of eligible purchased wholesale exposures. If the Board-regulated institution can estimate ECL (but not PD or LGD) for a segment of eligible purchased wholesale exposures, the Board-regulated institution must assume that the LGD of the segment equals 100 percent and that the PD of the segment equals ECL divided by EAD. The estimated ECL must be calculated for the exposures without regard to any assumption of recourse or guarantees from the seller or other parties.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Credit risk mitigation: credit derivatives, guarantees, and collateral.</E> (i) A Board-regulated institution may take into account the risk reducing effects of eligible guarantees and eligible credit derivatives in support of a wholesale exposure by applying the PD substitution or LGD adjustment treatment to the exposure as provided in § 217.134 or, if applicable, applying double default treatment to the exposure as provided in § 217.135. A Board-regulated institution may decide separately for each wholesale exposure that qualifies for the double default treatment under § 217.135 whether to apply the double default treatment or to use the PD substitution or LGD adjustment treatment without recognizing double default effects.</P>
                <P>(ii) A Board-regulated institution may take into account the risk reducing effects of guarantees and credit derivatives in support of retail exposures in a segment when quantifying the PD and LGD of the segment. In doing so, a Board-regulated institution must consider all relevant available information.</P>
                <P>(iii) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(6) of this section, a Board-regulated institution may take into account the risk reducing effects of collateral in support of a wholesale exposure when quantifying the LGD of the exposure, and may take into account the risk reducing effects of collateral in support of retail exposures when quantifying the PD and LGD of the segment. In order to do so, a Board-regulated institution must have established internal requirements for collateral management, legal certainty, and risk management processes.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">EAD for OTC derivative contracts, repo-style transactions, and eligible margin loans.</E> A Board-regulated institution must calculate its EAD for an OTC derivative contract as provided in § 217.132 (c) and (d). A Board-regulated institution may take into account the risk-reducing effects of financial collateral in support of a repo-style transaction or eligible margin loan and of any collateral in support of a repo-style transaction that is included in the Board-regulated institution's VaR-based measure under subpart F of this part through an adjustment to EAD as provided in § 217.132(b) and (d). A Board-regulated institution that takes collateral into account through such an adjustment to EAD under § 217.132 may not reflect such collateral in LGD.</P>
                <P>(7) <E T="03">Effective maturity.</E> An exposure's M must be no greater than five years and no less than one year, except that an exposure's M must be no less than one day if the exposure is a trade related letter of credit, or if the exposure has an original maturity of less than one year and is not part of a Board-regulated institution's ongoing financing of the obligor. An exposure is not part of a Board-regulated institution's ongoing financing of the obligor if the Board-regulated institution:</P>
                <P>(i) Has a legal and practical ability not to renew or roll over the exposure in the event of credit deterioration of the obligor;</P>
                <P>(ii) Makes an independent credit decision at the inception of the exposure and at every renewal or roll over; and</P>
                <P>(iii) Has no substantial commercial incentive to continue its credit relationship with the obligor in the event of credit deterioration of the obligor.</P>
                <P>(8) <E T="03">EAD for exposures to certain central counterparties.</E> A Board-regulated institution may attribute an EAD of zero to <PRTPAGE P="501"/>exposures that arise from the settlement of cash transactions (such as equities, fixed income, spot foreign exchange, and spot commodities) with a central counterparty where there is no assumption of ongoing counterparty credit risk by the central counterparty after settlement of the trade and associated default fund contributions.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Phase 4—Calculation of risk-weighted assets</E>—(1) <E T="03">Non-defaulted exposures.</E> (i) A Board-regulated institution must calculate the dollar risk-based capital requirement for each of its wholesale exposures to a non-defaulted obligor (except for eligible guarantees and eligible credit derivatives that hedge another wholesale exposure, IMM exposures, cleared transactions, default fund contributions, unsettled transactions, and exposures to which the Board-regulated institution applies the double default treatment in § 217.135) and segments of non-defaulted retail exposures by inserting the assigned risk parameters for the wholesale obligor and exposure or retail segment into the appropriate risk-based capital formula specified in Table 1 and multiplying the output of the formula (K) by the EAD of the exposure or segment. Alternatively, a Board-regulated institution may apply a 300 percent risk weight to the EAD of an eligible margin loan if the Board-regulated institution is not able to meet the Board's requirements for estimation of PD and LGD for the margin loan.</P>

                <P>(ii) The sum of all the dollar risk-based capital requirements for each wholesale exposure to a non-defaulted obligor and segment of non-defaulted retail exposures calculated in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section and in § 217.135(e) equals the total dollar risk-based capital requirement for those exposures and segments.</P>
                <P>(iii) The aggregate risk-weighted asset amount for wholesale exposures to non-defaulted obligors and segments of non-defaulted retail exposures equals the total dollar risk-based capital requirement in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section multiplied by 12.5.</P>

                <P>(A) The sum of the EAD of the portion of each wholesale exposure to a defaulted obligor covered by an eligible guarantee from the U.S. government plus the EAD of the portion of each segment of defaulted retail exposures that is covered by an eligible guarantee from the U.S. government and the resulting sum is multiplied by 0.016, and</P>
                <P>(B) The sum of the EAD of the portion of each wholesale exposure to a defaulted obligor not covered by an eligible guarantee from the U.S. government plus the EAD of the portion of each segment of defaulted retail exposures that is not covered by an eligible guarantee from the U.S. government and the resulting sum is multiplied by 0.08.</P>
                <P>(iii) The sum of all the dollar risk-based capital requirements for each wholesale exposure to a defaulted obligor and each segment of defaulted retail exposures calculated in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section plus the dollar risk-based capital requirements each wholesale exposure to a defaulted obligor and for each segment of defaulted retail exposures calculated in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section equals the total dollar risk-based capital requirement for those exposures and segments.</P>
                <P>(iv) The aggregate risk-weighted asset amount for wholesale exposures to defaulted obligors and segments of defaulted retail exposures equals the total dollar risk-based capital requirement calculated in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section multiplied by 12.5.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Assets not included in a defined exposure category.</E> (i) A bank holding company or savings and loan holding company may assign a risk-weighted asset amount of zero to cash owned and held in all offices of subsidiary depository institutions or in transit; and for gold bullion held in a subsidiary depository institution's own vaults, or held in another depository institution's vaults on an allocated basis, to the extent the gold bullion assets are offset by gold bullion liabilities.</P>
                <P>(ii) A state member bank may assign a risk-weighted asset amount to cash owned and held in all offices of the state member bank or in transit and for gold bullion held in the state member bank's own vaults, or held in another depository institution's vaults on an allocated basis, to the extent the gold bullion assets are offset by gold bullion liabilities.</P>
                <P>(iii) A Board-regulated institution must assign a risk-weighted asset amount equal to 50 percent of the carrying value to a pre-sold construction loan unless the purchase contract is cancelled, in which case a Board-regulated institution must assign a risk-weighted asset amount equal to a 100 percent of the carrying value of the pre-sold construction loan.</P>
                <P>(iv) The risk-weighted asset amount for the residual value of a retail lease exposure equals such residual value.</P>
                <P>(v) The risk-weighted asset amount for DTAs arising from temporary differences that the Board-regulated institution could realize through net operating loss carrybacks equals the carrying value, netted in accordance with § 217.22.</P>

For <PRTPAGE P="505"/>purposes of this paragraph (e)(4), the notional amount of an OTC derivative contract that is not a credit derivative is the EAD of the derivative as calculated in § 217.132.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Assets held in non-guaranteed separate accounts.</E> The risk-weighted asset amount for an on-balance sheet asset that is held in a non-guaranteed separate account is zero percent of the carrying value of the asset.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Methodologies for collateral recognition.</E> (1) Instead of an LGD estimation methodology, a Board-regulated institution may use the following methodologies to recognize the benefits of financial collateral in mitigating the counterparty credit risk of repo-style transactions, eligible margin loans, collateralized OTC derivative contracts and single product netting sets of such transactions, and to recognize the benefits of any collateral in mitigating the counterparty credit risk of repo-style transactions that are included in a Board-regulated institution's VaR-based measure under subpart F of this part:</P>
                <P>(i) The collateral haircut approach set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section;</P>
                <P>(ii) The internal models methodology set forth in paragraph (d) of this section; and</P>
                <P>(iii) For single product netting sets of repo-style transactions and eligible margin loans, the simple VaR methodology set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</P>
                <P>(2) A Board-regulated institution may use any combination of the three methodologies for collateral recognition; however, it must use the same methodology for transactions in the same category.</P>
                <P>(3) A Board-regulated institution must use the methodology in paragraph (c) of this section, or with prior written approval of the Board, the internal model methodology in paragraph (d) of this section, to calculate EAD for an OTC derivative contract or a set of OTC derivative contracts subject to a qualifying master netting agreement. To estimate EAD for qualifying cross-product master netting agreements, a Board-regulated institution may only use the internal models methodology in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
                <P>(4) A Board-regulated institution must also use the methodology in paragraph (e) of this section to calculate the risk-weighted asset amounts for CVA for OTC derivatives.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">EAD for eligible margin loans and repo-style transactions</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> A Board-regulated institution may recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of financial collateral that secures an eligible margin loan, repo-style transaction, or single-product netting set of such transactions by factoring the collateral into its LGD estimates for the exposure. Alternatively, a Board-regulated institution may estimate an unsecured LGD for the exposure, as well as for any repo-style transaction that is included in the Board-regulated institution's VaR-based measure under subpart F of this part, and determine the EAD of the exposure using:</P>
                <P>(i) The collateral haircut approach described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section;</P>
                <P>(ii) For netting sets only, the simple VaR methodology described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section; or</P>

                <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) A Board-regulated institution is required to calculate its own internal estimates with inputs calibrated to historical data from a continuous 12-month period that reflects a period of significant financial stress appropriate to the security or category of securities.</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) A Board-regulated institution must have policies and procedures that describe how it determines the period of significant financial stress used to calculate the Board-regulated institution's own internal estimates for haircuts under this section and must be able to provide empirical support for the period used. The Board-regulated institution must obtain the prior approval of the Board for, and notify the Board if the Board-regulated institution makes any material changes to, these policies and procedures.</P>

                <P>(B) With respect to debt securities that are investment grade, a Board-regulated institution may calculate haircuts for categories of securities. For a category of securities, the Board-regulated institution must calculate the haircut on the basis of internal volatility estimates for securities in that category that are representative of the securities in that category that the Board-regulated institution has lent, sold subject to repurchase, posted as collateral, borrowed, purchased subject to resale, or taken as collateral. In determining relevant categories, the Board-regulated institution must at a minimum take into account:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The type of issuer of the security;</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The credit quality of the security;</P>

                <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) The interest rate sensitivity of the security.</P>
                <P>(C) With respect to debt securities that are not investment grade and equity securities, a Board-regulated institution must calculate a separate haircut for each individual security.</P>
                <P>(D) Where an exposure or collateral (whether in the form of cash or securities) is denominated in a currency that differs from the settlement currency, the Board-regulated institution must calculate a separate currency mismatch haircut for its net position in each mismatched currency based on estimated volatilities of foreign exchange rates between the mismatched currency and the settlement currency.</P>
                <P>(E) A Board-regulated institution's own estimates of market price and foreign exchange rate volatilities may not take into account the correlations among securities and foreign exchange rates on either the exposure or collateral side of a transaction (or netting set) or the correlations among securities and foreign exchange rates between the exposure and collateral sides of the transaction (or netting set).</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Simple VaR methodology.</E> With the prior written approval of the Board, a <PRTPAGE P="509"/>Board-regulated institution may estimate EAD for a netting set using a VaR model that meets the requirements in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. In such event, the Board-regulated institution must set EAD equal to max {0, [(ΣE − ΣC) + PFE]}, where:</P>
                <P>(i) ΣE equals the value of the exposure (the sum of the current fair values of all instruments, gold, and cash the Board-regulated institution has lent, sold subject to repurchase, or posted as collateral to the counterparty under the netting set);</P>

                <P>(iii) PFE (potential future exposure) equals the Board-regulated institution's empirically based best estimate of the 99th percentile, one-tailed confidence interval for an increase in the value of (ΣE − ΣC) over a five-business-day holding period for repo-style transactions, or over a ten-business-day holding period for eligible margin loans except for netting sets for which paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section applies using a minimum one-year historical observation period of price data representing the instruments that the Board-regulated institution has lent, sold subject to repurchase, posted as collateral, borrowed, purchased subject to resale, or taken as collateral. The Board-regulated institution must validate its VaR model by establishing and maintaining a rigorous and regular backtesting regime.</P>
                <P>(iv) If the number of trades in a netting set exceeds 5,000 at any time during a quarter, a Board-regulated institution must use a twenty-business-day holding period for the following quarter (except when a Board-regulated institution is calculating EAD for a cleared transaction under § 217.133). If a netting set contains one or more trades involving illiquid collateral, a Board-regulated institution must use a twenty-business-day holding period. If over the two previous quarters more than two margin disputes on a netting set have occurred that lasted more than the holding period, then the Board-regulated institution must set its PFE for that netting set equal to an estimate over a holding period that is at least two times the minimum holding period for that netting set.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">EAD for OTC derivative contracts</E>—(1) <E T="03">OTC derivative contracts not subject to a qualifying master netting agreement.</E> A Board-regulated institution must determine the EAD for an OTC derivative contract that is not subject to a qualifying master netting agreement using the current exposure methodology in paragraph (c)(5) of this section or using the internal models methodology described in paragraph (d) of this section. A Board-regulated institution may reduce the EAD calculated according to paragraph (c)(5) of this section by the credit valuation adjustment that the Board-regulated institution has recognized in its balance sheet valuation of any OTC derivative contracts in the netting set. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(1), the credit valuation adjustment does not include any adjustments to common equity tier 1 capital attributable to changes in the fair value of the Board-regulated institution's liabilities that are due to changes in its own credit risk since the inception of the transaction with the counterparty.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">OTC derivative contracts subject to a qualifying master netting agreement.</E> A Board-regulated institution must determine the EAD for multiple OTC derivative contracts that are subject to a qualifying master netting agreement using the current exposure methodology in paragraph (c)(6) of this section or using the internal models methodology described in paragraph (d) of this section. A Board-regulated institution may reduce the EAD calculated according to paragraph (c)(6) of this section by the credit valuation adjustment that the Board-regulated institution has recognized in its balance sheet valuation of any OTC derivative contracts in the netting set. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2), the credit valuation adjustment does not include any adjustments to common equity tier 1 capital attributable to changes in the fair value of the Board-regulated institution's liabilities that are due to changes in its own credit risk since the <PRTPAGE P="510"/>inception of the transaction with the counterparty.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Credit derivatives.</E> Notwithstanding paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section:</P>
                <P>(i) A Board-regulated institution that purchases a credit derivative that is recognized under § 217.134 or § 217.135 as a credit risk mitigant for an exposure that is not a covered position under subpart F of this part is not required to calculate a separate counterparty credit risk capital requirement under this section so long as the Board-regulated institution does so consistently for all such credit derivatives and either includes or excludes all such credit derivatives that are subject to a master netting agreement from any measure used to determine counterparty credit risk exposure to all relevant counterparties for risk-based capital purposes.</P>
                <P>(ii) A Board-regulated institution that is the protection provider in a credit derivative must treat the credit derivative as a wholesale exposure to the reference obligor and is not required to calculate a counterparty credit risk capital requirement for the credit derivative under this section, so long as it does so consistently for all such credit derivatives and either includes all or excludes all such credit derivatives that are subject to a master netting agreement from any measure used to determine counterparty credit risk exposure to all relevant counterparties for risk-based capital purposes (unless the Board-regulated institution is treating the credit derivative as a covered position under subpart F of this part, in which case the Board-regulated institution must calculate a supplemental counterparty credit risk capital requirement under this section).</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Equity derivatives.</E> A Board-regulated institution must treat an equity derivative contract as an equity exposure and compute a risk-weighted asset amount for the equity derivative contract under §§ 217.151-217.155 (unless the Board-regulated institution is treating the contract as a covered position under subpart F of this part). In addition, if the Board-regulated institution is treating the contract as a covered position under subpart F of this part, and under certain other circumstances described in § 217.155, the Board-regulated institution must also calculate a risk-based capital requirement for the counterparty credit risk of an equity derivative contract under this section.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Single OTC derivative contract.</E> Except as modified by paragraph (c)(7) of this section, the EAD for a single OTC derivative contract that is not subject to a qualifying master netting agreement is equal to the sum of the Board-regulated institution's current credit exposure and potential future credit exposure (PFE) on the derivative contract.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Current credit exposure.</E> The current credit exposure for a single OTC derivative contract is the greater of the mark-to-fair value of the derivative contract or zero; and</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">PFE.</E> The PFE for a single OTC derivative contract, including an OTC derivative contract with a negative mark-to-fair value, is calculated by multiplying the notional principal amount of the derivative contract by the appropriate conversion factor in Table 2 to § 217.132. For purposes of calculating either the PFE under paragraph (c)(5) of this section or the gross PFE under paragraph (c)(6) of this section for exchange rate contracts and other similar contracts in which the notional principal amount is equivalent to the cash flows, the notional principal amount is the net receipts to each party falling due on each value date in each currency. For any OTC derivative contract that does not fall within one of the specified categories in Table 2 to § 217.132, the PFE must be calculated using the “other” conversion factors. A Board-regulated institution must use an OTC derivative contract's effective notional principal amount (that is, its apparent or stated notional principal amount multiplied by any multiplier in the OTC derivative contract) rather than its apparent or stated notional principal amount in calculating PFE. PFE of the protection provider of a credit derivative is capped at the net present value of the amount of unpaid premiums.<PRTPAGE P="511"/>

                <P>(ii) A Board-regulated institution that uses the internal models methodology for a particular transaction type (derivative contracts, eligible margin loans, or repo-style transactions) must use the internal models methodology for all transactions of that transaction type. A Board-regulated institution may choose to use the internal models methodology for one or two of these three types of exposures and not the other types.</P>
                <P>(iii) A Board-regulated institution may also use the internal models methodology for derivative contracts, eligible margin loans, and repo-style transactions subject to a qualifying cross-product netting agreement if:</P>

                <P>(iv) A Board-regulated institution that uses the internal models methodology for a transaction type must receive approval from the Board to cease using the methodology for that transaction type or to make a material change to its internal model.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Risk-weighted assets using IMM.</E> Under the IMM, a Board-regulated institution uses an internal model to estimate the expected exposure (EE) for a netting set and then calculates EAD based on that EE. A Board-regulated institution must calculate two EEs and two EADs (one stressed and one unstressed) for each netting set as follows:</P>
                <P>(i) EAD<E T="52">unstressed</E> is calculated using an EE estimate based on the most recent data meeting the requirements of paragraph (d)(3)(vii) of this section;</P>

                <P>(vi) If a Board-regulated institution hedges some or all of the counterparty credit risk associated with a netting set using an eligible credit derivative, the Board-regulated institution may take the reduction in exposure to the counterparty into account when estimating EE. If the Board-regulated institution recognizes this reduction in exposure to the counterparty in its estimate of EE, it must also use its internal model to estimate a separate EAD for the Board-regulated institution's exposure to the protection provider of the credit derivative.</P>

                <P>(i) The model must have the systems capability to estimate the expected exposure to the counterparty on a daily basis (but is not expected to estimate or report expected exposure on a daily basis);</P>
                <P>(ii) The model must estimate expected exposure at enough future dates to reflect accurately all the future cash flows of contracts in the netting set;</P>
                <P>(iii) The model must account for the possible non-normality of the exposure distribution, where appropriate;</P>

                <P>(iv) The Board-regulated institution must measure, monitor, and control current counterparty exposure and the exposure to the counterparty over the <PRTPAGE P="514"/>whole life of all contracts in the netting set;</P>
                <P>(v) The Board-regulated institution must be able to measure and manage current exposures gross and net of collateral held, where appropriate. The Board-regulated institution must estimate expected exposures for OTC derivative contracts both with and without the effect of collateral agreements;</P>
                <P>(vi) The Board-regulated institution must have procedures to identify, monitor, and control wrong-way risk throughout the life of an exposure. The procedures must include stress testing and scenario analysis;</P>
                <P>(vii) The model must use current market data to compute current exposures. The Board-regulated institution must estimate model parameters using historical data from the most recent three-year period and update the data quarterly or more frequently if market conditions warrant. The Board-regulated institution should consider using model parameters based on forward-looking measures, where appropriate;</P>
                <P>(viii) When estimating model parameters based on a stress period, the Board-regulated institution must use at least three years of historical data that include a period of stress to the credit default spreads of the Board-regulated institution's counterparties. The Board-regulated institution must review the data set and update the data as necessary, particularly for any material changes in its counterparties. The Board-regulated institution must demonstrate, at least quarterly, and maintain documentation of such demonstration, that the stress period coincides with increased CDS or other credit spreads of the Board-regulated institution's counterparties. The Board-regulated institution must have procedures to evaluate the effectiveness of its stress calibration that include a process for using benchmark portfolios that are vulnerable to the same risk factors as the Board-regulated institution's portfolio. The Board may require the Board-regulated institution to modify its stress calibration to better reflect actual historic losses of the portfolio;</P>
                <P>(ix) A Board-regulated institution must subject its internal model to an initial validation and annual model review process. The model review should consider whether the inputs and risk factors, as well as the model outputs, are appropriate. As part of the model review process, the Board-regulated institution must have a backtesting program for its model that includes a process by which unacceptable model performance will be determined and remedied;</P>
                <P>(x) A Board-regulated institution must have policies for the measurement, management and control of collateral and margin amounts; and</P>
                <P>(xi) A Board-regulated institution must have a comprehensive stress testing program that captures all credit exposures to counterparties, and incorporates stress testing of principal market risk factors and creditworthiness of counterparties.</P>

                <P>(ii) If the remaining maturity of the exposure or the longest-dated contract in the netting set is one year or less, the Board-regulated institution must set M for the exposure or netting set equal to one year, except as provided in § 217.131(d)(7).</P>
                <P>(iii) Alternatively, a Board-regulated institution that uses an internal model to calculate a one-sided credit valuation adjustment may use the effective credit duration estimated by the model as M(EPE) in place of the formula in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Effects of collateral agreements on EAD.</E> A Board-regulated institution may capture the effect on EAD of a collateral agreement that requires receipt of collateral when exposure to the counterparty increases, but may not capture the effect on EAD of a collateral agreement that requires receipt of collateral when counterparty credit quality deteriorates. Two methods are available to capture the effect of a collateral agreement, as set forth in paragraphs (d)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section:</P>
                <P>(i) With prior written approval from the Board, a Board-regulated institution may include the effect of a collateral agreement within its internal model used to calculate EAD. The Board-regulated institution may set EAD equal to the expected exposure at the end of the margin period of risk. The margin period of risk means, with respect to a netting set subject to a collateral agreement, the time period from the most recent exchange of collateral with a counterparty until the next required exchange of collateral, plus the period of time required to sell and realize the proceeds of the least liquid collateral that can be delivered under the terms of the collateral agreement and, where applicable, the period of time required to re-hedge the resulting market risk upon the default of the counterparty. The minimum margin period of risk is set according to paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section; or</P>
                <P>(ii) As an alternative to paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section, a Board-regulated institution that can model EPE without collateral agreements but cannot achieve the higher level of modeling sophistication to model EPE with collateral agreements can set effective EPE for a collateralized netting set equal to the lesser of:</P>
                <P>(A) An add-on that reflects the potential increase in exposure of the netting set over the margin period of risk, plus the larger of:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The current exposure of the netting set reflecting all collateral held or posted by the Board-regulated institution excluding any collateral called or in dispute; or</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The largest net exposure including all collateral held or posted under the margin agreement that would not trigger a collateral call. For purposes of this section, the add-on is computed as the expected increase in the netting set's exposure over the margin period of risk (set in accordance with paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section); or</P>
                <P>(B) Effective EPE without a collateral agreement plus any collateral the Board-regulated institution posts to the counterparty that exceeds the required margin amount.</P>

                <P>(iii) For purposes of this part, including paragraphs (d)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section, the margin period of risk for a <PRTPAGE P="516"/>netting set subject to a collateral agreement is:</P>
                <P>(A) Five business days for repo-style transactions subject to daily remargining and daily marking-to-market, and ten business days for other transactions when liquid financial collateral is posted under a daily margin maintenance requirement, or</P>
                <P>(B) Twenty business days if the number of trades in a netting set exceeds 5,000 at any time during the previous quarter (except if the Board-regulated institution is calculating EAD for a cleared transaction under § 217.133) or contains one or more trades involving illiquid collateral or any derivative contract that cannot be easily replaced. If over the two previous quarters more than two margin disputes on a netting set have occurred that lasted more than the margin period of risk, then the Board-regulated institution must use a margin period of risk for that netting set that is at least two times the minimum margin period of risk for that netting set. If the periodicity of the receipt of collateral is N-days, the minimum margin period of risk is the minimum margin period of risk under this paragraph (d) plus N minus 1. This period should be extended to cover any impediments to prompt re-hedging of any market risk.</P>
                <P>(C) Five business days for an OTC derivative contract or netting set of OTC derivative contracts where the Board-regulated institution is either acting as a financial intermediary and enters into an offsetting transaction with a CCP or where the Board-regulated institution provides a guarantee to the CCP on the performance of the client. A Board-regulated institution must use a longer holding period if the Board-regulated institution determines that a longer period is appropriate. Additionally, the Board may require the Board-regulated institution to set a longer holding period if the Board determines that a longer period is appropriate due to the nature, structure, or characteristics of the transaction or is commensurate with the risks associated with the transaction.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">Own estimate of alpha.</E> With prior written approval of the Board, a Board-regulated institution may calculate alpha as the ratio of economic capital from a full simulation of counterparty exposure across counterparties that incorporates a joint simulation of market and credit risk factors (numerator) and economic capital based on EPE (denominator), subject to a floor of 1.2. For purposes of this calculation, economic capital is the unexpected losses for all counterparty credit risks measured at a 99.9 percent confidence level over a one-year horizon. To receive approval, the Board-regulated institution must meet the following minimum standards to the satisfaction of the Board:</P>
                <P>(i) The Board-regulated institution's own estimate of alpha must capture in the numerator the effects of:</P>
                <P>(A) The material sources of stochastic dependency of distributions of fair values of transactions or portfolios of transactions across counterparties;</P>
                <P>(B) Volatilities and correlations of market risk factors used in the joint simulation, which must be related to the credit risk factor used in the simulation to reflect potential increases in volatility or correlation in an economic downturn, where appropriate; and</P>
                <P>(C) The granularity of exposures (that is, the effect of a concentration in the proportion of each counterparty's exposure that is driven by a particular risk factor).</P>
                <P>(ii) The Board-regulated institution must assess the potential model uncertainty in its estimates of alpha.</P>
                <P>(iii) The Board-regulated institution must calculate the numerator and denominator of alpha in a consistent fashion with respect to modeling methodology, parameter specifications, and portfolio composition.</P>
                <P>(iv) The Board-regulated institution must review and adjust as appropriate its estimates of the numerator and denominator of alpha on at least a quarterly basis and more frequently when the composition of the portfolio varies over time.</P>
                <P>(7) <E T="03">Risk-based capital requirements for transactions with specific wrong-way risk.</E> A Board-regulated institution must determine if a repo-style transaction, eligible margin loan, bond option, or equity derivative contract or purchased credit derivative to which the Board-<PRTPAGE P="517"/>regulated institution applies the internal models methodology under this paragraph (d) has specific wrong-way risk. If a transaction has specific wrong-way risk, the Board-regulated institution must treat the transaction as its own netting set and exclude it from the model described in § 217.132(d)(2) and instead calculate the risk-based capital requirement for the transaction as follows:</P>
                <P>(i) For an equity derivative contract, by multiplying:</P>
                <P>(A) K, calculated using the appropriate risk-based capital formula specified in Table 1 of § 217.131 using the PD of the counterparty and LGD equal to 100 percent, by</P>
                <P>(B) The maximum amount the Board-regulated institution could lose on the equity derivative.</P>
                <P>(ii) For a purchased credit derivative by multiplying:</P>
                <P>(A) K, calculated using the appropriate risk-based capital formula specified in Table 1 of § 217.131 using the PD of the counterparty and LGD equal to 100 percent, by</P>
                <P>(B) The fair value of the reference asset of the credit derivative.</P>
                <P>(iii) For a bond option, by multiplying:</P>
                <P>(A) K, calculated using the appropriate risk-based capital formula specified in Table 1 of § 217.131 using the PD of the counterparty and LGD equal to 100 percent, by</P>
                <P>(B) The smaller of the notional amount of the underlying reference asset and the maximum potential loss under the bond option contract.</P>
                <P>(iv) For a repo-style transaction or eligible margin loan by multiplying:</P>
                <P>(A) K, calculated using the appropriate risk-based capital formula specified in Table 1 of § 217.131 using the PD of the counterparty and LGD equal to 100 percent, by</P>

                <P>(8) <E T="03">Risk-weighted asset amount for IMM exposures with specific wrong-way risk.</E> The aggregate risk-weighted asset amount for IMM exposures with specific wrong-way risk is the sum of a Board-regulated institution's risk-based capital requirement for purchased credit derivatives that are not bond options with specific wrong-way risk as calculated under paragraph (d)(7)(ii) of this section, a Board-regulated institution's risk-based capital requirement for equity derivatives with specific wrong-way risk as calculated under paragraph (d)(7)(i) of this section, a Board-regulated institution's risk-based capital requirement for bond options with specific wrong-way risk as calculated under paragraph (d)(7)(iii) of this section, and a Board-regulated institution's risk-based capital requirement for repo-style transactions and eligible margin loans with specific wrong-way risk as calculated under paragraph (d)(7)(iv) of this section, multiplied by 12.5.</P>
                <P>(9) <E T="03">Risk-weighted assets for IMM exposures.</E> (i) The Board-regulated institution must insert the assigned risk parameters for each counterparty and netting set into the appropriate formula specified in Table 1 of § 217.131 and multiply the output of the formula by the EAD<E T="52">unstressed</E> of the netting set to obtain the unstressed capital requirement for each netting set. A Board-regulated institution that uses an advanced CVA approach that captures migrations in credit spreads under paragraph (e)(3) of this section must set the maturity adjustment (b) in the formula equal to zero. The sum of the unstressed capital requirement calculated for each netting set equals K<E T="52">unstressed</E>.</P>

                <P>(ii) The Board-regulated institution must insert the assigned risk parameters for each wholesale obligor and netting set into the appropriate formula specified in Table 1 of § 217.131 and multiply the output of the formula by the EAD<E T="52">stressed</E> of the netting set to obtain the stressed capital requirement for each netting set. A Board-regulated institution that uses an advanced CVA approach that captures migrations in credit spreads under paragraph (e)(6) of this section must set the maturity adjustment (b) in the formula equal to zero. The sum of the stressed capital requirement calculated for each netting set equals K<E T="52">stressed</E>.<PRTPAGE P="518"/>

A Board-regulated institution's risk-weighted assets amount for IMM exposures is equal to the capital requirement multiplied by 12.5, plus risk-weighted assets for IMM exposures with specific wrong-way risk in paragraph (d)(8) of this section and those in paragraph (d)(10) of this section.</P>
                <P>(10) <E T="03">Other measures of counterparty exposure.</E> (i) With prior written approval of the Board, a Board-regulated institution may set EAD equal to a measure of counterparty credit risk exposure, such as peak EAD, that is more conservative than an alpha of 1.4 (or higher under the terms of paragraph (d)(7)(iv)(C) of this section) times the larger of EPE<E T="52">unstressed</E> and EPE<E T="52">stressed</E> for every counterparty whose EAD will be measured under the alternative measure of counterparty exposure. The Board-regulated institution must demonstrate the conservatism of the measure of counterparty credit risk exposure used for EAD. With respect to paragraph (d)(10)(i) of this section:</P>
                <P>(A) For material portfolios of new OTC derivative products, the Board-regulated institution may assume that the current exposure methodology in paragraphs (c)(5) and (c)(6) of this section meets the conservatism requirement of this section for a period not to exceed 180 days.</P>
                <P>(B) For immaterial portfolios of OTC derivative contracts, the Board-regulated institution generally may assume that the current exposure methodology in paragraphs (c)(5) and (c)(6) of this section meets the conservatism requirement of this section.</P>
                <P>(ii) To calculate risk-weighted assets for purposes of the approach in paragraph (d)(10)(i) of this section, the Board-regulated institution must insert the assigned risk parameters for each counterparty and netting set into the appropriate formula specified in Table 1 of § 217.131, multiply the output of the formula by the EAD for the exposure as specified above, and multiply by 12.5.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Scope.</E> (1) This section applies to wholesale exposures for which:</P>
                <P>(i) Credit risk is fully covered by an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative; or</P>
                <P>(ii) Credit risk is covered on a pro rata basis (that is, on a basis in which the Board-regulated institution and the protection provider share losses proportionately) by an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative.</P>
                <P>(2) Wholesale exposures on which there is a tranching of credit risk (reflecting at least two different levels of seniority) are securitization exposures subject to § 217.141 through § 217.145.</P>
                <P>(3) A Board-regulated institution may elect to recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative covering an exposure described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section by using the PD substitution approach or the LGD adjustment approach in paragraph (c) of this section or, if the transaction qualifies, using the double default treatment in § 217.135. A Board-regulated institution's PD and LGD for the hedged exposure may not be lower than the PD and LGD floors described in § 217.131(d)(2) and (d)(3).</P>
                <P>(4) If multiple eligible guarantees or eligible credit derivatives cover a single exposure described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a Board-regulated institution may treat the hedged exposure as multiple separate exposures each covered by a single eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative and may calculate a separate risk-based capital requirement for each separate exposure as described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</P>
                <P>(5) If a single eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative covers multiple hedged wholesale exposures described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a Board-regulated institution must treat each hedged exposure as covered by a separate eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative and must calculate a separate risk-based capital requirement for each exposure as described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</P>
                <P>(6) A Board-regulated institution must use the same risk parameters for calculating ECL as it uses for calculating the risk-based capital requirement for the exposure.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Rules of recognition.</E> (1) A Board-regulated institution may only recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of eligible guarantees and eligible credit derivatives.</P>
                <P>(2) A Board-regulated institution may only recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of an eligible credit derivative to hedge an exposure that is different from the credit derivative's reference exposure used for determining the derivative's cash settlement value, deliverable obligation, or occurrence of a credit event if:</P>
                <P>(i) The reference exposure ranks <E T="03">pari passu</E> (that is, equally) with or is junior to the hedged exposure; and</P>

                <P>(ii) The reference exposure and the hedged exposure are exposures to the same legal entity, and legally enforceable cross-default or cross-acceleration <PRTPAGE P="529"/>clauses are in place to assure payments under the credit derivative are triggered when the obligor fails to pay under the terms of the hedged exposure.</P>

If the Board-regulated institution determines that full substitution of the protection provider's PD leads to an inappropriate degree of risk mitigation, the Board-regulated institution may substitute a higher PD than that of the protection provider.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Partial coverage.</E> If an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative meets the conditions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and P of the guarantee or credit derivative is less than the EAD of the hedged exposure, the Board-regulated institution must treat the hedged exposure as two separate exposures (protected and unprotected) in order to recognize the credit risk mitigation benefit of the guarantee or credit derivative.</P>
                <P>(A) The Board-regulated institution must calculate its risk-based capital requirement for the protected exposure under § 217.131, where PD is the protection provider's PD, LGD is determined under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, and EAD is P. If the Board-regulated institution determines that full substitution leads to an inappropriate degree of risk mitigation, the Board-regulated institution may use a higher PD than that of the protection provider.</P>
                <P>(B) The Board-regulated institution must calculate its risk-based capital requirement for the unprotected exposure under § 217.131, where PD is the obligor's PD, LGD is the hedged exposure's LGD (not adjusted to reflect the guarantee or credit derivative), and EAD is the EAD of the original hedged exposure minus P.</P>
                <P>(C) The treatment in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section is applicable when the credit risk of a wholesale exposure is covered on a partial pro rata basis or when an adjustment is made to the effective notional amount of the guarantee or credit derivative under paragraphs (d), (e), or (f) of this section.</P>

                <P>(B) The LGD of the guarantee or credit derivative, if the guarantee or credit derivative does not provide the Board-regulated institution with the option to receive immediate payout upon triggering the protection.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">LGD adjustment approach.</E> (i) <E T="03">Full coverage.</E> If an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative meets the conditions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and the protection amount (P) of the guarantee or credit derivative is greater than or equal to the EAD of the hedged exposure, the Board-regulated institution's risk-based capital requirement for the hedged exposure is the greater of:</P>
                <P>(A) The risk-based capital requirement for the exposure as calculated under § 217.131, with the LGD of the exposure adjusted to reflect the guarantee or credit derivative; or</P>

                <P>(B) The risk-based capital requirement for a direct exposure to the protection provider as calculated under § 217.131, using the PD for the protection provider, the LGD for the guarantee or credit derivative, and an EAD <PRTPAGE P="530"/>equal to the EAD of the hedged exposure.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Partial coverage.</E> If an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative meets the conditions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and the protection amount (P) of the guarantee or credit derivative is less than the EAD of the hedged exposure, the Board-regulated institution must treat the hedged exposure as two separate exposures (protected and unprotected) in order to recognize the credit risk mitigation benefit of the guarantee or credit derivative.</P>
                <P>(A) The Board-regulated institution's risk-based capital requirement for the protected exposure would be the greater of:</P>
                <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The risk-based capital requirement for the protected exposure as calculated under § 217.131, with the LGD of the exposure adjusted to reflect the guarantee or credit derivative and EAD set equal to P; or</P>

                <P>(B) The Board-regulated institution must calculate its risk-based capital requirement for the unprotected exposure under § 217.131, where PD is the obligor's PD, LGD is the hedged exposure's LGD (not adjusted to reflect the guarantee or credit derivative), and EAD is the EAD of the original hedged exposure minus P.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">M of hedged exposures.</E> For purposes of this paragraph (c), the M of the hedged exposure is the same as the M of the exposure if it were unhedged.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Maturity mismatch.</E> (1) A Board-regulated institution that recognizes an eligible guarantee or eligible credit derivative in determining its risk-based capital requirement for a hedged exposure must adjust the effective notional amount of the credit risk mitigant to reflect any maturity mismatch between the hedged exposure and the credit risk mitigant.</P>
                <P>(2) A maturity mismatch occurs when the residual maturity of a credit risk mitigant is less than that of the hedged exposure(s).</P>
                <P>(3) The residual maturity of a hedged exposure is the longest possible remaining time before the obligor is scheduled to fulfil its obligation on the exposure. If a credit risk mitigant has embedded options that may reduce its term, the Board-regulated institution (protection purchaser) must use the shortest possible residual maturity for the credit risk mitigant. If a call is at the discretion of the protection provider, the residual maturity of the credit risk mitigant is at the first call date. If the call is at the discretion of the Board-regulated institution (protection purchaser), but the terms of the arrangement at origination of the credit risk mitigant contain a positive incentive for the Board-regulated institution to call the transaction before contractual maturity, the remaining time to the first call date is the residual maturity of the credit risk mitigant.<SU>30</SU>

                </FTNT>
                <P>(4) A credit risk mitigant with a maturity mismatch may be recognized only if its original maturity is greater than or equal to one year and its residual maturity is greater than three months.</P>

                <P>(5) When a maturity mismatch exists, the Board-regulated institution must apply the following adjustment to the effective notional amount of the credit risk mitigant:

                <P>(1) The hedged exposure is fully covered or covered on a pro rata basis by:</P>
                <P>(i) An eligible guarantee issued by an eligible double default guarantor; or</P>
                <P>(ii) An eligible credit derivative that meets the requirements of § 217.134(b)(2) and that is issued by an eligible double default guarantor.</P>
                <P>(2) The guarantee or credit derivative is:</P>
                <P>(i) An uncollateralized guarantee or uncollateralized credit derivative (for example, a credit default swap) that provides protection with respect to a single reference obligor; or</P>
                <P>(ii) An n<SU>th</SU>-to-default credit derivative (subject to the requirements of § 217.142(m).</P>
                <P>(3) The hedged exposure is a wholesale exposure (other than a sovereign exposure).</P>
                <P>(4) The obligor of the hedged exposure is not:</P>
                <P>(i) An eligible double default guarantor or an affiliate of an eligible double default guarantor; or</P>
                <P>(ii) An affiliate of the guarantor.</P>

                <P>(5) The Board-regulated institution does not recognize any credit risk mitigation benefits of the guarantee or credit derivative for the hedged exposure other than through application of <PRTPAGE P="532"/>the double default treatment as provided in this section.</P>
                <P>(6) The Board-regulated institution has implemented a process (which has received the prior, written approval of the Board) to detect excessive correlation between the creditworthiness of the obligor of the hedged exposure and the protection provider. If excessive correlation is present, the Board-regulated institution may not use the double default treatment for the hedged exposure.</P>

                <P>(c) <E T="03">Partial coverage.</E> If a transaction meets the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section and the protection amount (P) of the guarantee or credit derivative is less than the EAD of the hedged exposure, the Board-regulated institution must treat the hedged exposure as two separate exposures (protected and unprotected) in order to recognize double default treatment on the protected portion of the exposure:</P>
                <P>(1) For the protected exposure, the Board-regulated institution must set EAD equal to P and calculate its risk-weighted asset amount as provided in paragraph (e) of this section; and</P>
                <P>(2) For the unprotected exposure, the Board-regulated institution must set EAD equal to the EAD of the original exposure minus P and then calculate its risk-weighted asset amount as provided in § 217.131.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Mismatches.</E> For any hedged exposure to which a Board-regulated institution applies double default treatment under this part, the Board-regulated institution must make applicable adjustments to the protection amount as required in § 217.134(d), (e), and (f).</P>

                <P>(1) Delivery-versus-payment (DvP) transaction means a securities or commodities transaction in which the buyer is obligated to make payment only if the seller has made delivery of the securities or commodities and the seller is obligated to deliver the securities or commodities only if the buyer has made payment.</P>
                <P>(2) Payment-versus-payment (PvP) transaction means a foreign exchange transaction in which each counterparty is obligated to make a final transfer of one or more currencies only if the other counterparty has made a final transfer of one or more currencies.</P>
                <P>(3) A transaction has a normal settlement period if the contractual settlement period for the transaction is equal to or less than the market standard for the instrument underlying the transaction and equal to or less than five business days.</P>
                <P>(4) The positive current exposure of a Board-regulated institution for a transaction is the difference between the transaction value at the agreed settlement price and the current market price of the transaction, if the difference results in a credit exposure of the Board-regulated institution to the counterparty.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Scope.</E> This section applies to all transactions involving securities, foreign exchange instruments, and commodities that have a risk of delayed settlement or delivery. This section does not apply to:</P>
                <P>(1) Cleared transactions that are subject to daily marking-to-market and daily receipt and payment of variation margin;</P>
                <P>(2) Repo-style transactions, including unsettled repo-style transactions (which are addressed in §§ 217.131 and 132);</P>
                <P>(3) One-way cash payments on OTC derivative contracts (which are addressed in §§ 217. 131 and 132); or</P>
                <P>(4) Transactions with a contractual settlement period that is longer than the normal settlement period (which are treated as OTC derivative contracts and addressed in §§ 217.131 and 132).</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">System-wide failures.</E> In the case of a system-wide failure of a settlement or clearing system, or a central counterparty, the Board may waive risk-based capital requirements for unsettled and failed transactions until the situation is rectified.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Delivery-versus-payment (DvP) and payment-versus-payment (PvP) transactions.</E> A Board-regulated institution must hold risk-based capital against any DvP or PvP transaction with a normal settlement period if the Board-regulated institution's counterparty has not made delivery or payment within five business days after the settlement date. The Board-regulated institution must determine its risk-weighted asset amount for such a transaction by multiplying the positive current exposure of the transaction for the Board-regulated institution by the appropriate risk weight in Table 1 to § 217.136.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Operational criteria for traditional securitizations.</E> A Board-regulated institution that transfers exposures it has originated or purchased to a securitization SPE or other third party in connection with a traditional securitization may exclude the exposures from the calculation of its risk-weighted assets only if each of the conditions in this paragraph (a) is satisfied. A Board-regulated institution that meets these conditions must hold risk-based capital against any securitization exposures it retains in connection with the securitization. A Board-regulated institution that fails to meet these conditions must hold risk-based capital against the transferred exposures as if they had not been securitized and must deduct from common equity tier 1 capital any after-tax gain-on-sale resulting from the transaction. The conditions are:</P>
                <P>(1) The exposures are not reported on the Board-regulated institution's consolidated balance sheet under GAAP;</P>
                <P>(2) The Board-regulated institution has transferred to one or more third parties credit risk associated with the underlying exposures;</P>
                <P>(3) Any clean-up calls relating to the securitization are eligible clean-up calls; and</P>
                <P>(4) The securitization does not:</P>
                <P>(i) Include one or more underlying exposures in which the borrower is permitted to vary the drawn amount within an agreed limit under a line of credit; and</P>

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Operational criteria for synthetic securitizations.</E> For synthetic securitizations, a Board-regulated institution may recognize for risk-based capital purposes under this subpart the use of a credit risk mitigant to hedge underlying exposures only if each of the conditions in this paragraph (b) is satisfied. A Board-regulated institution that meets these conditions must hold risk-based capital against any credit risk of the exposures it retains in connection with the synthetic securitization. A Board-regulated institution that fails to meet these conditions or chooses not to recognize the credit risk mitigant for purposes of this section must hold risk-based capital under this subpart against the underlying exposures as if they had not been synthetically securitized. The conditions are:</P>
                <P>(1) The credit risk mitigant is:</P>
                <P>(i) Financial collateral; or</P>
                <P>(ii) A guarantee that meets all of the requirements of an eligible guarantee in § 217.2 except for paragraph (3) of the definition; or</P>

                <P>(ii) Require the Board-regulated institution to alter or replace the underlying exposures to improve the credit quality of the underlying exposures;</P>
                <P>(iii) Increase the Board-regulated institution's cost of credit protection in response to deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying exposures;</P>
                <P>(iv) Increase the yield payable to parties other than the Board-regulated institution in response to a deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying exposures; or</P>
                <P>(v) Provide for increases in a retained first loss position or credit enhancement provided by the Board-regulated institution after the inception of the securitization;</P>
                <P>(3) The Board-regulated institution obtains a well-reasoned opinion from legal counsel that confirms the enforceability of the credit risk mitigant in all relevant jurisdictions; and</P>

The Board-regulated institution's analysis must be commensurate with the complexity of the securitization exposure and the materiality of the position in relation to regulatory capital according to this part.</P>
                <P>(2) A Board-regulated institution must demonstrate its comprehensive understanding of a securitization exposure under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, for each securitization exposure by:</P>
                <P>(i) Conducting an analysis of the risk characteristics of a securitization exposure prior to acquiring the exposure and document such analysis within three business days after acquiring the exposure, considering:</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">General requirements for the SSFA.</E> To use the SSFA to determine the risk weight for a securitization exposure, a Board-regulated institution must have data that enables it to assign accurately the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section. Data used to assign the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section must be the most currently available data; if the contracts governing the underlying exposures of the securitization require payments on a monthly or quarterly basis, the data used to assign the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section must be no more than 91 calendar days old. A Board-regulated institution that does not have the appropriate data to assign the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section must assign a risk weight of 1,250 percent to the exposure.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">SSFA parameters.</E> To calculate the risk weight for a securitization exposure using the SSFA, a Board-regulated institution must have accurate information on the following five inputs to the SSFA calculation:</P>
                <P>(1) K<E T="52">G</E> is the weighted-average (with unpaid principal used as the weight for each exposure) total capital requirement of the underlying exposures calculated using subpart D of this part. K<E T="52">G</E> is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one (that is, an average risk weight of 100 percent represents a value of K<E T="52">G</E> equal to 0.08).</P>
                <P>(2) Parameter W is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one. Parameter W is the ratio of the sum of the dollar amounts of any underlying exposures of the securitization that meet any of the criteria as set forth in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (vi) of this section to the balance, measured in dollars, of underlying exposures:</P>
                <P>(i) Ninety days or more past due;</P>
                <P>(ii) Subject to a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding;</P>
                <P>(iii) In the process of foreclosure;</P>
                <P>(iv) Held as real estate owned;</P>

                <P>(v) Has contractually deferred payments for 90 days or more, other than <PRTPAGE P="544"/>principal or interest payments deferred on:</P>
                <P>(A) Federally-guaranteed student loans, in accordance with the terms of those guarantee programs; or</P>
                <P>(B) Consumer loans, including non-federally-guaranteed student loans, provided that such payments are deferred pursuant to provisions included in the contract at the time funds are disbursed that provide for period(s) of deferral that are not initiated based on changes in the creditworthiness of the borrower; or</P>
                <P>(vi) Is in default.</P>
                <P>(3) Parameter A is the attachment point for the exposure, which represents the threshold at which credit losses will first be allocated to the exposure. Except as provided in section 142(l) for n<SU>th</SU>-to-default credit derivatives, parameter A equals the ratio of the current dollar amount of underlying exposures that are subordinated to the exposure of the Board-regulated institution to the current dollar amount of underlying exposures. Any reserve account funded by the accumulated cash flows from the underlying exposures that is subordinated to the Board-regulated institution's securitization exposure may be included in the calculation of parameter A to the extent that cash is present in the account. Parameter A is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one.</P>

                <P>(4) Parameter D is the detachment point for the exposure, which represents the threshold at which credit losses of principal allocated to the exposure would result in a total loss of principal. Except as provided in section 142(l) for n<SU>th</SU>-to-default credit derivatives, parameter D equals parameter A plus the ratio of the current dollar amount of the securitization exposures that are <E T="03">pari passu</E> with the exposure (that is, have equal seniority with respect to credit risk) to the current dollar amount of the underlying exposures. Parameter D is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one.</P>
                <P>(5) A supervisory calibration parameter, p, is equal to 0.5 for securitization exposures that are not resecuritization exposures and equal to 1.5 for resecuritization exposures.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Mechanics of the SSFA.</E> K<E T="52">G</E> and W are used to calculate K<E T="52">A</E>, the augmented value of K<E T="52">G</E>, which reflects the observed credit quality of the underlying exposures. K<E T="52">A</E> is defined in paragraph (d) of this section. The values of parameters A and D, relative to K<E T="52">A</E> determine the risk weight assigned to a securitization exposure as described in paragraph (d) of this section. The risk weight assigned to a securitization exposure, or portion of a securitization exposure, as appropriate, is the larger of the risk weight determined in accordance with this paragraph (c), paragraph (d) of this section, and a risk weight of 20 percent.</P>

                <P>(1) When the detachment point, parameter D, for a securitization exposure is less than or equal to K<E T="52">A</E>, the exposure must be assigned a risk weight of 1,250 percent;</P>

                <P>(2) When the attachment point, parameter A, for a securitization exposure is greater than or equal to K<E T="52">A</E>, the Board-regulated institution must calculate the risk weight in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section;</P>
                <P>(3) When A is less than K<E T="52">A</E> and D is greater than K<E T="52">A</E>, the risk weight is a weighted-average of 1,250 percent and 1,250 percent times K<E T="52">SSFA</E> calculated in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.

                <P>(A) To compute the aggregate adjusted carrying value of a Board-regulated institution's equity exposures for purposes of this section, the Board-regulated institution may exclude equity exposures described in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3)(i), and (b)(3)(ii) of this section, the equity exposure in a hedge pair with the smaller adjusted carrying value, and a proportion of each equity exposure to an investment fund equal to the proportion of the assets of the investment fund that are not equity exposures or that meet the criterion of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. If a Board-regulated institution does not know the actual holdings of the investment fund, the Board-regulated institution may calculate the proportion of the assets of the fund that are not equity exposures based on the terms of the prospectus, partnership agreement, or similar contract that defines the fund's permissible investments. If the sum of the investment limits for all exposure classes within the fund exceeds 100 percent, the Board-regulated institution must assume for purposes of this section that the investment fund invests to the maximum extent possible in equity exposures.</P>
                <P>(B) When determining which of a Board-regulated institution's equity exposures qualifies for a 100 percent risk weight under this section, a Board-regulated institution first must include equity exposures to unconsolidated small business investment companies or held through consolidated small business investment companies described in section 302 of the Small Business Investment Act, then must include publicly traded equity exposures (including those held indirectly through investment funds), and then must include non-publicly traded equity exposures (including those held indirectly through investment funds).</P>

                <P>(2) <E T="03">Effective hedge.</E> Two equity exposures form an effective hedge if the exposures either have the same remaining maturity or each has a remaining maturity of at least three months; the hedge relationship is formally documented in a prospective manner (that is, before the Board-regulated institution acquires at least one of the equity exposures); the documentation specifies the measure of effectiveness (E) the Board-regulated institution will use for the hedge relationship throughout the life of the transaction; and the hedge relationship has an E greater than or equal to 0.8. A Board-regulated institution must measure E at least quarterly and must use one of three alternative measures of E:</P>

                <P>(i) Under the dollar-offset method of measuring effectiveness, the Board-regulated institution must determine the ratio of value change (RVC). The RVC is the ratio of the cumulative sum of the periodic changes in value of one equity exposure to the cumulative sum of <PRTPAGE P="550"/>the periodic changes in the value of the other equity exposure. If RVC is positive, the hedge is not effective and E equals zero. If RVC is negative and greater than or equal to −1 (that is, between zero and −1), then E equals the absolute value of RVC. If RVC is negative and less than −1, then E equals 2 plus RVC.</P>

To receive such approval, the Board-regulated institution must demonstrate to the Board's satisfaction that the Board-regulated institution meets the following criteria:</P>
                <P>(1) The Board-regulated institution must have one or more models that:</P>
                <P>(i) Assess the potential decline in value of its modeled equity exposures;</P>
                <P>(ii) Are commensurate with the size, complexity, and composition of the Board-regulated institution's modeled equity exposures; and</P>
                <P>(iii) Adequately capture both general market risk and idiosyncratic risk.</P>

                <P>(2) The Board-regulated institution's model must produce an estimate of potential losses for its modeled equity exposures that is no less than the estimate of potential losses produced by a VaR methodology employing a 99th <PRTPAGE P="551"/>percentile one-tailed confidence interval of the distribution of quarterly returns for a benchmark portfolio of equity exposures comparable to the Board-regulated institution's modeled equity exposures using a long-term sample period.</P>
                <P>(3) The number of risk factors and exposures in the sample and the data period used for quantification in the Board-regulated institution's model and benchmarking exercise must be sufficient to provide confidence in the accuracy and robustness of the Board-regulated institution's estimates.</P>
                <P>(4) The Board-regulated institution's model and benchmarking process must incorporate data that are relevant in representing the risk profile of the Board-regulated institution's modeled equity exposures, and must include data from at least one equity market cycle containing adverse market movements relevant to the risk profile of the Board-regulated institution's modeled equity exposures. In addition, the Board-regulated institution's benchmarking exercise must be based on daily market prices for the benchmark portfolio. If the Board-regulated institution's model uses a scenario methodology, the Board-regulated institution must demonstrate that the model produces a conservative estimate of potential losses on the Board-regulated institution's modeled equity exposures over a relevant long-term market cycle. If the Board-regulated institution employs risk factor models, the Board-regulated institution must demonstrate through empirical analysis the appropriateness of the risk factors used.</P>
                <P>(5) The Board-regulated institution must be able to demonstrate, using theoretical arguments and empirical evidence, that any proxies used in the modeling process are comparable to the Board-regulated institution's modeled equity exposures and that the Board-regulated institution has made appropriate adjustments for differences. The Board-regulated institution must derive any proxies for its modeled equity exposures and benchmark portfolio using historical market data that are relevant to the Board-regulated institution's modeled equity exposures and benchmark portfolio (or, where not, must use appropriately adjusted data), and such proxies must be robust estimates of the risk of the Board-regulated institution's modeled equity exposures.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Available approaches.</E> (1) Unless the exposure meets the requirements for a community development equity exposure in § 217.152(b)(3)(i), a Board-regulated institution must determine the risk-weighted asset amount of an equity exposure to an investment fund under the full look-through approach in paragraph (b) of this section, the simple modified look-through approach in paragraph (c) of this section, or the alternative modified look-through approach in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
                <P>(2) The risk-weighted asset amount of an equity exposure to an investment fund that meets the requirements for a community development equity exposure in § 217.152(b)(3)(i) is its adjusted carrying value.</P>
                <P>(3) If an equity exposure to an investment fund is part of a hedge pair and the Board-regulated institution does not use the full look-through approach, the Board-regulated institution may use the ineffective portion of the hedge pair as determined under § 217.152(c) as the adjusted carrying value for the equity exposure to the investment fund. The risk-weighted asset amount of the effective portion of the hedge pair is equal to its adjusted carrying value.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Full look-through approach.</E> A Board-regulated institution that is able to calculate a risk-weighted asset amount for its proportional ownership share of each exposure held by the investment fund (as calculated under this subpart E of this part as if the proportional ownership share of each exposure were held directly by the Board-regulated institution) may either:</P>
                <P>(1) Set the risk-weighted asset amount of the Board-regulated institution's exposure to the fund equal to the product of:</P>
                <P>(i) The aggregate risk-weighted asset amounts of the exposures held by the fund as if they were held directly by the Board-regulated institution; and</P>
                <P>(ii) The Board-regulated institution's proportional ownership share of the fund; or</P>
                <P>(2) Include the Board-regulated institution's proportional ownership share of each exposure held by the fund in the Board-regulated institution's IMA.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Simple modified look-through approach.</E> Under this approach, the risk-weighted asset amount for a Board-regulated institution's equity exposure to an investment fund equals the adjusted carrying value of the equity exposure multiplied by the highest risk weight assigned according to subpart D of this part that applies to any exposure the fund is permitted to hold under its prospectus, partnership agreement, or similar contract that defines the fund's permissible investments (excluding derivative contracts that are used for hedging rather than speculative purposes and that do not constitute a material portion of the fund's exposures).</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Alternative modified look-through approach.</E> Under this approach, a Board-regulated institution may assign <PRTPAGE P="553"/>the adjusted carrying value of an equity exposure to an investment fund on a pro rata basis to different risk weight categories assigned according to subpart D of this part based on the investment limits in the fund's prospectus, partnership agreement, or similar contract that defines the fund's permissible investments. The risk-weighted asset amount for the Board-regulated institution's equity exposure to the investment fund equals the sum of each portion of the adjusted carrying value assigned to an exposure class multiplied by the applicable risk weight. If the sum of the investment limits for all exposure types within the fund exceeds 100 percent, the Board-regulated institution must assume that the fund invests to the maximum extent permitted under its investment limits in the exposure type with the highest risk weight under subpart D of this part, and continues to make investments in order of the exposure type with the next highest risk weight under subpart D of this part until the maximum total investment level is reached. If more than one exposure type applies to an exposure, the Board-regulated institution must use the highest applicable risk weight. A Board-regulated institution may exclude derivative contracts held by the fund that are used for hedging rather than for speculative purposes and do not constitute a material portion of the fund's exposures.</P>

                <P>(a) Under the IMA, in addition to holding risk-based capital against an equity derivative contract under this part, a Board-regulated institution must hold risk-based capital against the counterparty credit risk in the equity derivative contract by also treating the equity derivative contract as a wholesale exposure and computing a supplemental risk-weighted asset amount for the contract under § 217.132.</P>
                <P>(b) Under the SRWA, a Board-regulated institution may choose not to hold risk-based capital against the counterparty credit risk of equity derivative contracts, as long as it does so for all such contracts. Where the equity derivative contracts are subject to a qualified master netting agreement, a Board-regulated institution using the SRWA must either include all or exclude all of the contracts from any measure used to determine counterparty credit risk exposure.</P>

Qualitative disclosures that typically do not change each quarter (for example, a general <PRTPAGE P="555"/>summary of the Board-regulated institution's risk management objectives and policies, reporting system, and definitions) may be disclosed annually after the end of the fourth calendar quarter, provided that any significant changes to these are disclosed in the interim. Management may provide all of the disclosures required by this subpart in one place on the Board-regulated institution's public Web site or may provide the disclosures in more than one public financial report or other regulatory reports, provided that the Board-regulated institution publicly provides a summary table specifically indicating the location(s) of all such disclosures.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Purpose, applicability, and reservation of authority.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> This subpart F establishes risk-based capital requirements for Board-regulated institutions with significant exposure to market risk, provides methods for these Board-regulated institutions to calculate their standardized measure for market risk and, if applicable, advanced measure for market risk, and establishes public disclosure requirements.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> (1) This subpart applies to any Board-regulated institution with aggregate trading assets and trading liabilities (as reported in the Board-regulated institution's most recent quarterly Call Report, for a state member bank, or FR Y-9C, for a bank holding company or savings and loan holding company, as applicable, any savings and loan holding company that does not file the FR Y-9C should follow the instructions to the FR Y-9C) equal to:</P>
              <P>(i) 10 percent or more of quarter-end total assets as reported on the most recent quarterly [Call Report or FR Y-9C]; or</P>
              <P>(ii) $1 billion or more.</P>
              <P>(2) The Board may apply this subpart to any Board-regulated institution if the Board deems it necessary or appropriate because of the level of market risk of the Board-regulated institution or to ensure safe and sound banking practices.</P>
              <P>(3) The Board may exclude a Board-regulated institution that meets the criteria of paragraph (b)(1) of this section from application of this subpart if the Board determines that the exclusion is appropriate based on the level of market risk of the Board-regulated institution and is consistent with safe and sound banking practices.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Reservation of authority</E> (1) The Board may require a Board-regulated institution to hold an amount of capital greater than otherwise required under this subpart if the Board determines that the Board-regulated institution's capital requirement for market risk as calculated under this subpart is not commensurate with the market risk of the Board-regulated institution's covered positions. In making determinations under paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section, the Board will apply notice and response procedures generally in the same manner as the notice and response procedures set forth in 12 CFR 263.202.</P>
              <P>(2) If the Board determines that the risk-based capital requirement calculated under this subpart by the Board-regulated institution for one or more covered positions or portfolios of covered positions is not commensurate with the risks associated with those positions or portfolios, the Board may require the Board-regulated institution to assign a different risk-based capital requirement to the positions or portfolios that more accurately reflects the risk of the positions or portfolios.</P>
              <P>(3) The Board may also require a Board-regulated institution to calculate risk-based capital requirements for specific positions or portfolios under this subpart, or under subpart D or subpart E of this part, as appropriate, to more accurately reflect the risks of the positions.</P>
              <P>(4) Nothing in this subpart limits the authority of the Board under any other provision of law or regulation to take supervisory or enforcement action, including action to address unsafe or unsound practices or conditions, deficient capital levels, or violations of law.</P>

The valuation process must consider, as appropriate, unearned credit spreads, close-out costs, early termination costs, investing and funding costs, liquidity, and model risk.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Requirements for internal models.</E> (1) A Board-regulated institution must obtain the prior written approval of the Board before using any internal model to calculate its risk-based capital requirement under this subpart.</P>

              <P>(ii) The Board-regulated institution makes any change to an internal model approved by the Board under this subpart that would result in a material change in the Board-regulated institution's risk-weighted asset amount for a portfolio of covered positions; or</P>
              <P>(iii) The Board-regulated institution makes any material change to its modeling assumptions.</P>
              <P>(3) The Board may rescind its approval of the use of any internal model (in whole or in part) or of the determination of the approach under § 217.209(a)(2)(ii) for a Board-regulated institution's modeled correlation trading positions and determine an appropriate capital requirement for the covered positions to which the model would apply, if the Board determines that the model no longer complies with this subpart or fails to reflect accurately the risks of the Board-regulated institution's covered positions.</P>
              <P>(4) The Board-regulated institution must periodically, but no less frequently than annually, review its internal models in light of developments in financial markets and modeling technologies, and enhance those models as appropriate to ensure that they continue to meet the Board's standards for model approval and employ risk measurement methodologies that are most appropriate for the Board-regulated institution's covered positions.</P>
              <P>(5) The Board-regulated institution must incorporate its internal models into its risk management process and integrate the internal models used for calculating its VaR-based measure into its daily risk management process.</P>

              <P>(d) <E T="03">Control, oversight, and validation mechanisms.</E> (1) The Board-regulated institution must have a risk control unit that reports directly to senior management and is independent from the business trading units.</P>
              <P>(2) The Board-regulated institution must validate its internal models initially and on an ongoing basis. The Board-regulated institution's validation process must be independent of the internal models' development, implementation, and operation, or the validation process must be subjected to an independent review of its adequacy and effectiveness.

The stress tests must take into account concentration risk (including but not limited to concentrations in single issuers, industries, sectors, or markets), illiquidity under stressed market conditions, and risks arising from the Board-regulated institution's trading activities that may not be adequately captured in its internal models.</P>
              <P>(4) The Board-regulated institution must have an internal audit function independent of business-line management that at least annually assesses the effectiveness of the controls supporting the Board-regulated institution's market risk measurement systems, including the activities of the business trading units and independent risk control unit, compliance with policies and procedures, and calculation of the Board-regulated institution's measures for market risk under this subpart. At least annually, the internal audit function must report its findings to the Board-regulated institution's board of directors (or a committee thereof).</P>

              <SUBJECT>VaR-based measure.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General requirement.</E> A Board-regulated institution must use one or more internal models to calculate daily a VaR-based measure of the general market risk of all covered positions. The daily VaR-based measure also may reflect the Board-regulated institution's specific risk for one or more portfolios of debt and equity positions, if the internal models meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of § 217.207. The daily VaR-based measure must also reflect the Board-regulated institution's specific risk for any portfolio of correlation trading positions that is modeled under § 217.209. A Board-regulated institution may elect to include term repo-style transactions in its VaR-based measure, provided that the Board-regulated institution includes all such term repo-style transactions consistently over time.</P>
              <P>(1) The Board-regulated institution's internal models for calculating its VaR-based measure must use risk factors sufficient to measure the market risk inherent in all covered positions. The market risk categories must include, as appropriate, interest rate risk, credit spread risk, equity price risk, foreign exchange risk, and commodity price risk. For material positions in the major currencies and markets, modeling techniques must incorporate enough segments of the yield curve—in no case less than six—to capture differences in volatility and less than perfect correlation of rates along the yield curve.</P>
              <P>(2) The VaR-based measure may incorporate empirical correlations within and across risk categories, provided the Board-regulated institution validates and demonstrates the reasonableness of its process for measuring correlations. If the VaR-based measure does not incorporate empirical correlations across risk categories, the Board-regulated institution must add the separate measures from its internal models used to calculate the VaR-based measure for the appropriate market risk categories (interest rate risk, credit spread risk, equity price risk, foreign exchange rate risk, and/or commodity price risk) to determine its aggregate VaR-based measure.</P>
              <P>(3) The VaR-based measure must include the risks arising from the nonlinear price characteristics of options positions or positions with embedded optionality and the sensitivity of the fair value of the positions to changes in the volatility of the underlying rates, prices, or other material risk factors. A Board-regulated institution with a large or complex options portfolio must measure the volatility of options positions or positions with embedded optionality by different maturities and/or strike prices, where material.</P>

              <P>(4) The Board-regulated institution must be able to justify to the satisfaction of the Board the omission of any risk factors from the calculation of its <PRTPAGE P="571"/>VaR-based measure that the Board-regulated institution uses in its pricing models.</P>
              <P>(5) The Board-regulated institution must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Board the appropriateness of any proxies used to capture the risks of the Board-regulated institution's actual positions for which such proxies are used.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Quantitative requirements for VaR-based measure.</E> (1) The VaR-based measure must be calculated on a daily basis using a one-tail, 99.0 percent confidence level, and a holding period equivalent to a 10-business-day movement in underlying risk factors, such as rates, spreads, and prices. To calculate VaR-based measures using a 10-business-day holding period, the Board-regulated institution may calculate 10-business-day measures directly or may convert VaR-based measures using holding periods other than 10 business days to the equivalent of a 10-business-day holding period. A Board-regulated institution that converts its VaR-based measure in such a manner must be able to justify the reasonableness of its approach to the satisfaction of the Board.</P>
              <P>(2) The VaR-based measure must be based on a historical observation period of at least one year. Data used to determine the VaR-based measure must be relevant to the Board-regulated institution's actual exposures and of sufficient quality to support the calculation of risk-based capital requirements. The Board-regulated institution must update data sets at least monthly or more frequently as changes in market conditions or portfolio composition warrant. For a Board-regulated institution that uses a weighting scheme or other method for the historical observation period, the Board-regulated institution must either:</P>
              <P>(i) Use an effective observation period of at least one year in which the average time lag of the observations is at least six months; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Demonstrate to the Board that its weighting scheme is more effective than a weighting scheme with an average time lag of at least six months representing the volatility of the Board-regulated institution's trading portfolio over a full business cycle. A Board-regulated institution using this option must update its data more frequently than monthly and in a manner appropriate for the type of weighting scheme.</P>
              <P>(c) A Board-regulated institution must divide its portfolio into a number of significant subportfolios approved by the Board for subportfolio backtesting purposes. These subportfolios must be sufficient to allow the Board-regulated institution and the Board to assess the adequacy of the VaR model at the risk factor level; the Board will evaluate the appropriateness of these subportfolios relative to the value and composition of the Board-regulated institution's covered positions. The Board-regulated institution must retain and make available to the Board the following information for each subportfolio for each business day over the previous two years (500 business days), with no more than a 60-day lag:</P>
              <P>(1) A daily VaR-based measure for the subportfolio calibrated to a one-tail, 99.0 percent confidence level;</P>
              <P>(2) The daily profit or loss for the subportfolio (that is, the net change in price of the positions held in the portfolio at the end of the previous business day); and</P>
              <P>(3) The p-value of the profit or loss on each day (that is, the probability of observing a profit that is less than, or a loss that is greater than, the amount reported for purposes of paragraph (c)(2) of this section based on the model used to calculate the VaR-based measure described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section).</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Quantitative requirements for stressed VaR-based measure.</E> (1) A Board-regulated institution must calculate a stressed VaR-based measure for its covered positions using the same model(s) used to calculate the VaR-based measure, subject to the same confidence level and holding period applicable to the VaR-based measure under § 217.205, but with model inputs calibrated to <PRTPAGE P="572"/>historical data from a continuous 12-month period that reflects a period of significant financial stress appropriate to the Board-regulated institution's current portfolio.</P>

              <P>(3) A Board-regulated institution must have policies and procedures that describe how it determines the period of significant financial stress used to calculate the Board-regulated institution's stressed VaR-based measure under this section and must be able to provide empirical support for the period used. The Board-regulated institution must obtain the prior approval of the Board for, and notify the Board if the Board-regulated institution makes any material changes to, these policies and procedures. The policies and procedures must address:</P>
              <P>(i) How the Board-regulated institution links the period of significant financial stress used to calculate the stressed VaR-based measure to the composition and directional bias of its current portfolio; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The Board-regulated institution's process for selecting, reviewing, and updating the period of significant financial stress used to calculate the stressed VaR-based measure and for monitoring the appropriateness of the period to the Board-regulated institution's current portfolio.</P>
              <P>(4) Nothing in this section prevents the Board from requiring a Board-regulated institution to use a different period of significant financial stress in the calculation of the stressed VaR-based measure.</P>

A Board-regulated institution must use models to measure the specific risk of correlation trading positions that are modeled under § 217.209.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Requirements for specific risk modeling.</E> (i) If a Board-regulated institution uses internal models to measure the specific risk of a portfolio, the internal models must:</P>

              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Capture and demonstrate sensitivity to material differences between positions that are similar but not identical and to changes in portfolio composition and concentrations.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General requirement.</E> A Board-regulated institution that measures the specific risk of a portfolio of debt positions under § 217.207(b) using internal models must calculate at least weekly an incremental risk measure for that portfolio according to the requirements in this section. The incremental risk measure is the Board-regulated institution's measure of potential losses due to incremental risk over a one-year time horizon at a one-tail, 99.9 percent confidence level, either under the assumption of a constant level of risk, or under the assumption of constant positions. With the prior approval of the Board, a Board-regulated institution may choose to include portfolios of equity positions in its incremental risk model, provided that it consistently includes such equity positions in a manner that is consistent with how the Board-regulated institution internally measures and manages the incremental risk of such positions at the portfolio level. If equity positions are included in the model, for modeling purposes default is considered to have occurred upon the default of any debt of the issuer of the equity position. A Board-regulated institution may not include correlation trading positions or securitization positions in its incremental risk measure.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Requirements for incremental risk modeling.</E> For purposes of calculating the incremental risk measure, the incremental risk model must:</P>
              <P>(1) Measure incremental risk over a one-year time horizon and at a one-tail, 99.9 percent confidence level, either under the assumption of a constant level of risk, or under the assumption of constant positions.</P>
              <P>(i) A constant level of risk assumption means that the Board-regulated institution rebalances, or rolls over, its trading positions at the beginning of each liquidity horizon over the one-year horizon in a manner that maintains the Board-regulated institution's initial risk level. The Board-regulated institution must determine the frequency of rebalancing in a manner consistent with the liquidity horizons of the positions in the portfolio. The liquidity horizon of a position or set of positions is the time required for a Board-regulated institution to reduce its exposure to, or hedge all of its material risks of, the position(s) in a stressed market. The liquidity horizon for a position or set of positions may not be less than the shorter of three months or the contractual maturity of the position.</P>
              <P>(ii) A constant position assumption means that the Board-regulated institution maintains the same set of positions throughout the one-year horizon. If a Board-regulated institution uses this assumption, it must do so consistently across all portfolios.</P>
              <P>(iii) A Board-regulated institution's selection of a constant position or a constant risk assumption must be consistent between the Board-regulated institution's incremental risk model and its comprehensive risk model described in section 209 of this subpart, if applicable.</P>
              <P>(iv) A Board-regulated institution's treatment of liquidity horizons must be consistent between the Board-regulated institution's incremental risk model and its comprehensive risk model described in section 209, if applicable.</P>
              <P>(2) Recognize the impact of correlations between default and migration events among obligors.</P>
              <P>(3) Reflect the effect of issuer and market concentrations, as well as concentrations that can arise within and across product classes during stressed conditions.</P>
              <P>(4) Reflect netting only of long and short positions that reference the same financial instrument.</P>
              <P>(5) Reflect any material mismatch between a position and its hedge.</P>
              <P>(6) Recognize the effect that liquidity horizons have on dynamic hedging strategies. In such cases, a Board-regulated institution must:</P>
              <P>(i) Choose to model the rebalancing of the hedge consistently over the relevant set of trading positions;</P>

              <P>(ii) Demonstrate that the inclusion of rebalancing results in a more appropriate risk measurement;<PRTPAGE P="574"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) Demonstrate that the market for the hedge is sufficiently liquid to permit rebalancing during periods of stress; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Capture in the incremental risk model any residual risks arising from such hedging strategies.</P>
              <P>(7) Reflect the nonlinear impact of options and other positions with material nonlinear behavior with respect to default and migration changes.</P>
              <P>(8) Maintain consistency with the Board-regulated institution's internal risk management methodologies for identifying, measuring, and managing risk.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Standardized measurement method for specific risk.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General requirement.</E> A Board-regulated institution must calculate a total specific risk add-on for each portfolio of debt and equity positions for which the Board-regulated institution's VaR-based measure does not capture all material aspects of specific risk and for all securitization positions that are not modeled under § 217.209. A Board-regulated institution must calculate each specific risk add-on in accordance with the requirements of this section. Notwithstanding any other definition or requirement in this subpart, a position that would have qualified as a debt position or an equity position but for the fact that it qualifies as a correlation trading position under paragraph (2) of the definition of correlation trading position in § 217.2, shall be considered a debt position or an equity position, respectively, for purposes of this section 210 of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(1) The specific risk add-on for an individual debt or securitization position that represents sold credit protection is capped at the notional amount of the credit derivative contract. The specific risk add-on for an individual debt or securitization position that represents purchased credit protection is capped at the current fair value of the transaction plus the absolute value of the present value of all remaining payments to the protection seller under the transaction. This sum is equal to the value of the protection leg of the transaction.</P>

              <P>(2) For debt, equity, or securitization positions that are derivatives with linear payoffs, a Board-regulated institution must assign a specific risk-weighting factor to the fair value of the effective notional amount of the underlying instrument or index portfolio, except for a securitization position for which the Board-regulated institution directly calculates a specific risk add-on using the SFA in paragraph (b)(2)(vii)(B) of this section. A swap must be included as an effective notional position in the underlying instrument or portfolio, with the receiving side treated as a long position and the paying side treated as a short position. For debt, equity, or securitization positions that are derivatives with nonlinear payoffs, a Board-regulated institution must risk weight the fair value of the effective notional amount <PRTPAGE P="576"/>of the underlying instrument or portfolio multiplied by the derivative's delta.</P>
              <P>(3) For debt, equity, or securitization positions, a Board-regulated institution may net long and short positions (including derivatives) in identical issues or identical indices. A Board-regulated institution may also net positions in depositary receipts against an opposite position in an identical equity in different markets, provided that the Board-regulated institution includes the costs of conversion.</P>
              <P>(4) A set of transactions consisting of either a debt position and its credit derivative hedge or a securitization position and its credit derivative hedge has a specific risk add-on of zero if:</P>
              <P>(i) The debt or securitization position is fully hedged by a total return swap (or similar instrument where there is a matching of swap payments and changes in fair value of the debt or securitization position);</P>
              <P>(ii) There is an exact match between the reference obligation of the swap and the debt or securitization position;</P>
              <P>(iii) There is an exact match between the currency of the swap and the debt or securitization position; and</P>
              <P>(iv) There is either an exact match between the maturity date of the swap and the maturity date of the debt or securitization position; or, in cases where a total return swap references a portfolio of positions with different maturity dates, the total return swap maturity date must match the maturity date of the underlying asset in that portfolio that has the latest maturity date.</P>
              <P>(5) The specific risk add-on for a set of transactions consisting of either a debt position and its credit derivative hedge or a securitization position and its credit derivative hedge that does not meet the criteria of paragraph (a)(4) of this section is equal to 20.0 percent of the capital requirement for the side of the transaction with the higher specific risk add-on when:</P>
              <P>(i) The credit risk of the position is fully hedged by a credit default swap or similar instrument;</P>
              <P>(ii) There is an exact match between the reference obligation of the credit derivative hedge and the debt or securitization position;</P>
              <P>(iii) There is an exact match between the currency of the credit derivative hedge and the debt or securitization position; and</P>
              <P>(iv) There is either an exact match between the maturity date of the credit derivative hedge and the maturity date of the debt or securitization position; or, in the case where the credit derivative hedge has a standard maturity date:</P>
              <P>(A) The maturity date of the credit derivative hedge is within 30 business days of the maturity date of the debt or securitization position; or</P>
              <P>(B) For purchased credit protection, the maturity date of the credit derivative hedge is later than the maturity date of the debt or securitization position, but is no later than the standard maturity date for that instrument that immediately follows the maturity date of the debt or securitization position. The maturity date of the credit derivative hedge may not exceed the maturity date of the debt or securitization position by more than 90 calendar days.</P>
              <P>(6) The specific risk add-on for a set of transactions consisting of either a debt position and its credit derivative hedge or a securitization position and its credit derivative hedge that does not meet the criteria of either paragraph (a)(4) or (a)(5) of this section, but in which all or substantially all of the price risk has been hedged, is equal to the specific risk add-on for the side of the transaction with the higher specific risk add-on.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Debt and securitization positions.</E> (1) The total specific risk add-on for a portfolio of debt or securitization positions is the sum of the specific risk add-ons for individual debt or securitization positions, as computed under this section. To determine the specific risk add-on for individual debt or securitization positions, a Board-regulated institution must multiply the absolute value of the current fair value of each net long or net short debt or securitization position in the portfolio by the appropriate specific risk-weighting factor as set forth in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (b)(2)(vii) of this section.</P>

Notwithstanding any other provision in this subpart, sovereign debt positions that are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States are treated as having a CRC of 0.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Simplified supervisory formula approach (SSFA).</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General requirements.</E> To use the SSFA to determine the specific risk-weighting factor for a securitization position, a Board-regulated institution must have data that enables it to assign accurately the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section. Data used to assign the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section must be the most currently available data; if the contracts governing the underlying exposures of the securitization require payments on a monthly or quarterly basis, the data used to assign the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section must be no more than 91 calendar days old. A Board-regulated institution that does not have the appropriate data to assign the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section must assign a specific risk-weighting factor of 100 percent to the position.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">SSFA parameters.</E> To calculate the specific risk-weighting factor for a securitization position using the SSFA, a Board-regulated institution must have accurate information on the five inputs to the SSFA calculation described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) K<E T="52">G</E> is the weighted-average (with unpaid principal used as the weight for <PRTPAGE P="583"/>each exposure) total capital requirement of the underlying exposures calculated using subpart D. K<E T="52">G</E> is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one (that is, an average risk weight of 100 percent represents a value of K<E T="52">G</E> equal to 0.08).</P>
              <P>(2) Parameter W is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one. Parameter W is the ratio of the sum of the dollar amounts of any underlying exposures of the securitization that meet any of the criteria as set forth in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (vi) of this section to the balance, measured in dollars, of underlying exposures:</P>
              <P>(i) Ninety days or more past due;</P>
              <P>(ii) Subject to a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding;</P>
              <P>(iii) In the process of foreclosure;</P>
              <P>(iv) Held as real estate owned;</P>
              <P>(v) Has contractually deferred payments for 90 days or more, other than principal or interest payments deferred on:</P>
              <P>(A) Federally-guaranteed student loans, in accordance with the terms of those guarantee programs; or</P>
              <P>(B) Consumer loans, including non-federally-guaranteed student loans, provided that such payments are deferred pursuant to provisions included in the contract at the time funds are disbursed that provide for period(s) of deferral that are not initiated based on changes in the creditworthiness of the borrower; or</P>
              <P>(vi) Is in default.</P>
              <P>(3) Parameter A is the attachment point for the position, which represents the threshold at which credit losses will first be allocated to the position. Except as provided in § 217.210(b)(2)(vii)(D) for n<SU>th</SU>-to-default credit derivatives, parameter A equals the ratio of the current dollar amount of underlying exposures that are subordinated to the position of the Board-regulated institution to the current dollar amount of underlying exposures. Any reserve account funded by the accumulated cash flows from the underlying exposures that is subordinated to the position that contains the Board-regulated institution's securitization exposure may be included in the calculation of parameter A to the extent that cash is present in the account. Parameter A is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one.</P>

              <P>(4) Parameter D is the detachment point for the position, which represents the threshold at which credit losses of principal allocated to the position would result in a total loss of principal. Except as provided in § 217.210(b)(2)(vii)(D) for n<SU>th</SU>-to-default credit derivatives, parameter D equals parameter A plus the ratio of the current dollar amount of the securitization positions that are <E T="03">pari passu</E> with the position (that is, have equal seniority with respect to credit risk) to the current dollar amount of the underlying exposures. Parameter D is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one.</P>
              <P>(5) A supervisory calibration parameter, p, is equal to 0.5 for securitization positions that are not resecuritization positions and equal to 1.5 for resecuritization positions.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Mechanics of the SSFA.</E> K<E T="52">G</E> and W are used to calculate K<E T="52">A</E>, the augmented value of K<E T="52">G</E>, which reflects the observed credit quality of the underlying exposures. K<E T="52">A</E> is defined in paragraph (d) of this section. The values of parameters A and D, relative to K<E T="52">A</E> determine the specific risk-weighting factor assigned to a position as described in this paragraph (c) and paragraph (d) of this section. The specific risk-weighting factor assigned to a securitization position, or portion of a position, as appropriate, is the larger of the specific risk-weighting factor determined in accordance with this paragraph (c), paragraph (d) of this section, and a specific risk-weighting factor of 1.6 percent.</P>

              <P>(1) When the detachment point, parameter D, for a securitization position is less than or equal to K<E T="52">A</E>, the position must be assigned a specific risk-weighting factor of 100 percent.</P>

              <P>(2) When the attachment point, parameter A, for a securitization position is greater than or equal to K<E T="52">A</E>, the Board-regulated institution must calculate the specific risk-weighting factor in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) When A is less than K<E T="52">A</E> and D is greater than K<E T="52">A</E>, the specific risk-weighting factor is a weighted-average <PRTPAGE P="584"/>of 1.00 and K<E T="52">SSFA</E> calculated under paragraphs (c)(3)(i) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section. For the purpose of this calculation:</P>

              <SUBJECT>Market risk disclosures.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Scope.</E> A Board-regulated institution must comply with this section unless it is a consolidated subsidiary of a bank holding company or a depository institution that is subject to these requirements or of a non-U.S. banking organization that is subject to comparable public disclosure requirements in its home jurisdiction. A Board-regulated institution must make timely public disclosures each calendar quarter. If a significant change occurs, such that the most recent reporting amounts are no longer reflective of the Board-regulated institution's capital adequacy and risk profile, then a brief discussion of this change and its likely impact must be provided as soon as practicable thereafter. Qualitative disclosures that typically do not change each quarter may be disclosed annually, provided any significant changes are disclosed in the interim. If a Board-regulated institution believes that disclosure of specific commercial or financial information would prejudice seriously its position by making public certain information that is either proprietary or confidential in nature, the <PRTPAGE P="585"/>Board-regulated institution is not required to disclose these specific items, but must disclose more general information about the subject matter of the requirement, together with the fact that, and the reason why, the specific items of information have not been disclosed. The Board-regulated institution's management may provide all of the disclosures required by this section in one place on the Board-regulated institution's public Web site or may provide the disclosures in more than one public financial report or other regulatory reports, provided that the Board-regulated institution publicly provides a summary table specifically indicating the location(s) of all such disclosures.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Disclosure policy.</E> The Board-regulated institution must have a formal disclosure policy approved by the board of directors that addresses the Board-regulated institution's approach for determining its market risk disclosures. The policy must address the associated internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures. The board of directors and senior management must ensure that appropriate verification of the disclosures takes place and that effective internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures are maintained. One or more senior officers of the Board-regulated institution must attest that the disclosures meet the requirements of this subpart, and the board of directors and senior management are responsible for establishing and maintaining an effective internal control structure over financial reporting, including the disclosures required by this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Quantitative disclosures.</E> (1) For each material portfolio of covered positions, the Board-regulated institution must provide timely public disclosures of the following information at least quarterly:</P>
              <P>(i) The high, low, and mean VaR-based measures over the reporting period and the VaR-based measure at period-end;</P>
              <P>(ii) The high, low, and mean stressed VaR-based measures over the reporting period and the stressed VaR-based measure at period-end;</P>
              <P>(iii) The high, low, and mean incremental risk capital requirements over the reporting period and the incremental risk capital requirement at period-end;</P>
              <P>(iv) The high, low, and mean comprehensive risk capital requirements over the reporting period and the comprehensive risk capital requirement at period-end, with the period-end requirement broken down into appropriate risk classifications (for example, default risk, migration risk, correlation risk);</P>
              <P>(v) Separate measures for interest rate risk, credit spread risk, equity price risk, foreign exchange risk, and commodity price risk used to calculate the VaR-based measure; and</P>

              <P>(2) In addition, the Board-regulated institution must disclose publicly the following information at least quarterly:</P>
              <P>(i) The aggregate amount of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet securitization positions by exposure type; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The aggregate amount of correlation trading positions.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Qualitative disclosures.</E> For each material portfolio of covered positions, the Board-regulated institution must provide timely public disclosures of the following information at least annually after the end of the fourth calendar quarter, or more frequently in the event of material changes for each portfolio:</P>
              <P>(1) The composition of material portfolios of covered positions;</P>
              <P>(2) The Board-regulated institution's valuation policies, procedures, and methodologies for covered positions including, for securitization positions, the methods and key assumptions used for valuing such positions, any significant changes since the last reporting period, and the impact of such change;</P>

              <P>(ii) The methodologies used to achieve a capital assessment that is consistent with the required soundness standard; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The specific approaches used in the validation of these models;</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> This subpart implements provisions of section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act (12 U.S.C. 5365), by establishing a risk-based capital surcharge for global systemically important bank holding companies.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Applicability</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> This subpart applies to a bank holding company that is an advanced approaches Board-regulated institution and that is not a consolidated subsidiary of a bank holding company or a consolidated subsidiary of a foreign banking organization.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Effective date of calculation and surcharge requirements.</E> Subject to the transition provisions in paragraph (b)(3) of this section:</P>
              <P>(i) A bank holding company that becomes an advanced approaches Board-regulated institution must determine whether it qualifies as a global systemically important BHC pursuant to § 217.402 by December 31 of the year immediately following the year in which the bank holding company becomes an advanced approaches Board-regulated institution; and</P>
              <P>(ii) A bank holding company that becomes a global systemically important BHC pursuant to § 217.402 must calculate its GSIB surcharge pursuant to § 217.403 by December 31 of the year in which the bank holding company is identified as a global systemically important BHC and must use that GSIB surcharge for purposes of determining its maximum payout ratio under Table 1 to § 217.11 beginning on January 1 of the year that is immediately following the full calendar year after it is identified as a global systemically important BHC.</P>
              <P>(3) Transition provisions for the calculation and surcharge requirements—(i) GSIB surcharge requirements for bank holding companies with more than $700 billion in total assets or $10 trillion in assets under custody. A bank holding company that is an advanced approaches Board-regulated institution with more than $700 billion in total assets as reported on the FR Y-9C as of December 31, 2014, or more than $10 trillion in assets under custody as reported on the FR Y-15 as of December 31, 2014, must calculate its GSIB surcharge by December 31, 2015, and use that GSIB surcharge to determine its maximum payout ratio under Table 1 to § 217.11 beginning on January 1, 2016; provided that for the GSIB surcharges required to be calculated by December 31, 2015 and by December 31, 2016, the bank holding company must calculate its short-term wholesale funding score using the average of its weighted short-term wholesale funding amounts (defined in § 217.406(b)), calculated for July 31, 2015, August 24, 2015, and September 30, 2015.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Calculation and GSIB surcharge requirements for other advanced approaches Board-regulated institutions.</E> A bank holding company that was an advanced approaches Board-regulated institution as of December 31, 2014, and is not described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section must:</P>
              <P>(A) Determine whether it qualifies as a global systemically important BHC pursuant to § 217.402 by December 31, 2015; and</P>
              <P>(B) To the extent it qualifies as a global systemically important BHC by December 31, 2015, calculate its GSIB surcharge by December 31, 2016. The GSIB surcharge calculated by December 31, 2016, shall equal the method 1 surcharge (defined in § 217.403) of the bank holding company.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Reservation of authority.</E> (1) The Board may apply this subpart to any Board-regulated institution, in whole or in part, by order of the Board based on the institution's capital structure, size, level of complexity, risk profile, scope of operations, or financial condition.</P>

              <P>(2) The Board may adjust the amount of the GSIB surcharge applicable to a global systemically important BHC, or extend or accelerate any compliance date of this subpart, if the Board determines that the adjustment, extension, or acceleration is appropriate in light <PRTPAGE P="595"/>of the capital structure, size, complexity, risk profile, and scope of operations of the global systemically important BHC. In increasing the size of the GSIB surcharge for a global systemically important BHC, the Board shall follow the notice and response procedures in 12 CFR part 263, subpart E.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Except as provided in § 217.400(b)(3)(ii), a global systemically important BHC's short-term wholesale funding score is equal to:</P>
              <P>(1) The average of the global systemically important BHC's weighted short-term wholesale funding amount (defined in paragraph (b) of this section);</P>
              <P>(2) Divided by the global systemically important BHC's average risk-weighted assets; and</P>
              <P>(3) Multiplied by a fixed factor of 350.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Weighted short-term wholesale funding amount.</E> (1) To calculate its weighted short-term wholesale funding amount, a global systemically important BHC must calculate the amount of its short-term wholesale funding on a consolidated basis for each business day of the previous calendar year and weight the components of short-term wholesale funding in accordance with Table 1 of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) Short-term wholesale funding includes the following components, each as defined in paragraph (c) of this section:</P>
              <P>(i) All funds that the bank holding company must pay under each secured funding transaction, other than an operational deposit, with a remaining maturity of 1 year or less;</P>
              <P>(ii) All funds that the bank holding company must pay under all unsecured wholesale funding, other than an operational deposit, with a remaining maturity of 1 year or less;</P>
              <P>(iii) The fair value of an asset as determined under GAAP that a bank holding company must return under a covered asset exchange with a remaining maturity of 1 year or less;</P>
              <P>(iv) The fair value of an asset as determined under GAAP that the bank holding company must return under a short position to the extent that the borrowed asset does not qualify as a Level 1 liquid asset or a Level 2A liquid asset; and</P>
              <P>(v) All brokered deposits held at the bank holding company provided by a retail customer or counterparty.</P>
              <P>(3) For purposes of calculating the short-term wholesale funding amount and the components thereof, a bank holding company must assume that each asset or transaction described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section matures in accordance with the criteria set forth in 12 CFR 249.31.</P>

              <SUBJECT>The Board's Regulatory Capital Framework for Depository Institution Holding Companies Organized as Non-Stock Companies.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> (1) This section applies to all depository institution holding companies that are organized as legal entities other than stock corporations and that are subject to this part (Regulation Q, 12 CFR part 217).<SU>1</SU>
                <FTREF/>

                  <SU>1</SU> <E T="03">See</E> 12 CFR 217.1(c)(1) through (3).</P>
              </FTNT>
              <P>(2) Notwithstanding §§ 217.2 and 217.10, a bank holding company or covered savings and loan holding company that is organized as a legal entity other than a stock corporation and has issued capital instruments that do not qualify as common equity tier 1 capital under § 217.20 by virtue of the requirements set forth in this section may treat those capital instruments as common equity tier 1 capital until July 1, 2016.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Common equity tier 1 capital criteria applied to capital instruments issued by non-stock companies.</E> (1) Subpart C of this part provides criteria for capital instruments to qualify as common equity tier 1 capital. This section describes how certain criteria apply to capital instruments issued by bank holding companies and covered savings and loan holding companies that are organized as legal entities other than stock corporations, such as limited liability companies (LLCs) and partnerships.</P>
              <P>(2) Holding companies are organized using a variety of legal structures, including corporate forms, LLCs, partnerships, and similar structures.<SU>2</SU>

                <FTREF/> In the Board's experience, some depository institution holding companies that are organized in non-stock form issue multiple classes of capital instruments that allocate profit and loss from a distribution differently among classes, which may affect the ability of <PRTPAGE P="600"/>those classes to qualify as common equity tier 1 capital.<SU>3</SU>
                <FTREF/>
              </P>
              <FTNT>
                <P>
                  <SU>2</SU> A stock corporation's common stock should satisfy the CET1 criteria so long as the common stock does not have unusual features, such as a limited duration.</P>
              </FTNT>
              <FTNT>
                <P>
                  <SU>3</SU> Notably, voting powers or other means of exercising control are not relevant for purposes of satisfying the CET1 eligibility criteria. Thus, the fact that a particular partner or member controls a holding company, for instance, due to serving as general partner or managing member, is not material to qualification of particular interests as CET1.</P>
              </FTNT>
              <P>(3) Common equity tier 1 capital is defined in § 217.20(b). To qualify as common equity tier 1 capital, capital instruments must satisfy a number of criteria. This section provides examples of the application of certain common equity tier 1 capital criteria that relate to the economic interests in the company represented by particular capital instruments.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Examples.</E> The following examples show how the criteria for common equity tier 1 capital apply to particular partnership or LLC structures.<SU>4</SU>

              <FTNT>
                <P>
                  <SU>4</SU> Although the examples refer to specific types of legal entities for purposes of illustration, the substance of the Regulation Q criteria reflected in the examples applies to all types of legal entities.</P>
              </FTNT>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">LLC with one class of membership interests.</E> (i) An LLC issues one class of membership interests that provides that all holders of the interests bear losses and receive dividends proportionate to their levels of ownership.</P>
              <P>(ii) Provided that the other criteria in § 217.20(b) are met, the membership interests would qualify as common equity tier 1 capital.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Partnership with limited and general partners.</E> (i) A partnership has two classes of interests: General partnership interests and limited partnership interests. The general partners and the limited partners bear losses and receive distributions allocated proportionately to their capital contributions. In addition, the general partner has unlimited liability for the debts of the partnership.</P>
              <P>(ii) Provided that the other criteria in § 217.20(b) are met, the general and limited partnership interests would qualify as common equity tier 1 capital. The fact of unlimited liability of the general partner is not relevant in the context of the eligibility criteria of common equity tier 1 capital instruments, provided that the general partner and limited partners share losses equally to the extent of the assets of the partnership, and the general partner is liable after the assets of the partnership are exhausted. In this regard, the general partner's unlimited liability is similar to a guarantee provided by the general partner, rather than a feature of the general partnership interest.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Senior and junior classes of capital instruments.</E> (i) An LLC issues two types of membership interests, Class A and Class B. Holders of Class A and Class B interests participate equally in operating distributions and have equal voting rights. However, in liquidation, holders of Class B interests must receive the entire amount of their contributed capital in order for any distributions to be made to holders of Class A interests.</P>
              <P>(ii) Class B interests have a preference over Class A interests in liquidation and, therefore, would not qualify as common equity tier 1 capital as the Class B interests are not the most subordinated claim (criterion (i)) and do not share losses proportionately (criterion (viii) (§ 217.20(b)(1)(i) and (viii), respectively).</P>
              <P>(A) If all other criteria are satisfied, Class A interests would qualify as common equity tier 1 capital.</P>
              <P>(B) Class B interests may qualify as additional tier 1 capital, or tier 2 capital, if the Class B interests meet the applicable criteria (§ 217.20(c) and (d)).</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">LLC with two classes of membership interests.</E> (i) An LLC issues two types of membership interests, Class A and Class B. To the extent that the LLC makes a distribution, holders of Class A and Class B interests share proportionately in any losses and receive proportionate shares of contributed capital. To the extent that a capital distribution includes an allocation of profits, holders of Class A and Class B interests share proportionately up to the point where all holders receive a specific annual rate of return on capital contributions, and, if the distribution exceeds that point, holders of Class B interests receive double their proportional share and holders of Class A interests receive the remainder of the distribution.</P>

              <P>(ii) Class A and Class B interests would both qualify as common equity <PRTPAGE P="601"/>tier 1 capital, provided that under all circumstances they share losses proportionately, as measured with respect to each distribution, and that they satisfy the common equity tier 1 capital criteria. The holders of Class A and Class B interests may receive different allocations of profits with respect to a distribution, provided that the distribution is made simultaneously to all members of Class A and Class B interests. Despite the potential for disproportionate profits, Class A and Class B interests have the same level of seniority with regard to potential losses and therefore they both satisfy all the criteria in § 217.20(b), including criterion (ii) (§ 217.20(b)(1)(ii)).</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Alternative LLC with two classes of membership interests.</E> (i) An LLC issues two types of membership interests, Class A and Class B. In the event that the LLC makes a distribution, holders of Class A interests bear a disproportionately low level of any losses, such that the Class B interests bear a disproportionately high level of losses at the distribution. In contrast to the example in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the different participation rights apply to distributions in situations where losses are allocated, including losses at liquidation.</P>
              <P>(ii) Because holders of the Class A interests do not bear a proportional interest in the losses (criterion (ii) (§ 217.20(b)(1)(ii)), the Class A interests would not qualify as common equity tier 1 capital.</P>
              <P>(A) Companies with such structures may revise their capital structures in order to provide for a sufficiently large class of capital instruments that proportionally bear first losses in liquidation (that is, the Class B interests in this example).</P>
              <P>(B) Alternatively, companies with such structures could revise their capital structure to ensure that all classes of capital instruments that are intended to qualify as common equity tier 1 capital share equally in losses in liquidation consistent with criteria (i), (ii), (vii), and (viii) in § 217.20(b)(1)(i), (ii), (vii), respectively, even if each class of capital instruments has different rights to allocations of profits, as in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Mandatory distributions.</E> (i) A partnership agreement contains provisions that require distributions to holders of one or more classes of capital instruments on the occurrence of particular events, such as upon specific dates or following a significant sale of assets, but not including any final distributions in liquidation.</P>
              <P>(ii) Any class of capital instruments that provides holders with rights to mandatory distributions would not qualify as common equity tier 1 capital because a holding company must have full discretion at all times to refrain from paying any dividends and making any other distributions on the instrument without triggering an event of default, a requirement to make a payment-in-kind, or an imposition of any other restriction on the holding company (criterion (vi) in § 217.20(b)(1)(vi)). Companies must ensure that they have a sufficient amount of capital instruments that do not have such rights and that meet the other criteria of common equity tier 1 capital, in order to meet the requirements of Regulation Q.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Features that Reallocate Prior Distributions.</E> (i) An LLC issues two types of membership interests, Class A and Class B. The terms of the LLC's membership interests provide that, under certain circumstances, holders of Class A interests must return a portion of earlier distributions, which are then distributed to holders of Class B interests (sometimes called a “clawback”).</P>
              <P>(ii) If the reallocation of prior distributions described in paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this section could result in holders of the Class B interests bearing fewer losses on an aggregate basis than Class A interests, the Class B interests would not qualify as common equity tier 1 capital. However, where the membership interests provide for disproportionate allocation of profits, such as described in the example in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, and the reallocation of prior distributions would be limited to reversing the disproportionate portions of prior distributions, both the Class A and Class B interests could qualify as common equity tier 1 capital provided that they met all the other criteria in § 217.20(b).</P>

              <P>(a) In 2013, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) issued a final regulatory capital rule (Regulation Q) in coordination with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) that strengthened risk-based and leverage capital requirements applicable to insured depository institutions and depository institution holding companies (banking organizations).<SU>1</SU>

The CCyB applies only to banking organizations subject to the advanced approaches capital rules, which generally apply to those banking organizations with greater than $250 billion in assets or more than $10 billion in on-balance-sheet foreign exposures. <E T="03">See</E> 12 CFR 217.100(b). An advanced approaches institution is subject to the CCyB regardless of whether it has completed the parallel run process and received notification from its primary Federal supervisor. <E T="03">See</E> 12 CFR 217.121(d).</P>

              <P>(b) The CCyB is a supplemental, macroprudential policy tool that the Board can increase during periods of rising vulnerabilities in the financial system and reduce when vulnerabilities recede. It is designed to increase the resilience of large banking organizations when there is an elevated risk of above-normal losses. Increasing the resilience of large banking organizations will, in turn, improve the resilience of the broader financial system. Above-normal losses often follow periods of rapid asset price appreciation or credit growth that are not well supported by underlying economic fundamentals. The circumstances in which the Board would most likely begin to increase the CCyB above zero percent to augment minimum capital requirements and other capital buffers would be when systemic vulnerabilities are meaningfully above normal. By requiring large banking organizations to hold additional capital during those periods of excess and removing the requirement to hold additional capital when the vulnerabilities have diminished, the CCyB also is expected to moderate fluctuations in the supply of credit over time. Moderating the supply of credit may mitigate or prevent the conditions that contribute to above-normal losses, such as elevated asset prices and excessive leverage, and prevent or mitigate reductions in lending to creditworthy borrowers that can amplify an economic downturn. In this way, implementation of the CCyB also responds to the Dodd-Frank Act's requirement that the Board seek to make its capital requirements countercyclical.<SU>3</SU>

              <P>(c) Regulation Q established the initial CCyB amount with respect to private sector credit exposures located in the United States (U.S.-based credit exposures) at zero percent and provided that the maximum potential amount of the CCyB for credit exposures in the United States was 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets.<SU>4</SU>

                <FTREF/> The Board expects to make decisions about the appropriate level of the CCyB for U.S.-based credit exposures jointly with the OCC and FDIC, and expects that the CCyB amount for U.S.-based credit exposures <PRTPAGE P="603"/>will be the same for covered depository institution holding companies and insured depository institutions. The CCyB is designed to take into account the macrofinancial environment in which banking organizations function and the degree to which that environment impacts the resilience of advanced approaches institutions. Therefore, the appropriate level of the CCyB for U.S.-based credit exposures is not closely linked to the characteristics of an individual institution. Rather, the impact of the CCyB on any single institution will depend on the particular composition of the private-sector credit exposures of the institution across national jurisdictions.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD1">2. Overview and Scope of the Policy Statement</HD>
              <P>This Policy Statement describes the framework that the Board will follow in setting the amount of the CCyB for U.S.-based credit exposures. The framework consists of a set of principles for translating assessments of financial system vulnerabilities that are regularly undertaken by the Board into the appropriate level of the CCyB. Those assessments are informed by a broad array of quantitative indicators of financial and economic performance and a set of empirical models. In addition, the framework includes an assessment of whether the CCyB is the most appropriate policy instrument (among available policy instruments) to address the highlighted financial system vulnerabilities.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">3. The Objectives of the CCyB</HD>
              <P>(a) The objectives of the CCyB are to strengthen banking organizations' resilience against the build-up of systemic vulnerabilities and reduce fluctuations in the supply of credit. The CCyB supplements the minimum capital requirements and the capital conservation buffer, which themselves are designed to provide substantial resilience to unexpected losses created by normal fluctuations in economic and financial conditions. The capital surcharge on global systemically important banking organizations adds an additional layer of defense for the largest and most systemically important institutions, whose financial distress can have outsized effects on the rest of the financial system and the real economy.<SU>5</SU>
                <FTREF/> However, periods of financial excesses, for example as reflected in episodes of rapid asset price appreciation or credit growth not well supported by underlying economic fundamentals, are often followed by above-normal losses that leave banking organizations and other financial institutions undercapitalized. Therefore, the Board would most likely begin to increase the CCyB above zero in those circumstances when systemic vulnerabilities become meaningfully above normal and progressively raise the CCyB level if vulnerabilities become more severe.</P>
              <FTNT>
                <P>
                  <SU>5</SU> <E T="03">See, Federal Reserve Board Approves Final Rule Requiring The Largest, Most Systemically Important U.S. Bank Holding Companies To Further Strengthen Their Capital Positions (July 20, 2015), available at http://www.federalreserve.gov</E>.</P>
              </FTNT>
              <P>(b) The CCyB is expected to help provide additional resilience for advanced approaches institutions, and by extension the broader financial system, against elevated vulnerabilities primarily in two ways. First, advanced approaches institutions will likely hold more capital to avoid limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments resulting from implementation of the CCyB. Strengthening their capital positions when financial conditions are accommodative would increase the capacity of advanced approaches institutions to absorb outsized losses during a future significant economic downturn or period of financial instability, thus making them more resilient.</P>
              <P>(c) The second and related goal of the CCyB is to promote a more sustainable supply of credit over the economic cycle. During a credit cycle downturn, better-capitalized institutions have been shown to be more likely than weaker institutions to have continued access to funding. Better-capitalized institutions also are less likely to take actions that lead to broader financial-sector distress and its associated macroeconomic costs, such as large-scale sales of assets at prices below their fundamental value and sharp contractions in credit supply.<SU>6</SU>

                <FTREF/> Therefore, it is likely that as a result of the CCyB having been put into place during the preceding period of rapid credit creation, advanced approaches institutions would be better positioned to continue their important intermediary functions during a subsequent economic contraction. A timely and credible reduction in the CCyB requirement during a period of high credit losses could reinforce those beneficial effects of a higher base level of capital, because it would permit advanced approaches institutions either to realize loan losses promptly and remove them from their balance sheets or to expand their balance <PRTPAGE P="604"/>sheets, for example by continuing to lend to creditworthy borrowers.</P>

              </FTNT>
              <P>(d) During a period of cyclically increasing vulnerabilities, advanced approaches institutions might react to an increase in the CCyB by raising lending standards, otherwise reducing their risk exposure, augmenting their capital, or some combination of those actions. They may choose to raise capital by taking actions that would increase net income, reducing capital distributions such as share repurchases or dividends, or issuing new equity. In this regard, an increase in the CCyB would not prevent advanced approaches institutions from maintaining their important role as credit intermediaries, but would reduce the likelihood that banking organizations with insufficient capital would foster unsustainable credit growth or engage in imprudent risk taking. The specific combination of adjustments and the relative size of each adjustment will depend in part on the initial capital positions of advanced approaches institutions, the cost of debt and equity financing, and the earnings opportunities presented by the economic situation at the time.<SU>7</SU>

              <P>(a) The Board regularly monitors and assesses threats to financial stability by synthesizing information from a comprehensive set of financial-sector and macroeconomic indicators, supervisory information, surveys, and other interactions with market participants.<SU>8</SU>
                <FTREF/> In forming its view about the appropriate size of the U.S. CCyB, the Board will consider a number of financial system vulnerabilities, including but not limited to, asset valuation pressures and risk appetite, leverage in the nonfinancial sector, leverage in the financial sector, and maturity and liquidity transformation in the financial sector. The decision will reflect the implications of the assessment of overall financial system vulnerabilities as well as any concerns related to one or more classes of vulnerabilities. The specific combination of vulnerabilities is important because an adverse shock to one class of vulnerabilities could be more likely than another to exacerbate existing pressures in other parts of the economy or financial system.</P>

              </FTNT>
              <P>(b) The Board intends to monitor a wide range of financial and macroeconomic quantitative indicators including, but not limited to, measures of relative credit and liquidity expansion or contraction, a variety of asset prices, funding spreads, credit condition surveys, indices based on credit default swap spreads, option implied volatilities, and measures of systemic risk.<SU>9</SU>
                <FTREF/> In addition, empirical models that translate a manageable set of quantitative indicators of financial and economic performance into potential settings for the CCyB, when used as part of a comprehensive judgmental assessment of all available information, can be a useful input to the Board's deliberations. Such models may include, but are not limited to, those that rely on small sets of indicators—such as the nonfinancial credit-to-GDP ratio, its growth rate, and combinations of the credit-to-GDP ratio with trends in the prices of residential and commercial real estate—which some academic research has shown to be useful in identifying periods of financial excess followed by a period of crisis on a cross-country basis.<SU>10</SU>
                <FTREF/> Such models may also include those that consider larger sets of indicators, which have the advantage of representing conditions in all key sectors of the economy, especially those specific to risk-taking, performance, and the financial condition of large banks.<SU>11</SU>

              </FTNT>

              <P>(c) However, no single indictor or fixed set of indicators can adequately capture all the <PRTPAGE P="605"/>vulnerabilities in the U.S. economy and financial system. Moreover, adjustments in the CCyB that were tightly linked to a specific model or set of models could be imprecise due to the relatively short period that some indicators are available, the limited number of past crises against which the models can be calibrated, and limited experience with the CCyB as a macroprudential tool. As a result, the types of indicators and models considered in assessments of the appropriate level of the CCyB are likely to change over time based on advances in research and the experience of the Board with this new macroprudential tool.</P>
              <P>(d) The Board will determine the appropriate level of the CCyB for U.S.-based credit exposures based on its analysis of the above factors. Generally, a zero percent U.S. CCyB amount would reflect an assessment that U.S. economic and financial conditions are broadly consistent with a financial system in which levels of system-wide vulnerabilities are within or near their normal range of values. The Board could increase the CCyB as vulnerabilities build. A 2.5 percent CCyB amount for U.S.-based credit exposures, which is the maximum level under the Board's rule, would reflect an assessment that the U.S. financial sector is experiencing a period of significantly elevated or rapidly increasing system-wide vulnerabilities. Importantly, as a macroprudential policy tool, the CCyB will be activated and deactivated based on broad developments and trends in the U.S. financial system, rather than the activities of any individual banking organization.</P>
              <P>(e) Similarly, the Board would remove or reduce the CCyB when the conditions that led to its activation abate or lessen. Additionally, the Board would remove or reduce the CCyB when release of CCyB capital would promote financial stability. Indeed, for the CCyB to be most effective, the CCyB should be deactivated or reduced in a timely manner. Deactivating the CCyB in a timely manner could, for example, promote the prompt realization of loan losses by advanced approaches institutions and the removal of such loans from their balance sheets and would reduce the likelihood that advanced approaches institutions would significantly pare their risk-weighted assets in order to maintain their capital ratios during a downturn.</P>
              <P>(f) The pace and magnitude of changes in the CCyB will depend importantly on the underlying conditions in the financial sector and the economy as well as the desired effects of the proposed change in the CCyB. If vulnerabilities are rising gradually, then incremental increases in the level of the CCyB may be appropriate. Incremental increases would allow banks to augment their capital primarily through retained earnings and allow policymakers additional time to assess the effects of the policy change before making subsequent adjustments. However, if vulnerabilities in the financial system are building rapidly, then larger or more frequent adjustments may be necessary to increase loss-absorbing capacity sooner and potentially to mitigate the rise in vulnerabilities.</P>
              <P>(g) The Board will also consider whether the CCyB is the most appropriate of its available policy instruments to address the financial system vulnerabilities highlighted by the framework's judgmental assessments and empirical models. The CCyB primarily is intended to address cyclical vulnerabilities, rather than structural vulnerabilities that do not vary significantly over time. Structural vulnerabilities are better addressed through targeted reforms or permanent increases in financial system resilience. Two central factors for the Board to consider are whether advanced approaches institutions are exposed—either directly or indirectly—to the vulnerabilities identified in the comprehensive judgmental assessment or by the quantitative indicators that suggest activation of the CCyB and whether advanced approaches institutions are contributing—either directly or indirectly—to these highlighted vulnerabilities.</P>
              <P>(h) In setting the CCyB for advanced approaches institutions that it supervises, the Board plans to consult with the OCC and FDIC on their analyses of financial system vulnerabilities and on the extent to which advanced approaches banking organizations are either exposed to or contributing to these vulnerabilities.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">5. Communication of the U.S. CCyB With the Public</HD>
              <P>(a) The Board expects to consider at least once per year the applicable level of the U.S. CCyB. The Board will review financial conditions regularly throughout the year and may adjust the CCyB more frequently as a result of those monitoring activities.</P>

              <P>(b) Further, the Board will continue to communicate with the public in other formats regarding its assessment of U.S. financial stability, including financial system vulnerabilities. In the event that the Board considered that a change in the CCyB were appropriate, it would, in proposing the change, include a discussion of the reasons for the proposed action as determined by the particular circumstances. In addition, the Board's biannual Monetary Policy Report to Congress, usually published in February and July, will continue to contain a section that reports on developments pertaining to the <PRTPAGE P="606"/>stability of the U.S. financial system.<SU>12</SU>

              <P>(a) The effects of the U.S. CCyB ultimately will depend on the level at which it is set, the size and nature of any adjustments in the level, and the timeliness with which it is increased or decreased. The extent to which the CCyB may affect vulnerabilities in the broader financial system depends upon a complex set of interactions between required capital levels at the largest banking organizations and the economy and financial markets. In addition to the direct effects, the secondary economic effects could be amplified if financial markets extract a signal from the announcement of a change in the CCyB about subsequent actions that might be taken by the Board. Moreover, financial market participants might react by updating their expectations about future asset prices in specific markets or broader economic activity based on the concerns expressed by the regulators in communications announcing a policy change.</P>
              <P>(b) The Board will monitor and analyze adjustments by banking organizations and other financial institutions to the CCyB: whether a change in the CCyB leads to observed changes in risk-based capital ratios at advanced approaches institutions, as well as whether those adjustments are achieved passively through retained earnings, or actively through changes in capital distributions or in risk-weighted assets. Other factors to be monitored include the extent to which loan growth and interest rate spreads on loans made by affected banking organizations change relative to loan growth and loan spreads at banking organizations that are not subject to the buffer. Another consideration in setting the CCyB and other macroprudential tools is the extent to which the adjustments by advanced approaches institutions to higher capital buffers lead to migration of credit market activity outside of those banking organizations, especially to the nonbank financial sector. Depending on the amount of migration, which institutions are affected by it, and the remaining exposures of advanced approaches institutions, those adjustments could cause the Board to favor either a higher or a lower value of the CCyB.</P>
              <P>(c) The Board will also monitor information regarding the levels of and changes in the CCyB in other countries. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is expected to maintain this information for member countries in a publically available form on its Web site.<SU>13</SU>
                <FTREF/> Using that data in conjunction with supervisory and publicly available datasets, the Board will be able to draw not only upon the experience of the United States but also that of other countries to refine estimates of the effects of changes in the CCyB.</P>

              <P>This subpart of Regulation S (12 CFR part 219, subpart B) is issued by the Board under the authority of section 21(b) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1829b), as amended by the Annunzio-Wylie Anti-Money Laundering Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-550, title XV; 106 Stat. 3672, 4044), which authorizes the Board and the Secretary of the Treasury jointly to prescribe recordkeeping and reporting requirements for domestic wire transfers by insured depository institutions; and which also requires the Board and the Treasury jointly to prescribe recordkeeping and reporting requirements for international wire transfers by insured depository institutions and by nonbank financial institutions. The definitions and recordkeeping and reporting requirements referenced in this subpart are promulgated and administered jointly by the Board and the Treasury and are codified in 31 CFR 1010.100, 1010.410(e), and 1020.410(a). This subpart does not apply to a particular person or class of persons or a particular transaction or class of transactions to the extent that the Treasury has determined that 31 CFR 1010.410(e) or 1020.410(a) do not apply to that person, transaction, or class of persons or transactions. These recordkeeping and reporting requirements will assist in the prosecution of money laundering activities and are determined to have a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax or regulatory investigations or proceedings.</P>
