      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, January 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

          <P>(3) Copies of all records, regardless of form or format, are available for public inspection in an electronic format if they:</P>
          <P>(i) Have been released to any person under paragraph (b) of this section; and</P>

          <P>(4) An index of the records referred to in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section is available for public inspection in an electronic format.</P>

Unless specifically authorized by the Council, or as set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the following records, and portions thereof, are not available to the public:</P>
          <P>(i) A record, or portion thereof, which is specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and which is, in fact, properly classified pursuant to such Executive Order.</P>
          <P>(ii) A record, or portion thereof, relating solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency.</P>
          <P>(iii) A record, or portion thereof, specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than 5 U.S.C. 552b), provided that such statute:</P>
          <P>(A) Requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue; or</P>
          <P>(B) Establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld.</P>
          <P>(iv) A record, or portion thereof, containing trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential.</P>
          <P>(v) An intra-agency or interagency memorandum or letter that would not be routinely available by law to a private party in litigation, including, but not limited to, memoranda, reports, and other documents prepared by the personnel of the Council or its constituent agencies, and records of deliberations of the Council and discussions of meetings of the Council, any Council Committee, or Council staff, that are not subject to 5 U.S.C. 552b (the Government in the Sunshine Act).

          <P>(vi) A personnel, medical, or similar record, including a financial record, or any portion thereof, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.</P>
          <P>(vii) Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, to the extent permitted under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7), including records relating to a proceeding by a financial institution's State or Federal regulatory agency for the issuance of a cease-anddesist order, or order of suspension or removal, or assessment of a civil money penalty and the granting, withholding, or revocation of any approval, permission, or authority.</P>
          <P>(viii) A record, or portion thereof, containing, relating to, or derived from an examination, operating, or condition report prepared by, or on behalf of, or for the use of any State or Federal agency directly or indirectly responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions.</P>

          </P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Discretionary release of exempt information.</E> Notwithstanding the applicability of an exemption, the Council will only withhold records requested under this paragraph (b) if the Council reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption listed in 5 U.S.C. 552(b) and described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. In addition, whenever the Council determines that full disclosure of a requested record is not possible, the Council will consider whether partial disclosure is possible and will take reasonable steps necessary to segregate and release the nonexempt portion of a record. The Council or the Council's designee may elect, under the circumstances of a particular request, to disclose all or a portion of any requested record where permitted by law. Such disclosure has no precedential significance.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Procedure for records request</E>-(i) <E T="03">Initial request.</E> Requests for records shall be submitted in writing to the Executive Secretary of the Council:</P>
          <P>(A) By sending a letter to: FFIEC, Attn: Executive Secretary, 3501 Fairfax Drive, Room B-708la, Arlington, VA, 22226-3550. Both the mailing envelope and the request should be marked “Freedom of Information Request,” “FOIA Request,” or the like; or</P>
          <P>(B) By facsimile clearly marked “Freedom of Information Act Request,” “FOIA Request,” or the like to the Executive Secretary at (703) 562-6446; or</P>

          <P>(C) By email to the address provided on the FFIEC's World Wide Web page, found at: <E T="03">http://www.ffiec.gov.</E> Requests must reasonably describe the records sought.</P>
          <P>(ii) <E T="03">Contents of request.</E> All requests should contain the following information:</P>
          <P>(A) The name and mailing address of the requester, an electronic mail address, if available, and the telephone number at which the requester may be reached during normal business hours;</P>
          <P>(B) A statement as to whether the information is intended for commercial use, and whether the requester is an educational or noncommercial scientific institution, or news media representative; and</P>
          <P>(C) A statement agreeing to pay all applicable fees, or a statement identifying any desired fee limitation, or a request for a waiver or reduction of fees that satisfies paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(H) of this section.</P>
          <P>(iii) <E T="03">Defective requests.</E> The Council need not accept or process a request that does not reasonably describe the records requested or that does not otherwise comply with the requirements of this section. The Executive Secretary may return a defective request specifying the deficiency. The requester may submit a corrected request, which will be treated as an initial request.</P>
          <P>(iv) <E T="03">Expedited processing.</E> (A) Where a person requesting expedited access to records has demonstrated a compelling need for the records, or where the Executive Secretary has determined to expedite the response, the Executive Secretary shall process the request as soon as practicable. To show a compelling need for expedited processing, the requester shall provide a statement demonstrating that:</P>
          <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Failure to obtain the records on an expedited basis could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or</P>
          <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The requester is primarily engaged in information dissemination as a main professional occupation or activity, and there is urgency to inform the public of the government activity involved in the request.</P>
          <P>(B) The requester's statement must be certified to be true and correct to the best of the person's knowledge and belief and explain in detail the basis for requesting expedited processing.</P>
          <P>(C) The formality of the certification required to obtain expedited treatment may be waived by the Executive Secretary as a matter of administrative discretion.</P>
          <P>(v) <E T="03">Response to initial requests.</E> (A) Except where the Executive Secretary has determined to expedite the processing of a request, the Executive Secretary will respond by mail or electronic mail to all properly submitted initial requests within 20 working days of receipt. The time for response may be extended up to 10 additional working <PRTPAGE P="8"/>days in unusual circumstances, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B), where the Council has provided written notice to the requester setting forth the reasons for the extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be dispatched. In addition, where the extension of the 20-day time limit exceeds 10 working days, as described by the FOIA, the requester shall be provided with an opportunity to modify the scope of the FOIA request so that it can be processed within that time frame or provided an opportunity to arrange an alternative time frame for processing the request or a modified request. To aid the requester, the Council's FOIA Public Liaison is available to assist the requester for this purpose and in the resolution of any disputes between the requester and the Council. The Council's FOIA Public Liaison's contact information is available at <E T="03">http://www.ffiec.gov/foia.htm.</E> The requester may also seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services.</P>
          <P>(B) In response to a request that reasonably describes the records sought and otherwise satisfies the requirements of this section, a search shall be conducted of records in existence and maintained by the Council on the date of receipt of the request, and a review made of any responsive information located. The Executive Secretary shall notify the requester of:</P>
          <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The Executive Secretary's determination of the response to the request;</P>
          <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The reasons for the determination;</P>
          <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) The right of the requester to seek assistance from the Council's FOIA Public Liaison; and</P>
          <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) When an adverse determination is made (including a determination that the requested record is exempt, in whole or in part; the request does not reasonably describe the records sought; the information requested is not a record subject to the FOIA; the requested record does not exist, cannot be located, or has been destroyed; the requested record is not readily reproducible in the form or format sought by the requester; a fee waiver request or other fee categorization matter is denied; and a request for expedited processing is denied), the Executive Secretary will advise the requester in writing of that determination and will further advise the requester:</P>
          <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) If the denial is in part or in whole;</P>
          <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) The name and title of each person responsible for the denial (when other than the person signing the notification);</P>
          <P>(<E T="03">iii</E>) The exemptions relied on for the denial;</P>
          <P>(<E T="03">iv</E>) The right of the requester to appeal any adverse determination to the Chairman of the Council within 90 days following the date of issuance of the notification, as specified in paragraph (b)(3)(vi) of this section; and</P>
          <P>(<E T="03">v</E>) The right of the requester to seek dispute resolution services from the Council's FOIA Public Liaison or the Office of Government Information Services.</P>
          <P>(vi) <E T="03">Appeals of responses to initial requests.</E> A requester may appeal any adverse determination in writing, within 90 days of the date of issuance of the adverse determination. Appeals should refer to the date and tracking number of the original request and the date of the Council's initial ruling. Appeals should include an explanation of the basis for the appeal. Appeals shall be submitted to the Chairman of the Council:</P>
          <P>(A) By sending a letter to: FFIEC, Attn: Executive Secretary, 3501 Fairfax Drive, Room B-7081a, Arlington, VA, 22226-3550. Both the mailing envelope and the request should be marked “Freedom of Information Act Appeal,” “FOIA Appeal,” or the like; or</P>
          <P>(B) By facsimile clearly marked “Freedom of Information Act Appeal,” “FOIA Appeal,” or the like to the Executive Secretary at (703) 562-6446; or</P>

          <P>(C) By email with the subject line marked “Freedom of Information Act Appeal,” “FOIA Appeal,” or the like to <E T="03">FOIA@ffiec.gov.</E>
          </P>
          <P>(vii) <E T="03">Council response to appeals.</E> The Chairman of the Council, or another member designated by the Chairman, will respond to all properly submitted appeals within 20 working days of actual receipt of the appeal by the Executive Secretary. The time for response may be extended up to 10 additional working days, as provided in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B), or for other periods by <PRTPAGE P="9"/>agreement between the requester and the Chairman or the Chairman's designee.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Procedure for access to records if request is granted.</E> (i) When a request for access to records is granted, in whole or in part, a copy of the records to be disclosed will be promptly delivered to the requester or made available for inspection in an electronic format, whichever was requested. Inspection of records, or duplication and delivery of copies of records, will be arranged so as not to interfere with their use by the Council and other users of the records.</P>
          <P>(ii) When delivery to the requester is to be made, copies of requested records shall be sent to the requester by regular U.S. mail to the address indicated in the request, unless the Executive Secretary deems it appropriate to send the documents by another means.</P>
          <P>(iii) The Council shall provide a copy of the record in any form or format requested if the record is readily reproducible by the Council in that form or format, but the Council need not provide more than one copy of any record to a requester.</P>
          <P>(iv) By arrangement with the requester, the Executive Secretary may elect to send the responsive records electronically if a substantial portion of the records is in electronic format. If the information requested is subject to disclosure under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, it will not be sent by electronic means unless reasonable security measures can be established.</P>
          <P>(5) <E T="03">Fees for document search, review, and duplication; waiver and reduction of fee</E>—(i) <E T="03">Definitions</E>—(A) <E T="03">Direct costs</E> means those expenditures which the Council actually incurs in searching for, duplicating, and reviewing documents to respond to a FOIA request.</P>
          <P>(B) <E T="03">Search</E> means all time spent looking for material that is responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line identification of material within documents. Searches may be done manually or by computer using existing programming.</P>
          <P>(C) <E T="03">Duplication</E> means the process of making a copy of a document necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Such copies can take the form of paper copy, microfilm, audiovisual records, or machine readable records (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> magnetic tape or computer disk).</P>
          <P>(D) <E T="03">Review</E> means the process of examining documents located in response to a request that is for a commercial use (<E T="03">see</E> paragraph (b)(5)(i)(E) of this section) to determine whether any portion of any document located is permitted to be withheld and processing such documents for disclosure.</P>
          <P>(E) <E T="03">Commercial use request</E> means a request from or on behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made. In determining whether a request falls within this category, the Executive Secretary will determine the use to which a requester will put the records requested and seek additional information as the Executive Secretary deems necessary.</P>
          <P>(F) <E T="03">Educational institution</E> means a preschool, an elementary or secondary school, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an institution of graduate higher education, an institution of professional education, and an institution of vocational education, which operates a program or programs of scholarly research.</P>
          <P>(G) <E T="03">Noncommercial scientific institution</E> means an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis as that term is referenced in paragraph (b)(5)(i)(E) of this section, and which is operated solely for the purposes of conducting scientific research, the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.</P>
          <P>(H) <E T="03">Representative of the news media</E> means any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. In this paragraph (b)(5)(i)(H), the term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news-media entities are television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large and publishers of periodicals (but only if such entities qualify as disseminators of “news”) who make their products available for purchase <PRTPAGE P="10"/>by or subscription by or free distribution to the general public. These examples are not all-inclusive. Moreover, as methods of news delivery evolve (for example, the adoption of the electronic dissemination of newspapers through telecommunications services), such alternative media shall be considered to be news-media entities. A freelance journalist shall be regarded as working for a news-media entity if the journalist can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that entity, whether or not the journalist is actually employed by the entity. A publication contract would present a solid basis for such an expectation; the Council may also consider the past publication record of the requester in making such a determination.</P>
          <P>(ii) <E T="03">Fees to be charged.</E> The Council will charge fees that recoup the full allowable direct costs it incurs, except that the charging of search and/or duplication fees is subject to the restrictions of paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(G) of this section. The Council may contract with the private sector to locate, reproduce, and/or disseminate records. Provided, however, that the Council has ensured that the ultimate cost to the requester is no greater than it would be if the Council performed these tasks. Fees are subject to change as costs change. In no case will the Council contract out responsibilities which the FOIA provides that it alone may discharge, such as determining the applicability of an exemption, or determining whether to waive or reduce fees.</P>
          <P>(A) <E T="03">Manual searches and review.</E> The Council will charge fees at the following rates for manual searches for and review of records:</P>
          <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) If search/review is done by clerical staff, the hourly rate for GS-7, step 5, plus 16 percent of the rate to cover benefits;</P>
          <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) If search/review is done by professional staff, the hourly rate for GS-13, step 5, plus 16 percent of the rate to cover benefits.</P>
          <P>(B) <E T="03">Computer searches.</E> The Council will charge fees at the hourly rate for GS-13, step 5, plus 16 percent of the rate to cover benefits, plus the hourly cost of operating the computer for computer searches for records.</P>
          <P>(C) <E T="03">Duplication of records.</E> (<E T="03">1</E>) The per-page fee for paper copy reproduction of a document is $.25;</P>
          <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The fee for records generated by computer is the hourly rate for the computer operator (at GS-7, step 5, plus 16 percent for benefits if clerical staff, and GS-13, step 5, plus 16 percent for benefits if professional staff) plus the cost of materials (computer paper, tapes, disks, labels, etc.).</P>
          <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) If any other method of duplication is used, the Council will charge the actual direct cost of duplicating the records.</P>
          <P>(D) <E T="03">Hourly rates.</E> If search, duplication and/or review is provided by personnel of member agencies of the Council, fees will reflect their actual hourly rates, plus 16 percent for benefits.</P>
          <P>(E) <E T="03">Fees to exceed $25.</E> If the Council estimates that duplication and/or search fees are likely to exceed $25, it will notify the requester of the estimated amount of fees, unless the requester has indicated in advance his/her willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. In the case of such notification by the Council, the requester will then have the opportunity to confer with the Council's FOIA Public Liaison with the object of reformulating the request to meet his/her needs at a lower cost.</P>
          <P>(F) <E T="03">Other services.</E> Complying with requests for special services such as certifying records as true copies or mailing records by express mail is entirely at the discretion of the Council. The Council will recover the full costs of providing such services to the extent it elects to provide them.</P>
          <P>(G) <E T="03">Restriction on assessing fees.</E> (<E T="03">1</E>) The Council will not charge fees to any requester, including commercial use requesters, if the cost of collecting a fee would be equal to or greater than the fee itself.</P>
          <P>(<E T="03">2</E>)(<E T="03">i</E>) If the Council fails to comply with the time limits specified in the FOIA in which to respond to a request, the Council will not charge search fees, or, in the case of a requester described in paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(B) of this section, will not charge duplication fees, except as described in paragraphs (b)(5)(ii)(G)(<E T="03">2</E>)(<E T="03">ii</E>) through (<E T="03">iv</E>) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="11"/>
          </P>
          <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) If the Council has determined that unusual circumstances apply (as the term is defined in the FOIA) and the Council provided a timely written notice to the requester in accordance with the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limit shall be excused for an additional 10 working days.</P>
          <P>(<E T="03">iii</E>) If the Council has determined that unusual circumstances apply (as the term is defined in the FOIA) and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, the Council may charge search fees, or, in the case of requesters described in paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(B) of this section, may charge duplication fees, if the following steps are taken: The Council provided timely written notice of unusual circumstances to the requester in accordance with the FOIA; and The Council discussed with the requester via written mail, email message, or telephone (or made not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(ii). If this exception is satisfied, the Council may charge all applicable fees incurred in the processing of the request.</P>
          <P>(<E T="03">iv</E>) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist, as defined by the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limits shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.</P>
          <P>(H) <E T="03">Waiving or reducing fees.</E> As part of the initial request for records, a requester may ask that the Council waive or reduce fees if disclosure of the records is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Council and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. The initial request for records must also state the justification for a waiver or reduction of fees. Determinations as to a waiver or reduction of fees will be made by the Executive Secretary of the Council and the requester will be notified in writing of his/her determination. A determination not to grant a request for a waiver or reduction of fees under this paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(H) may be appealed to the Chairman of the Council pursuant to the procedure set forth in paragraph (b)(3)(vi) of this section.</P>
          <P>(iii) <E T="03">Categories of requesters</E>—(A) <E T="03">Commercial use requester</E>s. The Council will assess fees for commercial use requesters sufficient to recover the full direct costs of searching for, reviewing for release, and duplicating the records sought. Commercial use requesters are not entitled to two hours of free search time nor 100 free pages of reproduction of documents.</P>
          <P>(B) <E T="03">News media, educational and noncommercial scientific institution requesters.</E> Requesters who are representatives of the news media, educational and noncommercial scientific institution requesters. The Council shall provide documents to requesters in these categories for the cost of reproduction alone, excluding fees for the first 100 pages.</P>
          <P>(C) <E T="03">All other requesters.</E> The Council shall charge requesters who do not fit into any of the categories in paragraphs (b)(5)(iii)(A) and (B) of this section fees which recover the full reasonable direct cost of searching for and reproducing records that are responsive to the request, except that the first 100 pages of reproduction and the first two hours of search time shall be furnished without a fee.</P>
          <P>(D) <E T="03">Description of records.</E> All requesters must specifically describe records sought.</P>
          <P>(iv) <E T="03">Interest on unpaid fees.</E> The Council may begin assessing interest charges on an unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the day on which the bill was sent. Interest will be at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the date of the billing.</P>
          <P>(v) <E T="03">Fees for unsuccessful search and review.</E> The Council may assess fees for time spent searching and reviewing, even if it fails to locate the records or if records located are determined to be exempt from disclosure.</P>
          <P>(vi) <E T="03">Aggregating requests.</E> A requester(s) may not file multiple requests each seeking portions of a document or documents, solely in order to avoid payment of fees. If this is done, the Council may aggregate any such requests and charge accordingly. In no case will the Council aggregate multiple requests on unrelated subjects from the same requester.<PRTPAGE P="12"/>
          </P>
          <P>(vii) <E T="03">Advance payment of fees.</E> The Council will not require a requester to make an assurance of payment or an advance payment unless:</P>
          <P>(A) The Council estimates or determines that allowable charges that a requester may be required to pay are likely to exceed $250. The Council will notify the requester of the likely cost and obtain satisfactory assurance of full payment where the requester has a history of prompt payment of FOIA fees, or require an advance payment of an amount up to the full estimated charges in the case of requesters with no history of payment; or</P>
          <P>(B) A requester has previously failed to pay a fee charged in a timely fashion. The Council may require the requester to pay the full amount owed plus any applicable interest as provided in paragraph (b)(5)(iv) of this section or demonstrate that he/she has, in fact, paid the fee, and to make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated fee before the Council begins to process a new request or a pending request from that requester.</P>

          <P>(C) When the Council acts under paragraph (b)(5)(vii)(A) or (B) of this section, the administrative time limits prescribed in subsection (a)(6) of the FOIA (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> 20 working days from receipt of initial requests, plus permissible extensions of these time limits) will begin only after the Council has received the fee payments described.</P>
          <P>(6) <E T="03">Records of another agency.</E> If a requested record originated with or incorporates the information of another State or Federal agency or department, upon receipt of a request for the record the Council will promptly inform the requester of this circumstance and immediately shall forward the request to the originating agency or department either for processing in accordance with the latter's regulations or for guidance with respect to disposition.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Testimony and production of documents in response to subpoena, order, etc.</SUBJECT>
          <P>No person shall testify, in court or otherwise, as a result of activities on behalf of the Council without prior written authorization from the Council. This section shall not restrict the authority of a Council member to testify before Congress on matters within his or her official responsibilities as a Council member. No person shall furnish documents reflecting information of the Council in compliance with a subpoena, order, or otherwise, without prior written authorization from the Council. The Council may authorize testimony or production of documents after the litigant (or the litigant's attorney) submits an affidavit to the Council setting forth the interest of the litigant and the testimony or documents desired. Authorization to testify or produce documents is limited to authority expressly granted by the Council. When the Council has not authorized testimony or production of documents, the individual to whom the subpoena or order has been directed will appear in court and respectfully state that he or she is unable to comply further with the subpoena or order by reason of this section.</P>

These procedures apply whenever a State appraiser regulatory agency requests the Appraisal Subcommittee of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (“ASC”) for a waiver of any requirement relating to certification or licensing of a person to perform appraisals under title XI of FIRREA. They also apply whenever the ASC, based on sufficient, credible information or requests received from other persons or entities, initiates a temporary waiver proceeding.</P>

Such regulated financial institutions and other persons or institutions do not need to comply with § 1102.2(g) of this subpart, but are strongly encouraged to include meaningful suggestions and recommendations for remedying the situation. A copy of the request or informational submission shall be forwarded promptly to the State Appraiser Regulatory Agency. The ASC shall consider these submissions and requests in exercising its authority to initiate a temporary waiver procedure. When the ASC initiates a temporary waiver proceeding, these documents shall correspond to a received request under § 1102.4 of this subpart.</P>

            <P>(b) The terms and conditions of the waiver order are not being satisfied. The ASC shall publish a finding of waiver termination promptly in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> giving interested persons no less than 30 calendar days from publication in which to submit written data, views and arguments. In the absence of further ASC action to the contrary, the finding of waiver termination automatically shall become <PRTPAGE P="15"/>final 21 calendar days after the close of the comment period.</P>

If, upon such inquiry, it appears that one or more allegations relate to possible violations of regulations administered by another agency or instrumentality of the Federal Government, then the matter shall be referred to that agency or instrumentality for appropriate action. The ASC, pursuant to its responsibilities under section 1103(a)(2) of title XI (12 U.S.C. 3332(a)(2)) and section 1119(c) of title XI (12 U.S.C. 3348)), shall monitor the matter.

Upon request, the staff, in its discretion, may advise such persons of the general nature of the investigation, including the indicated violations as they pertain to them and the amount of time that may be available for preparing and submitting such a statement prior to the presentation of a staff recommendation to the ASC. Upon the commencement of a formal investigation or a proceeding under this subpart, the Secretary shall place any such statement in the appropriate public file.</P>
            <P>(d) In instances where the staff has concluded its inquiry of a particular matter and has determined that it will not recommend the commencement of a formal investigation or a proceeding under this subpart against a person, the staff shall advise the person that its inquiry has been terminated.

            <P>(b) The Privacy Act of 1974 is based, in part, on the finding by Congress that “in order to protect the privacy of individuals identified in information systems maintained by Federal agencies, it is necessary and proper for the Congress to regulate the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of information by such agencies.” To achieve this objective, the Act generally provides that Federal agencies must advise an individual upon request whether records maintained by the agency in a system of records pertain to the individual and must grant the individual access to such records. The Act further provides that individuals may request amendments to records pertaining to them that are maintained by the agency, and that the agency shall either grant the requested amendments or set forth fully its reasons for refusing to do so.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Times, places and requirements for requests pertaining to individual records in a record system and for the identification of individuals making requests for access to records pertaining to them.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Place to make request.</E> Any request by an individual to be advised whether any system of records maintained by the ASC and named by the individual contains a record pertaining to him or her, or any request by an individual for access to a record pertaining to him or her that is contained in a system of records maintained by the ASC, shall be submitted in person at the ASC between 9 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, which is located at 1325 G Street NW, Suite 500, Washington, DC 20005, or by mail addressed to: Privacy Act Officer, ASC, 1325 G Street NW, Suite 500, Washington, DC 20005. All requests will be required to be put in writing and signed by the individual making the request. In the case of requests for access that are made by mail, the envelope should be clearly marked “Privacy Act Request.”</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Information to be included in requests.</E> Each request by an individual concerning whether the ASC maintains in a system of records a record that pertains to the individual, or for access to any record pertaining to the individual that is maintained by the ASC in a system of records, shall include such information as will assist the ASC in identifying those records as to which <PRTPAGE P="22"/>the individual is seeking information or access. Where practicable, the individual should identify the system of records that is the subject of his or her request by reference to the ASC's notices of systems of records, which are published in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> as required by section (e)(4) of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4). Where a system of records is compiled on the basis of a specific identification scheme, the individual should include in his or her request the identification number or other identifier assigned to the individual. In the event the individual does not know that number or identifier, the individual shall provide other information, including his or her full name, address, date of birth and subject matter of the record, to aid in processing his or her request. If additional information is required before a request can be processed, the individual shall be so advised.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Verification of identity.</E> When the fact of the existence of a record is not required to be disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, or when a record as to which access has been requested is not required to be disclosed under that Act, the individual seeking the information or requesting access to the record shall be required to verify his or her identity before access will be granted or information given. For this purpose, individuals shall appear at the ASC located at 1325 G Street NW, Suite 500, Washington, DC 20005, between 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday. The ASC's Office is not open on Saturdays, Sundays or Federal holidays.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Methods for verifying identity—appearance in person.</E> For the purpose of verifying identity, an individual seeking information regarding pertinent records or access to those records shall furnish documentation that may reasonably be relied on to establish the individual's identity. Such documentation might include a valid birth certificate, driver's license, employee or military identification card, and medicare card.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Method for verifying identity—by mail.</E> Where an individual cannot appear at the ASC's Office for the purpose of verifying identity, the individual shall submit, along with the request for information or access, a signed and notarized statement attesting to his or her identity. Where access is being sought, the sworn statement shall include a representation that the records being sought pertain to the individual and a stipulation that the individual is aware that knowingly and willfully requesting or obtaining records pertaining to an individual from the ASC under false pretenses is a criminal offense.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Additional procedures for verifying identity.</E> When it appears appropriate to the Privacy Act Officer, other arrangements may be made for the verification of identity as are reasonable under the circumstances and appear to be effective to prevent unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, individual records.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Acknowledgement of requests for information pertaining to individual records in a record system or for access to individual records.</E> (1) Except where an immediate acknowledgement is given for requests made in person, the receipt of a request for information pertaining to individual records in a record system will be acknowledged within 10 days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and Federal holidays. Requests will be processed as promptly as possible and a response to such requests will be given within 30 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays) unless, within the 30 day period and for cause shown, the individual making the request is notified in writing that a longer period is necessary.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Initial review.</E> Requests by individuals for access to records pertaining to them will be referred to the ASC's Privacy Act Officer, who initially will determine whether access will be granted.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Grant of request for access.</E> (1) If it is determined that a request for access to records pertaining to an individual will be granted, the individual will be advised by mail that access will be given at the ASC or a copy of the requested record will be provided by mail if the individual shall so indicate. <PRTPAGE P="23"/>Where the individual requests that copies of the record be mailed to or her or requests copies of a record upon reviewing it at the ASC, the individual shall pay the cost of making requested copies, as set forth in § 1102.109 of this subpart.</P>
            <P>(2) In granting access to an individual to a record pertaining to him or her, the ASC staff shall take steps to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of information pertaining to other individuals.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Denial of request for access.</E> If it is determined that access will not be granted, the individual making the request will be notified of that fact and given the reasons why access is being denied. The individual also will be advised of his or her right to seek review by the Executive Director of the initial decision to deny access, in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 1102.107 of this subpart.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Time for acting on requests for access.</E> Access to a record pertaining to an individual normally will be granted or denied within 30 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays) after the receipt of the request for access, unless the individual making the request is notified in writing within the 30 day period that, for good cause shown, a longer time is required. In such cases, the individual making the request shall be informed in writing of the difficulties encountered and an indication shall be given as to when it is anticipated that access may be granted or denied.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Authorization to allow designated person to review and discuss records pertaining to another individual.</E> An individual, who is granted access to records pertaining to him or her and who appears at the ASC Office to review the records, may be accompanied by another person of his or her choosing. Where the records as to which access has been granted are not required to be disclosed under provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, the individual requesting the records, before being granted access, shall execute a written statement, signed by him or her, specifically authorizing the latter individual to review and discuss the records. If such authorization has not been given as described, the person who has accompanied the individual making the request will be excluded from any review or discussion of the records.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Exclusion for certain records.</E> Nothing contained in these rules shall allow an individual access to any information compiled in reasonable anticipation of an administrative judicial or civil action or proceeding.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Statement of physician or mental health professional.</E> When an individual requests access to records pertaining to the individual that include medical and/or psychological information, the ASC, if it deems it necessary under the particular circumstances, may require the individual to submit with the request a signed statement by the individual's physician or a mental health professional indicating that, in his or her opinion, disclosure of the requested records or information directly to the individual will not have an adverse effect on the individual.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Designation of physician or mental health professional to receive records.</E> If the ASC believes, in good faith, that disclosure of medical and/or psychological information, directly to an individual could have an adverse effect on that individual, the individual may be asked to designate in writing a physician or mental health professional to whom the individual would like the records to be disclosed, and disclosure that otherwise would be made to the individual will instead be made to the designated physician or mental health professional.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Place to make requests.</E> A request by an individual to amend records pertaining to him or her may be made in person during normal business hours at the ASC located at 1325 G Street NW, Suite 500, Washington, DC 20005, or by mail addressed to the Privacy Act Officer, ASC, 1325 G Street NW, Suite 500, Washington, DC 20005.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Information to be included in requests.</E> Each request to amend an ASC record shall reasonably describe the <PRTPAGE P="24"/>record sought to be amended. Such description should include, for example, relevant names, dates and subject matter to permit the record to be located among the records maintained by the ASC. An individual who has requested that a record pertaining to the individual be amended will be advised promptly if the record cannot be located on the basis of the description given and that further identifying information is necessary before the request can be processed. An initial evaluation of a request presented in person will be made immediately to ensure that the request is complete and to indicate what, if any, additional information will be required. Verification of the individual's identity as set forth in § 1102.102(a) (2), (3), (4) and (5) may also be required.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Basis for amendment.</E> An individual requesting an amendment to a record pertaining to the individual shall specify the substance of the amendment and set forth facts and provide such materials that would support his or her contention that the record as maintained by the ASC is not accurate, timely or complete, or that the record is not necessary and relevant to accomplish a statutory purpose of the ASC as authorized by law or by Executive Order of the President.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Acknowledgement of requests for amendment.</E> Receipt of a request to amend a record pertaining to an individual normally will be acknowledged in writing within 10 days after such request has been received, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and Federal holidays.

            <SUBJECT>Review of requests for amendment.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Initial review.</E> As in the case of requests for access, requests by individuals for amendment to records pertaining to them will be referred to the ASC's Privacy Act Officer for an initial determination.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Standards to be applied in reviewing requests.</E> In reviewing requests to amend records, the Privacy Act Officer will be guided by the criteria set forth in 5 U.S.C. 552(e) (1) and (5), <E T="03">i.e.,</E> that records maintained by the ASC shall contain only such information as is necessary and relevant to accomplish a statutory purpose of the ASC as required by statute or Executive Order of the President and that such information also be accurate, timely, relevant and complete. These criteria will be applied whether the request is to add material to a record or to delete information from a record.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Time for acting on requests.</E> Initial review of a request by an individual to amend a record shall be completed as promptly as is reasonably possible and normally within 30 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays) from the date the request was received, unless unusual circumstances preclude completion of review within that time. If the anticipated completion date indicated in the acknowledgement cannot be met, the individual requesting the amendment will be advised in writing of the delay and the reasons therefor, and also advised when action is expected to be completed.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Grant of requests to amend records.</E> If a request to amend a record is granted in whole or in part, the Privacy Act Officer will:</P>
            <P>(1) Advise the individual making the request in writing of the extent to which it has been granted;</P>
            <P>(2) Amend the record accordingly; and</P>
            <P>(3) Where an accounting of disclosures of the record has been kept pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(c), advise all previous recipients of the record of the fact that the record has been amended and the substance of the amendment.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Denial of requests to amend records.</E> If an individual's request to amend a record pertaining to him is denied in <PRTPAGE P="25"/>whole or in part, the Privacy Act Officer will:</P>
            <P>(1) Promptly advise the individual making the request in writing of the extent to which the request has been denied;</P>

            <P>(3) Describe the procedures established by the ASC to obtain further review within the ASC of the request to amend, including the name and address of the person to whom the appeal is to be addressed; and</P>

            <SUBJECT>General provisions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Extensions of time.</E> Pursuant to §§ 1102.103(b), 1102.104(d), 1102.109(c) and 1102.109(a)(4) of this subpart, the time within which a request for information, access or amendment by an individual with respect to records maintained by the ASC that pertain to him or her normally would be processed may be extended for good cause shown or because of unusual circumstances. As used in these rules, <E T="03">good cause</E> and <E T="03">unusual circumstances</E> shall include, but only to the extent reasonably necessary to the proper processing of a particular request:</P>
            <P>(1) The need to search for and collect the requested records from establishments that are separate from the ASC. Some records of the ASC may be stored in Federal Records Centers in accordance with law—including many of the documents that have been on file with the ASC for more than 2 years—and cannot be made available promptly. Any person who has requested for personal examination a record stored at the Federal Records Center will be notified when the record will be made available.</P>
            <P>(2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which may be demanded in a single request. While every reasonable effort will be made to comply fully with each request as promptly as possible on a first-come, first-served basis, work done to search for, collect and appropriately examine records in response to a request for a large number of records will be contingent upon the availability of processing personnel in accordance with an equitable allocation of time to all members of the public who have requested or wish to request records.</P>

            <P>(3) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request, or among two or <PRTPAGE P="27"/>more components within the ASC having substantial subject-matter interest herein.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Effective date of action.</E> Whenever it is provided in this subpart that an acknowledgement or response to a request will be given by specific times, deposit in the mails of such acknowledgement or response by that time, addressed to the person making the request, will be deemed full compliance.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Records in use by a member of the ASC or its staff.</E> Although every effort will be made to make a record in use by a member of the ASC or its staff available when requested, it may occasionally be necessary to delay making such a record available when doing so at the time the request is made would seriously interfere with the work of the ASC or its staff.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Missing or lost records.</E> Any person who has requested a record or a copy of a record pertaining to him or her will be notified if the record sought cannot be found. If the person so requests, he or she will be notified if the record subsequently is found.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Oral requests; misdirected written requests</E>—(1) <E T="03">Telephone and other oral requests.</E> Before responding to any request by an individual for information concerning whether records maintained by the ASC in a system of records pertain to the individual or to any request for access to records by an individual, such request must be in writing and signed by the individual making the request. The Executive Director will not entertain any appeal from an alleged denial of failure to comply with an oral request. Any person who has made an oral request for information or access to records who believes that the request has been improperly denied should resubmit the request in appropriate written form to obtain proper consideration and, if need be, administrative review.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Misdirected written requests.</E> The ASC cannot assure that a timely or satisfactory response will be given to written requests for information, access or amendment by an individual with respect to records pertaining to him or her that are directed to the ASC other than in a manner prescribed in §§ 1102.103(a), 1102.106(a), 1102.108(a)(2), and 1102.110 of this subpart. Any staff member who receives a written request for information, access or amendment should promptly forward the request to the Privacy Act Officer. Misdirected requests for records will be considered to have been received by the ASC only when they have been actually received by the Privacy Act Officer in cases under § 1102.108(a)(2). The Executive Director will not entertain any appeal from an alleged denial or failure to comply with a misdirected request, unless it is clearly shown that the request was in fact received by the Privacy Act Officer.</P>

Copies of the ASC's records will be provided by a commercial copier at rates established by a contract between the copier and the ASC or by the ASC at the rates in § 1101.4(b)(5)(ii) of 12 CFR part 1101.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Waiver or reduction of fees.</E> Whenever the Executive Director of the ASC determines that good cause exists to grant a request for reduction or waiver of fees for copying documents, he or she may reduce or waive any such fees.</P>

            <P>(iii) A statement agreeing to pay the applicable fees, or a statement identifying a maximum fee that is acceptable to the requester, or a request for a waiver or reduction of fees that satisfies paragraph (e)(1)(x) of this section; and</P>
            <P>(iv) The preferred form and format of any responsive information requested, if other than paper copies.</P>
            <P>(3) A request for identifiable records shall reasonably describe the records in a way that enables the ASC's staff to identify and produce the records with reasonable effort and without unduly burdening or significantly interfering with any ASC operations.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Defective requests.</E> The ASC need not accept or process a request that does not reasonably describe the records requested or that does not otherwise comply with the requirements of this subpart. The ASC may return a defective request, specifying the deficiency. The requester may submit a corrected request, which will be treated as a new request.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Processing requests</E>—(1) <E T="03">Receipt of requests.</E> Upon receipt of any request that satisfies paragraph (a) of this section, the Executive Director shall assign the request to the appropriate processing track pursuant to this section.

            <P>(2) <E T="03">Expedited processing.</E> (i) Where a person requesting expedited access to records has demonstrated a compelling need for the records, or where the ASC has determined to expedite the response, the ASC shall process the request as soon as practicable. To show a compelling need for expedited processing, the requester shall provide a statement demonstrating that:</P>
            <P>(A) The failure to obtain the records on an expedited basis could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or</P>

            <P>(B) The requester can establish that it is primarily engaged in information dissemination as its main professional <PRTPAGE P="32"/>occupation or activity, and there is urgency to inform the public of the government activity involved in the re request; and</P>
            <P>(C) The requester's statement must be certified to be true and correct to the best of the person's knowledge and belief and explain in detail the basis for requesting expedited processing.</P>
            <P>(ii) The formality of the certification required to obtain expedited treatment may be waived by the Executive Director as a matter of administrative discretion.</P>
            <P>(3) A requester seeking expedited processing will be notified whether expedited processing has been granted within ten (10) working days of the receipt of the request. If the request for expedited processing is denied, the requester may file an appeal pursuant to the procedures set forth in paragraph (g) of this section, and the ASC shall respond to the appeal within ten (10) working days after receipt of the appeal.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Priority of responses.</E> Consistent with sound administrative process, the ASC processes requests in the order they are received. However, in the ASC's discretion, or upon a court order in a matter to which the ASC is a party, a particular request may be processed out of turn.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Notification.</E> (i) The time for response to requests will be twenty (20) working days except:</P>
            <P>(A) In the case of expedited treatment under paragraph (c)(2) of this section;</P>
            <P>(B) Where the running of such time is suspended for the calculation of a cost estimate for the requester if the ASC determines that the processing of the request may exceed the requester's maximum fee provision or if the charges are likely to exceed $250 as provided for in paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section;</P>
            <P>(C) Where the running of such time is suspended for the payment of fees pursuant to the paragraph (c)(5)(i)(B) and (e)(1) of this section; or</P>
            <P>(D) In unusual circumstances, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B) and further described in paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section.</P>
            <P>(ii) In unusual circumstances as referred to in paragraph (c)(5)(i)(D) of this section, the time limit may be extended for a period of:</P>
            <P>(A) Ten (10) working days as provided by written notice to the requester, setting forth the reasons for the extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be dispatched; or</P>
            <P>(B) Such alternative time period as agreed to by the requester or as reasonably determined by the ASC when the ASC notifies the requester that the request cannot be processed in the specified time limit.</P>
            <P>(iii) Unusual circumstances may arise when:</P>
            <P>(A) The records are in facilities that are not located at the ASC's Washington office;</P>
            <P>(B) The records requested are voluminous or are not in close proximity to one another; or</P>
            <P>(C) There is a need to consult with another agency or among two or more components of the ASC having a substantial interest in the determination.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Response to request.</E> In response to a request that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, a search shall be conducted of records maintained by the ASC in existence on the date of receipt of the request, and a review made of any responsive information located. To the extent permitted by law, the ASC may redact identifying details when it makes available or publishes any records. If redaction is appropriate, the ASC will, to the extent technically feasible, indicate the amount of material deleted at the place in the record where such deletion is made unless that indication in and of itself will jeopardize the purpose for the redaction. The ASC shall notify the requester of:</P>
            <P>(i) The ASC's determination of the request;</P>
            <P>(ii) The reasons for the determination;</P>
            <P>(iii) If the response is a denial of an initial request or if any information is withheld, the ASC will advise the requester in writing:</P>
            <P>(A) If the denial is in part or in whole;</P>

            <P>(B) The name and title of each person responsible for the denial (when other than the person signing the notification);<PRTPAGE P="33"/>
            </P>
            <P>(C) The exemptions relied on for the denial; and</P>
            <P>(D) The right of the requester to appeal the denial to the Chairman of the ASC within 30 business days following receipt of the notification, as specified in paragraph (h) of this section.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Providing responsive records.</E> (1) Copies of requested records shall be sent to the requester by regular U.S. mail to the address indicated in the request, unless the requester elects to take delivery of the documents at the ASC or makes other acceptable arrangements, or the ASC deems it appropriate to send the documents by another means.</P>
            <P>(2) The ASC shall provide a copy of the record in any form or format requested if the record is readily reproducible by the ASC in that form or format, but the ASC need not provide more than one copy of any record to a requester.</P>
            <P>(3) By arrangement with the requester, the ASC may elect to send the responsive records electronically if a substantial portion of the request is in electronic format. If the information requested is made pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, it will not be sent by electronic means unless reasonable security measures can be provided.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Fees</E>—(1) <E T="03">General rules.</E> (i) Persons requesting records of the ASC shall be charged for the direct costs of search, duplication, and review as set forth in paragraphs (e)(2) and (e)(3) of this section, unless such costs are less than the ASC's cost of processing the requester's remittance.</P>
            <P>(ii) Requesters will be charged for search and review costs even if responsive records are not located or, if located, are determined to be exempt from disclosure.</P>
            <P>(iii) Multiple requests seeking similar or related records from the same requester or group of requesters will be aggregated for the purposes of this section.</P>
            <P>(iv) If the ASC determines that the estimated costs of search, duplication, or review of requested records will exceed the dollar amount specified in the request, or if no dollar amount is specified, the ASC will advise the requester of the estimated costs. The requester must agree in writing to pay the costs of search, duplication, and review prior to the ASC initiating any records search.</P>
            <P>(v) If the ASC estimates that its search, duplication, and review costs will exceed $250, the requester must pay an amount equal to 20 percent of the estimated costs prior to the ASC initiating any records search.</P>
            <P>(vi) The ASC ordinarily will collect all applicable fees under the final invoice before releasing copies of requested records to the requester.</P>
            <P>(vii) The ASC may require any requester who has previously failed to pay charges under this section within 30 calendar days of mailing of the invoice to pay in advance the total estimated costs of search, duplication, and review. The ASC also may require a requester who has any charges outstanding in excess of 30 calendar days following mailing of the invoice to pay the full amount due, or demonstrate that the fee has been paid in full, prior to the ASC initiating any additional records search.</P>
            <P>(viii) The ASC may begin assessing interest charges on unpaid bills on the 31st day following the day on which the invoice was sent. Interest will be at the rate prescribed in § 3717 of title 31 of the United States Code and will accrue from the date of the invoice.</P>
            <P>(ix) The time limit for the ASC to respond to a request will not begin to run until the ASC has received the requester's written agreement under paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section, and advance payment under paragraph (e)(1)(v) or (vii) of this section, or payment of outstanding charges under paragraph (e)(1)(vii) or (viii) of this section.</P>

            <P>(x) As part of the initial request, a requester may ask that the ASC waive or reduce fees if disclosure of the records is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Determinations as to a waiver or reduction of fees will be made by the Executive Director (or designee), and the requester will be notified in writing of <PRTPAGE P="34"/>his or her determination. A determination not to grant a request for a waiver or reduction of fees under this paragraph may be appealed to the ASC's Chairman pursuant to the procedure set forth in paragraph (g) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Chargeable fees by category of requester.</E> (i) Commercial use requesters shall be charged search, duplication, and review costs.</P>
            <P>(ii) Educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, and news media representatives shall be charged duplication costs, except for the first 100 pages.</P>
            <P>(iii) Requesters not described in paragraph (e)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section shall be charged the full reasonable direct cost of search and duplication, except for the first two hours of search time and first 100 pages of duplication.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Fee schedule.</E> The dollar amount of fees which the ASC may charge to records requesters will be established by the Executive Director. The ASC may charge fees that recoup the full allowable direct costs it incurs. Fees are subject to change as costs change. The fee schedule will be published periodically on the ASC's Internet World Wide Web site (<E T="03">http://www.asc.gov</E>) and will be effective on the date of publication. Copies of the fee schedule may be obtained by request at no charge by contacting the Executive Director by letter, Internet email or facsimile.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Manual searches for records.</E> The ASC will charge for manual searches for records at the basic rate of pay of the employee making the search plus 16 percent to cover employee benefit costs.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Computer searches for records.</E> The fee for searches of computerized records is the actual direct cost of the search, including computer time, computer runs, and the operator's time apportioned to the search multiplied by the operator's basic rate of pay plus 16 percent to cover employee benefit costs.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Duplication of records.</E> (A) The per-page fee for paper copy reproduction of documents is $.25.</P>
            <P>(B) For other methods of reproduction or duplication, the ASC will charge the actual direct costs of reproducing or duplicating the documents, including each involved employee's basic rate of pay plus 16 percent to cover employee benefit costs.</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Review of records.</E> The ASC will charge commercial use requesters for the review of records at the time of processing the initial request to determine whether they are exempt from mandatory disclosure at the basic rate of pay of the employee making the search plus 16 percent to cover employee benefit costs. The ASC will not charge at the administrative appeal level for review of an exemption already applied. When records or portions of records are withheld in full under an exemption which is subsequently determined not to apply, the ASC may charge for a subsequent review to determine the applicability of other exemptions not previously considered.</P>
            <P>(v) <E T="03">Other services.</E> Complying with requests for special services, other than a readily produced electronic form or format, is at the ASC's discretion. The ASC may recover the full costs of providing such services to the requester.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Use of contractors.</E> The ASC may contact with independent contractors to locate, reproduce, and/or disseminate records; provided, however, that the ASC has determined that the ultimate cost to the requester will be no greater than it would be if the ASC performed these tasks itself. In no case will the ASC contract our responsibilities which FOIA provides that the ASC alone may discharge, such as determining the applicability of an exemption or whether to waive or reduce fees.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Exempt information.</E> A request for records may be denied if the requested record contains information that falls into one or more of the following categories. <SU>1</SU>

              <FTREF/> If the requested record contains both exempt and nonexempt information, the nonexempt portions, <PRTPAGE P="35"/>which may reasonable be segregated from the exempt portions, will be released to the requester. If redaction is necessary, the ASC will, to the extent technically feasible, indicate the amount of material deleted at the place in the record where such deletion is made unless that indication in and of itself will jeopardize the purpose for the redaction. The categories of exempt records are as follows:</P>

            <SUBJECT>Disclosure of exempt records.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Disclosure prohibited.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section or by 12 CFR part 1102, subpart C, no person shall disclose or permit the disclosure of any exempt records, or information contained therein, to any persons other than those officers, directors, employees, or agents of the ASC or a State appraiser regulatory agency who has a need for such records in the performance of their official duties. In any instance in which any person has possession, custody or control of ASC exempt records or information contained therein, all copies of such records shall remain the property of the ASC and under no circumstances shall any person, entity or agency disclose or make public in any manner the exempt records or information without written authorization from the Executive Director, after consultation with the ASC General Counsel.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Disclosure authorized.</E> Exempt records or information of the ASC may be disclosed only in accordance with the conditions and requirements set forth in this paragraph (b). Requests for discretionary disclosure of exempt records of information pursuant to this paragraph (b) may be submitted directly to the Executive Director. Such administrative request must clearly state that it seeks discretionary disclosure of exempt records, clearly identify the records sought, provide sufficient information for the ASC to evaluate whether there is good cause for disclosure, and meet all other conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(1) through (3) of this section. Authority to disclose or authorize disclosure of exempt records of the ASC is delegated to the Executive Director, after consultation with the ASC General Counsel.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Disclosure by Executive Director.</E> (i) The Executive Director, or designee, may disclose or authorize the disclosure of any exempt record in response to a valid judicial subpoena, court order, or other legal process, and authorize any current or former member, officer, employee, agent of the ASC, or third party, to appear and testify regarding an exempt record or any information obtained in the performance of such person's official duties, at any administrative or judicial hearing or proceeding where such person has been served with a valid subpoena, court order, or other legal process requiring him or her to testify. The Executive Director shall consider the relevancy of such exempt records or testimony to the ligation, and the interests of justice, in determining whether to disclose such records or testimony. Third parties seeking disclosure of exempt records or testimony in litigation to which the ASC is not a party shall submit a request for discretionary disclosure directly to the Executive Director. Such requests shall specify the information sought with reasonable particularity and shall be accompanied by a statement with supporting documentation showing in detail the relevance of such exempt information to the litigation, justifying good cause for disclosure, and a commitment to be bound by a protective order. Failure to exhaust such administration request prior to service of a subpoena or other legal process may, in the Executive Director's discretion, serve as a basis for objection to such subpoena or legal process.</P>

            <P>(ii) The Executive Director, or designee, may in his or her discretion and for good cause, disclose or authorize <PRTPAGE P="37"/>disclosure of any exempt record or testimony by a current or former member, officer, employee, agent of the ASC, or third party, sought in connection with any civil or criminal hearing, proceeding or investigation without the service of a judicial subpoena, or other legal process requiring such disclosure or testimony. If he or she determines that the records or testimony are relevant to the hearing, proceeding or investigation and that disclosure is in the best interests of justice and not otherwise prohibited by Federal statute. Where the Executive Director or designee authorizes a current or former member, officer, director, empl9oyee or agent of the ASC to testify or disclose exempt records pursuant to this paragraph (b)(1), he or she may, in his or her discretion, limit the authorization to so much of the record or testimony as is relevant to the issues at such hearing, proceeding or investigation, and he or she shall give authorization only upon fulfillment of such conditions as he or she deems necessary and practicable to protect the confidential nature of such records or testimony.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Authorization for disclosure by the Chairman of the ASC.</E> Except where expressly prohibited by law, the Chairman of the ASC may, in his or her discretion, authorize the disclosure of any ASC records. Except where disclosure is required by law, the Chairman may direct any current or former member, officer, director, employee or agent of the ASC to refuse to disclose any record or to give testimony if the Chairman determines, in his or her discretion, that refusal to permit such disclosure is in the public interest.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Limitations on disclosure.</E> All steps practicable shall be taken to protect the confidentiality of exempt records and information. Any disclosure permitted by paragraph (b) of this section is discretionary and nothing in paragraph (b) of this section shall be construed as requiring the disclosure of information. Further, nothing in paragrah (b) of this section shall be construed as restricting, in any manner, the authority of the ASC, the Chairman of the ASC, the Executive Director, the ASC General Counsel, or their designees, in their discretion and in light of the facts and circumstances attendant in any given case, to require conditions upon, and to limit, the form, manner, and extent of any disclosure permitted by this section. Wherever practicable, disclosure of exempt records shall be made pursuant to a protective order and redacted to exclude all irrelevant or non-responsive exempt information.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Confidential treatment procedures.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Any submitter of written information to the ASC who desires that some or all of his or her submission be afforded confidential treatment under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4) (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential) shall file a request for confidential treatment with the Executive Director of the ASC at the time the written information is submitted to the ASC or within ten business days thereafter. Nothing in this section limits the authority of the ASC and its staff to make determinations regarding access to documents under this subpart.<PRTPAGE P="38"/>
            </P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Form of request.</E> A request for confidential treatment shall be submitted in a separate letter or memorandum conspicuously entitled, “Request for Confidential Treatment.” Each request shall state in reasonable detail the facts and arguments supporting the request and its legal justification. If the submitter had been required by the ASC to provide the particular information, conclusory statements that the information would be useful to competitors or would impair sales or similar statements generally will not be considered sufficient to justify confidential treatment. When the submitter had voluntarily provided the particular information to the ASC, the submitter must specifically identify the documents or information which are of a kind the submitter would not customarily make available to the public.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Designation and separation of confidential material.</E> Submitters shall clearly designate all information considered confidential and shall clearly separate such information from other non-confidential information, whenever possible.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">ASC action on request.</E> A request for confidential treatment of information will be considered only in connection with a request for access to the information under FOIA as implemented by this subpart. Upon the receipt of a request for access, the Executive Director or his or her designee (“ASC Officer”) as soon as possible shall provide the submitter with a written notice describing the request and shall provide the submitter with a reasonable opportunity, no longer than ten business days, to submit written objections to disclosure of the information. Notice may be given orally, and such notice shall be promptly confirmed in writing. The ASC Officer may provide a submitter with a notice if the submitter did not request confidential treatment of the requested information. If the ASC required the submitter to provide the requested information, the ASC Officer would need substantial reason to believe that disclosure of the requested information would result in substantial competitive harm to the submitter. If the submitter provided the information voluntarily to the ASC, the ASC officer would need to believe that the information is of a kind the submitter would not customarily make available to the public. The ASC Officer similarly shall notify the person seeking disclosure of the information under FOIA of the existence of a request for confidential treatment. These notice requirements need not be followed if the ASC Officer determines under this subpart that the information should not be disclosed; the information has been published or has been officially made available to the public; disclosure of the information is required by law (other than FOIA); or the submitter's request for confidential treatment appears obviously frivolous, in such instance the submitter shall be given written notice of the determination to disclose the information at least five business days prior to release. The ASC Officer shall carefully consider the issues involved, and if disclosure of the requested information is warranted, a written notice, containing a brief description of why the submitter's objections were not sustained, must be forwarded to the submitter within ten business days. The time for response may be extended up to ten additional business days, as provided in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B), or for other periods by agreement between the requester and the ASC Officer. This notice shall be provided to the submitter at least five business days prior to release of the requested information.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Notice of lawsuit.</E> The ASC Officer shall notify a submitter of any filing of any suit against the ASC pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552 to compel disclosure of documents or information covered by the submitter's request for confidential treatment within ten business days of service of the suit. The ASC Officer also shall notify the requester of the documents or information of any suit filed by the submitter against the ASC to enjoin their disclosure within ten business days of service of the suit.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Service.</E> Any subpoena or other legal process to obtain information maintained by the ASC shall be duly issued by a court having jurisdiction over the ASC, and served upon the <PRTPAGE P="39"/>Chairman ASC; 1325 G Street NW, Suite 500, Washington, DC 20005. Where the ASC is named as a party, service of process shall be made pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure upon the Chairman at the above address. The Chairman shall immediately forward any subpoena, court order or legal process to the General Counsel. If consistent with the terms of the subpoena, court order or legal process, the ASC may require the payment of fees, in accordance with the fee schedule referred to in § 1102.306(e) prior to the release of any records requested pursuant to any subpoena or other legal process.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Notification by person served.</E> If any current or former member, officer, employee or agent of the ASC, or any other person who has custody of records belonging to the ASC, is served with a subpoena, court order, or other process requiring that person's attendance as a witness concerning any matter related to official duties, or the production of any exempt record of the ASC, such person shall promptly advise the Executive Director of such service, the testimony and records described in the subpoena, and all relevant facts that may assist the Executive Director, in consultation with the ASC General Counsel, in determining whether the individual in question should be authorized to testify or the records should be produced. Such person also should inform the court or tribunal that issued the process and the attorney for the party upon whose application the process was issued, if known, of the substance of this section.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Official logo and seal.</SUBJECT>
            <P>This section describes and displays the logo adopted by the Director as the official symbol representing FHFA. It is displayed on correspondence, selected documents, and signage. The logo serves as the official seal to certify and authenticate official documents of the agency.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Description.</E> The logo is a disc consisting of three polygons each drawn in a manner resembling a silhouette of a pitched roof house and with distinctive eaves under its roof. Each polygon is placed one in front of the other, two of which are diminished in size from the polygon behind it. Placed in the center of the smallest polygon is the acronym for the organization, “FHFA.” The polygons are encircled by a designation scroll having a solid background and containing the words “FEDERAL HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY” in capital letters with serifs, with two mullets on the extreme left and right of the scroll. Upon approval by the Director, FHFA may employ variations of the color or shading of its logo and seal for specified purposes; these will be available for reference on the agency Web site at <E T="03">www.fhfa.gov.</E>

            <SUBJECT>Why did FHFA issue this part?</SUBJECT>
            <P>The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) issued this regulation to comply with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) (5 U.S.C. 552).</P>
            <P>(a) The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) (5 U.S.C. 552), is a Federal law that requires the Federal Government to disclose certain Federal Government records to the public.</P>
            <P>(b) This part explains the rules that the FHFA will follow when processing and responding to requests for records under the FOIA. It also explains what you must do to request records from FHFA under the FOIA. You should read this part together with the FOIA, which explains in more detail your rights and the records FHFA may release to you.</P>
            <P>(c) If you want to request information about yourself that is contained in a system of records maintained by FHFA, you may do so under the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552a). This is considered a first-party or Privacy Act request under the Privacy Act, and you must file your request following FHFA's Privacy Act regulation at part 1204 of this title. If you file a request for information about yourself, FHFA will process your request under both the FOIA and Privacy Act in order to give you the greatest degree of access to any responsive material.</P>
            <P>(d) Notwithstanding the FOIA and this part, FHFA may routinely publish or disclose to the public information without following these procedures.</P>

            <P>
              <E T="03">Requester</E> means any person seeking access to FHFA records under the FOIA. A requester falls into one of three categories for the purpose of determining what fees may be charged. The <E T="03">three</E> categories are—</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Commercial</E>—A request that asks for information for a use or a purpose that furthers a commercial, trade, or profit interest, which can include furthering those interests through litigation. A decision to place a requester in the commercial use category will be made on a case-by-case basis based on the requester's intended use of the information;</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Noncommercial</E>—Three distinct subcategories—</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Educational institution</E>—Any school that operates a program of scholarly research. A requester in this fee category must show that the request is authorized by, and is made under the auspices of, an educational institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use, but rather are sought to further scholarly research. To fall with this fee category, the request must serve the scholarly research goals of the institution rather than an individual research goal. A student who makes a request in furtherance of their coursework or other school-sponsored activities and provides a copy of a course syllabus or other reasonable documentation to indicate the research purpose for the request would qualify as part of this fee category;</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Noncommercial scientific institution</E>—An institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis, as defined in this section and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. A request in this category must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are sought to further scientific research and are not for a commercial use; or</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Representative of the news media</E>—Any person or entity that publishes or broadcasts news to the public, actively gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public; and</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Other</E>—All requesters who do not fall within either of the preceding two categories.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Requester Service Centers</E> serve as the primary contacts for a requester when the requester has questions, is seeking information about how the FOIA works, or to check the status of their request.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Review</E> means the examination of a record located in response to a request in order to determine whether any portion of it is exempt from disclosure. Review time includes processing any record for disclosure, such as doing all that is necessary to prepare the record for disclosure, including the process of redacting the record and marking the appropriate exemptions. Review costs are properly charged even if a record ultimately is not disclosed. Review time also includes time spent both obtaining and considering any formal objection to disclosure made by a confidential commercial information submitter under § 1202.8(f) of this part.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Search</E> means the process of looking for and retrieving records or information responsive to a request, whether manually or by electronic means. Search time includes a page-by-page or line-by-line identification of information within a record and the reasonable efforts expanded to locate and retrieve information from electronic records.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Submitter</E> means any person or entity providing confidential information to the Federal Government. The term “submitter” includes, but is not limited to corporations, state governments, and foreign governments.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Unusual circumstances</E> means the need to—<PRTPAGE P="54"/>
            </P>
            <P>(1) Search for and collect records from agencies, offices, facilities, or locations that are separate from the office processing the request;</P>
            <P>(2) Search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records in order to process a single request; or</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> You may request that FHFA disclose to you its records on a subject of interest to you. The FOIA only requires the disclosure of records. It does not require FHFA to create compilations of information or to provide narrative responses to questions or queries.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Proactive disclosure.</E> FHFA will make available for public inspection and copying in its electronic reading room the following records:</P>
            <P>(1) Final opinions or orders made in the adjudication of cases;</P>

            <P>(2) Statements of policy and interpretation adopted by FHFA that are not published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>;</P>
            <P>(3) Administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect a member of the public and are not exempt from disclosure under the FOIA;</P>
            <P>(4) Copies of all records, regardless of form or format, that have been released to any person under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3), that because of the nature of their subject matter, FHFA determines have become or are likely to become the subject of subsequent requests for substantially the same records, or that have been requested 3 or more times; and</P>
            <P>(5) A general index of the records referred to in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Reading rooms.</E> FHFA maintains an electronic reading room. FHFA will ensure that its reading room is reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis. See the Appendices to this part for location and contact information for FHFA-HQ and FHFA-OIG respective reading rooms.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Unless the Director of FHFA or his or her designee, or any regulation or statute specifically authorizes disclosure, FHFA will not release records if it reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by one or more of the following—</P>
            <P>(1) Specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy, and in fact is properly classified pursuant to such Executive Order;</P>
            <P>(2) Related solely to FHFA's internal personnel rules and practices;</P>
            <P>(3) Specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than 5 U.S.C. 552a), provided that such statute—</P>
            <P>(i) Requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or</P>
            <P>(ii) Establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld;</P>
            <P>(4) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential;</P>
            <P>(5) Contained in inter-agency or intra-agency memoranda or letters that would not be available by law to a private party in litigation with FHFA; provided that the deliberative process privilege shall not apply to records created 25 years or more before the date on which the records were requested.</P>
            <P>(6) Contained in personnel, medical or similar files (including financial files) the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;</P>
            <P>(7) Compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records or information—</P>

            <P>(i) Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings;<PRTPAGE P="55"/>
            </P>

            <P>(iv) Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source, including a State, local, or foreign agency or authority or any private institution or an entity that is regulated and examined by FHFA that furnished information on a confidential basis, and, in the case of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, information furnished by a confidential source;</P>
            <P>(v) Would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law; or</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Redacted portion.</E> If a requested record contains exempt information and information that can be disclosed and the portions can reasonably be segregated from each other, the disclosable portion of the record will be released to the requester after FHFA redacts the exempt portions. If it is technically feasible, FHFA will indicate the amount of the information redacted at the place in the record where the redaction is made and include a notation identifying the exemption that was applied, unless including that indication would harm an interest protected by an exemption.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Exempt and redacted material.</E> FHFA is not required to and will not provide a Vaughn index during the administrative stage of processing your FOIA request.</P>

            <SUBJECT>How do I request information from FHFA under the FOIA?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Where to send your request.</E> FHFA has a decentralized system for processing FOIA requests, made up of two components. To make a request for FHFA records, the FOIA request must be in writing. A requester must write directly to the FOIA office of the component that maintains the records being sought. The Appendices to this part contain the respective location and contact information for submitting a FOIA request for each FHFA component.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Provide your name and address.</E> Your request must include your full name, your address and, if different, the address at which the component is to notify you about your request, a telephone number at which you can be reached during normal business hours, and an electronic mail address, if any.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Request is under the FOIA.</E> Your request must have a statement identifying it as being made under the FOIA.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Your FOIA status.</E> Your request should include a statement specifically identifying your status as a “commercial use” requester, an “educational institution” requester, a “non-commercial scientific institution” requester, or a “representative of the news media” for the purposes of the fee provisions of the FOIA.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Describing the records you request.</E> You must describe the records that you seek in enough detail to enable FHFA to search for and locate the records with a reasonable amount of effort. Your request must include as much specific information as possible that you know about each record in your request, such as the date, title, name, author, recipient, subject matter, file designations, or the description of the record.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">How you want the records produced to you.</E> Your request may state in what form or format you want FHFA to furnish the releasable records, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> hardcopy, or electronic.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Agreement to pay fees.</E> In your FOIA request you must acknowledge <PRTPAGE P="56"/>that you are aware of the applicable fees charged under § 1202.11, and specify an amount, if any, you are willing to pay without consultation. Your inability to pay a fee does not justify granting a fee waiver. The fact that FHFA withholds all responsive documents or does not locate any documents responsive to your request, does not mean that you are not responsible for paying applicable fees. Your FOIA request will not be considered received by FHFA until your acknowledgement of the applicable fees, in writing, is received. FHFA will notify a requester of any fees above $25.00.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Valid requests.</E> FHFA will only process valid requests. A valid request must meet all the requirements of this part.</P>

            <P>If FHFA determines that your request does not reasonably describe the records you seek, cannot be processed for reasons related to fees, or lacks required information, you will be informed in writing why your request cannot be processed. You will be given 15 calendar days to meet all requirements. If you are notified that your request cannot be processed for the reasons cited herein, your request will be placed on hold and will not be considered as being received by FHFA for the purpose of processing your request under this part.</P>
            <P>(a) If you respond with all the necessary information, FHFA will process this response as a new request and the time period for FHFA to respond to your request will start from the date the additional information is actually received by FHFA.</P>
            <P>(b) If you do not respond or provide additional information within the time period allowed, or if the additional information you provide is still incomplete or insufficient, FHFA will consider your request closed and will notify you that it will not be processed.</P>

            <SUBJECT>How will FHFA respond to my FOIA request?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Authority to grant or deny requests.</E> The FOIA Officer, FOIA Official, and the Chief FOIA Officer are authorized to grant or deny any request for FHFA records.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Designated standard “cut-off” date for searches.</E> In determining which records are responsive to a request, FHFA will include only records in its possession as of the date the FOIA request is received.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Multi-Track request processing.</E> FHFA uses a multi-track system to process FOIA requests. This means that a FOIA request is processed based on its complexity. When FHFA receives your request, it is assigned to a Standard Track or Complex Track. FHFA will notify you if your request is assigned to the Complex Track as described in paragraph (h) of this section.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Standard Track.</E> FHFA assigns FOIA requests that are routine and require little or no search time, review, or analysis to the Standard Track. FHFA responds to these requests in the order in which they are received and normally responds within 20 days after receipt. If FHFA determines while processing your Standard Track request, that it is more appropriately a Complex Track request, it will be reassigned to the Complex Track and you will be notified as described in paragraph (h) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Complex Track.</E> (i) FHFA assigns requests that are non-routine to the Complex Track. Complex Track requests are those to which FHFA determines that the request and/or response may—</P>
            <P>(A) Be voluminous;</P>
            <P>(B) Involve two or more FHFA components or units;</P>
            <P>(C) Require consultation with other agencies or entities;</P>
            <P>(D) Require searches of archived documents;</P>
            <P>(E) Seek confidential commercial information as described in § 1202.8 of this part;</P>
            <P>(F) Require an unusually high level of effort to search for, review and/or duplicate records; or</P>

            <P>(G) Cause undue disruption to the day-to-day activities of FHFA in regulating and supervising the regulated <PRTPAGE P="57"/>entities or in carrying out its statutory responsibilities.</P>
            <P>(ii) FHFA will respond to Complex Track requests as soon as reasonably possible, regardless of the date of receipt.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Referrals to other agencies.</E> If you submit a FOIA request that seeks records originating in another Federal Government agency, FHFA will refer those records, as applicable, to the other agency for a direct response. FHFA will provide you notice of the referral, what records were referred, and the name of the other agency and relevant contact information.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Consultation with other agencies.</E> When records originate with FHFA, but contain within them information of interest to another agency, FHFA will consult with the other agency(ies) prior to making a determination on your request.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Responses to FOIA requests.</E> FHFA will respond to your request by granting or denying it in full, or by granting and denying it in part. The response will be in writing. In determining which records are responsive to your request, FHFA will conduct a search for records in its possession as of the date of your request.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Requests that are granted.</E> If FHFA grants your request, the response will include the requested records or details about how FHFA will provide them to you and the amount of any fees charged.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Requests that are denied, or granted and denied in part.</E> If FHFA denies your request in whole or in part because a requested record does not exist or cannot be located, is not readily reproducible in the form or format you sought, is not subject to the FOIA, or is exempt from disclosure, the written response will include the requested releasable records, if any, the amount of any fees charged, the reasons for denial, and a notice and description of your right to file an administrative appeal under § 1202.9. FHFA will not provide you with a Vaughn index during the administrative stage of processing your request.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Format and delivery of disclosed records.</E> If FHFA grants, in whole or in part, your request for disclosure of records under the FOIA, the records may be made available to you in the form or format you requested, if they are readily reproducible in that form or format. The records will be sent to the address you provided by regular U.S. mail or by electronic mail unless alternate arrangements are made by mutual agreement, such as your agreement to pay express or expedited delivery service fees, or to pick up records at FHFA offices.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Extensions of time.</E> (1) In unusual circumstances, FHFA may extend the statutory time limit in paragraph (c)(1) of this section for no more than 10 days and notify you of—</P>
            <P>(i) The reason for the extension; and</P>
            <P>(ii) The date on which the determination is expected.</P>
            <P>(2) When a request requires more than 30 days to process, FHFA will make available its FOIA Public Liaison or other FOIA contact to assist you in modifying or reformulating your request. If the request cannot be modified or reformulated, FHFA will notify you regarding an alternative time period for processing the request. FHFA will also notify you of the availability of the Office of Government Information Services to provide dispute resolution service.</P>
            <P>(3) For the purpose of satisfying unusual circumstances under the FOIA, FHFA may aggregate requests in cases where it reasonably appears that multiple requests, submitted either by a requester or by a group of requesters acting in concert, constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances. FHFA will not aggregate multiple requests that involve unrelated matters.</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Designation of confidential commercial information.</E> Submitters of commercial information must use good-faith efforts to designate, by appropriate markings or written request, either at <PRTPAGE P="58"/>the time of submission or at a reasonable time thereafter, those portions of the information they deem to be protected under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4) and § 1202.4(a)(4) of this part. Any such designation will expire 10 years after the records are submitted to the Federal Government, unless the submitter requests, and provides reasonable justification for a designation period of longer duration.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Pre-Disclosure Notification.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, if your FOIA request encompasses confidential commercial information, FHFA will, prior to disclosure of the information and to the extent permitted by law, provide prompt written notice to a submitter that confidential commercial information was requested when—</P>
            <P>(1) The submitter has in good faith designated the information as confidential commercial information protected from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4) and § 1202.4(a)(4) of this part; or</P>
            <P>(2) FHFA has reason to believe that the request seeks confidential commercial information, the disclosure of which may result in substantial competitive harm to the submitter.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Content of Pre-Disclosure Notification.</E> When FHFA sends a Pre-Disclosure Notification to a submitter, it will contain—</P>
            <P>(1) A description of the commercial information requested or copies of the records or portions thereof containing the business information; and</P>
            <P>(2) An opportunity to object to disclosure within 10 days or such other time period that FHFA may allow by providing to FHFA a detailed written statement demonstrating all reasons the submitter opposes disclosure.</P>

            <P>(5) The submitter's designation, under paragraph (b) of this section, appears on its face to be frivolous; except that FHFA will provide the submitter with written notice of any final decision to disclose the designated confidential commercial information within a reasonable number of days prior to a specified disclosure date.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Submitter's objection to disclosure.</E> A submitter may object to disclosure within 10 days after the date of the Pre-Disclosure Notification, or such other time period that FHFA may allow, by delivering to FHFA a written statement demonstrating all grounds on which it opposes disclosure, and all reasons supporting its contention that the information should not be disclosed. The submitter's objection must contain a certification by the submitter, or an officer or authorized representative of the submitter, that the grounds and reasons presented are true and correct to the best of the submitter's knowledge. The submitter's objection may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Notice of Intent to disclose information.</E> FHFA will carefully consider all grounds and reasons provided by a submitter objecting to disclosure. If FHFA decides to disclose the information over the submitter's objection, the submitter will be provided with a written Notice of Intent to disclose at least 10 days before the date of disclosure. The written Notice of Intent will contain—</P>

            <SUBJECT>How do I appeal a response denying my FOIA request?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Right of appeal.</E> If FHFA denied your request in whole or in part, you may appeal the denial by writing directly to the appropriate FHFA component specified in the Appendices to this part.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Timing, form, content, and receipt of an appeal.</E> Your written appeal must be postmarked or submitted within 90 calendar days of the date of the decision by FHFA denying, in whole or in part, your request. Your appeal must include a copy of the initial request, a copy of the letter denying the request in whole or in part, and a statement of the circumstances, reasons, or arguments you believe support disclosure of the requested record(s). FHFA will not consider an improperly addressed appeal to have been received for the purposes of the 20-day time period of paragraph (d) of this section until it is actually received by the correct FHFA component.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Extensions of time to appeal.</E> If you need more time to file your appeal, you may request, in writing, an extension of time of no more than 10 calendar days in which to file your appeal, but only if your request is made within the original 90-calendar day time period for filing the appeal. Granting such an extension is in the sole discretion of the designated component Appeals Officer.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Final action on appeal.</E> FHFA's determination on your appeal will be in writing, signed by the designated component Appeals Officer, and sent to you within 20 days after the appeal is received, or by the last day of the last extension under paragraph (e) of this section. The determination of an appeal is the final action of FHFA on a FOIA request. A determination may—</P>
            <P>(1) Affirm, in whole or in part, the initial denial of the request and may include a brief statement of the reason or reasons for the decision, including each FOIA exemption relied upon;</P>
            <P>(2) Reverse, in whole or in part, the denial of a request in whole or in part, and require the request to be processed promptly in accordance with the decision; or</P>
            <P>(3) Remand a request to FHFA, as appropriate, for re-processing.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Notice of delayed determinations on appeal.</E> If FHFA cannot send a final determination on your appeal within the 20-day time limit, the designated component Appeals Officer will continue to process the appeal and upon expiration of the time limit, will inform you of the reason(s) for the delay and the date on which a determination may be expected.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Judicial review.</E> If the denial of your request for records is upheld in whole or in part, or if a determination on your appeal has not been sent at the end of the 20-day period in paragraph (d) of this section, or the last extension thereof, you may seek judicial review under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4). Before seeking review by a court of FHFA's adverse determination, a requester generally must first submit a timely administrative appeal.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Additional resource.</E> To aid the requester, the FOIA Public Liaison is available and will assist in the resolution of any disputes. Also, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) offers non-compulsory, non-binding services to resolve FOIA disputes.

            <SUBJECT>Will FHFA expedite my request or appeal?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Request for expedited processing.</E> You may request, in writing, expedited processing of an initial request or of an appeal. FHFA may grant expedited processing, and give your request or appeal priority if your request for expedited processing demonstrates a compelling need by establishing one or more of the following—</P>
            <P>(1) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual;</P>
            <P>(2) An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity if you are a person primarily engaged in disseminating information;</P>
            <P>(3) The loss of substantial due process or rights;</P>
            <P>(4) A matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exists possible questions about the Federal Government's integrity, affecting public confidence; or</P>
            <P>(5) Humanitarian need.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Certification of compelling need.</E> Your request for expedited processing must include a statement certifying that the reason(s) you present demonstrate a compelling need are true and correct to the best of your knowledge.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Determination on request.</E> FHFA will notify you within 10 calendar days of receipt of your request whether expedited processing has been granted. If a request for expedited treatment is granted, the request will be given priority and will be processed as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited processing is denied, any appeal of that decision under § 1202.9 of this part will be acted on expeditiously.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1202.11</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>What will it cost to get the records I requested?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Assessment of fees, generally.</E> FHFA will assess you for fees covering the direct costs of responding to your request and costs for duplicating records, except as otherwise provided in a statute with respect to the determination of fees that may be assessed for disclosure, search time, or review of particular records.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Assessment of fees, categories of requesters.</E> The fees that FHFA may assess vary depending on the type of request or the type of requester you are—</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Commercial use.</E> If you request records for a commercial use, the fees that FHFA may assess are limited to FHFA's operating costs incurred for document search, review, and duplication.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Educational institution, noncommercial scientific institution, or representative of the news media.</E> If you are not requesting records for commercial use and you are an educational institution or a noncommercial scientific institution, whose purpose is scholarly or scientific research, or a representative of the news media, the fees that may be assessed are limited to standard reasonable charges for duplication in excess of 100 pages or an electronic equivalent of 100 pages.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Other.</E> If neither paragraph (b)(1) nor paragraph (b)(2) of this section applies, the fees assessed are limited to the costs for document searching in excess of two hours and duplication in excess of 100 pages, or an electronic equivalent of 100 pages.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Fee schedule.</E> FHFA will charge fees for processing requests under the FOIA in accordance with the provisions of this section and OMB guidelines (basic pay plus 16 percent). There are three different groups of grades typically involved in processing FOIA requests: Personnel in grades EL-6 to EL-9; personnel in grades EL-10 to EL-13; and personnel EL-14 and above. FHFA's Web site, <E T="03">www.fhfa.gov,</E> will contain current rates for search and review fees for each group. The rates will be updated as salaries change and will be determined by using the formula in this regulation. The formula is the sum of the mid-point of each grade divided <PRTPAGE P="61"/>by the number of grades in each category divided by 2088 and then multiplied by 1.16.<SU>1</SU>
              <FTREF/> Fees for searches of computerized records are based on the actual cost to FHFA. For requests that require the retrieval of records stored by FHFA at a Federal records center operated by the National Archives and Records Administration, FHFA will charge additional costs in accordance with the Transaction Billing Rate Schedule established by NARA.</P>
            <FTNT>
              <P>
                <SU>1</SU> Example of the rate formula is as follows: For 2016, EL-6 to EL-9 is [($55,769 + $63,554 + $71,816 + $81,152)/4][1/2088 hours per year][1.16 OMB markup factor] = $37.82 per hour.</P>
            </FTNT>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Notice of anticipated fees in excess of $25.00.</E> When FHFA determines or estimates that the fees chargeable to you will exceed $25.00, you will be notified of the actual or estimated amount of fees you will incur, unless you earlier indicated your willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. When you are notified that the actual or estimated fees exceed $25.00, your request will be tolled until you agree to pay, in writing, the anticipated total fee.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Advance payment of fees.</E> FHFA may request that you pay estimated fees or a deposit in advance of responding to your request. If FHFA requests advance payment or a deposit, your request will be tolled by FHFA until the advance payment or deposit is received. FHFA may request advance payment or a deposit if—</P>
            <P>(1) The fees are likely to exceed $250.00;</P>
            <P>(2) You do not have a history of payment;</P>

            <P>(3) You previously failed to pay a FOIA fee to FHFA in a timely fashion, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> within 30 calendar days of the date of a billing; or</P>
            <P>(4) You have an outstanding balance due from a prior request. FHFA will require you to pay the full amount owed plus any applicable interest, as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, or demonstrate that the fee owed has been paid, as well as payment of the full amount of anticipated fees before processing your request.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Interest.</E> FHFA may charge you interest on an unpaid bill starting on the 31st calendar day following the day on which the bill was sent. Once a fee payment has been received by FHFA, even if not processed, FHFA will stay the accrual of interest. Interest charges will be assessed at the rate prescribed by 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the date of the billing.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">FHFA assistance to reduce costs.</E> If FHFA notifies you of estimated fees exceeding $100.00 or requests advance payment or a deposit, you will have an opportunity to consult with FHFA FOIA staff to modify or reformulate your request to meet your needs at a lower cost.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Fee waiver requests.</E> You may request a fee waiver in accordance with the FOIA and this regulation. Requests for a waiver of fees must be made in writing and should be made at the time you submit your FOIA request. However, your fee waiver may be submitted at a later time so long as the underlying record request is pending or on administrative appeal. FHFA may grant your fee waiver request or a reduction of fees if disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Federal Government and is not primarily in your commercial interest. In submitting a fee waiver request, you must address the following six factors—</P>
            <P>(1) Whether the subject of the requested records concerns the operations or activities of the Federal Government. The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated;</P>
            <P>(2) Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute significantly to the public understanding of Federal Government operations or activities. This factor is satisfied when the following criteria are met:</P>

            <P>(i) Disclosure of the requested information must be meaningfully informative about government operations or activities. The disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in either the same or a substantially identical form, would not be meaningfully informative if nothing new would be added to the public's understanding; and<PRTPAGE P="62"/>
            </P>
            <P>(ii) The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to your individual understanding. Your expertise in the subject area as well as your ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public must be considered. FHFA will presume that a representative of the news media will satisfy this consideration.</P>
            <P>(3) The disclosure must not be primarily in your commercial interest. To determine whether disclosure of the requested information is primarily in your commercial interest FHFA will consider the following criteria:</P>
            <P>(i) FHFA will determine whether you have any commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. A commercial interest includes any commercial, trade, or profit interest. You will be given an opportunity to provide explanatory information regarding this consideration; and</P>
            <P>(ii) If there is an identified commercial interest, FHFA will determine whether that is the primary interest furthered by the request.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Fee Waiver determination.</E> FHFA will notify you within 20 days of receipt of your request whether the fee waiver has been granted. Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the requirements for a waiver of fees, a waiver will be granted for those records. For those records that do not satisfy the requirements for a waiver of fees, you may be charged for those records. When you have committed to pay fees and subsequently ask for a waiver of those fees and that waiver is denied, you must pay any costs incurred up to the date the fee waiver request was received. A request for fee waiver that is denied may only be appealed when a final decision has been made on the initial FOIA request.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Restrictions on charging fees.</E> (1) When FHFA determines that you are an educational institution, non-commercial scientific institution, or representative of the news media, and the records are not sought for commercial use, FHFA will not charge search fees.</P>
            <P>(2)(i) If FHFA fails to comply with the FOIA's time limits in which to respond to your request, FHFA will not charge search fees, or, in the instances of requests from requesters described in paragraph (j)(1) of this section, will not charge duplication fees, except as described in paragraphs (j)(2)(ii) through (iv) of this section.</P>
            <P>(ii) If FHFA has determined that unusual circumstances as defined by the FOIA apply and FHFA has provided timely written notice to you in accordance with the FOIA, FHFA's failure to comply with the time limit will be excused for an additional 10 days.</P>
            <P>(iii) If FHFA determines that unusual circumstances, as defined by the FOIA, apply and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to your request, FHFA may charge search fees, or, in the case of a requester described in paragraph (j)(1) of this section, may charge duplication fees, if the following steps are taken. FHFA must have provided timely written notice of unusual circumstances to you in accordance with the FOIA and FHFA must have discussed with you via written mail, email, or telephone (or made not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how you could effectively limit the scope of your request in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(ii). If this exception is satisfied, FHFA may charge all applicable fees incurred in the processing of the request.</P>
            <P>(iv) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist, as defined by the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limits shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.</P>
            <P>(3) No search or review fees will be charged for a quarter-hour period unless more than half of that period is required for search or review.</P>
            <P>(4) If you seek records for a commercial use, FHFA will provide without charge:</P>
            <P>(i) The first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent for other media); and</P>
            <P>(ii) The first two hours of search.</P>
            <P>(5) No fee will be charged when the total fee, after deducting the 100 free pages (or its cost equivalent) and the first two hours of search, is equal to or less than $25.00.</P>
            <P>(k) <E T="03">Additional resource.</E> The FOIA Public Liaison or other FOIA contact is available to assist you in modifying or reformulating a request to meet <PRTPAGE P="63"/>your needs at a lower cost. FHFA will also notify you of the availability of OGIS to provide dispute resolution service.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Standards for awards.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) An eligible party that files an application for award of fees and other expenses in accordance with this part will receive an award of fees and other expenses related to defending against a demand of FHFA if the demand was in excess of the decision in the underlying adversary adjudication and was unreasonable when compared with the decision under the facts and circumstances <PRTPAGE P="66"/>of the case, unless the party has committed a willful violation of law or otherwise acted in bad faith, or unless special circumstances make an award unjust. The burden of proof that the demand of FHFA was substantially in excess of the decision and is unreasonable when compared with the decision is on the eligible party.</P>
              <P>(b) An eligible party that submits an application for award in accordance with this part will receive an award of fees and other expenses incurred in connection with an adversary adjudication in which it prevailed or in a significant and discrete substantive portion of the adversary adjudication in which it prevailed, unless the position of FHFA in the adversary adjudication was substantially justified or special circumstances make an award unjust.

              <SUBJECT>Allowable fees and expenses.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Awards of fees and other expenses will be based on rates customarily charged by persons engaged in the business of acting as attorneys, agents, and expert witnesses, even if the services were made available without charge or at a reduced rate to the party. However, except as provided in § 1203.6, an award for the fee of an attorney or agent may not exceed $125 per hour and an award to compensate an expert witness may not exceed the highest rate at which FHFA pays expert witnesses. However, an award may also include the reasonable expenses of the attorney, agent, or expert witness as a separate item if he or she ordinarily charges clients separately for such expenses.</P>
              <P>(b) In determining the reasonableness of the fee sought for an attorney, agent, or expert witness, the adjudicative officer will consider the following:</P>
              <P>(1) If the attorney, agent, or expert witness is in private practice, his or her customary fees for similar services; or, if the attorney, agent, or expert witness is an employee of the eligible party, the fully allocated costs of the services;</P>
              <P>(2) The prevailing rate for similar services in the community in which the attorney, agent, or expert witness ordinarily performs services;</P>
              <P>(3) The time actually spent in the representation of the eligible party;</P>
              <P>(4) The time reasonably spent in light of the difficulty or complexity of the issues in the adversary adjudication; and</P>
              <P>(5) Such other factors as may bear on the value of the services provided.</P>
              <P>(c) In determining the reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test, project, or similar matter prepared on behalf of a party, the adjudicative officer will consider the prevailing rate for similar services in the community in which the services were performed.</P>
              <P>(d) Fees and other expenses incurred before the date on which an adversary adjudication was initiated will be awarded only if the eligible party can demonstrate that they were reasonably incurred in preparation for the adversary adjudication.</P>

              <P>If warranted by an increase in the cost of living or by special circumstances, FHFA may adopt regulations providing for an award of attorney or agent fees at a rate higher than $125 per hour in adversary adjudications covered by this part. Special circumstances include the limited availability of attorneys or agents who are qualified to handle certain types of adversary adjudications. FHFA will conduct any rulemaking proceedings for this purpose under the informal rulemaking procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1204.3</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>How do I make a Privacy Act request?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">What is a valid request?</E> In general, a Privacy Act request can be made on your own behalf for records or information about you. You can make a Privacy Act request on behalf of another individual as the parent or guardian of a minor, or as the guardian of someone determined by a court to be incompetent. You also may request access to another individual's record or information if you have that individual's written consent, unless other conditions of disclosure apply.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">How and where do I make a request?</E> Your request must be in writing. Regardless of whether your request seeks records from FHFA, FHFA-OIG, or both, you may appear in person to submit your written request to the FHFA Privacy Act Officer, or send your written request to the FHFA Privacy Act Officer by electronic mail, mail, delivery service, or facsimile. The electronic mail address is: <E T="03">privacy@fhfa.gov.</E> For mail or delivery service, the address is: FHFA Privacy Act Officer, Federal Housing Finance Agency, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Eighth Floor, Washington, DC 20219. The facsimile number is (202) 649-1073. Requests for FHFA-OIG maintained records will be forwarded to FHFA-OIG for processing and direct response. You can help FHFA and FHFA-OIG process your request by marking electronic mail, letters, or facsimiles and the subject line, envelope, or facsimile cover sheet with “Privacy Act Request.” FHFA's “Privacy Act Reference <PRTPAGE P="72"/>Guide,” which is available on FHFA's Web site, <E T="03">http://www.fhfa.gov,</E> provides additional information to assist you in making your request.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">What must the request include?</E> You must describe the record that you want in enough detail to enable either the FHFA or FHFA-OIG Privacy Act Officer to locate the system of records containing it with a reasonable amount of effort. Include specific information about each record sought, such as the time period in which you believe it was compiled, the name or identifying number of each system of records in which you believe it is kept, and the date, title or name, author, recipient, or subject matter of the record. As a general rule, the more specific you are about the record that you want, the more likely FHFA or FHFA-OIG will be able to locate it in response to your request.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">How do I request amendment or correction of a record?</E> If you are requesting an amendment or correction of any FHFA or FHFA-OIG record, identify each particular record in question and the system of records in which the record is located, describe the amendment or correction that you want, and state why you believe that the record is not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete. You may submit any documentation that you think would be helpful, including an annotated copy of the record.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">How do I request for an accounting of disclosures?</E> If you are requesting an accounting of disclosures by FHFA or FHFA-OIG of a record to another person, organization, or Federal agency, you must identify each particular record in question. An accounting generally includes the date, nature, and purpose of each disclosure, as well as the name and address of the person, organization, or Federal agency to which the disclosure was made, subject to § 1204.7.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Must I verify my identity?</E> Yes. When making requests under the Privacy Act, your request must verify your identity to protect your privacy or the privacy of the individual on whose behalf you are acting. If you make a Privacy Act request and you do not follow these identity verification procedures, FHFA or FHFA-OIG cannot and will not process your request.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">How do I verify my identity?</E> To verify your identity, you must state your full name, current address, and date and place of birth. In order to help identify and locate the records you request, you also may, at your option, include your Social Security number. If you make your request in person and your identity is not known to either the FHFA or FHFA-OIG Privacy Act Officer, you must provide either two forms of unexpired identification with photographs issued by a federal, state, or local government agency or entity (<E T="03">i.e.</E> passport, passport card, driver's license, ID card, etc.), or one form of unexpired identification with a photograph issued by a federal, state, or local government agency or entity (<E T="03">i.e.</E> passport, passport card, driver's license, ID card, etc.) and a properly authenticated birth certificate. If you make your request by mail, your signature either must be notarized or submitted under 28 U.S.C. 1746, a law that permits statements to be made under penalty of perjury as a substitute for notarization. You may fulfill this requirement by having your signature on your request letter witnessed by a notary or by including the following statement just before the signature on your request letter: “I declare (or certify, verify, or state) under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. Executed on [date]. [Signature].”</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">How do I verify parentage or guardianship?</E> If you make a Privacy Act request as the parent or guardian of a minor, or as the guardian of someone determined by a court to be incompetent, with respect to records or information about that individual, you must establish—</P>
            <P>(i) The identity of the individual who is the subject of the record, by stating the individual's name, current address, date and place of birth, and, at your option, the Social Security number of the individual;</P>
            <P>(ii) Your own identity, as required in paragraph (f)(1) of this section;</P>

            <P>(iii) That you are the parent or guardian of the individual, which you may prove by providing a properly authenticated copy of the individual's <PRTPAGE P="73"/>birth certificate showing your parentage or a properly authenticated court order establishing your guardianship; and</P>
            <P>(iv) That you are acting on behalf of the individual in making the request.</P>

            <SUBJECT>How will FHFA or FHFA-OIG respond to my Privacy Act request?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">How will FHFA or FHFA-OIG locate the requested records?</E> FHFA or FHFA-OIG will search to determine if requested records exist in the system of records it owns or controls. You can find FHFA and FHFA-OIG system of records notices on our Web site at <E T="03">http://www.fhfa.gov.</E> You can also find descriptions of OFHEO and FHFB system of records that have not yet been superseded on the FHFA Web site. A description of the system of records also is available in the “Privacy Act Issuances” compilation published by the Office of the Federal Register of the National Archives and Records Administration. You can access the “Privacy Act Issuances” compilation in most large reference and university libraries or electronically at the Government Printing Office Web site at: <E T="03">http://www.gpoaccess.gov/privacyact/index.html.</E> You also can request a copy of FHFA or FHFA-OIG system of records from the Privacy Act Officer.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">How long does FHFA or FHFA-OIG have to respond?</E> Either the FHFA or FHFA-OIG Privacy Act Officer generally will respond to your request in writing within 20 days after receiving it, if it meets the § 1204.3 requirements. For requests to amend a record, either the FHFA or FHFA-OIG Privacy Act Officer will respond within 10 days after receipt of the request to amend. FHFA or FHFA-OIG may extend the response time in unusual circumstances, such as when consultation is needed with another Federal agency (if that agency is subject to the Privacy Act) about a record or to retrieve a record shipped offsite for storage. If you submit your written request in person, either the FHFA or FHFA-OIG Privacy Act Officer may disclose records or information to you directly and create a written record of the grant of the request. If you are to be accompanied by another person when accessing your record or any information pertaining to you, FHFA or FHFA-OIG may require your written authorization before permitting access or discussing the record in the presence of the other person.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">What will the FHFA or FHFA-OIG response include?</E> The written response will include a determination to grant or deny your request in whole or in part, a brief explanation of the reasons for the determination, and the amount of the fee charged, if any, under § 1204.6. If you are granted a request to access a record, FHFA or FHFA-OIG will make the record available to you. If you are granted a request to amend or correct a record, the response will describe any amendments or corrections made and advise you of your right to obtain a copy of the amended or corrected record.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">What is an adverse determination?</E> An adverse determination is a determination on a Privacy Act request that—</P>
            <P>(1) Withholds any requested record in whole or in part;</P>
            <P>(2) Denies a request for an amendment or correction of a record in whole or in part;</P>
            <P>(3) Declines to provide a requested accounting of disclosures;</P>
            <P>(4) Advises that a requested record does not exist or cannot be located; or</P>
            <P>(5) Finds what has been requested is not a record subject to the Privacy Act.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">What will be stated in a response that includes an adverse determination?</E> If an adverse determination is made with respect to your request, either the FHFA or FHFA-OIG Privacy Act Officer's written response under this section will identify the person responsible for the adverse determination, state that the adverse determination is not a final action of FHFA or FHFA-OIG, and state that you may appeal the adverse determination under § 1204.5.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1204.5</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>What if I am dissatisfied with the response to my Privacy Act request?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">May I appeal the response?</E> You may appeal any adverse determination made in response to your Privacy Act <PRTPAGE P="74"/>request. If you wish to seek review by a court of any adverse determination or denial of a request, you must first appeal it under this section.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">How do I appeal the response?</E>—(1) You may appeal by submitting in writing, a statement of the reasons you believe the adverse determination should be overturned. FHFA or FHFA-OIG must receive your written appeal within 30 calendar days of the date of the adverse determination under § 1204.4. Your written appeal may include as much or as little related information as you wish, as long as it clearly identifies the determination (including the request number, if known) that you are appealing.</P>

            <P>(2) If FHFA or FHFA-OIG denied your request in whole or in part, you may appeal the denial by writing directly to the FHFA Privacy Act Appeals Officer through electronic mail, mail, delivery service, or facsimile. The electronic mail address is: <E T="03">privacy@fhfa.gov.</E> For mail or express mail, the address is: FHFA Privacy Act Appeals Officer, Federal Housing Finance Agency, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Eighth Floor, Washington, DC 20219. The facsimile number is: (202) 649-1073. For appeals of FHFA-OIG denials, whether in whole or in part, the appeal must be clearly marked by adding “FHFA-OIG” after “Privacy Act Appeal.” All appeals from denials, in whole or part, made by FHFA-OIG will be forwarded to the FHFA-OIG Privacy Act Appeals Officer for processing and direct response. You can help FHFA and FHFA-OIG process your appeal by marking electronic mail, letters, or facsimiles and the subject line, envelope, or facsimile cover sheet with “Privacy Act Appeal.” FHFA's “Privacy Act Reference Guide,” which is available on FHFA's Web site, <E T="03">http://www.fhfa.gov,</E> provides additional information to assist you in making your appeal. FHFA or FHFA-OIG ordinarily will not act on an appeal if the Privacy Act request becomes a matter of litigation.</P>
            <P>(3) If you need more time to file your appeal, you may request an extension of time of no more than ten (10) calendar days in which to file your appeal, but only if your request is made within the original 30-calendar day time period for filing the appeal. Granting an extension is in the sole discretion of either the FHFA or FHFA-OIG Privacy Act Appeals Officer.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Who has the authority to grant or deny appeals?</E> For appeals from the FHFA Privacy Act Officer, the FHFA Privacy Act Appeals Officer is authorized to act on your appeal. For appeals from the FHFA-OIG Privacy Act Officer, the FHFA-OIG Privacy Act Appeals Officer is authorized to act on your appeal.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">When will FHFA or FHFA-OIG respond to my appeal?</E> FHFA or FHFA-OIG generally will respond to you in writing within 30 days of receipt of an appeal that meets the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, unless for good cause shown, the FHFA or FHFA-OIG Privacy Act Appeals Officer extends the response time.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">What will the FHFA or FHFA-OIG response include?</E> The written response will include the determination of either the FHFA or FHFA-OIG Privacy Act Appeals Officer, whether to grant or deny your appeal in whole or in part, a brief explanation of the reasons for the determination, and information about the Privacy Act provisions for court review of the determination.</P>
            <P>(1) If your appeal concerns a request for access to records or information and the appeal determination grants your access, the records or information, if any, will be made available to you.</P>
            <P>(2)(i) If your appeal concerns an amendment or correction of a record and the appeal determination grants your request for an amendment or correction, the response will describe any amendment or correction made to the record and advise you of your right to obtain a copy of the amended or corrected record under this part. FHFA or FHFA-OIG will notify all persons, organizations, or Federal agencies to which it previously disclosed the record, if an accounting of that disclosure was made, that the record has been amended or corrected. Whenever the record is subsequently disclosed, the record will be disclosed as amended or corrected.</P>

            <P>(ii) If the response to your appeal denies your request for an amendment or correction to a record, the response <PRTPAGE P="75"/>will advise you of your right to file a Statement of Disagreement under paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">What is a Statement of Disagreement?</E>—(1) A Statement of Disagreement is a concise written statement in which you clearly identify each part of any record that you dispute and explain your reason(s) for disagreeing with either the FHFA or FHFA-OIG Privacy Act Appeals Officer's denial, in whole or in part, of your appeal requesting amendment or correction. Your Statement of Disagreement must be received by either the FHFA or FHFA-OIG Privacy Act Officer within 30 calendar days of either the FHFA or FHFA-OIG Privacy Act Appeals Officer's denial, in whole or in part, of your appeal concerning amendment or correction of a record. FHFA and FHFA-OIG will place your Statement of Disagreement in the system of records in which the disputed record is maintained. FHFA and FHFA-OIG may also append a concise statement of its reason(s) for denying the request for an amendment or correction of the record.</P>
            <P>(2) FHFA and FHFA-OIG will notify all persons, organizations, and Federal agencies to which it previously disclosed the disputed record, if an accounting of that disclosure was made, that the record is disputed and provide your Statement of Disagreement and the FHFA or FHFA-OIG concise statement, if any. Whenever the disputed record is subsequently disclosed, a copy of your Statement of Disagreement and the FHFA or FHFA-OIG concise statement, if any, will also be disclosed.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Must I agree to pay fees?</E> Your Privacy Act request is your agreement to pay all applicable fees, unless you specify a limit on the amount of fees you agree to pay. FHFA or FHFA-OIG will not exceed the specified limit without your written agreement.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">How does FHFA or FHFA-OIG calculate fees?</E> FHFA and FHFA-OIG will charge a fee for duplication of a record under the Privacy Act in the same way it charges for duplication of records under FOIA in 12 CFR 1202.11. There are no fees to search for or review records.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Are there any exemptions from the Privacy Act?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">What is a Privacy Act exemption?</E> The Privacy Act authorizes the Director and the FHFA Inspector General to exempt records or information in a system of records from some of the Privacy Act requirements, if the Director or the FHFA Inspector General, as appropriate, determines that the exemption is necessary.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">How do I know if the records or information I want are exempt?</E>—(1) Each system of records notice will advise you if the Director or the FHFA Inspector General has determined records or information in records are exempt from Privacy Act requirements. If the Director or the FHFA Inspector General has claimed an exemption for a system of records, the system of records notice will identify the exemption and the provisions of the Privacy Act from which the system is exempt.</P>
            <P>(2) Until superseded by FHFA or FHFA-OIG systems of records, the following OFHEO and FHFB systems of records are, under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) or (k)(5), exempt from the Privacy Act requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (e)(4)(H), (e)(4)(I), and (f)—</P>
            <P>(i) OFHEO-11 Litigation and Enforcement Information System; and</P>
            <P>(ii) FHFB-5 Agency Personnel Investigative Records.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">What exemptions potentially apply to FHFA-OIG records?</E> Unless the FHFA Inspector General, his or her designee, or a statute specifically authorizes disclosure, FHFA-OIG will not release records of matters that are subject to the following exemptions—</P>

            <P>(1) To the extent that the systems of records entitled “FHFA-OIG Audit Files Database,” “FHFA-OIG Investigative &amp; Evaluative Files Database,” “FHFA-OIG Investigative &amp; Evaluative MIS Database,” “FHFA-OIG Hotline Database,” and “FHFA-OIG Correspondence Database” contain any information compiled by FHFA-OIG for the purpose of criminal law enforcement investigations, such information falls within the scope of exemption (j)(2) of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. <PRTPAGE P="76"/>552a(j)(2), and therefore these systems of records are exempt from the requirements of the following subsections of the Privacy Act to that extent, for the reasons stated in paragraphs (1)(i) through (vi) of this section.</P>
            <P>(i) From 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), because release of an accounting of disclosures to an individual who is the subject of an investigation or evaluation could reveal the nature and scope of the investigation or evaluation and could result in the altering or destruction of evidence, improper influencing of witnesses, and other evasive actions that could impede or compromise the investigation or evaluation.</P>
            <P>(ii) From 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1), because release of investigative or evaluative records to an individual who is the subject of an investigation or evaluation could interfere with pending or prospective law enforcement proceedings, constitute an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of third parties, reveal the identity of confidential sources, or reveal sensitive investigative or evaluative techniques and procedures.</P>
            <P>(iii) From 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(2), because amendment or correction of investigative or evaluative records could interfere with pending or prospective law enforcement proceedings, or could impose an impossible administrative and investigative or evaluative burden by requiring FHFA-OIG to continuously retrograde its investigations or evaluations attempting to resolve questions of accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness.</P>
            <P>(iv) From 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1), because it is often impossible to determine relevance or necessity of information in the early stages of an investigation or evaluation. The value of such information is a question of judgment and timing; what appears relevant and necessary when collected may ultimately be evaluated and viewed as irrelevant and unnecessary to an investigation or evaluation. In addition, FHFA-OIG may obtain information concerning the violation of laws other than those within the scope of its jurisdiction. In the interest of effective law enforcement, FHFA-OIG should retain this information because it may aid in establishing patterns of unlawful activity and provide leads for other law enforcement agencies. Further, in obtaining evidence during an investigation or evaluation, information may be provided to FHFA-OIG that relates to matters incidental to the main purpose of the investigation or evaluation, but which may be pertinent to the investigative or evaluative jurisdiction of another agency. Such information cannot readily be identified.</P>
            <P>(v) From 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(2), because in a law enforcement investigation or an evaluation it is usually counterproductive to collect information to the greatest extent practicable directly from the subject thereof. It is not always feasible to rely upon the subject of an investigation or evaluation as a source for information which may implicate him or her in illegal activities. In addition, collecting information directly from the subject could seriously compromise an investigation or evaluation by prematurely revealing its nature and scope, or could provide the subject with an opportunity to conceal criminal activities, or intimidate potential sources, in order to avoid apprehension.</P>
            <P>(vi) From 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(3), because providing such notice to the subject of an investigation or evaluation, or to other individual sources, could seriously compromise the investigation or evaluation by prematurely revealing its nature and scope, or could inhibit cooperation, permit the subject to evade apprehension, or cause interference with undercover activities.</P>

            <P>(2) To the extent that the systems of records entitled “FHFA-OIG Audit Files Database,” “FHFA-OIG Investigative &amp; Evaluative Files Database,” “FHFA-OIG Investigative &amp; Evaluative MIS Database,” “FHFA-OIG Hotline Database,” and “FHFA-OIG Correspondence Database,” contain information compiled by FHFA-OIG for the purpose of criminal law enforcement investigations, such information falls within the scope of exemption (k)(2) of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), and therefore these systems of records are exempt from the requirements of the following subsections of the Privacy Act to that extent, for the reasons stated in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="77"/>

Revealing the identity of a confidential source could impede future cooperation by sources, and could result in harassment or harm to such sources.</P>

The determination of the Director upon such review is final. Except as provided by the Director, review by the Director does not suspend the requirement that the Regulated Entity make the semiannual payment or partial payment on or before the date it is due. Any adjustments determined appropriate shall be credited or otherwise addressed by the following year's assessment for that entity.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Request for a hearing.</E> (1) <E T="03">Time-period for submission.</E> An employee who requests a hearing on the existence or amount of the debt held by FHFA or on the salary-offset schedule proposed by FHFA, must send a written request to FHFA. The request for a hearing must be received by FHFA on or before the 30th calendar day following receipt by the employee of the Notice of Intent.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Failure to submit timely.</E> If the employee files a request for a hearing after the expiration of the 30th calendar day, the employee shall not be entitled to a hearing. However, FHFA may accept the request if the employee can show that the delay was the result of circumstances beyond his or her control or that he or she failed to receive actual notice of the filing deadline.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Contents of request.</E> The request for a hearing must be signed by the employee and must fully identify and explain with reasonable specificity all the facts, evidence, and witnesses, if any, that the employee believes support his or her position. The employee must also specify whether he or she requests an oral hearing. If an oral hearing is requested, the employee should explain why a hearing by examination of the documents without an oral hearing would not resolve the matter.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Failure to request a hearing.</E> The failure of an employee to request a hearing will be considered an admission by the employee that the debt exists in the amount specified in the Notice of Intent that was provided to the employee under § 1208.21(b).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Obtaining the services of a hearing official</E>—(1) <E T="03">Debtor is not an FHFA employee.</E> When the debtor is not an FHFA employee and FHFA cannot provide a prompt and appropriate hearing before an administrative law judge or other hearing official, FHFA may request a hearing official from an agent of the paying agency, as designated in 5 CFR part 581, appendix A, or as otherwise designated by the paying agency. The paying agency must cooperate with FHFA to provide a hearing official, as required by the FCCS.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Debtor is an FHFA employee.</E> When the debtor is an FHFA employee, FHFA may contact any agent of another agency, as designated in 5 CFR part 581, appendix A, or as otherwise designated by the agency, to request a hearing official.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Procedure</E>—(1) <E T="03">Notice of hearing.</E> After the employee requests a hearing, the hearing official shall notify the employee of the form of the hearing to be provided. If the hearing will be oral, the notice shall set forth the date, time, and location of the hearing, which must occur no more than 30 calendar days after the request is received, unless the employee requests that the hearing be delayed. If the hearing will be conducted by an examination of documents, the employee shall be notified within 30 calendar days that he or she should submit evidence and arguments in writing to the hearing official within 30 calendar days.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Oral hearing.</E> (i) An employee who requests an oral hearing shall be provided an oral hearing if the hearing official determines that the matter cannot be resolved by an examination of the documents alone, as for example, when an issue of credibility or veracity is involved. The oral hearing need not be an adversarial adjudication; and rules of evidence need not apply. Witnesses who testify in an oral hearing shall do so under oath or affirmation.</P>
              <P>(ii) Oral hearings may take the form of, but are not limited to:</P>

              <P>(A) Informal conferences with the hearing official in which the employee and agency representative are given <PRTPAGE P="91"/>full opportunity to present evidence, witnesses, and argument;</P>
              <P>(B) Informal meetings in which the hearing examiner interviews the employee; or</P>
              <P>(C) Formal written submissions followed by an opportunity for oral presentation.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Hearing by examination of documents.</E> If the hearing official determines that an oral hearing is not necessary, he or she shall make the determination based upon an examination of the documents.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Record.</E> The hearing official shall maintain a summary record of any hearing conducted under this section.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Decision.</E> (1) The hearing official shall issue a written opinion stating his or her decision, based upon all evidence and information developed during the hearing, as soon as practicable after the hearing, but not later than 60 calendar days after the date on which the request was received by FHFA, unless the hearing was delayed at the request of the employee, in which case the 60-day decision period shall be extended by the number of days by which the hearing was postponed.</P>
              <P>(2) The decision of the hearing official shall be final and is considered to be an official certification regarding the existence and the amount of the debt for purposes of executing salary offset under 5 U.S.C. 5514. If the hearing official determines that a debt may not be collected by salary offset, but FHFA finds that the debt is still valid, FHFA may seek collection of the debt through other means in accordance with applicable law and regulations.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Content of decision.</E> The written decision shall include:</P>
              <P>(1) A summary of the facts concerning the origin, nature, and amount of the debt;</P>
              <P>(2) The hearing official's findings, analysis, and conclusions; and</P>
              <P>(3) The terms of any repayment schedules, if applicable.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Failure to appear.</E> If, in the absence of good cause shown, such as illness, the employee or the representative of FHFA fails to appear, the hearing official shall proceed with the hearing as scheduled, and make his or her decision based upon the oral testimony presented and the documentation submitted by both parties. At the request of both parties, the hearing official may schedule a new hearing date. Both parties shall be given reasonable notice of the time and place of the new hearing.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Request for review.</E> (1) An employee subject to salary offset or a voluntary repayment agreement may, at any time, request a special review by FHFA of the amount of the salary offset or voluntary repayment, based on materially changed circumstances, including, but not limited to, catastrophic illness, divorce, death, or disability.</P>
              <P>(2) The request for special review must include an alternative proposed offset or payment schedule and a detailed statement, with supporting documents, that shows why the current salary offset or payments result in extreme financial hardship to the employee and his or her spouse and dependents. The detailed statement must indicate:</P>
              <P>(i) Income from all sources;</P>
              <P>(ii) Assets;</P>
              <P>(iii) Liabilities;</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Evaluation of request.</E> FHFA shall evaluate the statement and supporting documents and determine whether the original offset or repayment schedule imposes extreme financial hardship on the employee, for example, by preventing the employee from meeting essential subsistence expenses such as food, housing, clothing, transportation, and medical care. FHFA shall notify the employee in writing within 30 calendar days of such determination, including, if appropriate, a revised offset or payment schedule. If the special review results in a revised offset or repayment schedule, FHFA shall provide a new certification to the paying agency.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Procedures for salary offset where FHFA is the paying agency.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Generally.</E> FHFA shall coordinate salary deductions under this section and shall determine the amount of an employee's disposable pay and the amount of the salary offset subject to the requirements in this section. Deductions shall begin the pay period following the issuance of the certification by FHFA or the receipt by FHFA of the certification from another agency, or as soon thereafter as possible.</P>
              <P>(b) Upon issuance of a proper certification by FHFA for debts owed to FHFA, or upon receipt of a proper certification from a creditor agency, FHFA shall send the employee a written notice of salary offset. Such notice shall advise the employee:</P>
              <P>(1) That certification has been issued by FHFA or received from another creditor agency;</P>
              <P>(2) Of the amount of the debt and of the deductions to be made; and provided for in the certification, and</P>

              <P>(3) Of the initiation of salary offset at the next officially established pay <PRTPAGE P="93"/>interval or as otherwise provided for in the certification.</P>
              <P>(c) Where appropriate, FHFA shall provide a copy of the notice to the creditor agency and advise such agency of the dollar amount to be offset and the pay period when the offset will begin.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Types of collection</E>—(1) <E T="03">Lump-sum payment.</E> If the amount of the debt is equal to or less than 15 percent of the employee's disposable pay, such debt ordinarily will be collected in one lump-sum payment.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Installment deductions.</E> Installment deductions will be made over a period not greater than the anticipated period of employment. The size and frequency of installment deductions will bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the employee's ability to pay. However, the amount deducted for any pay period will not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made unless the employee has agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount. The installment payment should normally be sufficient in size and frequency to liquidate the debt in no more than three years. Installment payments of less than $50 should be accepted only in the most unusual circumstances.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Lump-sum deductions from final check.</E> In order to liquidate a debt, a lump-sum deduction exceeding 15 percent of disposable pay may be made pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716 from any final salary payment due a former employee, whether the former employee was separated voluntarily or involuntarily.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Lump-sum deductions from other sources.</E> Whenever an employee subject to salary offset is separated from FHFA, and the balance of the debt cannot be liquidated by offset of the final salary check, FHFA may offset any later payments of any kind to the former employee to collect the balance of the debt pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Multiple debts</E>—(1) Where two or more creditor agencies are seeking salary offset, or where two or more debts are owed to a single creditor agency, FHFA may, at its discretion, determine whether one or more debts should be offset simultaneously within the 15 percent limitation.</P>
              <P>(2) In the event that a debt owed FHFA is certified while an employee is subject to salary offset to repay another agency, FHFA may, at its discretion, determine whether the debt to FHFA should be repaid before the debt to the other agency is repaid, repaid simultaneously with the other debt, or repaid after the debt to the other agency.</P>
              <P>(3) A levy pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall take precedence over other deductions under this section, as provided in 5 U.S.C. 5514(d).</P>

              <P>(2) Upon completion of the procedures set forth in §§ 1208.24 through 1208.26, FHFA shall submit to the employee's paying agency, if applicable, a certified debt claim and an installment agreement or other instruction on the payment schedule.</P>
              <P>(i) If the employee is in the process of separating from the Federal Government, FHFA shall submit its debt claim to the employee's paying agency for collection by lump-sum deduction from the employee's final check.

              <P>(ii) If the employee is already separated and all payments due from his or her former paying agency have been paid, FHFA may, unless otherwise prohibited, request that money due and payable to the employee from the Federal Government, including payments from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (5 CFR 831.1801) or other similar funds, be administratively offset to collect the debt.<PRTPAGE P="94"/>

Deductions shall be scheduled to begin at the next officially established pay interval or as otherwise provided for in the certification.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Incomplete claim.</E> When FHFA receives an incomplete certification of debt from a creditor agency, FHFA shall return the claim with notice that procedures under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR 550.1104 must be followed, and that a properly certified claim must be received before FHFA will take action to collect the debt from the employee's current pay account.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Review.</E> FHFA is not authorized to review the merits of the creditor agency's determination with respect to the amount or validity of the debt certified by the creditor agency.</P>

One copy of the certification shall be furnished to the employee and one copy shall be sent to the creditor agency along with notice of the employee's transfer. If FHFA is aware that the employee is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund or other similar payments, it must provide written notification to the agency responsible for making such payments that the debtor owes a debt (including the amount) and that the requirements set forth herein and in 5 CFR part 550, subpart K, have been met. FHFA must submit a properly certified claim to the new payment agency before a collection can be made.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Authority and scope.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The provisions of this subpart C apply to the collection of debts owed to the Federal Government arising from transactions with FHFA. Administrative offset is authorized under the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (DCIA). This subpart C is consistent with the Federal Claims Collection Standards (FCCS) on administrative offset issued by the Department of Justice.</P>
              <P>(b) FHFA may collect a debt owed to the Federal Government from a person, organization, or other entity by administrative offset, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716, where:</P>
              <P>(1) The debt is certain in amount;</P>
              <P>(2) Administrative offset is feasible, desirable, and not otherwise prohibited;</P>
              <P>(3) The applicable statute of limitations has not expired; and</P>
              <P>(4) Administrative offset is in the best interest of the Federal Government.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 1208.41</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Collection.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) FHFA may collect a claim from a person, organization, or other entity by administrative offset of monies payable by the Federal Government only after:</P>
              <P>(1) Providing the debtor with due process required under this part; and</P>
              <P>(2) Providing the paying agency with written certification that the debtor owes the debt in the amount stated and that FHFA, as creditor agency, has complied with this part.</P>
              <P>(b) Prior to initiating collection by administrative offset, FHFA should determine that the proposed offset is within the scope of this remedy, as set forth in 31 CFR 901.3(a). Administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716 may not be used to collect debts more than 10 years after the Federal Government's right to collect the debt first accrued, except as otherwise provided by law. In addition, administrative offset may not be used when a statute explicitly prohibits its use to collect the claim or type of claim involved.</P>
              <P>(c) Unless otherwise provided, debts or payments not subject to administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716 may be collected by administrative offset under common law, or any other applicable statutory authority.</P>

              <P>FHFA shall not be required to follow the procedures described in § 1208.43 where:</P>
              <P>(a) Prior to the completion of the procedures described in § 1208.43, FHFA may effect administrative offset if failure to offset would substantially prejudice its ability to collect the debt, and if the time before the payment is to be made does not reasonably permit completion of the procedures described in § 1208.43. Such prior administrative offset shall be followed promptly by the completion of the procedures described in § 1208.43. Amounts recovered by administrative offset but later found not to be owed to FHFA shall be promptly refunded. This section applies only to administrative offset pursuant to 31 CFR 901.3(c), and does not apply when debts are referred to the Department of the Treasury for mandatory centralized administrative offset under 31 CFR 901.3(b)(1).</P>

              <P>(b) The administrative offset is in the nature of a recoupment (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> FHFA may offset a payment due to the debtor when both the payment due to the debtor and the debt owed to FHFA arose from the same transaction); or</P>
              <P>(c) In the case of non-centralized administrative offsets, FHFA first learns of the existence of a debt due when there would be insufficient time to afford the debtor due process under these procedures before the paying agency makes payment to the debtor; in such cases, the Director shall give the debtor notice and an opportunity for review as soon as practical and shall refund any money ultimately found not to be due to the Federal Government.</P>

              <P>Unless the procedures described in § 1208.42 are used, prior to collecting any debt by administrative offset or referring such claim to another agency for collection through administrative offset, FHFA shall provide the debtor with the following:</P>

              <P>(a) Written notification of the nature and amount of the debt, the intention <PRTPAGE P="96"/>of FHFA to collect the debt through administrative offset, and a statement of the rights of the debtor under this section;</P>
              <P>(b) An opportunity to inspect and copy the records of FHFA related to the debt that are not exempt from disclosure;</P>
              <P>(c) An opportunity for review within FHFA of the determination of indebtedness. Any request for review by the debtor shall be in writing and shall be submitted to FHFA within 30 calendar days of the date of the notice of the offset. FHFA may waive the time limits for requesting review for good cause shown by the debtor. FHFA shall provide the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for an oral hearing when:</P>
              <P>(1) An applicable statute authorizes or requires FHFA to consider waiver of the indebtedness involved, the debtor requests waiver of the indebtedness, and the waiver determination turns on an issue of credibility or veracity; or</P>
              <P>(2) The debtor requests reconsideration of the debt and FHFA determines that the question of the indebtedness cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence, as for example, when the validity of the debt turns on an issue of credibility or veracity. Unless otherwise required by law, an oral hearing under this subpart C is not required to be a formal evidentiary hearing, although FHFA shall document all significant matters discussed at the hearing. In those cases where an oral hearing is not required by this subpart C, FHFA shall make its determination on the request for waiver or reconsideration based upon a review of the written record; and</P>
              <P>(d) An opportunity to enter into a written agreement for the voluntary repayment of the amount of the claim at the discretion of FHFA.</P>

              <P>(ii) The agency has prescribed regulations for the exercise of administrative offset; and<PRTPAGE P="97"/>

              <P>(2) A determination by FHFA that collection by administrative offset against funds payable by FHFA would be in the best interest of the Federal Government as determined by the facts and circumstances of the particular case and that such administrative offset would not otherwise be contrary to law.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Request for administrative offset.</E> Unless otherwise prohibited by law, FHFA may request that monies that are due and payable to a debtor from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (Fund) be offset administratively in reasonable amounts in order to collect in one full payment or in a minimal number of payments debt owed to FHFA by the debtor. Such requests shall be made to the appropriate officials of OPM in accordance with such regulations as may be prescribed by FHFA or OPM.</P>

              <P>(2) FHFA has complied with the applicable statutes, regulations, and procedures of OPM; and</P>

              <P>(c) If FHFA decides to request administrative offset under paragraph (a) of this section, it shall make the request as soon as practicable after completion of the applicable procedures. This will satisfy any requirement that administrative offset be initiated prior to the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. At such time as the debtor makes a claim for payments from the Fund, if at least one year has elapsed since the administrative offset request was originally made, the debtor shall be permitted to offer a satisfactory repayment plan in lieu of administrative offset if he or she establishes that changed financial circumstances would render the administrative offset unjust.</P>
              <P>(d) If FHFA collects part or all of the debt by other means before deductions are made or completed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, FHFA shall act promptly to modify or terminate its request for administrative offset under paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

              <P>(c) To the extent that a debt owed has not been established by judicial or administrative order, to request a hearing concerning the existence or amount of the debt or the terms of the repayment schedule. With respect to debts established by a judicial or administrative order, a debtor may request a hearing concerning the payment or other discharge of the debt. The debtor is not entitled to a hearing concerning the terms of the proposed repayment schedule if these terms have been established by written agreement.</P>

              <P>(a) If the debtor submits a timely written request for a hearing as provided in § 1208.62(c), FHFA will afford the debtor a hearing, which at FHFA's option may be oral or written. FHFA will provide the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for an oral hearing when FHFA determines that the issues in dispute cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence, for example, when the validity of the claim turns on the issue of credibility or veracity.</P>
              <P>(b) If FHFA determines that an oral hearing is appropriate, the time and location of the hearing shall be established by FHFA. An oral hearing may, at the debtor's option, be conducted either in person or by telephone conference. All travel expenses incurred by the debtor in connection with an in-person hearing will be borne by the debtor. All telephonic charges incurred during the hearing will be the responsibility of the agency.</P>
              <P>(c) In cases when it is determined that an oral hearing is not required by this section, FHFA will accord the debtor a “paper hearing,” that is, FHFA will decide the issues in dispute based upon a review of the written record.</P>

              <P>FHFA will have the burden of proof to establish the existence or amount of the debt. Thereafter, if the debtor disputes the existence or amount of the debt, the debtor must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that no debt exists, or that the amount of the debt is incorrect. In addition, the debtor may present evidence that the terms of the repayment schedule are unlawful, would cause a financial hardship to the debtor, or that collection of the debt may not be pursued due to operation of law. The hearing official shall maintain a record of any hearing held under this section. Hearings are not required to be formal, and evidence may be offered without regard to formal rules of evidence. Witnesses who testify in oral hearings shall do so under oath or affirmation.</P>

              <P>(a) Unless FHFA receives information that it believes justifies a delay or cancellation of the withholding order, FHFA will send by first class mail a withholding order to the debtor's employer within 30 calendar days after the debtor fails to make a timely request for a hearing (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> within 15 business days after the mailing of the notice of FHFA's intent to seek garnishment) or, if a timely request for a hearing is made by the debtor, within 30 calendar days after a decision to issue a withholding order becomes final.</P>
              <P>(b) The withholding order sent to the employer will be in the form prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, on FHFA's letterhead, and signed by the head of the agency or delegate. The order will contain all information necessary for the employer to comply with the withholding order, including the debtor's name, address, and social security number, as well as instructions for withholding and information as to where payments should be sent.</P>

              <P>Along with the withholding order, FHFA will send to the employer a certification in a form prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury. The employer shall complete and return the certification to FHFA within the time frame prescribed in the instructions to the form. The certification will address matters such as information about the debtor's employment status and disposable pay available for withholding.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Amounts withheld.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Upon receipt of the garnishment order issued under this section, the employer shall deduct from all disposable pay paid to the debtor during each pay period the amount of garnishment described in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, the amount of garnishment shall be the lesser of:</P>
              <P>(1) The amount indicated on the garnishment order up to 15 percent of the debtor's disposable pay; or</P>
              <P>(2) The amount set forth in 15 U.S.C. 1673(a)(2). The amount set forth at 15 U.S.C. 1673(a)(2) is the amount by which the debtor's disposable pay exceeds an amount equivalent to thirty times the minimum wage.</P>
              <P>(c) When a debtor's pay is subject to withholding orders with priority, the following shall apply:</P>

              <P>(1) Unless otherwise provided by Federal law, withholding orders issued under this section shall be paid in the amounts set forth under paragraph (b) of this section and shall have priority over other withholding orders which <PRTPAGE P="102"/>are served later in time. However, withholding orders for family support shall have priority over withholding orders issued under this section.</P>
              <P>(2) If amounts are being withheld from a debtor's pay pursuant to a withholding order served on an employer before a withholding order issued pursuant to this section, or if a withholding order for family support is served on an employer at any time, the amounts withheld pursuant to the withholding order issued under this section shall be the lesser of:</P>
              <P>(i) The amount calculated under paragraph (b) of this section; or</P>
              <P>(ii) An amount equal to 25 percent of the debtor's disposable pay less the amount(s) withheld under the withholding order(s) with priority.</P>
              <P>(3) If a debtor owes more than one debt to FHFA, FHFA may issue multiple withholding orders. The total amount garnished from the debtor's pay for such orders will not exceed the amount set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) An amount greater than that set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section may be withheld upon the written consent of the debtor.</P>
              <P>(e) The employer shall promptly pay to FHFA all amounts withheld in accordance with the withholding order issued pursuant to this section.</P>
              <P>(f) An employer shall not be required to vary its normal pay and disbursement cycles in order to comply with the withholding order.</P>
              <P>(g) Any assignment or allotment by the employee of the employee's earnings shall be void to the extent it interferes with or prohibits execution of the withholding order under this section, except for any assignment or allotment made pursuant to a family support judgment or order.</P>
              <P>(h) The employer shall withhold the appropriate amount from the debtor's wages for each pay period until the employer receives notification from FHFA to discontinue wage withholding. The garnishment order shall indicate a reasonable period of time within which the employer is required to commence wage withholding.</P>

              <P>(b) A debtor requesting a review under this section shall submit the basis for claiming that the current amount of garnishment results in a financial hardship to the debtor, along with supporting documentation.</P>
              <P>(c) If a financial hardship is found, FHFA will downwardly adjust, by an amount and for a period of time agreeable to FHFA, the amount garnished to reflect the debtor's financial condition. FHFA will notify the employer of any adjustments to the amounts to be withheld.</P>

              <P>FHFA may sue any employer for any amount that the employer fails to withhold from wages owed and payable to its employee in accordance with this subpart E. However, a suit will not be filed before the termination of the collection action involving a particular debtor, unless earlier filing is necessary to avoid expiration of any applicable statute of limitations. For purposes of this subpart E, “termination of the collection action” occurs when the agency has terminated collection action in accordance with the FCCS or other applicable standards. In any event, termination of the collection action will have been deemed to occur if FHFA has not received any payments to satisfy the debt from the particular debtor whose wages were subject to garnishment, in whole or in part, for a period of one (1) year.</P>

Fees for witnesses shall be tendered in advance by the party requesting the subpoena, except that fees and mileage need not be tendered in advance where FHFA is the party requesting the subpoena.

              <P>Proceedings under subpart C of this part are commenced by the Director by the issuance of a notice of charges, as defined in § 1209.3(p), that must be served upon a respondent. A notice of charges shall state all of the following:</P>
              <P>(a) The legal authority for the proceeding and for FHFA's jurisdiction over the proceeding;</P>
              <P>(b) A statement of the matters of fact or law showing that FHFA is entitled to relief;</P>
              <P>(c) A proposed order or prayer for an order granting the requested relief;</P>
              <P>(d) Information concerning the nature of the proceeding and pertinent procedural matters, including: the requirement that the hearing shall be held in the District of Columbia; the presiding officer will set the date and location for an evidentiary hearing in a scheduling order to be issued not less than 30 days or more than 60 days after service of the notice of charges; contact information for FHFA enforcement counsel and the presiding officer, if known; submission information for filings and appearances, the time within which to request a hearing, and citation to FHFA Rules of Practice and Procedure; and</P>
              <P>(e) Information concerning proper filing of the answer, including the time within which to file the answer as required by law or regulation, a statement that the answer shall be filed with the presiding officer or with FHFA as specified therein, and the address for filing the answer (and request for a hearing, if applicable).</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Filing deadline.</E> Unless otherwise specified by the Director in the notice, respondent shall file an answer within 20 days of service of the notice of charges initiating the enforcement action.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Content of answer.</E> An answer must respond specifically to each paragraph or allegation of fact contained in the notice of charges and must admit, deny, or state that the party lacks sufficient information to admit or deny each allegation of fact. A statement of lack of information has the effect of a denial. Denials must fairly meet the substance of each allegation of fact denied; general denials are not permitted. When a respondent denies part of an allegation, that part must be denied and the remainder specifically admitted. Any allegation of fact in the notice that is not denied in the answer is deemed admitted for purposes of the proceeding. A respondent is not required to respond to the portion of a notice that constitutes the prayer for relief or proposed order. The answer must set forth affirmative defenses, if any, asserted by the respondent.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Default.</E> Failure of a respondent to file an answer required by this section within the time provided constitutes a waiver of such respondent's right to appear and contest the allegations in the notice. If no timely answer is filed, FHFA counsel of record may file a motion for entry of an order of default. Upon a finding that no good cause has been shown for the failure to file a timely answer, the presiding officer shall file with the Director a recommended decision containing the findings and the relief sought in the notice. Any final order issued by the Director based upon a respondent's failure to answer is deemed to be an order issued upon consent.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Amendments.</E> The notice or answer may be amended or supplemented at any stage of the proceeding. The respondent must answer an amended notice within the time remaining for the respondent's answer to the original notice, or within 10 days after service of the amended notice, whichever period is longer, unless the Director or presiding officer orders otherwise for good cause shown.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Amendments to conform to the evidence.</E> When issues not raised in the notice or answer are tried at the hearing by express or implied consent of the parties, or as the presiding officer may allow for good cause shown, such issues will be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the notice or answer, and no formal amendments are required. If evidence is objected to at the hearing on the ground that it is not within the issues raised by the notice or answer, the presiding officer may admit the evidence when admission is likely to assist in adjudicating the merits of the action. The presiding officer will do so freely when the determination of the merits of the action is served thereby and the objecting party fails to satisfy the presiding officer that the admission of such evidence would unfairly prejudice that party's action or defense upon the merits. The presiding officer may grant a continuance to enable the objecting party to meet such evidence.</P>

In the event of consolidation under this section, appropriate adjustment to the pre-hearing schedule must be made to avoid unnecessary expense, inconvenience, or delay.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Severance.</E> The presiding officer may, upon the motion of any party, sever the proceeding for separate resolution of the matter as to any respondent only if the presiding officer finds that undue prejudice or injustice to the moving party would result from not severing the proceeding and such undue prejudice or injustice would outweigh the interests of judicial economy and expedition in the complete and final resolution of the proceeding.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Discovery.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General rule.</E> (1) <E T="03">Limits on discovery.</E> Subject to the limitations set out in paragraphs (a)(2), (b), (d), and (e) of this section, a party to a proceeding under this part may obtain document discovery by serving upon any other party in the proceeding a written request to produce documents. For purposes of such requests, the term “documents” may be defined to include records, drawings, graphs, charts, photographs, recordings, or data stored in electronic form or other data compilations from which information can be obtained or translated, if necessary, by the parties through detection devices into reasonably usable form (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> electronically stored information), as well as written material of all kinds.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Discovery plan.</E> (i) In the initial scheduling conference held in accordance with § 1209.36, or otherwise at the earliest practicable time, the presiding officer shall require the parties to confer in good faith to develop and submit a joint discovery plan for the timely, cost-effective management of document discovery (including, if applicable, electronically stored information). The discovery plan should provide for the coordination of similar discovery requests by multiple parties, if any, and specify how costs are to be apportioned among those parties. The discovery plan shall specify the form of electronic productions, if any. Documents are to be produced in accordance with the technical specifications described in the discovery plan.</P>
              <P>(ii) Discovery in the proceeding may commence upon the approval of the discovery plan by the presiding officer. Thereafter, the presiding officer may interpret or modify the discovery plan for good cause shown or in his or her discretion due to changed circumstances.</P>
              <P>(iii) Nothing in paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall be interpreted or deemed to require the production of documents that are privileged or not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost, or to require any document production otherwise inconsistent with the limitations on discovery set forth in this part.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Relevance and scope.</E> (1) A party may obtain document discovery regarding any matter not privileged that is materially relevant to the charges or allowable defenses raised in the pending proceeding.</P>
              <P>(2) The scope of available discovery shall be limited in accordance with subpart C of this part. Any request for the production of documents that seeks to obtain privileged information or documents not materially relevant under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, or that is unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, unduly burdensome, cumulative, or repetitive of any prior discovery requests, shall be denied or modified.</P>
              <P>(3) A request for document discovery is unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly burdensome—and shall be denied or modified—if, among other things, the request:</P>

              <P>(i) Fails to specify justifiable limitations on the relevant subject matter, <PRTPAGE P="122"/>time period covered, search parameters, or the geographic location(s) or data repositories to be searched;</P>
              <P>(ii) Fails to identify documents with sufficient specificity;</P>
              <P>(iii) Seeks material that is duplicative, cumulative, or obtainable from another source that is more accessible, cost-effective, or less burdensome;</P>
              <P>(iv) Calls for the production of documents to be delivered to the requesting party or his or her designee and fails to provide a written agreement by the requestor to pay in advance for the costs of production in accordance with § 1209.30, or otherwise fails to take into account costs associated with processing electronically stored information or any cost-sharing agreements between the parties;</P>
              <P>(v) Fails to afford the responding party adequate time to respond; or</P>
              <P>(vi) Fails to take into account retention policies or security protocols with respect to Federal information systems.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Forms of discovery.</E> Discovery shall be limited to requests for production of documents for inspection and copying. No other form of discovery shall be allowed. Discovery by use of interrogatories is not permitted. This paragraph shall not be interpreted to require the creation of a document.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Privileged matter.</E> (1) <E T="03">Privileged documents are not discoverable.</E> (i) Privileges include the attorney-client privilege, work-product privilege, any government's or government agency's deliberative process privilege, and any other privileges provided by the Constitution, any applicable act of Congress, or the principles of common law.</P>
              <P>(ii) The parties may enter into a written agreement to permit a producing party to assert applicable privileges of a document even after its production and to request the return or destruction of privileged matter (claw back agreement). The parties shall file the claw back agreement with the presiding officer. To ensure the enforceability of the terms of any such claw back agreement, the presiding officer shall enter an order. Any party may petition the presiding officer for an order specifying claw back procedures for good cause shown.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">No effect on examination authority.</E> The limitations on discoverable matter provided for in this part are not intended and shall not be construed to limit or otherwise affect the examination, regulatory or supervisory authority of FHFA.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Time limits.</E> All discovery matters, including all responses to discovery requests, shall be completed at least 20 days prior to the date scheduled for the commencement of the testimonial phase of the hearing. No exception to this discovery time limit shall be permitted, unless the presiding officer finds on the record that good cause exists for waiving the 20-day requirement of this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Production.</E> Documents must be produced as they are kept in the usual course of business, or labeled and organized to correspond with the categories in the request, or otherwise produced in a manner determined by mutual agreement between the requesting party and the party or non-party to whom the request is directed in accordance with this part.</P>

              <P>(1) <E T="03">Limitations.</E> Subject to applicable limitations on discovery in this part, a party may serve (requesting party) a request on another party (responding party) for the production of any non-privileged, discoverable documents in the possession, custody, or control of the responding party. A requesting party shall serve a copy of any such document request on all other parties. Each request for the production of documents must, with reasonable particularity, identify or describe the documents to be produced, either by individual item or by category, with sufficient specificity to enable the responding party to respond consistent with the requirements of this part.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Discovery plan.</E> Document discovery under subpart C of this part shall be consistent with any discovery plan approved by the presiding officer under § 1209.29.<PRTPAGE P="123"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Production and costs</E>—(1) <E T="03">General rule.</E> Subject to the applicable limitations on discovery in this part and the discovery plan, the requesting party shall specify a reasonable time, place, and manner for the production of documents and the performance of any related acts. The responding party shall produce documents to the requesting party in a manner consistent with the discovery plan.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Costs.</E> All costs associated with document productions—including, without limitation, photocopying (as specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section) or electronic processing (as specified in paragraph (b)(5) of this section)—shall be born by the requesting party, or otherwise in accordance with any discovery plan approved by the presiding officer that may require such costs be apportioned between parties, or as otherwise ordered by the presiding officer. If consistent with the discovery plan approved by the presiding officer, the responding party may require receipt of payment of any such document production costs in advance before any such production of responsive documents.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Organization.</E> Unless otherwise provided for in any discovery plan approved by the presiding officer under § 1209.29 of this part, or by order of the presiding officer, documents must be produced as they are kept in the usual course of business or they shall be labeled and organized to correspond with the categories in the document request.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Photocopying charges.</E> Photocopying charges are to be set at the current rate per page imposed by FHFA under the fee schedule pursuant to § 1202.11(c) of this part for requests for documents filed under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Electronic processing.</E> In the event that any party seeks the production of electronically stored information (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> information created, stored, communicated, or used in digital format requiring the use of computer hardware and software), the parties shall confer in good faith to resolve common discovery issues related to electronically stored information, such as preservation, search methodology, collection, and need for such information; the suitability of alternative means to obtain it; and the format of production. Consistent with the discovery plan approved by the presiding officer under § 1209.29, costs associated with the processing of such electronic information (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> imaging; scanning; conversion of “native” files to images that are viewable and searchable; indexing; coding; database or Web-based hosting; searches; branding of endorsements, such as “confidential” or document control numbering; privilege reviews; and copies of production discs) and delivery of any such document production, shall be born by the requesting party, apportioned among the parties, or as otherwise ordered by the presiding officer. Nothing in this part shall be deemed to require FHFA to produce privileged documents or any electronic records in violation of applicable Federal law or security protocols.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Obligation to update responses.</E> A party who has responded to a discovery request is not required to supplement the response, unless:</P>
              <P>(1) The responding party learns that in some material respect the information disclosed is incomplete or incorrect, and</P>
              <P>(2) The additional or corrective information has not otherwise been made known to the other parties during the discovery process or in writing.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Motions to strike or limit discovery requests.</E> (1) Any party served with a document discovery request may object within 30 days of service of the request by filing a motion to strike or limit the request in accordance with the provisions of § 1209.28 of this part. No other party may file an objection. If an objection is made only to a portion of an item or category in a request, the objection shall specify that portion. Any objections not made in accordance with this paragraph and § 1209.28 are waived.</P>
              <P>(2) The party who served the request that is the subject of a motion to strike or limit may file a written response in accordance with the provisions of § 1209.28. A reply by the moving party, if any, shall be governed by § 1209.28. No other party may file a response.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Privilege.</E> At the time other documents are produced, all documents withheld on a claim of privilege must <PRTPAGE P="124"/>be reasonably identified, together with a statement of the basis for the assertion of privilege on a privilege log. When similar documents that are protected by the government's deliberative process, investigative or examination privilege, the attorney work-product doctrine, or the attorney-client privilege are voluminous, such documents may be identified on the log by category instead of by individual document. The presiding officer has discretion to permit submission of a privilege log subsequent to the document production(s), which may occur on a rolling basis if agreed to by the parties in the discovery plan, and to determine whether an identification by category is sufficient to provide notice of withheld documents.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Motions to compel production.</E> (1) If a party withholds any document as privileged or fails to comply fully with a document discovery request, the requesting party may, within 10 days of the assertion of privilege or of the time the failure to comply becomes known to the requesting party, file a motion in accordance with the provisions of § 1209.28 for the issuance of a subpoena compelling the production of any such document.</P>
              <P>(2) The party who asserted the privilege or failed to comply with the request may, within five days of service of a motion for the issuance of a subpoena compelling production, file a written response to the motion. No other party may file a response.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Ruling on motions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Appropriate protective orders.</E> After the time for filing a response to a motion to compel pursuant to this section has expired, the presiding officer shall rule promptly on any such motion. The presiding officer may deny, grant in part, or otherwise modify any request for the production of documents, if he determines that a discovery request, or any one or more of its terms, seeks to obtain the production of documents that are privileged or otherwise not within the scope of permissible discovery under § 1209.29(b), and may issue appropriate protective orders, upon such conditions as justice may require.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">No stay.</E> The pendency of a motion to strike or limit discovery, or to compel the production of any document, shall not stay or continue the proceeding, unless otherwise ordered by the presiding officer. Notwithstanding any other provision in this part, the presiding officer may not release, or order any party to produce, any document withheld on the basis of privilege, if the withholding party has stated to the presiding officer its intention to file with the Director a timely motion for interlocutory review of the presiding officer's privilege determination or order to produce the documents, until the Director has rendered a decision on the motion for interlocutory review.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Interlocutory review by the Director.</E> Interlocutory review of a privilege determination or document discovery subpoena of the presiding officer shall be in accordance with § 1209.33. To the extent necessary to rule promptly on such matters, the Director may request that the presiding officer provide additional information from the record. As provided by § 1209.33 of this part, a pending interlocutory review of a privilege determination or document discovery subpoena shall not stay the proceedings, unless otherwise ordered by the presiding officer or the Director.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Enforcement of document discovery subpoenas</E>—(1) <E T="03">Authority.</E> If the presiding officer or Director issues a subpoena compelling production of documents by a party in a proceeding under this part, in the event of noncompliance with the subpoena and to the extent authorized by section 1379D(c)(1) of the Safety and Soundness Act (12 U.S.C. 4641(c)(1)), the Director or the subpoenaing party may apply to the appropriate United States district court for an order requiring compliance with the subpoena.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">United States district court jurisdiction.</E> As provided by section 1379D(c)(2) of the Safety and Soundness Act (12 U.S.C. 4641(c)(2)), the appropriate United States district court has the jurisdiction and power to order and to require compliance with any discovery subpoena issued under this part.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">No stay; sanctions.</E> The judicial enforcement of a discovery subpoena shall not operate as a stay of the proceedings, unless the presiding officer or the Director orders a stay of such duration as the presiding officer or Director <PRTPAGE P="125"/>may find reasonable and in the best interest of the parties or as justice may require.

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General rules</E>—(1) <E T="03">Application for subpoena.</E> As provided under this part, any party may apply to the presiding officer for the issuance of a document discovery subpoena addressed to any person who is not a party to the proceeding. The application must contain the proposed document subpoena, and a brief statement of facts demonstrating that the documents are materially relevant to the charges and issues presented in the proceeding and the reasonableness of the scope of the document request. The subpoenaing party shall specify a reasonable time, place, and manner for production in response to the subpoena, and state its unequivocal intention to pay for the production of the documents as provided in this part.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Service of subpoena.</E> A party shall apply for a document subpoena under this section only within the time period during which such party could serve a discovery request under § 1209.30 of this part. The party obtaining the document subpoena is responsible for serving it on the subpoenaed person and for serving copies on all other parties. Document subpoenas may be served in the District of Columbia, or any State, Territory, possession, or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, or as otherwise provided by law.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Presiding officer's discretion.</E> The presiding officer shall issue promptly any document subpoena applied for under this section subject to the application conditions set forth in this section and his or her discretion. If the presiding officer determines that the application does not set forth a valid basis for the issuance of the requested document subpoena, or that any of its terms are unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, unduly burdensome, or otherwise objectionable under § 1209.29(b), he may refuse to issue the requested document subpoena or may issue it in a modified form upon such additional conditions as may be determined by the presiding officer.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Motion to quash or modify</E>—(1) <E T="03">Limited appearance.</E> Any non-party to a pending proceeding to whom a document subpoena is directed may enter a limited appearance, through a representative or on his or her own behalf, before the presiding officer to file with the presiding officer a motion to quash or modify such subpoena, accompanied by a statement of the basis for quashing or modifying the subpoena.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Objections.</E> Any motion to quash or modify a document subpoena must be filed on the same basis, including the assertion of any privileges, upon which a party could object to a discovery document request under § 1209.30 and during the same time limits during which such an objection could be filed.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Responses and replies.</E> The party who obtained the subpoena may respond to such motion within 10 days of service of the motion; the response shall be served on the non-party in accordance with this part. Absent express leave of the presiding officer, no other party may respond to the non-party's motion. The non-party may file a reply within five days of service of a response.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">No stay.</E> A non-party's right to seek to quash or modify a document subpoena shall not stay the proceeding, or limit in any manner the sanctions that may be imposed by the presiding officer against a party who induces another to fail to produce any such subpoenaed documents. No party may rely upon the pendency of a non-party's motion to quash or modify a document subpoena to excuse performance of any action required of that party under this part.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Enforcing document subpoenas to non-parties</E>—(1) <E T="03">Application for enforcement of subpoena.</E> If a non-party fails to comply with any subpoena issued pursuant to this section or with any order of the presiding officer that directs compliance with all or any portion of a document subpoena issued pursuant to this section, the subpoenaing party or <PRTPAGE P="126"/>any other aggrieved party to the proceeding may, to the extent authorized by section 1379D(c) of the Safety and Soundness Act (12 U.S.C. 4641(c)), apply to an appropriate United States district court for an order requiring compliance with the subpoena.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">No stay.</E> A party's right to seek district court enforcement of a non-party document production subpoena under this section shall not automatically stay an enforcement proceeding under of the Safety and Soundness Act.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Sanctions.</E> A party's right to seek district court enforcement of a non-party document subpoena shall in no way limit the sanctions that may be imposed by the presiding officer on a party who induces another to fail to comply with any subpoena issued under this section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Deposition of witness unavailable for hearing.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General rules.</E> (1) If a witness will not be available for the hearing, a party desiring to preserve that witness's testimony for the record may apply to the presiding officer in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section for the issuance of a subpoena or subpoena <E T="03">duces tecum</E> requiring attendance of the witness at a deposition for the purpose of preserving that witness's testimony. The presiding officer may issue a deposition subpoena under this section upon a showing that:</P>
              <P>(i) The witness will be unable to attend or may be prevented from attending the testimonial phase of the hearing because of age, sickness, or infirmity, or will be otherwise unavailable;</P>
              <P>(ii) The subpoenaing party did not cause or contribute to the unavailability of the witness for the hearing;</P>
              <P>(iii) The witness has personal knowledge and the testimony is reasonably expected to be materially relevant to claims, defenses, or matters determined to be at issue in the proceeding; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Taking the deposition will not result in any undue burden to any other party and will not cause undue delay of the proceeding.</P>
              <P>(2) The application must contain a proposed deposition subpoena and a brief statement of the reasons for the issuance of the subpoena. The subpoena must name the witness whose deposition is to be taken and specify the time and place for taking the deposition. A deposition subpoena may require the witness to be deposed anywhere within the United States, or its Territories and possessions, in which that witness resides or has a regular place of employment or such other convenient place as the presiding officer shall fix.</P>
              <P>(3) Subpoenas must be issued promptly upon request, unless the presiding officer determines that the request fails to set forth a valid basis under this section for its issuance. Before making a determination that there is no valid basis for issuing the subpoena, the presiding officer shall require a written response from the party requesting the subpoena or require attendance at a conference to determine whether there is a valid basis upon which to issue the requested subpoena.</P>
              <P>(4) The party obtaining a deposition subpoena is responsible for serving it on the witness and for serving copies on all parties. Unless the presiding officer orders otherwise, no deposition under this section shall be taken on fewer than 10 days' notice to the witness and all parties. Deposition subpoenas may be served anywhere within the United States or its Territories and possessions, or on any person doing business anywhere within the United States or its Territories and possessions, or as otherwise permitted by law.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Objections to deposition subpoenas.</E> (1) The witness and any party who has not had an opportunity to oppose a deposition subpoena issued under this section may file a motion with the presiding officer under § 1209.28 of this part to quash or modify the subpoena prior to the time for compliance specified in the subpoena, but not more than 10 days after service of the subpoena.</P>
              <P>(2) A statement of the basis for the motion to quash or modify a subpoena issued under this section must accompany the motion. The motion must be served on all parties.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Procedure upon deposition.</E> (1) Each witness testifying pursuant to a deposition subpoena must be duly sworn and <PRTPAGE P="127"/>each party shall have the right to examine the witness. Objections to questions or documents must be in short form, stating the grounds for the objection. Failure to object to questions or documents is not deemed a waiver except where the ground for objection might have been avoided if the objection had been presented timely. All questions, answers, and objections must be recorded and transcribed. Videotaped depositions must be transcribed for the record; copies and transcriptions must be supplied to each party.</P>
              <P>(2) Any party may move before the presiding officer for an order compelling the witness to answer any questions the witness has refused to answer or submit any evidence that, during the deposition, the witness has refused to submit.</P>
              <P>(3) The deposition transcript must be subscribed by the witness, unless the parties and the witness, by stipulation, have waived the signing, or the witness is ill, cannot be found, or has refused to sign. If the deposition is not subscribed by the witness, the court reporter taking the deposition shall certify that the transcript is a true and complete transcript of the deposition.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Enforcing subpoenas.</E> If a subpoenaed person fails to comply with any subpoena issued pursuant to this section or with any order of the presiding officer made upon motion under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the subpoenaing party or other aggrieved party may, to the extent authorized by section 1379D(c) of the Safety and Soundness Act (12 U.S.C. 4641(c)), apply to an appropriate United States district court for an order requiring compliance with the portions of the subpoena that the presiding officer has ordered enforced. A party's right to seek court enforcement of a deposition subpoena in no way limits the sanctions that may be imposed by the presiding officer on a party who fails to comply with or induces a failure to comply with a subpoena issued under this section.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General rule.</E> The Director may review a ruling of the presiding officer prior to the certification of the record to the Director only in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Scope of review.</E> The Director may exercise interlocutory review of a ruling of the presiding officer if the Director finds that:</P>
              <P>(1) The ruling involves a controlling question of law or policy as to which substantial grounds exist for a difference of opinion;</P>
              <P>(2) Immediate review of the ruling may materially advance the ultimate termination of the proceeding;</P>
              <P>(3) Subsequent modification of the ruling at the conclusion of the proceeding would be an inadequate remedy; or</P>
              <P>(4) Subsequent modification of the ruling would cause unusual delay or expense.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Procedure.</E> Any motion for interlocutory review shall be filed by a party with the presiding officer within 10 days of his or her ruling. Upon the expiration of the time for filing all responses, the presiding officer shall refer the matter to the Director for final disposition. In referring the matter to the Director, the presiding officer may indicate agreement or disagreement with the asserted grounds for interlocutory review of the ruling in question.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Suspension of proceeding.</E> Neither a request for interlocutory review nor any disposition of such a request by the Director under this section suspends or stays the proceeding unless otherwise ordered by the presiding officer or the Director.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> The presiding officer shall recommend that the Director issue a final order granting a motion for summary disposition if the undisputed pleaded facts, admissions, affidavits, stipulations, documentary evidence, matters as to which official notice may be taken, and any other evidentiary materials properly submitted in connection with a motion for summary disposition show that:</P>
              <P>(1) There is no genuine issue as to any material fact; and</P>

              <P>(2) The movant is entitled to a decision in its favor as a matter of law.<PRTPAGE P="128"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Filing of motions and responses.</E> (1) Any party who believes there is no genuine issue of material fact to be determined and that such party is entitled to a decision as a matter of law may move at any time for summary disposition in its favor of all or any part of the proceeding. Any party, within 30 days after service of such motion or within such time period as allowed by the presiding officer, may file a response to such motion.</P>
              <P>(2) A motion for summary disposition must be accompanied by a statement of material facts as to which the movant contends there is no genuine issue. Such motion must be supported by documentary evidence, which may take the form of admissions in pleadings, stipulations, depositions, investigatory depositions, transcripts, affidavits, and any other evidentiary materials that the movant contends support its position. The motion must also be accompanied by a brief containing the points and authorities in support of the contention of the movant. Any party opposing a motion for summary disposition must file a statement setting forth those material facts as to which the party contends a genuine dispute exists. Such opposition must be supported by evidence of the same type as that submitted with the motion for summary disposition and a brief containing the points and authorities in support of the contention that summary disposition would be inappropriate.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Hearing on motion.</E> At the request of any party or on his or her own motion, the presiding officer may hear oral argument on the motion for summary disposition.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Decision on motion.</E> Following receipt of a motion for summary disposition and all responses thereto, the presiding officer shall determine whether the movant is entitled to summary disposition. If the presiding officer determines that summary disposition is warranted, the presiding officer shall submit a recommended decision to that effect to the Director, under § 1209.53. If the presiding officer finds that the moving party is not entitled to summary disposition, the presiding officer shall make a ruling denying the motion.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Appearance before FHFA or a presiding officer</E>—(1) <E T="03">By attorneys.</E> A party may be represented by an attorney who is a member in good standing of the bar of the highest court of any State, commonwealth, possession or territory of the United States, or the District of Columbia, and who is not currently suspended or disbarred from practice before FHFA.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">By non-attorneys.</E> An individual may appear on his or her own behalf, <E T="03">pro se.</E> A member of a partnership may represent the partnership and a duly authorized officer, director, employee, or other agent of any corporation or other entity not specifically listed herein may represent such corporation or other entity; provided that such officer, director, employee, or other agent is not currently suspended or disbarred from practice before FHFA.

Such notice of appearance shall include a written declaration that the individual is currently qualified as provided in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section and is authorized to represent the particular party. By filing a notice of appearance on behalf of a party in an adjudicatory proceeding, the representative thereby agrees and represents that he is authorized to accept service on behalf of the represented party and that, in the event of withdrawal from representation, he or she will, if required by the presiding officer, continue to accept service until a new representative has filed a notice of appearance or until the represented party indicates that he or she will proceed on a <E T="03">pro se</E> basis.

The presiding officer may take corrective measures at any stage of a proceeding to cure a conflict of interest in representation, including the issuance of an order limiting the scope of representation or disqualifying an individual from appearing in a representative capacity for the duration of the proceeding.</P>

              <P>(6) Assessing reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by any other party as a result of the improper action or failure to act.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Procedure for imposition of sanctions.</E> (1) The presiding officer, on the motion of any party, or on his or her own motion, and after such notice and responses as may be directed by the presiding officer, may impose any sanction authorized by this section.

              <P>(2) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, no sanction authorized by this section, other than refusing to accept late papers, shall be imposed without prior notice to all parties and an opportunity for any representative or party against whom sanctions may be imposed to be heard. The presiding officer shall determine and direct the appropriate notice and form for such opportunity to be heard. The opportunity to be heard may be limited to an opportunity to respond verbally immediately after the act or inaction in question is noted by the presiding officer.</P>
              <P>(3) For purposes of interlocutory review, motions for the imposition of sanctions by any party and the imposition of sanctions shall be treated the same as motions for any other ruling by the presiding officer.</P>
              <P>(4) Nothing in this section shall be read to preclude the presiding officer or the Director from taking any other action or imposing any other restriction or sanction authorized by any applicable statute or regulation.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Discretionary censure, suspension, and disbarment.</E> (1) The Director may censure any individual who practices or attempts to practice before FHFA or suspend or revoke the privilege to appear or practice before FHFA of such individual if, after notice of and opportunity for hearing in the matter, that individual is found by the Director—</P>
              <P>(i) Not to possess the requisite qualifications or competence to represent others;</P>

              <P>(vii) Within the last 10 years, to have been convicted of an offense involving moral turpitude, dishonesty, or breach of trust, if the conviction has not been reversed on appeal. A conviction within the meaning of this paragraph shall be deemed to have occurred when the convicting court enters its judgment or order, regardless of whether an appeal is pending or could be taken and includes a judgment or an order on a plea of <E T="03">nolo contendere</E> or on consent, regardless of whether a violation is admitted in the consent.</P>
              <P>(2) Suspension or revocation on the grounds set forth in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) through (vii) of this section shall only be ordered upon a further finding that the individual's conduct or character was sufficiently egregious as to justify suspension or revocation. Suspension or disbarment under this paragraph shall continue until the applicant has been reinstated by the Director for good cause shown or until, in the case of a suspension, the suspension period has expired.</P>
              <P>(3) If the final order against the respondent is for censure, the individual may be permitted to practice before FHFA, but such individual's future representations may be subject to conditions designed to promote high standards of conduct. If a written letter of censure is issued, a copy will be maintained in FHFA's files.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Mandatory suspension and disbarment.</E> (1) Any counsel who has been and remains suspended or disbarred by a court of the United States or of any State, commonwealth, possession or territory of the United States, or the District of Columbia; any accountant or other licensed expert whose license to practice has been revoked in any State, commonwealth, possession or territory of the United States, or the District of Columbia; any person who has been and remains suspended or barred from practice by or before the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Office of Thrift Supervision, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration, the Federal Housing Finance Board, the Farm Credit Administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission is also suspended automatically from appearing or practicing before FHFA.

              <P>(2) A suspension or disbarment from practice before FHFA under paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall continue until the person suspended or disbarred is reinstated under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</P>

              <P>(2) Any individual appearing or practicing before FHFA who is or within the last 10 years has been convicted of a felony or of a misdemeanor that resulted in a sentence of prison term or in a fine or restitution order totaling more than $5,000 promptly shall file a notice with the Director.

An applicant for reinstatement hereunder may, in the Director's sole discretion, be afforded a hearing.</P>
              <P>(2) An application for reinstatement for good cause by any person suspended or disbarred under paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be filed at any time, but not less than one year after the applicant's most recent application. An applicant for reinstatement for good cause hereunder may, in the Director's sole discretion, be afforded a hearing.</P>
              <P>If, however, all the grounds for suspension or disbarment under paragraph (b)(1) of this section have been removed by a reversal of the order of suspension or disbarment or by termination of the underlying suspension or disbarment, any person suspended or disbarred under paragraph (b)(1) of this section may apply immediately for reinstatement and shall be reinstated by FHFA upon written application notifying FHFA that the grounds have been removed.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Conferences.</E> (1) <E T="03">General rule.</E> The FHFA counsel of record may confer with a proposed respondent concerning allegations of misconduct or other grounds for censure, disbarment, or suspension, regardless of whether a proceeding for censure, disbarment or suspension has been commenced. If a conference results in a stipulation in connection with a proceeding in which the individual is the respondent, the stipulation may be entered in the record at the request of either party to the proceeding.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Resignation or voluntary suspension.</E> In order to avoid the institution of or a decision in a disbarment or suspension proceeding, a person who practices before FHFA may consent to censure, suspension, or disbarment from practice. At the discretion of the Director, the individual may be censured, suspended, or disbarred in accordance with the consent offered.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Hearings under this section.</E> Hearings conducted under this section shall be conducted in substantially the same manner as other hearings under this part, except that in proceedings to terminate an existing FHFA suspension or disbarment order, the person seeking the termination of the order shall bear the burden of going forward with an application and with proof and that the Director may, in the Director's sole discretion, direct that any proceeding to terminate an existing suspension or disbarment by FHFA be limited to written submissions.

              <SUBJECT>Scope.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Subpart F of this part applies to informal hearings afforded to any entity-affiliated party who has been suspended, removed, or prohibited from further participation in the business affairs of a regulated entity by a notice or order issued by the Director under section 1377(h) of the Safety and Soundness Act (12 U.S.C. 4636a(h)).</P>
            </SECTION>
            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 1209.101</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Suspension, removal, or prohibition.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Notice of suspension or prohibition.</E> (1) As provided by section 1377(h)(1) of the Safety and Soundness Act (12 U.S.C. 4636a(h)(1)), if an entity-affiliated party is charged in any information, indictment, or complaint, with the commission of or participation in a crime that involves dishonesty or breach of trust that is punishable by imprisonment for more than one year under State or Federal law, the Director may, if continued service or participation by such party may pose a threat to the regulated entity or impair public confidence in the regulated entity, by written notice served upon such party, suspend such party from office or prohibit such party from further participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of any regulated entity.</P>
              <P>(2) In accordance with section 1377(h)(1) of the Safety and Soundness Act (12 U.S.C. 4636a(h)(1)), the notice of suspension or prohibition is effective upon service. A copy of such notice will be served on the relevant regulated entity. The notice will state the basis for the suspension and the right of the party to request an informal hearing as provided in § 1209.102. The suspension or prohibition is to remain in effect until the information, indictment, or complaint is finally disposed of, or until terminated by the Director, or otherwise as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Order of removal or prohibition.</E> As provided by section 1377(h)(2) of the Safety and Soundness Act (12 U.S.C. 4636a(h)(2)), at such time as a judgment of conviction is entered (or pretrial diversion or other plea bargain is agreed to) in connection with a crime as referred to above in paragraph (a) (the “conviction”), and the conviction is no longer subject to appellate review, the Director may, if continued service or participation by such party may pose a threat to the regulated entity or impair public confidence in the regulated entity, issue an order removing such party from office or prohibiting such party from further participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of the regulated entity without the prior written consent of the Director. A copy of such order will be served on the relevant regulated entity, at which time the entity-affiliated party shall immediately cease to be a director or officer of the regulated entity. The notice will state the basis for the removal or prohibition and the right of the party to request a hearing as provided in § 1209.102.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Effective period.</E> Unless terminated by the Director, a notice of suspension or order of removal issued under section 1377(h)(1) or (2) of the Safety and Soundness Act (12 U.S.C. 4636a(h)(1), (2)) shall remain effective and outstanding until the completion of any informal hearing or appeal provided under section 1377(h)(4) of the Safety and Soundness Act (12 U.S.C. 4636a(h)(4)). The pendency of an informal hearing, if any, does not stay any notice of suspension or prohibition or order of removal or prohibition under subpart F of this part.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Effect of acquittal.</E> As provided by section 1377(h)(2)(B)(ii) of the Safety and Soundness Act (12 U.S.C. 4636a(h)(2)(B)(ii)), a finding of not guilty or other disposition of the charge does not preclude the Director from instituting removal, suspension, or prohibition proceedings under section 1377(a) or (b) of the Safety and Soundness Act (12 U.S.C. 4636a(a), (b)).</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Preservation of authority.</E> Action by the Director under section 1377(h) of the Safety and Soundness Act (12 U.S.C. 4636a(h)), shall not be deemed as a predicate or a bar to any other regulatory, supervisory, or enforcement action under the Safety and Soundness Act.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Hearing on removal or suspension.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Hearing requests</E>—(1) <E T="03">Deadline.</E> An entity-affiliated party served with a notice of suspension or prohibition or an order of removal or prohibition, within 30 days of service of such notice or order, may submit to the Director a written request to appear before the Director to show that his or her continued service or participation in the affairs of the regulated entity will not pose a threat to the interests of, or threaten to impair public confidence in, the Enterprises or the Banks. The request must be addressed to the Director and sent to the Federal Housing Finance Agency at 400 Seventh Street, SW., Eighth Floor, Washington, DC 20219, by:</P>
              <P>(i) Overnight U.S. Postal Service delivery or delivery by a reliable commercial delivery service for same day or overnight delivery to the address stated above; or</P>
              <P>(ii) First class, registered, or certified mail via the U.S. Postal Service.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Waiver of appearance.</E> An entity-affiliated party may elect in writing to waive his or her right to appear to make a statement in person or through counsel and have the matter determined solely on the basis of his or her written submission.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Form and timing of hearing.</E> (1) <E T="03">Informal hearing.</E> Hearings under subpart F of this part are not subject to the formal adjudication provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 554 through 557), and are not conducted under subpart C of this part.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Setting of the hearing.</E> Upon receipt of a timely request for a hearing, the Director will give written notice and set a date within 30 days for the entity-affiliated party to appear, personally, or through counsel, before the Director or his or her designee(s) to submit written materials (or, at the discretion of the Director, oral testimony and oral argument) to make the necessary showing under paragraph (a) of this section. The entity-affiliated party may submit a written request for additional time for the hearing to commence, without undue delay, and the Director may extend the hearing date for a specified time.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Oral testimony.</E> The Director or his or her designee, in his or her discretion, may deny, permit, or limit oral testimony in the hearing.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Conduct of the hearing</E>—(1) <E T="03">Hearing officer.</E> A hearing under this section may be presided over by the Director or one or more designated FHFA employees, except that an officer designated by the Director (hearing officer) to conduct the hearing may not have been involved in an underlying criminal proceeding, a factually related proceeding, or an enforcement proceeding in a prosecutorial or investigative role. This provision does not preclude the Director otherwise from seeking information on the matters at issue from appropriate FHFA staff on an as needed basis consistent with § 1209.101(d)(2).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Submissions.</E> All submissions of the requestor and FHFA's counsel of record must be received by the Director or his or her designee no later than 10 days prior to the date set for the hearing. FHFA may respond in writing to the requestor's submission and serve the requestor (and any other interested party such as the regulated entity) not later than the date fixed by the hearing officer for submissions or other time period as the hearing officer may require.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Procedures.</E> (i) <E T="03">Fact finding authority of the hearing officer.</E> The hearing officer shall determine all procedural matters under subpart F of this part, permit or limit the appearance of witnesses in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section, and impose time limits as he or she deems reasonable. All oral statements, witness testimony, if permitted, and documents submitted that are found by the hearing officer to be materially relevant to the proceeding and not unduly repetitious may be considered. The hearing officer may question any person appearing in the proceeding, and may make any ruling reasonably necessary to ensure the full and fair presentation of evidence and to facilitate the efficient and effective operation of the proceeding.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Statements to an officer.</E> Any oral or written statement made to the Director, a hearing officer, or any FHFA employee under subpart F of this part <PRTPAGE P="140"/>is deemed to be a statement made to a Federal officer or agency within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. 1006.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Oral testimony.</E> If either the requestor or FHFA counsel of record desires to present oral testimony to supplement the party's written submission he or she must make a request in writing to the hearing officer not later than 10 days prior to the hearing, as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, or within a shorter time period as permitted by the hearing officer for good cause shown. The request should include the name of the individual(s), a statement generally descriptive of the expected testimony, and the reasons why such oral testimony is warranted. The hearing officer generally will not admit witnesses, absent a strong showing of specific and compelling need. Witnesses, if admitted, shall be sworn.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Written materials.</E> Each party must file a copy of any affidavit, memorandum, or other written material to be presented at the hearing with the hearing officer and serve copies on any other interested party (such as the affected regulated entity) not later than 10 days prior to commencement of the informal hearing, as provided in paragraph (c)(2), or within a shorter time period as permitted by the hearing officer for good cause shown.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Relief.</E> The purpose of the hearing is to determine whether the suspension or prohibition from participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of the regulated entity will be continued, terminated, or otherwise modified, or whether the order removing such party from office or prohibiting the party from further participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of the regulated entity will be rescinded or otherwise modified.</P>
              <P>(vi) <E T="03">Ultimate question.</E> In deciding on any request for relief from a notice of suspension or prohibition, the hearing officer shall not consider the ultimate question of guilt or innocence with respect to the outstanding criminal charge(s). In deciding on a request for relief from a removal order, the hearing officer shall not consider challenges to or efforts to impeach the validity of the conviction. In either case, the hearing officer may consider facts that show the nature of the events on which the conviction or charges were based.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Record.</E> If warranted under the circumstances of the matter, the hearing officer may require that a transcript of the proceedings be prepared at the expense of the requesting party. The hearing officer may order the record be kept open for a reasonable time following the hearing, not to exceed five business days, to permit the filing of additional pertinent submissions for the record. Thereafter, no further submissions are to be admitted to the record, absent good cause shown.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Recommended decision</E>—(1) <E T="03">Written recommended decision of the hearing officer.</E> Not later than 20 days following the close of the hearing (or if the requestor waived a hearing, from the deadline for submission of the written materials), the hearing officer will serve a copy of the recommended decision on the parties to the proceeding. The recommended decision must include a summary of the findings, the parties' respective arguments, and support for the determination.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Five-day comment period.</E> Not later than five business days after receipt of the recommended decision, the parties shall submit written comments in response to the recommended decision, if any, to the hearing officer. The hearing officer shall not grant any extension of the stated time for responses to a recommended decision.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Recommended decision to be transmitted to the Director.</E> The hearing officer shall promptly forward the recommended decision, and written comments, if any, and the record to the Director for final determination.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Decision of the Director.</E> Within 60 days of the date of the hearing, or if the requestor waived a hearing the date fixed for the hearing, the Director will notify the entity-affiliated party in writing by registered mail of the disposition of his or her request for relief from the notice of suspension or prohibition or the order of removal or prohibition. The decision will state whether the suspension or prohibition will be <PRTPAGE P="141"/>continued, terminated, or otherwise modified, or whether the order removing such party from any participation in the affairs of the regulated entity will be rescinded or otherwise modified. The decision will contain a brief statement of the basis for an adverse determination. The Director's decision is a final and non-appealable order.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Effect of notice or order.</E> A removal or prohibition by order shall remain in effect until terminated by the Director. A suspension or prohibition by notice remains in effect until the criminal charge is disposed of or until terminated by the Director.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Reconsideration.</E> A suspended or removed entity-affiliated party subsequently may petition the Director to reconsider the final decision any time after the expiration of a 12-month period from the date of the decision, but no such request may be made within 12 months of a previous petition for reconsideration. An entity-affiliated party must submit a petition for reconsideration in writing; the petition shall state the specific grounds for relief from the notice of suspension or order or removal and be supported by a memorandum and any other documentation materially relevant to the request for reconsideration. No hearing will be held on a petition for reconsideration, and the Director will inform the requestor of the disposition of the reconsideration request in a timely manner. A decision on a request for reconsideration shall not constitute an appealable order.</P>

            <P>(2) A regulated entity, the Office of Finance, or a director, officer, employee, or agent thereof, also may disclose confidential supervisory information to a consultant under this paragraph if the consultant is under a written contract to provide services to the regulated entity or the Office of Finance and the consultant has agreed in writing:</P>

            <P>(a) This regulation sets forth the policies and procedures that must be followed in order to compel an employee of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to produce records or information, or to provide testimony relating to the employee's official duties, in the context of a legal proceeding. Parties seeking records, information, or testimony must comply with these requirements when submitting demands or requests:</P>

            <P>(1) Promote economy and efficiency in its programs and operations;</P>

            <P>(3) Maintain FHFA's impartiality;</P>
            <P>(4) Protect employees from being compelled to serve as involuntary witnesses for wholly private interests, or as inappropriate expert witnesses regarding current law or the activities of FHFA; and</P>
            <P>(5) Protect sensitive, confidential information and FHFA's deliberative processes.</P>
            <P>(c) By providing these policies and procedures, FHFA does not waive the sovereign immunity of the United States.</P>
            <P>(d) This part provides guidance for FHFA's internal operations. This part does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, that a party may rely upon in any legal proceeding against the United States.</P>
            <P>(e) The production of records, information, or testimony pursuant to this part, does not constitute a waiver by FHFA of any privilege.</P>

            <P>(a) This regulation applies to demands or requests for records, information, or testimony, in legal proceedings in which FHFA is not a named party.</P>
            <P>(b) This regulation does not apply to:</P>
            <P>(1) Demands or requests for an FHFA employee to testify as to facts or events that are unrelated to his or her official duties or that are unrelated to the functions of FHFA;</P>
            <P>(2) Requests for the release of non-exempt records under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, or the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a; or</P>

            <P>As used in this part:</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Confidential supervisory information</E> means information prepared or received by FHFA that meets all of the following criteria:</P>
            <P>(1) The information is not a document prepared by a regulated entity or the Office of Finance for its own business purposes that is in its possession;</P>
            <P>(2) The information is exempt from the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552 (1966); and</P>

            </P>
            <P>(4) The inclusion of the term “confidential” within the definition of “confidential supervisory information” is not intended to invoke the meaning of “confidential,” as that term is used in Executive Order No. 13526, December 29, 2009 (75 FR 707 (Jan. 5, 2010) (President's order on the classification of National Security Information). Confidential supervisory information is used in part 1215 to refer to the distinct category of information defined in § 1215.3. FHFA used the word “confidential” within the label for this category of information simply to be consistent with the manner in which federal banking agencies refer to similar or identical types of information.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Demand</E> means a subpoena, or an order or other command of a court or other competent authority, for the production of records, information, or testimony that is issued in a legal proceeding.</P>

              <E T="03">Federal Home Loan Bank</E> means a bank established under the authority of 12 U.S.C. 1423(a).</P>

              <E T="03">Records or information</E> means, regardless of the person or entity in possession:</P>
            <P>(1) All documents and materials that are FHFA agency records under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552;</P>
            <P>(2) All other documents and materials contained in FHFA files; and</P>
            <P>(3) All other information or materials acquired by an FHFA employee in the performance of his or her official duties or because of his or her official status, including confidential supervisory information.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Regulated entity</E> has the same meaning as set forth in 12 U.S.C. 4502(20). For this regulation's purposes, “regulated entity” also includes:</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">False, fictitious or fraudulent claims.</E> (1) A civil penalty of not more than $11,181 may be imposed upon a person who makes a claim to FHFA for property, services, or money where the <PRTPAGE P="157"/>person knows or has reason to know that the claim:</P>
            <P>(i) Is false, fictitious, or fraudulent;</P>
            <P>(ii) Includes or is supported by a written statement that:</P>
            <P>(A) Asserts a material fact which is false, fictitious, or fraudulent; or</P>
            <P>(B) Omits a material fact and, as a result of the omission, is false, fictitious, or fraudulent, where the person making, presenting, or submitting such statement has a duty to include such material fact; or</P>
            <P>(iii) Is for payment for the provision of property or services to FHFA which the person has not provided as claimed.</P>
            <P>(2) Each voucher, invoice, claim form, or other individual request or demand for property, services, or money constitutes a separate claim for purposes of this part.</P>
            <P>(3) A claim shall be considered made to FHFA, a recipient, or party when the claim is actually made to an agent, fiscal intermediary, or other entity, acting for or on behalf of FHFA, the recipient, or the party.</P>
            <P>(4) Each claim for property, services, or money is subject to a civil penalty, without regard to whether the property, services, or money actually is delivered or paid.</P>
            <P>(5) There is no liability under this part if the amount of money or value of property or services claimed exceeds $150,000 as to each claim that a person submits. For purposes of this paragraph (a), a group of claims submitted simultaneously as part of a single transaction shall be considered a single claim.</P>
            <P>(6) If the FHFA has made any payment, transferred property, or provided services for a claim, then FHFA may make an assessment against a person found liable in an amount of up to twice the amount of the claim or portion of the claim that is determined to be in violation of paragraph (a)(1) of this section. This assessment is in addition to the amount of any civil penalty imposed.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">False, fictitious or fraudulent statements.</E> (1) A civil penalty of up to $11,181 may be imposed upon a person who makes a written statement to FHFA with respect to a claim, contract, bid or proposal for a contract, or benefit from FHFA that:</P>
            <P>(i) The person knows or has reason to know:</P>
            <P>(A) Asserts a material fact which is false, fictitious, or fraudulent; or</P>
            <P>(B) Omits a material fact and is false, fictitious, or fraudulent as a result of such omission, where the person making, presenting, or submitting such statement has a duty to include such material fact; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Contains or is accompanied by an express certification or affirmation of the truthfulness and accuracy of the contents of the statement.</P>
            <P>(2) Each written representation, certification, or affirmation constitutes a separate statement.</P>
            <P>(3) A statement shall be considered made to FHFA when the statement is actually made to an agent, fiscal intermediary, or other entity acting for or on behalf of FHFA.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Joint and several liability.</E> A civil penalty or assessment may be imposed jointly and severally if more than one person is determined to be liable.</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> Section 4(s) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 6s) and section 15F of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78o-10) require FHFA to establish capital and margin requirements for any regulated entity that is registered as a swap dealer, major swap participant, security-based swap dealer, or major security-based swap participant with respect to all non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps. This regulation implements section 4s of the Commodity Exchange Act and section 15F of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by defining terms used in the statute and related terms, establishing capital and margin requirements, and explaining the statute's requirements.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Scope.</E> This part establishes minimum capital and margin requirements for each covered swap entity subject to this part with respect to all non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps. This part applies to any non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap entered into by a covered swap entity on or after the related compliance date set forth in paragraph (e) of this section. Nothing in this part is intended to prevent a covered swap entity from collecting margin in amounts greater than are required under this part.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Exemptions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Swaps.</E> The requirements of this part (except for § 45.12) shall not apply to a non-cleared swap if the counterparty:</P>
            <P>(i) Qualifies for an exception from clearing under section 2(h)(7)(A) of the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (7 U.S.C. 2(h)(7)(A)) and implementing regulations;</P>
            <P>(ii) Qualifies for an exemption from clearing under a rule, regulation, or order that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission issued pursuant to its authority under section 4(c)(1) of the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (7 U.S.C. 6(c)(1)) concerning cooperative entities that would otherwise be subject to the requirements of section 2(h)(1)(A) of the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (7 U.S.C. 2(h)(1)(A)); or</P>
            <P>(iii) Satisfies the criteria in section 2(h)(7)(D) of the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (7 U.S.C. 2(h)(7)(D)) and implementing regulations.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Security-based swaps.</E> The requirements of this part (except for § 1221.12) shall not apply to a non-cleared security-based swap if the counterparty:</P>

            <P>(ii) Satisfies the criteria in section 3C(g)(4) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c-3(g)(4)) and implementing regulations.<PRTPAGE P="162"/>

            <P>(2) To the extent that one or more non-cleared swaps or non-cleared security-based swaps are executed pursuant to an eligible master netting agreement between a covered swap entity and its counterparty that is a swap entity or financial end user, a covered <PRTPAGE P="170"/>swap entity may calculate and comply with the applicable requirements of this part on an aggregate net basis with respect to all non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps governed by such agreement, subject to paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</P>

            <P>(ii) An eligible master netting agreement may identify one or more separate netting portfolios that independently meet the requirements in paragraph (1) of the definition of “Eligible master netting agreement” in § 1221.2 and to which collection and posting of margin applies on an aggregate net basis separate from and exclusive of any other non-cleared swaps or non-cleared security-based swaps covered by the eligible master netting agreement. Any such netting portfolio that contains any non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap entered into on or after the applicable compliance date set forth in § 1221.1(e) or (g) is subject to the requirements of this part. Any such netting portfolio that contains only non-cleared swaps or non-cleared security-based swaps entered into before the applicable compliance date is not subject to the requirements of this part.</P>
            <P>(4) If a covered swap entity cannot conclude after sufficient legal review with a well-founded basis that the netting agreement described in this section meets the definition of eligible master netting agreement set forth in § 1221.2, the covered swap entity must treat the non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security based swaps covered by the agreement on a gross basis for the purposes of calculating and complying with the requirements of this part to collect margin, but the covered swap entity may net those non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section for the purposes of calculating and complying with the requirements of this part to post margin.</P>

            <P>(1) The counterparty has refused or otherwise failed to provide or accept the required margin to or from the covered swap entity; and</P>
            <P>(2) The covered swap entity has:</P>
            <P>(i) Made the necessary efforts to collect or post the required margin, including the timely initiation and continued pursuit of formal dispute resolution mechanisms, or has otherwise demonstrated upon request to the satisfaction of FHFA that it has made appropriate efforts to collect or post the required margin; or</P>

            <SUBJECT>Initial margin models and standardized amounts.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Standardized amounts.</E> Unless a covered swap entity's initial margin model conforms to the requirements of this section, the covered swap entity shall calculate the amount of initial margin required to be collected or posted for one or more non-cleared swaps or non-cleared security-based swaps with a given counterparty pursuant to § 1221.3 on a daily basis pursuant to appendix A of this part.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Use of initial margin models.</E> A covered swap entity may calculate the amount of initial margin required to be collected or posted for one or more non-cleared swaps or non-cleared security-based swaps with a given counterparty pursuant to § 1221.3 on a daily basis using an initial margin model only if the initial margin model meets the requirements of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Requirements for initial margin model.</E> (1) A covered swap entity must obtain the prior written approval of FHFA before using any initial margin model to calculate the initial margin required in this part.</P>
            <P>(2) A covered swap entity must demonstrate that the initial margin model satisfies all of the requirements of this section on an ongoing basis.</P>
            <P>(3) A covered swap entity must notify FHFA in writing 60 days prior to:</P>
            <P>(i) Extending the use of an initial margin model that FHFA has approved under this section to an additional product type;</P>
            <P>(ii) Making any change to any initial margin model approved by FHFA under this section that would result in a material change in the covered swap entity's assessment of initial margin requirements; or</P>
            <P>(iii) Making any material change to modeling assumptions used by the initial margin model.</P>
            <P>(4) FHFA may rescind its approval of the use of any initial margin model, in whole or in part, or may impose additional conditions or requirements if FHFA determines, in its sole discretion, that the initial margin model no longer complies with this section.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Quantitative requirements.</E> (1) The covered swap entity's initial margin model must calculate an amount of initial margin that is equal to the potential future exposure of the non-cleared swap, non-cleared security-based swap or netting portfolio of non-cleared swaps or non-cleared security-based swaps covered by an eligible master netting agreement. Potential future exposure is an estimate of the one-tailed 99 percent confidence interval for an increase in the value of the non-cleared swap, non-cleared security-based swap or netting portfolio of non-cleared swaps or non-cleared security-based swaps due to an instantaneous price shock that is equivalent to a movement in all material underlying risk factors, including prices, rates, and spreads, over a holding period equal to the shorter of ten business days or the maturity of the non-cleared <PRTPAGE P="175"/>swap, non-cleared security-based swap or netting portfolio.</P>
            <P>(2) All data used to calibrate the initial margin model must be based on an equally weighted historical observation period of at least one year and not more than five years and must incorporate a period of significant financial stress for each broad asset class that is appropriate to the non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps to which the initial margin model is applied.</P>
            <P>(3) The covered swap entity's initial margin model must use risk factors sufficient to measure all material price risks inherent in the transactions for which initial margin is being calculated. The risk categories must include, but should not be limited to, foreign exchange or interest rate risk, credit risk, equity risk, and commodity risk, as appropriate. For material exposures in significant currencies and markets, modeling techniques must capture spread and basis risk and must incorporate a sufficient number of segments of the yield curve to capture differences in volatility and imperfect correlation of rates along the yield curve.</P>
            <P>(4) In the case of a non-cleared cross-currency swap, the covered swap entity's initial margin model need not recognize any risks or risk factors associated with the fixed, physically-settled foreign exchange transaction associated with the exchange of principal embedded in the non-cleared cross-currency swap. The initial margin model must recognize all material risks and risk factors associated with all other payments and cash flows that occur during the life of the non-cleared cross-currency swap.</P>
            <P>(5) The initial margin model may calculate initial margin for a non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap or a netting portfolio of non-cleared swaps or non-cleared security-based swaps covered by an eligible master netting agreement. It may reflect offsetting exposures, diversification, and other hedging benefits for non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps that are governed by the same eligible master netting agreement by incorporating empirical correlations within the following broad risk categories, provided the covered swap entity validates and demonstrates the reasonableness of its process for modeling and measuring hedging benefits: Commodity, credit, equity, and foreign exchange or interest rate. Empirical correlations under an eligible master netting agreement may be recognized by the initial margin model within each broad risk category, but not across broad risk categories.</P>
            <P>(6) If the initial margin model does not explicitly reflect offsetting exposures, diversification, and hedging benefits between subsets of non-cleared swaps or non-cleared security-based swaps within a broad risk category, the covered swap entity must calculate an amount of initial margin separately for each subset within which such relationships are explicitly recognized by the initial margin model. The sum of the initial margin amounts calculated for each subset of non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps within a broad risk category will be used to determine the aggregate initial margin due from the counterparty for the portfolio of non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps within the broad risk category.</P>
            <P>(7) The sum of the initial margin amounts calculated for each broad risk category will be used to determine the aggregate initial margin due from the counterparty.</P>
            <P>(8) The initial margin model may not permit the calculation of any initial margin collection amount to be offset by, or otherwise take into account, any initial margin that may be owed or otherwise payable by the covered swap entity to the counterparty.</P>

            <P>(9) The initial margin model must include all material risks arising from the nonlinear price characteristics of option positions or positions with embedded optionality and the sensitivity of the market value of the positions to changes in the volatility of the underlying rates, prices, or other material risk factors.<PRTPAGE P="176"/>
            </P>
            <P>(10) The covered swap entity may not omit any risk factor from the calculation of its initial margin that the covered swap entity uses in its initial margin model unless it has first demonstrated to the satisfaction of FHFA that such omission is appropriate.</P>
            <P>(11) The covered swap entity may not incorporate any proxy or approximation used to capture the risks of the covered swap entity's non-cleared swaps or non-cleared security-based swaps unless it has first demonstrated to the satisfaction of FHFA that such proxy or approximation is appropriate.</P>
            <P>(12) The covered swap entity must have a rigorous and well-defined process for re-estimating, re-evaluating, and updating its internal margin model to ensure continued applicability and relevance.</P>
            <P>(13) The covered swap entity must review and, as necessary, revise the data used to calibrate the initial margin model at least annually, and more frequently as market conditions warrant, to ensure that the data incorporate a period of significant financial stress appropriate to the non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps to which the initial margin model is applied.</P>
            <P>(14) The level of sophistication of the initial margin model must be commensurate with the complexity of the non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps to which it is applied. In calculating an initial margin collection amount, the initial margin model may make use of any of the generally accepted approaches for modeling the risk of a single instrument or portfolio of instruments.</P>
            <P>(15) FHFA may in its sole discretion require a covered swap entity using an initial margin model to collect a greater amount of initial margin than that determined by the covered swap entity's initial margin model if FHFA determines that the additional collateral is appropriate due to the nature, structure, or characteristics of the covered swap entity's transaction(s), or is commensurate with the risks associated with the transaction(s).</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Periodic review.</E> A covered swap entity must periodically, but no less frequently than annually, review its initial margin model in light of developments in financial markets and modeling technologies, and enhance the initial margin model as appropriate to ensure that the initial margin model continues to meet the requirements for approval in this section.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Control, oversight, and validation mechanisms.</E> (1) The covered swap entity must maintain a risk control unit that reports directly to senior management and is independent from the business trading units.</P>
            <P>(2) The covered swap entity's risk control unit must validate its initial margin model prior to implementation and on an ongoing basis. The covered swap entity's validation process must be independent of the development, implementation, and operation of the initial margin model, or the validation process must be subject to an independent review of its adequacy and effectiveness. The validation process must include:</P>
            <P>(i) An evaluation of the conceptual soundness of (including developmental evidence supporting) the initial margin model;</P>
            <P>(ii) An ongoing monitoring process that includes verification of processes and benchmarking by comparing the covered swap entity's initial margin model outputs (estimation of initial margin) with relevant alternative internal and external data sources or estimation techniques. The benchmark(s) must address the chosen model's limitations. When applicable, the covered swap entity should consider benchmarks that allow for non-normal distributions such as historical and Monte Carlo simulations. When applicable, validation shall include benchmarking against observable margin standards to ensure that the initial margin required is not less than what a derivatives clearing organization or a clearing agency would require for similar cleared transactions; and</P>
            <P>(iii) An outcomes analysis process that includes backtesting the initial margin model. This analysis must recognize and compensate for the challenges inherent in back-testing over periods that do not contain significant financial stress.</P>

            <P>(3) If the validation process reveals any material problems with the initial margin model, the covered swap entity <PRTPAGE P="177"/>must promptly notify FHFA of the problems, describe to FHFA any remedial actions being taken, and adjust the initial margin model to ensure an appropriately conservative amount of required initial margin is being calculated.</P>
            <P>(4) The covered swap entity must have an internal audit function independent of business-line management and the risk control unit that at least annually assesses the effectiveness of the controls supporting the covered swap entity's initial margin model measurement systems, including the activities of the business trading units and risk control unit, compliance with policies and procedures, and calculation of the covered swap entity's initial margin requirements under this part. At least annually, the internal audit function must report its findings to the covered swap entity's board of directors or a committee thereof.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Documentation.</E> The covered swap entity must adequately document all material aspects of its initial margin model, including the management and valuation of the non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps to which it applies, the control, oversight, and validation of the initial margin model, any review processes and the results of such processes.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Escalation procedures.</E> The covered swap entity must adequately document internal authorization procedures, including escalation procedures, that require review and approval of any change to the initial margin calculation under the initial margin model, demonstrable analysis that any basis for any such change is consistent with the requirements of this section, and independent review of such demonstrable analysis and approval.</P>

The net current replacement cost equals the total replacement cost for all non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps subject to the eligible master netting agreement.

The weights to be applied in the weighted average should be calculated as a fraction of the fund's total market value that is invested in each asset with a given discount amount. As an example, an eligible investment fund that is comprised solely of $100 of 91 day Treasury bills and $100 of 3 year US Treasury bonds would receive a discount of (100/200)*0.5+(100/200)*2.0=(0.5)*0.5+(0.5)*2.0=1.25 percent.</TNOTE>

Neither the Banks nor the Enterprises are subject to Section 129H of TILA or 12 CFR 1026.35. Originators of higher-priced mortgage loans, including Bank members and institutions that sell mortgage loans to the Enterprises, are subject to those provisions. A failure of those institutions to comply with Section 129H of TILA and 12 CFR 1026.35 may limit their ability to sell such loans to the Banks or Enterprises or to pledge such loans to the Banks as collateral, to the extent provided in the parties' agreements.</P>

            <P>FHFA is responsible for ensuring the safe and sound operation of regulated entities. In furtherance of that responsibility, this part sets forth standards and procedures FHFA will employ to determine whether to require or rescind a temporary increase in the minimum capital levels for a regulated entity or entities pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 4612(d).</P>

            <P>
              <E T="03">Minimum capital level</E> means the lowest amount of capital meeting any regulation or orders issued pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1426(a)(2) and 12 U.S.C. 4612, or any similar requirement established for a Federal Home Loan Bank by regulation, order or other action.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Rescission</E> means a removal in whole or in part of an increase in the temporary minimum capital level.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Information</E>—(1) <E T="03">Information to the regulated entity or entities.</E> If the Director determines, based on standards enunciated in this part, that a temporary increase in the minimum capital level is necessary, the Director will provide notice to the affected regulated entity or entities 30 days in advance of the date that the temporary minimum capital requirement becomes effective, unless the Director determines that an exigency exists that does not permit such notice or the Director determines a longer time period would be appropriate.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Information to the Government.</E> The Director shall inform the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission of a temporary increase in the minimum capital level contemporaneously with informing the affected regulated entity or entities.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Comments.</E> The affected regulated entity or entities may provide comments regarding or objections to the temporary increase to FHFA within 15 days or such other period as the Director determines appropriate under the circumstances. The Director may determine to modify, delay, or rescind the announced temporary increase in response to such comments or objection, but no further notice is required for the temporary increase to become effective upon the date originally determined by the Director.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Communication.</E> The Director shall transmit notice of a temporary increase or rescission of a temporary increase in the minimum capital level in writing, using electronic or such other means as appropriate. Such communication shall set forth, at a minimum, the bases for the Director's determination, the amount of increase or decrease in the minimum capital level, the anticipated duration of such increase, and a description of the procedures for requesting a rescission of the temporary increase in the minimum capital level.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Written plan.</E> In making a finding under this part, the Director may require a written plan to augment capital to be submitted on a timely basis to address the methods by which such temporary increase may be attained and the time period for reaching the new temporary minimum capital level.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Time frame for review of temporary increase for purpose of rescission.</E> (1) Absent an earlier determination to rescind in whole or in part a temporary increase in the minimum capital level for a regulated entity or entities, the Director shall no less than every 12 months, consider the need to maintain, modify, or rescind such increase.</P>
            <P>(2) A regulated entity or regulated entities may at any time request in writing such review by the Director.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Standards and factors.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Standard for imposing a temporary increase.</E> In making a determination to increase temporarily a minimum capital requirement for a regulated entity or entities, the Director will consider the necessity and consistency of such an increase with the prudential regulation and the safe and sound operations of a regulated entity. The Director may impose a temporary minimum-capital increase if consideration of one or more of the following factors leads <PRTPAGE P="196"/>the Director to the judgment that the current minimum capital requirement for a regulated entity is insufficient to address the entity's risks:</P>
            <P>(1) Current or anticipated declines in the value of assets held by a regulated entity; the amounts of mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by the regulated entity; and, its ability to access liquidity and funding;</P>
            <P>(2) Credit (including counterparty), market, operational and other risks facing a regulated entity, especially where an increase in risks is foreseeable and consequential;</P>
            <P>(3) Current or projected declines in the capital held by a regulated entity;</P>
            <P>(4) A regulated entity's material non-compliance with regulations, written orders, or agreements;</P>
            <P>(5) Housing finance market conditions;</P>
            <P>(6) Level of reserves or retained earnings;</P>
            <P>(7) Initiatives, operations, products, or practices that entail heightened risk;</P>
            <P>(8) With respect to a Bank, the ratio of the market value of its equity to par value of its capital stock where the market value of equity is the value calculated and reported by the Bank as “market value of total capital” under 12 CFR 932.5(a)(1)(ii)(A); or</P>
            <P>(9) Other conditions as detailed by the Director in the notice provided under § 1225.3.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Standard for rescission of a temporary increase.</E> In making a determination to rescind a temporary increase in the minimum capital level for a regulated entity or entities, whether in full or in part, the Director will consider the consistency of such a rescission with the prudential regulation and safe and sound operations of a regulated entity. The Director will rescind, in full or in part, a temporary minimum capital increase if consideration of one or more of the following factors leads the Director to the judgment that rescission of a temporary minimum-capital increase for a regulated entity is appropriate considering the entity's risks:</P>
            <P>(1) Changes to the circumstances or facts that led to the imposition of a temporary increase in the minimum capital levels;</P>
            <P>(2) The meeting of targets set for a regulated entity in advance of any capital or capital-related plan agreed to by the Director;</P>
            <P>(3) Changed circumstances or facts based on new developments occurring since the imposition of the temporary increase in the minimum capital level, particularly where the original problems or concerns have been successfully addressed or alleviated in whole or in part; or</P>
            <P>(4) Such other standard as the Director may consider as detailed by the Director in the notice provided under § 1225.3.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>

              <P>This part sets forth the procedures FHFA follows under its Suspended Counterparty Program, the purpose of which is to protect the safety and soundness of the regulated entities. The procedures require the regulated entities to submit reports when they become aware that a person with whom <PRTPAGE P="197"/>they have engaged or are engaging in a covered transaction within the past three (3) years has engaged in covered misconduct. The procedures set forth a process for FHFA to issue suspension orders directing the regulated entities to cease or refrain from engaging in covered transactions with such persons and any affiliates thereof for a specified period of time or permanently. A suspension order is not intended to be, and may not be issued as, a form of punishment for the suspended person. The procedures include options for:</P>
              <P>(a) Appeal of a final suspension order to the Director;</P>
              <P>(b) Request for reconsideration of a final suspension order after twelve (12) months have elapsed; and</P>
              <P>(c) Request for an exception to a final suspension order in effect in order to engage in a particular covered transaction with the suspended person.</P>

                <E T="03">Administrative sanction</E> means debarment or suspension imposed by any Federal agency, or any similar administrative action that has the effect of limiting the ability of a person to do business with a Federal agency, including Limited Denials of Participation, Temporary Denials of Participation, or settlements of proposed administrative sanctions if the terms of the settlement restrict the person's ability to do business with the Federal agency in question.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Affiliate</E> means a party that either controls or is controlled by another person, whether directly or indirectly, including one or more persons that are controlled by the same third person.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Conviction</E> means:</P>
              <P>(1) A judgment or any other determination of guilt of a criminal offense by any court of competent jurisdiction, whether entered upon a verdict or plea; or</P>
              <P>(2) Any other resolution that is the functional equivalent of a judgment of guilt of a criminal offense, including probation before judgment and deferred prosecution. A disposition without the participation of the court is the functional equivalent of a judgment only if it includes an admission of guilt.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Covered misconduct</E> means:</P>
              <P>(1) Any conviction or administrative sanction within the past three (3) years if the basis of such action involved fraud, embezzlement, theft, conversion, forgery, bribery, perjury, making false statements or claims, tax evasion, obstruction of justice, or any similar offense, in each case in connection with a mortgage, mortgage business, mortgage securities or other lending product.</P>
              <P>(2) FHFA may impute covered misconduct among affiliates as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Conduct imputed from an individual to an organization.</E> FHFA may impute the covered misconduct of any officer, director, shareholder, partner, employee, or other individual associated with an organization, to that organization when the conduct occurred in connection with the individual's performance of duties for or on behalf of that organization, or with the organization's knowledge, approval, or acquiescence. The organization's acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct is evidence of knowledge, approval, or acquiescence.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Conduct imputed from an organization to an individual, or between individuals.</E> FHFA may impute the covered misconduct of any organization to an individual, or from one individual to another individual, if the individual to whom the conduct is imputed either participated in, had knowledge of, or had reason to know of the conduct.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Conduct imputed from one organization to another organization.</E> FHFA may impute the covered misconduct of one organization to another organization when the conduct occurred in connection with a partnership, joint venture, joint application, association, or similar arrangement, or when the organization to whom the conduct is imputed has the power to direct, manage, control, or influence the activities of the organization responsible for the conduct. Acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct is evidence of knowledge, approval, or acquiescence and hence is a basis for imputation of conduct.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Covered transaction</E> means a contract, agreement, or financial or business relationship between a regulated entity and a person and any affiliates thereof.<PRTPAGE P="198"/>

                <E T="03">Suspension</E> means an action taken by a suspending official pursuant to a final suspension order that requires a regulated entity to cease or refrain from engaging in any covered transactions with a person and any affiliates thereof for a specified period of time or permanently.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">No effect on other actions by FHFA.</E> Nothing in this part shall limit the authority of FHFA to pursue any other regulatory or supervisory action with respect to any regulated entity or any other person and any affiliates thereof, whether instead of or in addition to any action taken under this part.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Restriction.</E> An adequately capitalized Bank may not make a capital distribution if after doing so the Bank's capital would be insufficient to maintain a classification of adequately capitalized. A Bank may not make a capital distribution if such distribution would violate any restriction on the redemption or repurchase of capital stock or the payment of a dividend set forth in section 6 of the Bank Act (12 U.S.C. 1426) and any other applicable regulation.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Exception.</E> Notwithstanding the restriction in paragraph (a) of this section, the Director may permit a Bank to repurchase or redeem its shares of stock if the transaction is made in connection with the issuance of additional Bank shares or obligations in at least an equivalent amount to the shares that are redeemed or repurchased and will reduce the Bank's financial obligations or otherwise improve its financial condition. Any transaction under this paragraph also must conform with any restriction on the redemption or repurchase of Bank stock set forth in section 6 of the Bank Act (12 U.S.C. 1426) and in any other applicable regulation.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Actions applicable to critically undercapitalized Banks.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Appointment of conservator or receiver.</E> Notwithstanding any other provision of federal or state law, the Director may appoint the FHFA as conservator or receiver of any Bank at any time after the Director determines that the Bank is, or the Director otherwise exercises authority to reclassify the Bank as, critically undercapitalized.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Periodic determination</E>—(1) <E T="03">Determination.</E> Not later than 30 calendar days after the Director first determines that a Bank is, or the Director otherwise exercises authority to reclassify the Bank as, critically undercapitalized, and a least once during each succeeding 30-day calendar period, the Director make a determination in writing as to whether:</P>
              <P>(i) The assets of the Bank are, and during the preceding 60 calendar days have been, less than its obligations to its creditors and others, provided that the Director shall consider as an obligation only that amount of outstanding consolidated obligations for which the Bank is primary obligor or for which the Bank has been ordered to make payments of principal or interest on behalf of another Bank, or is actually making payments of principal or interest on behalf of another Bank; or</P>

              <P>(ii) The Bank is not, and during the previous 60 calendar days has not been paying its debts on a regular basis as such debts become due, provided that this provision does not apply to any unpaid debts that are the subject of a <E T="03">bona fide</E> dispute.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Mandatory receivership.</E> If the Director determines that the conditions described in either paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii) of this section applies to a Bank, the Director shall appoint the FHFA as receiver for the Bank. The appointment of the FHFA as receiver under this paragraph shall immediately terminate any conservatorship established for the Bank.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Determination not required.</E> A determination under paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall not be required during any period in which the FHFA serves as receiver for a Bank.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Judicial review.</E> If the Director appoints the FHFA as conservator or receiver of a Bank under paragraph (a) or (b)(2) of this section, the Bank may within 30 days of such appointment bring an action in the United States district court for the judicial district in which the Bank was established pursuant to section 3 of the Bank Act (12 U.S.C. 1423) or in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, for an order requiring the FHFA to remove itself as conservator or receiver.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Other applicable actions.</E> Until such time as FHFA is appointed as conservator or receiver for a critically undercapitalized Bank, a critically undercapitalized Bank shall be subject to all mandatory restrictions or obligations applicable to a significantly undercapitalized Bank under § 1229.8 of this subpart and will remain subject to any on-going restrictions or obligations that the Director imposed on the Bank under § 1229.7 or § 1229.9 of this subpart, or any restrictions or obligations that are applicable to the Bank under the terms of an approved capital restoration plan.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Capital restoration plans.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Contents.</E> Each capital restoration plan submitted by a Bank shall set forth a plan to restore its permanent and total capital to levels sufficient to fulfill its risk-based and minimum capital requirements within a reasonable period of time. Such plan must be feasible given general market conditions and the conditions of the Bank and, at a minimum, shall:</P>

              <P>(1) Describe the actions the Bank will take, including any changes that the <PRTPAGE P="211"/>Bank will make to member stock purchase requirements, to assure that it will become adequately capitalized within the meaning of § 1229.3(a) of this subpart and, if appropriate, to resolve any structural or long term causes for the capital deficiency;</P>
              <P>(2) Specify the level of permanent and total capital the Bank will achieve and maintain and provide quarterly projections indicating how each component of total and permanent capital and the major components of income, assets and liabilities are expected to change over the term of the plan;</P>
              <P>(3) Specify the types and levels of activities in which the Bank will engage during the term of the plan, including any new business activities that it intends to begin during such term;</P>
              <P>(4) Describe any other actions the Bank intends to take to comply with any other requirements imposed on it under this subpart A of part 1229;</P>
              <P>(5) Provide a schedule which sets forth dates for meeting specific goals and benchmarks and taking other actions described in the proposed capital restoration plan, including setting forth a schedule for it to restore its permanent and total capital to levels necessary for meeting its risk-based and minimum capital requirements; and</P>
              <P>(6) Address such other items that the Director shall provide in writing in advance of such submission.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Deadline for submission.</E> A Bank must submit a proposed capital restoration plan no later than 15 business-days after it receives written notification that such a plan is required either because the notice specifically states that the Director has required the submission of a plan or the notice indicates that the Bank's capital classification or reclassification is to a category for which a capital restoration plan is a mandatory action required of the Bank. The Director may extend this deadline if the Director determines that such extension is necessary. Any such extension shall be in writing and provide a specific date by which the Bank must submit its proposed capital restoration plan.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Review of the plan by the Director.</E> The Director shall have 30 calendar days from the date the Bank submits a proposed capital restoration plan to approve or disapprove the plan. The Director may extend the period for consideration of a capital restoration plan for a single 30 calendar day period by providing the Bank with written notification that the decision deadline has been extended. The Director shall provide the Bank with written notification of the decision to approve or not approve a proposed capital restoration plan. If the Director does not approve the capital restoration plan, the written notification of such decision shall provide the reasons for the disapproval.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Resubmission.</E> If the Director does not approve the Bank's proposed capital restoration plan, the Bank shall submit a new capital restoration plan acceptable to the Director within 30 calendar days of the date that the Bank was notified of the disapproval. The Director may extend the period for the Bank's submission of a new acceptable capital restoration plan upon a determination that such extension is in the public interest. The Director shall provide the Bank written notice of the extension and include in such notice the date by which the Bank must submit an acceptable plan.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Amendments.</E> The Director, in his or her sole discretion, may approve amendments to an approved capital restoration plan if, after consideration of changes in conditions of the Bank, changes in market conditions and other relevant factors, the Director determines that such amendments are consistent with the restoration of the Bank's capital to levels necessary to meet its risk-based and minimum capital requirements in a reasonable period of time and with the safe and sound operations of the Bank.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Effectiveness of provisions.</E> A Bank is obligated to implement and fulfill all provisions of an approved capital restoration plan. Unless expressly addressed by the terms of the capital restoration plan, a Bank remains bound by each and every obligation and requirement set forth in the approved capital restoration plan until such requirement or obligation is amended under paragraph (e) of this section or terminated in writing by the Director.<PRTPAGE P="212"/>
              </P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Appointment of conservator or receiver.</E> Notwithstanding any other provision of federal or state law, the Director may appoint the FHFA as conservator or receiver of any Bank that is classified as undercapitalized or significantly undercapitalized if the Bank fails to submit a capital restoration plan acceptable to the Director within the time frames established by this section or if the Bank materially fails to implement any capital restoration plan that has been approved by the Director. A Bank may within 30 days of such appointment bring an action in the United States district court for the judicial district in which the Bank is established pursuant to section 3 of the Bank Act (12 U.S.C. 1423) or in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, for an order requiring the FHFA to remove itself as conservator or receiver.</P>

            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 1229.12</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Procedures related to capital classification and other actions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Classification or reclassification of a Bank.</E> Before finalizing any decision to classify a Bank under § 1229.2(a) of this subpart or reclassify the Bank under § 1229.4(a) of this subpart, the Director shall provide the Bank with written notification of the proposed action that states the reasons for the proposed action and describes the information on which the proposed action is based. The notice required under this paragraph may be combined with the notice of a proposed supervisory action required under paragraph (b) of this section. The Director also may combine a notice informing the Bank of its capital classification and simultaneously informing the Bank that the Director intends to reclassify a Bank to a lower capital classification category.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Notice of a supervisory action.</E> Before finalizing any action or actions authorized under § 1229.7 or § 1229.9 of this subpart, the Director shall provide the Bank with written notification of the proposed action that states the reasons for the proposed action and describes the information on which the proposed action is based. The notice required under this paragraph may be combined with the notice of a proposed action to classify or reclassify the Bank required under paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Bank response.</E> During the 30 calendar day period beginning on the date that the Bank is provided notice under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section of a proposed action or actions, a Bank may submit to the Director any information that the Bank considers relevant or appropriate for the Director to consider in determining whether to finalize the proposed action. The Director may, in his or her sole discretion, convene an informal hearing with representatives of the Bank to receive or discuss any such information. The Director, in his or her sole discretion, also may extend the period in which the Bank may respond to a notice for an additional 30 calendar days for good cause, or shorten such comment period if the Director determines the condition of the Bank requires faster action or a shorter comment period or if the Bank consents to a shorter comment period. The Director shall inform the Bank in writing, which may be provided as part of the notice required under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section, of any decision to extend or shorten the comment period. The failure of a Bank to provide information during the allotted comment period will waive any right of the Bank to comment on the proposed action.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Final action.</E> At the earlier of the completion of the comment period established under paragraph (c) or the receipt of information provided by the Bank during such period, the Director shall determine whether to take the proposed action or actions that were the subject of the notice under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section, after taking into consideration any information provided by the Bank. Such notice shall respond to any information submitted by the Bank. Any final order that the Bank take action, refrain from action or comply with any other requirement that was the subject of a notice under paragraph (b) of this section shall take effect upon the Bank's receipt of the notice required under this paragraph, unless a different effective date is set forth in this notice, and shall remain in effect and binding on the Bank until terminated in writing by the Director or until any terms and <PRTPAGE P="213"/>conditions for termination, as set forth in the notice, have been met.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Final actions under this section.</E> Any final decision that the Bank take action, refrain from action or comply with any other requirement that was the subject of a notice under paragraph (b) of this section shall constitute an order under the Safety and Soundness Act. The Director in his or her discretion may apply to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or to the United States district court for the judicial district in which the Bank in question is established pursuant to section 3 of the Bank Act (12 U.S.C. 1423) for the enforcement of such order, as allowed under § 1375 of the Safety and Soundness Act (12 U.S.C. 4635) . In addition, a Bank or any executive officer or director of a Bank can be subject to enforcement action, including the imposition of civil monetary penalties, under § 1371, § 1372 or § 1376 of the Safety and Soundness Act (12 U.S.C. 4631, 4632, or 4636) for failure to comply with such an order.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Judicial review.</E> A Bank that is not classified as critically undercapitalized may obtain judicial review of any final capital classification decision or of any final decision to take supervisory action made by the Director under § 1229.2, § 1229.4, § 1229.7 or § 1229.9 in accordance with the requirements and procedures set forth in § 1369D of the Safety and Soundness Act (12 U.S.C. 4623).</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Covered agreements or contracts.</E> An agreement or contract that provides for termination payments to an executive officer of an Enterprise that was entered into before October 28, 1992,<SU>1</SU>

              <FTREF/> is not retroactively subject to approval or disapproval by the Director. However, any renegotiation, amendment, or change to such an agreement or contract shall be considered as entering <PRTPAGE P="216"/>into an agreement or contract that is subject to approval by the Director.</P>
            <FTNT>
              <P>
                <SU>1</SU> This date refers to the date of enactment of the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992. </P>
            </FTNT>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Factors to be taken into account.</E> In making the determination whether to approve or disapprove termination benefits, the Director may consider:</P>
            <P>(1) Whether the benefits provided under the agreement or contract are comparable to benefits provided under such agreements or contracts for officers of other public or private entities involved in financial services and housing interests who have comparable duties and responsibilities;</P>
            <P>(2) The factors set forth in § 1230.3(b); and</P>
            <P>(3) Such other information as deemed appropriate by the Director.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Exception to prior approval.</E> An employment agreement or contract subject to prior approval of the Director under this section may be entered into prior to that approval, provided that such agreement or contract specifically provides notice that termination benefits under the agreement or contract shall not be effective and no payments shall be made under such agreement or contract unless and until approved by the Director. Such notice should make clear that alteration of benefit plans subsequent to FHFA approval under this section, which affect final termination benefits of an executive officer, requires review at the time of the individual's termination from the Enterprise and prior to the payment of any benefits.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Effect of prior approval of an agreement or contract.</E> The Director's approval of an executive officer's termination of employment benefits shall not preclude the Director from making any subsequent determination under this section to prohibit and withhold executive compensation.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Form of approval.</E> The Director's approval pursuant to this section may occur in such form and manner as the Director shall provide through written notice to the regulated entities or the Office of Finance.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 1234.5</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Revolving pool securitizations.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Revolving pool securitization</E> means an issuing entity that is established to issue on multiple issuance dates more than one series, class, subclass, or tranche of asset-backed securities that are collateralized by a common pool of securitized assets that will change in composition over time, and that does not monetize excess interest and fees from its securitized assets.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Seller's interest</E> means an ABS interest or ABS interests:</P>
              <P>(1) Collateralized by the securitized assets and servicing assets owned or held by the issuing entity, other than the following that are not considered a component of seller's interest:</P>
              <P>(i) Servicing assets that have been allocated as collateral only for a specific series in connection with administering the revolving pool securitization, such as a principal accumulation or interest reserve account; and</P>

              <P>(ii) Assets that are not eligible under the terms of the securitization transaction to be included when determining whether the revolving pool securitization holds aggregate securitized assets in specified proportions to aggregate outstanding investor ABS interests issued; and<PRTPAGE P="235"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) That is <E T="03">pari passu</E> with each series of investor ABS interests issued, or partially or fully subordinated to one or more series in identical or varying amounts, with respect to the allocation of all distributions and losses with respect to the securitized assets prior to early amortization of the revolving securitization (as specified in the securitization transaction documents); and</P>
              <P>(3) That adjusts for fluctuations in the outstanding principal balance of the securitized assets in the pool.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">General requirement.</E> A sponsor satisfies the risk retention requirements of § 1234.3 with respect to a securitization transaction for which the issuing entity is a revolving pool securitization if the sponsor maintains a seller's interest of not less than 5 percent of the aggregate unpaid principal balance of all outstanding investor ABS interests in the issuing entity.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Measuring the seller's interest.</E> In measuring the seller's interest for purposes of meeting the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section:</P>
              <P>(1) The unpaid principal balance of the securitized assets for the numerator of the 5 percent ratio shall not include assets of the types excluded from the definition of seller's interest in paragraph (a) of this section;</P>
              <P>(2) The aggregate unpaid principal balance of outstanding investor ABS interests in the denominator of the 5 percent ratio may be reduced by the amount of funds held in a segregated principal accumulation account for the repayment of outstanding investor ABS interests, if:</P>
              <P>(i) The terms of the securitization transaction documents prevent funds in the principal accumulation account from being applied for any purpose other than the repayment of the unpaid principal of outstanding investor ABS interests; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Funds in that account are invested only in the types of assets in which funds held in an eligible horizontal cash reserve account pursuant to § 1234.4 are permitted to be invested;</P>
              <P>(3) If the terms of the securitization transaction documents set minimum required seller's interest as a proportion of the unpaid principal balance of outstanding investor ABS interests for one or more series issued, rather than as a proportion of the aggregate outstanding investor ABS interests in all outstanding series combined, the percentage of the seller's interest for each such series must, when combined with the percentage of any minimum seller's interest set by reference to the aggregate outstanding investor ABS interests, equal at least 5 percent;</P>
              <P>(4) The 5 percent test must be determined and satisfied at the closing of each issuance of ABS interests to investors by the issuing entity, and</P>
              <P>(i) At least monthly at a seller's interest measurement date specified under the securitization transaction documents, until no ABS interest in the issuing entity is held by any person not a wholly-owned affiliate of the sponsor; or</P>
              <P>(ii) If the revolving pool securitization fails to meet the 5 percent test as of any date described in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, and the securitization transaction documents specify a cure period, the 5 percent test must be determined and satisfied within the earlier of the cure period, or one month after the date described in paragraph (c)(4)(i).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Measuring outstanding investor ABS interests.</E> In measuring the amount of outstanding investor ABS interests for purposes of this section, ABS interests held for the life of such ABS interests by the sponsor or its wholly-owned affiliates may be excluded.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Holding and retention of the seller's interest; legacy trusts.</E> (1) Notwithstanding § 1234.12(a), the seller's interest, and any offsetting horizontal retention interest retained pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section, must be retained by the sponsor or by one or more wholly-owned affiliates of the sponsor, including one or more depositors of the revolving pool securitization.</P>

              <P>(2) If one revolving pool securitization issues collateral certificates representing a beneficial interest in all or a portion of the securitized assets held by that securitization to another revolving pool securitization, which in turn issues ABS interests for which the collateral certificates are all or a portion of the securitized assets, a sponsor may satisfy the requirements <PRTPAGE P="236"/>of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section by retaining the seller's interest for the assets represented by the collateral certificates through either of the revolving pool securitizations, so long as both revolving pool securitizations are retained at the direction of the same sponsor or its wholly-owned affiliates.</P>
              <P>(3) If the sponsor retains the seller's interest associated with the collateral certificates at the level of the revolving pool securitization that issues those collateral certificates, the proportion of the seller's interest required by paragraph (b) of this section retained at that level must equal the proportion that the principal balance of the securitized assets represented by the collateral certificates bears to the principal balance of the securitized assets in the revolving pool securitization that issues the ABS interests, as of each measurement date required by paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Offset for pool-level excess funding account.</E> The 5 percent seller's interest required on each measurement date by paragraph (c) of this section may be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the balance, as of such date, of an excess funding account in the form of a segregated account that:</P>
              <P>(1) Is funded in the event of a failure to meet the minimum seller's interest requirements or other requirement to maintain a minimum balance of securitized assets under the securitization transaction documents by distributions otherwise payable to the holder of the seller's interest;</P>
              <P>(2) Is invested only in the types of assets in which funds held in a horizontal cash reserve account pursuant to § 1234.4 are permitted to be invested; and</P>
              <P>(3) In the event of an early amortization, makes payments of amounts held in the account to holders of investor ABS interests in the same manner as payments to holders of investor ABS interests of amounts received on securitized assets.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Combined seller's interests and horizontal interest retention.</E> The 5 percent seller's interest required on each measurement date by paragraph (c) of this section may be reduced to a percentage lower than 5 percent to the extent that, for all series of investor ABS interests issued after the applicable effective date of this § 1234.5, the sponsor, or notwithstanding § 1234.12(a) a wholly-owned affiliate of the sponsor, retains, at a minimum, a corresponding percentage of the fair value of ABS interests issued in each series, in the form of one or more of the horizontal residual interests meeting the requirements of paragraphs (h) or (i).</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Residual ABS interests in excess interest and fees.</E> The sponsor may take the offset described in paragraph (g) of this section for a residual ABS interest in excess interest and fees, whether certificated or uncertificated, in a single or multiple classes, subclasses, or tranches, that meets, individually or in the aggregate, the requirements of this paragraph (h);</P>
              <P>(1) Each series of the revolving pool securitization distinguishes between the series' share of the interest and fee cash flows and the series' share of the principal repayment cash flows from the securitized assets collateralizing the revolving pool securitization, which may according to the terms of the securitization transaction documents, include not only the series' ratable share of such cash flows but also excess cash flows available from other series;</P>
              <P>(2) The residual ABS interest's claim to any part of the series' share of the interest and fee cash flows for any interest payment period is subordinated to all accrued and payable interest due on the payment date to more senior ABS interests in the series for that period, and further reduced by the series' share of losses, including defaults on principal of the securitized assets collateralizing the revolving pool securitization (whether incurred in that period or carried over from prior periods) to the extent that such payments would have been included in amounts payable to more senior interests in the series;</P>

              <P>(3) The revolving pool securitization continues to revolve, with one or more series, classes, subclasses, or tranches of asset-backed securities that are collateralized by a common pool of assets that change in composition over time; and<PRTPAGE P="237"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) For purposes of taking the offset described in paragraph (g) of this section, the sponsor determines the fair value of the residual ABS interest in excess interest and fees, and the fair value of the series of outstanding investor ABS interests to which it is subordinated and supports using the fair value measurement framework under GAAP, as of:</P>
              <P>(i) The closing of the securitization transaction issuing the supported ABS interests; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The seller's interest measurement dates described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, except that for these periodic determinations the sponsor must update the fair value of the residual ABS interest in excess interest and fees for the numerator of the percentage ratio, but may at the sponsor's option continue to use the fair values determined in (h)(4)(i) for the outstanding investor ABS interests in the denominator.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Offsetting eligible horizontal residual interest.</E> The sponsor may take the offset described in paragraph (g) of this section for ABS interests that would meet the definition of eligible horizontal residual interests in § 1234.2 but for the sponsor's simultaneous holding of subordinated seller's interests, residual ABS interests in excess interests and fees, or a combination of the two, if:</P>
              <P>(1) The sponsor complies with all requirements of paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section for its holdings of subordinated seller's interest, and paragraph (h) for its holdings of residual ABS interests in excess interests and fees, as applicable;</P>
              <P>(2) For purposes of taking the offset described in paragraph (g) of this section, the sponsor determines the fair value of the eligible horizontal residual interest as a percentage of the fair value of the outstanding investor ABS interests in the series supported by the eligible horizontal residual interest, determined using the fair value measurement framework under GAAP:</P>
              <P>(i) As of the closing of the securitization transaction issuing the supported ABS interests; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Without including in the numerator of the percentage ratio any fair value based on:</P>
              <P>(A) The subordinated seller's interest or residual ABS interest in excess interest and fees;</P>
              <P>(B) the interest payable to the sponsor on the eligible horizontal residual interest, if the sponsor is including the value of residual ABS interest in excess interest and fees pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section in taking the offset in paragraph (g) of this section; and,</P>
              <P>(C) the principal payable to the sponsor on the eligible horizontal residual interest, if the sponsor is including the value of the seller's interest pursuant to paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section and distributions on that seller's interest are available to reduce charge-offs that would otherwise be allocated to reduce principal payable to the offset eligible horizontal residual interest.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Specified dates.</E> A sponsor using data about the revolving pool securitization's collateral, or ABS interests previously issued, to determine the closing-date percentage of a seller's interest, residual ABS interest in excess interest and fees, or eligible horizontal residual interest pursuant to this § 1234.5 may use such data prepared as of specified dates if:</P>
              <P>(1) The sponsor describes the specified dates in the disclosures required by paragraph (k) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(2) The dates are no more than 60 days prior to the date of first use with investors of disclosures required for the interest by paragraph (k) of this section, or for revolving pool securitizations that make distributions to investors on a quarterly or less frequent basis, no more than 135 days prior to the date of first use with investors of such disclosures.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Disclosure and record maintenance.</E> (1) <E T="03">Disclosure.</E> A sponsor relying on this section shall provide, or cause to be provided, to potential investors, under the caption “Credit Risk Retention” the following disclosure in written form and within the time frames set forth in this paragraph (k):</P>

              <P>(i) A reasonable period of time prior to the sale of an asset-backed security, a description of the material terms of the seller's interest, and the percentage of the seller's interest that the sponsor expects to retain at the closing <PRTPAGE P="238"/>of the securitization transaction, measured in accordance with the requirements of this § 1234.5, as a percentage of the aggregate unpaid principal balance of all outstanding investor ABS interests issued, or as a percentage of the aggregate unpaid principal balance of outstanding investor ABS interests for one or more series issued, as required by the terms of the securitization transaction;</P>
              <P>(ii) A reasonable time after the closing of the securitization transaction, the amount of seller's interest the sponsor retained at closing, if that amount is materially different from the amount disclosed under paragraph (k)(1)(i) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(iii) A description of the material terms of any horizontal residual interests offsetting the seller's interest in accordance with paragraphs (g), (h), and (i) of this section; and</P>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Adjusted data.</E> Disclosures required by this paragraph (k) to be made a reasonable period of time prior to the sale of an asset-backed security of the amount of seller's interest, residual ABS interest in excess interest and fees, or eligible horizontal residual interest may include adjustments to the amount of securitized assets for additions or removals the sponsor expects to make before the closing date and adjustments to the amount of outstanding investor ABS interests for expected increases and decreases of those interests under the control of the sponsor.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Record maintenance.</E> A sponsor must retain the disclosures required in paragraph (k)(1) of this section in its records and must provide the disclosure upon request to the Commission and its appropriate Federal banking agency, if any, until three years after all ABS interests are no longer outstanding.</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Early amortization of all outstanding series.</E> A sponsor that organizes a revolving pool securitization that relies on this § 1234.5 to satisfy the risk retention requirements of § 1234.3, does not violate the requirements of this part if its seller's interest falls below the level required by § 1234. 5 after the revolving pool securitization commences early amortization, pursuant to the terms of the securitization transaction documents, of all series of outstanding investor ABS interests, if:</P>
              <P>(1) The sponsor was in full compliance with the requirements of this section on all measurement dates specified in paragraph (c) of this section prior to the commencement of early amortization;</P>

              <P>(2) The terms of the seller's interest continue to make it <E T="03">pari passu</E> with or subordinate in identical or varying amounts to each series of outstanding investor ABS interests issued with respect to the allocation of all distributions and losses with respect to the securitized assets;</P>
              <P>(3) The terms of any horizontal interest relied upon by the sponsor pursuant to paragraph (g) to offset the minimum seller's interest amount continue to require the interests to absorb losses in accordance with the terms of paragraph (h) or (i) of this section, as applicable; and</P>
              <P>(4) The revolving pool securitization issues no additional ABS interests after early amortization is initiated to any person not a wholly-owned affiliate of the sponsor, either at the time of issuance or during the amortization period.</P>

              <P>Claimants seeking a review of the determination of claims may seek alternative dispute resolution from the Agency as receiver in lieu of a judicial determination.

              <SUBJECT>Priority of expenses and unsecured claims.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The receiver will grant priority to unsecured claims against a regulated entity or the receiver for that regulated entity that are proven <PRTPAGE P="280"/>to the satisfaction of the receiver in the following order:</P>
              <P>(1) Administrative expenses of the receiver (or an immediately preceding conservator).</P>
              <P>(2) Any other general or senior liability of the regulated entity (that is not a liability described under paragraph (a)(3) or (a)(4) of this section).</P>
              <P>(3) Any obligation subordinated to general creditors (that is not an obligation described under paragraph (a)(4) of this section).</P>

              <P>(4) Any claim by current or former shareholders or members arising as a result of their current or former status as shareholders or members, including, without limitation, any securities litigation claim. Within this priority level, the receiver shall recognize the priorities of shareholder claims <E T="03">inter se,</E> such as that preferred shareholder claims are prior to common shareholder claims. This subparagraph (a)(4) shall not apply to any claim by a current or former member of a Federal Home Loan Bank that arises from transactions or relationships distinct from the current or former member's ownership, purchase, sale, or retention of an equity security of the Federal Home Loan Bank.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Similarly situated creditors.</E> All claimants that are similarly situated shall be treated in a similar manner, except that the receiver may take any action (including making payments) that does not comply with this section, if:</P>
              <P>(1) The Director determines that such action is necessary to maximize the value of the assets of the regulated entity, to maximize the present value return from the sale or other disposition of the assets of the regulated entity, or to minimize the amount of any loss realized upon the sale or other disposition of the assets of the regulated entity; and</P>
              <P>(2) All claimants that are similarly situated under paragraph (a) of this section receive not less than the amount such claimants would have received if the receiver liquidated the assets and liabilities of the regulated entity in receivership and such action had not been taken.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Priority determined at default.</E> The receiver will determine priority based on a claim's status at the time of default, such default having occurred at the time of entry into the receivership, or if a conservatorship immediately preceded the receivership, at the time of entry into the conservatorship provided the claim then existed.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Authority and purpose.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Authority.</E> This part is issued by the FHFA under section 165(i) of Title I of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) (Pub. L. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376, 1423-32 (2010), 12 U.S.C. 5365(i)), the Safety and Soundness Act, as amended (12 U.S.C. 4513, 4526, 4612), and the Bank Act (12 U.S.C. 1426).</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> (1) This part implements section 165(i)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Act, which requires all large financial companies that have total consolidated assets of more than $10 billion, and are regulated by a primary federal financial regulatory agency, to conduct annual stress tests. To ensure the safety and soundness of the regulated entities, the Director reserves and retains the discretion to apply this part to any regulated entity with less than $10 billion total consolidated assets in a particular year.</P>
            <P>(2) This part establishes requirements that apply to each regulated entity's performance of annual stress tests. The purpose of the annual stress test is to provide the regulated entities, FHFA, and the FRB with additional, forward-looking information that will help them to assess capital adequacy at the regulated entities under various scenarios; to review the regulated entities' stress test results; and to increase public disclosure of the regulated entities' capital condition by requiring broad dissemination of the stress test scenarios and results.</P>

            <P>
              <E T="03">Planning horizon</E> means the period of time over which the stress projections must extend. The planning horizon cannot be less than nine quarters.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Scenarios</E> are sets of economic and financial conditions used in the regulated entities' stress tests, including baseline, adverse, and severely adverse.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Stress test</E> is a process to assess the potential impact on a regulated entity of economic and financial conditions (“scenarios”) on the consolidated earnings, losses, and capital of the regulated entity over a set planning horizon, taking into account the current condition of the regulated entity and the regulated entity's risks, exposures, strategies, and activities.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Each regulated entity:</P>
            <P>(1) Shall complete an annual stress test of itself based on its data as of December 31 of the preceding calendar year;</P>
            <P>(2) The stress test shall be conducted in accordance with this section and the methodologies and practices described in § 1238.4 and in any supplemental guidance or Order.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Scenarios provided by FHFA.</E> In conducting its annual stress tests under this section, each regulated entity must use scenarios provided by FHFA, which shall be generally consistent with and comparable to those established by the FRB, that reflect a minimum of three sets of economic and financial conditions, including a baseline, adverse, and severely adverse scenario. Not later than 30 days after the FRB publishes its scenarios, FHFA will issue to all regulated entities a description of the baseline, adverse, and severely adverse scenarios that each regulated entity shall use to conduct its annual stress tests under this part.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Potential impact.</E> Except as noted in this subpart, in conducting a stress test under § 1238.3, each regulated entity shall calculate how each of the following is affected during each quarter of the stress test planning horizon, for each scenario:</P>
            <P>(1) Potential losses, pre-provision net revenues, allowance for loan losses, and future pro forma capital positions over the planning horizon; and</P>
            <P>(2) Capital levels and capital ratios, including regulatory capital and net worth, each Bank's leverage and permanent capital ratios, and any other capital ratios, specified by FHFA.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Planning horizon.</E> Each regulated entity must use a planning horizon of <PRTPAGE P="283"/>at least nine quarters over which the impact of specified scenarios would be assessed.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Additional analytical techniques.</E> If FHFA determines that the stress test methodologies and practices of a regulated entity are deficient, FHFA may determine that additional or alternative analytical techniques and exercises are appropriate for a regulated entity to use in identifying, measuring, and monitoring risks to the financial soundness of the regulated entity, and require a regulated entity to implement such techniques and exercises in order to fulfill the requirements of this part. In addition, FHFA will issue guidance annually to describe the baseline, adverse, and severely adverse scenarios, and methodologies to be used in conducting the annual stress test.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Controls and oversight of stress testing processes.</E> (1) The appropriate senior management of each regulated entity must ensure that the regulated entity establishes and maintains a system of controls, oversight, and documentation, including policies and procedures, designed to ensure that the stress testing processes used by the regulated entity are effective in meeting the requirements of this part. These policies and procedures must, at a minimum, describe the regulated entity's testing practices and methodologies, validation and use of stress test results, and processes for updating the regulated entity's stress testing practices consistent with relevant supervisory guidance;</P>
            <P>(2) The board of directors, or a designated committee thereof, shall review and approve the policies and procedures established to comply with this part as frequently as economic conditions or the condition of the regulated entity warrants, but at least annually; and</P>
            <P>(3) Senior management of the regulated entity and each member of the board of directors shall receive a summary of the stress test results.</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Content of report for annual stress test.</E> Each regulated entity must file a report in the manner and form established by FHFA.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Confidential treatment of information submitted.</E> Reports submitted to FHFA under this part are FHFA property and records (as defined in 12 CFR part 1202 of this chapter). The reports are and include non-public information contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of, FHFA in connection with the performance of the agency's responsibilities regulating or supervising its regulated entities.

A security interest in a Security Entitlement that is in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank from a Person that is not a Participant, and that is not recorded on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank pursuant to § 1249.13(c)(1), is governed by the law determined in the manner specified in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) If the jurisdiction specified in the first sentence of paragraph (b) of this section is a State that has not adopted Revised Article 8, then the law specified in paragraph (b) of this section shall be the law of that State as though Revised Article 8 had been adopted by that State.</P>
            <P>(d) To the extent not otherwise inconsistent with this part, and notwithstanding any provision in the Securities Documentation setting forth a choice of law, the provisions set forth in 31 CFR 357.11 regarding law governing other interests apply and shall be read as though modified to effectuate the application of 31 CFR 357.11 to the Enterprises.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1249.13</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Creation of Participant's Security Entitlement; security interests.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A Participant's Security Entitlement is created when a Federal Reserve Bank indicates by book-entry that a Book-entry Enterprise Security has been credited to a Participant's Securities Account.</P>

            <P>(b) A security interest in a Security Entitlement of a Participant in favor of the United States to secure deposits of public money, including without limitation deposits to the Treasury tax and loan accounts, or other security interest in favor of the United States that is required by Federal statute, regulation, or agreement, and that is <PRTPAGE P="296"/>marked on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank is thereby effected and perfected, and has priority over any other interest in the securities. Where a security interest in favor of the United States in a Security Entitlement of a Participant is marked on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank, such Federal Reserve Bank may rely, and is protected in relying, exclusively on the order of an authorized representative of the United States directing the transfer of the security. For purposes of this paragraph, an “authorized representative of the United States” is the official designated in the applicable regulations or agreement to which a Federal Reserve Bank is a party, governing the security interest.</P>
            <P>(c)(1) An Enterprise and the Federal Reserve Banks have no obligation to agree to act on behalf of any Person or to recognize the interest of any transferee of a security interest or other limited interest in favor of any Person except to the extent of any specific requirement of Federal law or regulation or to the extent set forth in any specific agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank on whose books the interest of the Participant is recorded. To the extent required by such law or regulation or set forth in an agreement with a Federal Reserve Bank, or the Federal Reserve Bank Operating Circular, a security interest in a Security Entitlement that is in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank, an Enterprise, or a Person may be created and perfected by a Federal Reserve Bank marking its books to record the security interest. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a security interest in a Security Entitlement marked on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank shall have priority over any other interest in the securities.</P>
            <P>(2) In addition to the method provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a security interest, including a security interest in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank, may be perfected by any method by which a security interest may be perfected under applicable law as described in § 1249.12(b) or (d). The perfection, effect of perfection or non-perfection and priority of a security interest are governed by such applicable law. A security interest in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank shall be treated as a security interest in favor of a clearing corporation in all respects under such law, including with respect to the effect of perfection and priority of such security interest. A Federal Reserve Bank Operating Circular shall be treated as a rule adopted by a clearing corporation for such purposes.</P>

            <P>(a) Except in the case of a security interest in favor of the United States or a Federal Reserve Bank or otherwise as provided in § 1249.13(c)(1), for the purposes of this part, each Enterprise and the Federal Reserve Banks shall treat the Participant to whose Securities Account an interest in a Book-entry Enterprise Security has been credited as the person exclusively entitled to issue a Transfer Message, to receive interest and other payments with respect thereof and otherwise to exercise all the rights and powers with respect to such Security, notwithstanding any information or notice to the contrary. Neither the Federal Reserve Banks nor an Enterprise shall be liable to a Person asserting or having an adverse claim to a Security Entitlement or to a Book-entry Enterprise Security in a Participant's Securities Account, including any such claim arising as a result of the transfer or disposition of a Book-entry Enterprise Security by a Federal Reserve Bank pursuant to a Transfer Message that the Federal Reserve Bank reasonably believes to be genuine.</P>
            <P>(b) The obligation of the Enterprise to make payments (including payments of interest and principal) with respect to Book-entry Enterprise Securities is discharged at the time payment in the appropriate amount is made as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) Interest or other payments on Book-entry Enterprise Securities is either credited by a Federal Reserve Bank to a Funds Account maintained at such Federal Reserve Bank or otherwise paid as directed by the Participant.</P>

            <P>(2) Book-entry Enterprise Securities are redeemed in accordance with their terms by a Federal Reserve Bank withdrawing the securities from the Participant's Securities Account in which <PRTPAGE P="297"/>they are maintained and by either crediting the amount of the redemption proceeds, including both redemption proceeds, where applicable, to a Funds Account at such Federal Reserve Bank or otherwise paying such redemption proceeds as directed by the Participant. No action by the Participant ordinarily is required in connection with the redemption of a Book-entry Enterprise Security.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1253.3</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Notice of new activity.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Before commencing a new activity, an Enterprise must submit a Notice of New Activity (Notice) to the FHFA, and either receive a determination that the new activity is not a new product, await passage of the 15 business-day period as described in paragraph (d) of this section, or, where FHFA determines the new activity to be a new product, await approval of the new product under § 1253.4. In addition, for any new activity that an Enterprise seeks to engage in which FHFA had previously approved in accordance with this part for the other Enterprise, or in which the other Enterprise had engaged continuously since prior to July 30, 2008, the Enterprise must submit a Notice to FHFA. In support of its Notice, the Enterprise shall submit information sufficient to allow the Director to make a determination on the Notice pursuant to section 1321 of the Safety and Soundness Act (12 U.S.C. 4541), as amended, including any information required by FHFA by regulation or otherwise. The Enterprise shall provide a thorough, meaningful, complete and specific description of the new activity such that the public will be able to provide fully informed comment on the new activity if FHFA determines the new activity to be a new product. Such information shall include that contained in the FHFA Notice Form and the Instructions for the FHFA Notice of New Activity Form (Notice Form Instructions) that appear in the appendix of this part. The Notice Form and Notice Form Instructions may be amended from time to time by written direction of the Director. Requests for confidential treatment for any portion of an Enterprise's submission must be made consistent with § 1253.5.</P>
            <P>(b) FHFA will evaluate a Notice to establish whether the submission contains sufficient information for FHFA to make a determination whether the new activity is a new product subject to prior approval. Upon establishing that the Notice contains sufficient information, FHFA shall deem the submission complete and “received” for purposes of section 1321(e)(2)(B) of the Safety and Soundness Act (12 U.S.C. 4541(e)(2)(B)), and shall notify the Enterprise accordingly.</P>

            <P>(c) No later than 15 business-days after the Notice is deemed completed and “received” for purposes of section <PRTPAGE P="302"/>1321(e)(2)(B) of the Safety and Soundness Act (12 U.S.C. 4541(e)(2)(B)), the Director will make a written determination on the Notice, and shall notify the Enterprise accordingly. The Director may also approve the new activity subject to such terms, conditions, or limitations on the Enterprise's engagement in the new activity as the Director determines to be appropriate.</P>
            <P>(d) If the Director fails to make a determination within the 15 business-day period specified in paragraph (c) of this section, the Enterprise may commence the new activity. The Director's failure to make a determination within the 15-day period does not limit or restrict the Director's safety and soundness authority or the authority of the Director to review the new activity to determine whether the activity is consistent with the statutory mission of the Enterprise.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 1253.4</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>New product approval.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Public notice.</E> If the Director determines that the new activity is a new product, FHFA shall publish a public notice soliciting comments on the proposed product for a 30 calendar-day period.</P>
            <P>(1) The public notice will describe the new product and state the closing date of the public comment period. The public notice will provide instructions for submission of public comment.</P>
            <P>(2) The Director will consider all public comments received by the closing date of the comment period.</P>

            <P>(3) In computing the 30 calendar-day public comment period, FHFA excludes the day on which the public notice is published in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> from which the period begins to run, and includes the last day of the period, regardless of whether it is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Director's determination.</E> (1) No later than 30 calendar-days after the end of the public comment period, the Director will provide the Enterprise with a written determination on whether it may proceed with the new product. The written determination will specify the grounds for the Director's determination.</P>
            <P>(2) The Director will approve the new product if the Director determines that the new product complies with the applicable authorizing statute, is in the public interest, and is consistent with the safety and soundness of the Enterprise and the mortgage finance and financial system. The Enterprise may then offer the new product subject to any terms, conditions, or limitations as may be established by the Director.</P>
            <P>(3) Among the factors that the Director may consider when determining whether a new product is in the public interest are—</P>
            <P>(i) The degree to which the new product might reasonably be expected to advance any of the purposes of the Enterprise under the applicable authorizing statute;</P>
            <P>(ii) The degree to which the new product serves underserved markets as set forth in section 1335 of the Safety and Soundness Act (12 U.S.C. 4565);</P>
            <P>(iii) The degree to which the new product is being supplied or could be supplied by non-government-sponsored-enterprise firms;</P>
            <P>(iv) Other alternatives for providing the new product;</P>
            <P>(v) The degree to which the new product promotes competition in the marketplace or, to the contrary, would result in less competition and greater concentration of economic activity or risk;</P>
            <P>(vi) The degree to which Enterprise provision of the new product overcomes natural market barriers or inefficiencies;</P>
            <P>(vii) The degree to which Enterprise provision of the new product might raise or mitigate systemic risks to the mortgage, mortgage finance or other financial markets;</P>
            <P>(viii) The degree to which the new product furthers fair housing; and</P>
            <P>(ix) Such other factors determined appropriate by the Director.</P>

            <P>(4) The Director will disapprove the new product if the Director determines that approval is inconsistent with applicable law, regulation, or FHFA policy thereunder, or contrary to public interest or the safety and soundness of the Enterprise or the mortgage finance or financial system. If the Director disapproves the new product, the Enterprise may not offer the new product.<PRTPAGE P="303"/>
            </P>
            <P>(5) The Director may establish terms, conditions, or limitations on the Enterprise's offering of the new product to ensure that the product offering is consistent with applicable statutory and regulatory standards, FHFA policies, public interest, or the safety and soundness of the Enterprise or the mortgage finance or financial system.</P>
            <P>(6) If the Director fails to make a determination within the 30 calendar-day period that begins on the day after the end of the public comment period, the Enterprise may offer the new product. The Director's failure to make a determination within such 30-day period does not limit or restrict the Director's safety and soundness authority or the authority of the Director to review the new product to determine that the product is consistent with the statutory mission of the Enterprise.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Temporary approval.</E> (1) FHFA may approve a new product without first seeking public comments as described in § 1253.4(c) if—</P>
            <P>(i) The Enterprise submits a specific request for Temporary Approval that describes the exigent circumstances that make the delay associated with the 30-day public comment period contrary to the public interest and the Director determines that exigent circumstances exist and that delay associated with first seeking public comment would be contrary to the public interest; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Notwithstanding the absence of a request by the Enterprise for Temporary Approval, the Director determines on his or her own initiative that there are exigent circumstances that make the delay associated with first seeking public comment contrary to the public interest.</P>
            <P>(2) The Director may impose terms, conditions, or limitations on the Temporary Approval to ensure that the new product offering is consistent with applicable statutory and regulatory standards, FHFA policies, public interest, and the safety and soundness of the Enterprise or the mortgage finance system.</P>
            <P>(3) If the Director grants Temporary Approval, the Director will notify the Enterprise in writing of the Director's decision, and include the period for which it is effective and any terms, conditions or limitations. Upon granting of Temporary Approval, FHFA will also publish the request for public comment to begin the process for permanent approval.</P>
            <P>(4) If the Director denies a request for Temporary Approval, the Director will notify the Enterprise in writing of the Director's decision, and will evaluate the new product in accordance with paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Additional information.</E> The Director may request any information in addition to that supplied in the completed Notice if, as a result of public comment or otherwise in the course of considering the Notice, the Director believes that the information is necessary for his or her decision. The Director may disapprove a new product if he or she does not receive the information requested from the Enterprise in sufficient time to permit adequate evaluation of the information within the time periods set forth in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Confidential information.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Information presumed public.</E> FHFA will treat all information an Enterprise submits in a Notice as public information, except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section. FHFA will also treat information provided by a commenter, in response to a notice requesting comment on an Enterprise new product, as public information, except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Confidential treatment request.</E> An Enterprise or commenter may designate specific information as confidential and request that it not be made publicly available. For any information that an Enterprise or commenter seeks confidential treatment, the Enterprise or commenter is required to submit a complete copy of the Notice or comment, with a specific request for confidential treatment. Simultaneously, the Enterprise or commenter is required to submit a copy of the Notice or comment containing only those portions for which no request for confidential treatment is made, and from which those portions for which confidential treatment is requested have been redacted. The Enterprise or <PRTPAGE P="304"/>commenter must specify the bases for designated information not being made public as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Required information.</E> The Enterprise or commenter is required to provide the following information in support of its request for confidential treatment of the designated information—</P>
            <P>(1) Identification of the specific information for which confidential treatment is sought, and the specific Notice for which the information is being submitted;</P>
            <P>(2) Explanation of the bases for the proposed confidential treatment including, but not limited to, why the information is “commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential” as that phrase is used in Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), and § 1202.4(a)(4) of this chapter;</P>
            <P>(3) Explanation of the relevance and necessity of the information to whether the Notice should be approved or denied;</P>
            <P>(4) Explanation of how disclosure of the information would result in substantial harm to the competitive position of the Enterprise or commenter;</P>
            <P>(5) Explanation of whether the information is available to the public and the extent of any previous disclosure to third parties;</P>
            <P>(6) Justification of the time period during which the Enterprise or commenter asserts that the material should not be available for public disclosure; and</P>
            <P>(7) Any other information that the Enterprise or commenter seeking confidential treatment believes may be useful in assessing whether its request for confidentiality should be granted.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">FHFA determination.</E> FHFA will determine whether the designated information may be withheld from public disclosure and will notify the Enterprise or commenter of the determination. In the event that FHFA determines the information may not be withheld from public disclosure, the Enterprise or commenter may withdraw the information or consent to public disclosure. Requests for confidential treatment that do not comply with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section will not be considered.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Certifying and nullifying an approval.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) An Enterprise shall certify, through an executive officer, as that term is defined by § 1770.3(g) of this title, that any filing or supporting material submitted to FHFA pursuant to regulations in this part contains no material misrepresentations or omissions. FHFA may review and verify any information filed in connection with a Notice. If FHFA discovers a material misrepresentation or omission after the Director has rendered a decision on the filing, FHFA may nullify any approval or modify the terms, conditions, and limitations to such approval. For purposes of this paragraph, an Enterprise's authority to offer a new product or engage in a new activity by reason of the Director's not having made an explicit determination within the statutory time period constitutes an approval.</P>
            <P>(b) Any person responsible for any material misrepresentation or omission in a submission or supporting materials may be subject to enforcement action and other penalties, including criminal penalties provided in 18 U.S.C. 1001.</P>

            <P>(a) Unless the Director otherwise informs the Enterprise in writing, an Enterprise must cease offering a new product or engaging in a new activity immediately upon discovering or receiving notice from the Director that the Enterprise has—</P>
            <P>(1) Offered a new product or commenced a new activity without submitting a Notice;</P>
            <P>(2) Offered a new product or commenced a new activity after submitting a Notice but before approval is granted, and before the expiration of the time provided for the Director to make a determination under §§ 1253.3 and 1253.4;</P>
            <P>(3) Offered a new product after the Director disapproved it; or</P>

            <P>(4) Failed to adhere to any terms, conditions or limitations established by the Director in his or her approval of a new product or activity.<PRTPAGE P="305"/>
            </P>
            <P>(b) Within five (5) business-days of the discovery or notice of any of the events described in paragraph (a) of this section, the Enterprise must provide the Director a written description of the failure or failures of controls that resulted in the offering of the new product or commencement of the new activity in contravention of this regulation, and the steps that the Enterprise has taken or will take to remediate the control failures. The Enterprise must provide the board of directors of the Enterprise and chief risk officer, internal audit, and compliance officer of the Enterprise with a copy of the written description on the same date the description is provided to the Director of FHFA.</P>
            <P>(c) In the event that the Enterprise elects to resubmit the Notice of a new product or new activity that was undertaken in contravention of this regulation, the resubmission must provide sufficient documentation of the effectiveness of the remediation efforts described in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
            <P>(d) Failure to comply with paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section above may result in FHFA's taking enforcement action, including pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 4631 (orders to cease and desist), 12 U.S.C. 4632 (temporary orders to cease and desist), and 12 U.S.C. 4636 (civil money penalties).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Bank information to be shared.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> In order to enable each Bank to evaluate the financial condition of any one or more of the other Banks and the Bank System, FHFA shall distribute to each Bank and to the Office of Finance, or shall require each Bank to distribute directly to each other Bank and the Office of Finance, such categories of financial and supervisory information regarding each Bank and the Bank system as it determines to be appropriate, subject to the requirements of this part.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Notice.</E> FHFA shall prepare and issue to each Bank and the Office of Finance a notice setting forth the categories of information to be distributed, which it shall review from time to time and revise as necessary to ensure that the information distributed remains useful to the Banks in evaluating the financial strength of the other Banks and the Bank System. Prior to issuing a new or revised notice, FHFA shall notify each Bank and the Office of Finance of its proposed contents and allow them a reasonable period within which to comment.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Director's orders.</E> The Director or his designee may issue such orders as are necessary to effect the distribution of the information set forth in the notice issued under paragraph (b) of this section and to carry out the provisions of this part.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Requests to withhold proprietary information.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> A Bank may request in writing that FHFA withhold from distribution, or determine that the Bank may withhold from distribution, particular information relating to the Bank that may otherwise be subject to distribution under § 1260.2 on the basis that it is proprietary information and the public interest requires that it not be shared. Any such request shall identify the particular information the Bank believes should not be distributed and provide support for the assertions that it is proprietary information and that withholding it from the other Banks and the Office of Finance is necessary to protect the public interest.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Timing of requests.</E> (1) <E T="03">General.</E> Unless otherwise specified as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the period within which a Bank may make a request to withhold proprietary information under paragraph (a) of this section shall be as follows:</P>
            <P>(i) For information that a Bank submits to FHFA, the request shall be delivered to FHFA no later than the time at which the Bank submits the subject information to FHFA.</P>
            <P>(ii) For information that FHFA creates (not including compilations of data submitted by the Banks), prior to distributing any information relating to a particular Bank, FHFA shall provide that Bank with a copy of the information to be distributed, after which the Bank shall have ten (10) business days within which to deliver the request to FHFA.</P>

            <P>(iii) For information that a Bank is required to distribute directly to the other Banks and the Office of Finance, <PRTPAGE P="316"/>the request shall be delivered to FHFA no later than ten (10) business days prior to the date on which the Bank would otherwise be required to distribute the information.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">As otherwise specified by FHFA.</E> Any notice issued by FHFA under § 1260.2(b) may establish requirements for the timing of requests to withhold proprietary information that are different from those specified under paragraph (b)(1) of this section for any category of information to be distributed thereunder. In establishing such requirements, FHFA shall give due regard to the volume and complexity of the information to be reviewed, the Bank's existing familiarity with the information, the frequency of submission or distribution of the information, the likelihood that the information will contain proprietary information, and the effect that any delay in the distribution of the information would have on the fulfillment of the purposes of section 20A(a) of the Bank Act.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Determination and notice by FHFA.</E> After receiving a written request that meets the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the Director or his designee shall promptly determine whether FHFA will, or the Bank may, withhold any information from distribution pursuant to the request, which determination shall be final. FHFA shall promptly notify the affected Bank of that determination and shall not distribute any information that is the subject of the request until it has provided the required notice to the Bank.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 1260.4</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Timing and form of information distribution.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Timing of distribution by FHFA.</E> FHFA may distribute information as provided in the notice issued under § 1260.2(b) after the expiration of the applicable time period specified in § 1260.3(b) unless, within that time period, the affected Bank has filed with FHFA a written request to withhold particular proprietary information that meets the requirements of § 1260.3(a). When a Bank has filed such a request, FHFA shall not distribute the information that is the subject of the request until the Director or his designee has made the determination and provided the notice required by § 1260.3(c) and shall distribute or withhold the subject information in conformity with that determination.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Timing of distribution by Banks.</E> A Bank that is required to distribute information directly to the other Banks and the Office of Finance shall distribute that information at the time specified in the notice issued under § 1260.2(b) unless, within the time period specified in § 1260.3(b)(1)(iii), the Bank has submitted to FHFA a request to withhold particular proprietary information that meets the requirements of § 1260.3(a). If the Bank has filed such a request, it need not distribute the information that is the subject of the request until the Director or his designee has made the determination and provided the notice required by § 1260.3(c). Thereafter, the Bank shall distribute or withhold the subject information in conformity with that determination.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Form.</E> FHFA may distribute information, or require a Bank to distribute information, under this part in either tangible or electronic form, as it deems appropriate.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1260.5</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Control and disclosure of shared information.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">No waiver of privilege.</E> The release of information under this part does not constitute a waiver by FHFA of any privilege, or of its right to control, supervise or impose limitations on the subsequent use and disclosure of any information concerning a Bank. To the extent that any information provided to a Bank or the Office of Finance pursuant to this part qualifies as non-public information under part 1214 of this chapter, that information shall continue to qualify as such and shall continue to be subject to the restrictions on disclosure set forth in part 1214, provided that a Bank shall not be deemed to have violated any provision of § 1214.3 of this chapter by disclosing in its filings with the SEC non-public information about another Bank that was obtained pursuant to this part if the disclosure is limited to a recital of the relevant factual content of the underlying information and the Bank has provided the notice required by paragraph (b) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="317"/>
            </P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Disclosures under the Federal securities laws.</E> If a Bank determines in good faith that it is required by any applicable provision of the 1934 Act or of 17 CFR chapter II to disclose non-public information relating to another Bank that it has received pursuant to this part, it shall provide to FHFA and to the Bank to which the information pertains prior written notice of such determination and of the content and anticipated timing of the disclosure, which notice shall be provided as far in advance of the anticipated disclosure as is feasible under the circumstances.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Safeguarding of information.</E> A Bank may use non-public information distributed pursuant to this part only for the purposes described in section 20A(a) of the Bank Act. Except as otherwise provided in this part, neither the Office of Finance, nor any Bank, nor any officer, director or employee thereof, may disclose or permit the use or disclosure of any non-public information regarding another Bank received pursuant to this part in any manner or for any purpose. Each Bank and the Office of Finance shall implement policies and procedures to prevent the improper disclosure of such information and to limit the access of its personnel to such information, which policies and procedures shall be no less stringent than those that apply to the entity's own confidential and supervisory information.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Information regarding the Office of Finance.</E> A Bank president that receives any information regarding the Office of Finance in his or her capacity as a member of the board of directors of the Office of Finance may share the information with the board of directors of the Bank at which he or she is employed, as well as with the appropriate officers and employees of the Bank, subject to the limitations of this part.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Capital stock reports.</E> (1) On or before April 10 of each year, each Bank shall deliver to FHFA a capital stock report that indicates, as of the record date, the number of members located in each voting State in the Bank's district, the number of shares of Bank stock that each member (identified by its FHFA ID number) was required to hold, and the number of shares of Bank stock that all members located in each voting State were required to hold. If a Bank has issued more than one class of stock, it shall report the total shares of stock of all classes required to be held by the members. The Bank shall certify to FHFA that, to the best of its knowledge, the information provided in the capital stock report is accurate and complete, and that it has notified each member of its minimum capital stock holding requirement as of the record date.</P>
              <P>(2) The number of shares of Bank stock that any member was required to hold as of the record date shall be determined in accordance with the minimum investment established by the capital plan for that Bank.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Designation of member directorships.</E> Using the method of equal proportions, the Director annually will conduct a designation of member directorships for each Bank based on the number of shares of Bank stock required to be held by the members in each State as of the record date. If a Bank has issued more than one class of stock, the Director will designate the directorships for each State in that Bank district based on the combined number of shares required to be held by the members in that State. For purposes of conducting the designation, the number of shares of Bank stock required to be held by members as of that date shall be determined in accordance with the minimum investment established by the capital plan for that Bank.

The new directorship shall be filled by vote of the members in the succeeding State and, in order to maintain the staggered terms of directorships, shall be adjusted to a term equal to the remaining term of the previous directorship if it had not been redesignated to another State.</P>

              <P>(5) If a member directorship is to be filled by members in a State, a nominating certificate for those members.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Member directorship nominations.</E> (1) Any member that is entitled to vote in the election may nominate an eligible individual to fill each available member directorship for its voting state by delivering to its Bank, prior to a deadline to be established by the Bank and set forth in the notice required in paragraph (a) of this section, a nominating certificate duly adopted by the member's governing body or by an individual authorized by the member's governing body to act on its behalf.</P>
              <P>(2) The nominating certificate shall include the name of the nominee and the name, location, and FHFA ID number of the member the nominee serves as an officer or director.</P>
              <P>(3) The Bank shall establish a deadline for delivery of nominating certificates, which shall be no earlier than 30 calendar days after the date on which the Bank delivers the notice required by paragraph (a) of this section, and the Bank shall not accept certificates received after that deadline. The Bank shall retain all accepted nominating certificates for at least two years after the date of the election.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Accepting member directorship nominations.</E> Promptly after receipt of any nominating certificate, a Bank shall notify in writing any individual nominated for a member directorship. An individual may accept the nomination only by delivering to the Bank, prior to a deadline established by the Bank and set forth in its notice, an executed director eligibility certification form prescribed by FHFA. A Bank shall allow each nominee at least 30 calendar days after the date the Bank delivered the notice of nomination within which to deliver the executed form. A nominee may decline the nomination by so advising the Bank in writing, or by failing to deliver a properly executed director eligibility certification form prior to the deadline. Each Bank shall retain all information received under this paragraph for at least two years after the date of the election.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Independent directorship nominations.</E> (1) Any individual who seeks to be an independent director of the board of directors of a Bank may deliver to the Bank, on or before the deadline set by the Bank for delivery of nominating <PRTPAGE P="322"/>certificates, an executed independent director application form prescribed by FHFA that demonstrates that the individual both is eligible and has either of the following qualifications:</P>
              <P>(i) More than four years of experience representing consumer or community interests in banking services, credit needs, housing, or consumer financial protections; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Knowledge of or experience in one or more of the areas set forth in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) Any other interested party may recommend to the Bank that it consider a particular individual as a nominee for an independent directorship, but the Bank shall not nominate any individual unless the individual has delivered to the Bank, on or before the date the Bank has set for delivery of nominating certificates, an executed independent director application form prescribed by FHFA. The application form prescribed by FHFA will provide a means by which an individual can indicate an intent to be considered for a public interest directorship. The board of directors of the Bank may consider any individual for any independent directorship nomination, provided it has determined that the individual is eligible and qualified, but the board shall nominate for a public interest directorship only an individual who indicates on the application form a desire to be considered for a public interest directorship. The board of directors of the Bank shall consult with the Bank's Advisory Council before nominating any individual for any independent directorship. Each Bank shall include in its bylaws the procedures it intends to use for the nomination and election of the independent directors, and shall retain all information received under this paragraph for at least two years after the date of the election.</P>
              <P>(3) Each Bank shall determine the number of public interest directorships to be included among its authorized independent directorships, provided that each Bank shall at all times have at least two such directorships, and shall announce that number to its members in the notice required by paragraph (a) of this section. In submitting nominations to its members, each Bank shall nominate at least as many individuals as there are independent directorships to be filled in that year's election.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Independent director qualifications.</E> (1) Each independent director and each nominee for an independent directorship, other than a public interest directorship, shall have experience in, or knowledge of, one or more of the following areas: auditing and accounting, derivatives, financial management, organizational management, project development, risk management practices, and the law. Before nominating any individual for an independent directorship, other than a public interest directorship, the board of directors of a Bank shall determine that such knowledge or experience of the nominee is commensurate with that needed to oversee a financial institution with a size and complexity that is comparable to that of the Bank.</P>
              <P>(2) Each public interest independent director and each nominee for a public interest directorship shall have more than four years of experience representing consumer or community interests in banking services, credit needs, housing or consumer financial protection.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Eligibility verification.</E> Using the information provided on member director eligibility forms prescribed by FHFA, each Bank shall verify that each nominee for each member directorship meets all the eligibility requirements for such directorship. Using the information provided on independent director application forms prescribed by FHFA, each Bank shall verify that each nominee for each public interest independent directorship and each other independent directorship meets all eligibility requirements and any knowledge or experience qualifications for such directorship, as set forth in the Bank Act and this subpart. Before announcing any independent director nominee, the Bank shall deliver to FHFA, for the Director's review, a copy of the independent director application forms executed by the individuals nominated for independent directorships. If within two weeks of such delivery FHFA provides comments to the Bank on any independent director nominee, the board of directors of the Bank shall <PRTPAGE P="323"/>consider the FHFA's comments in determining whether to proceed with those nominees or to reopen the nomination.</P>

              <P>(v) A confidentiality statement prohibiting the Bank from disclosing how any member voted.</P>
              <P>(2) At the election of the Bank, a ballot also may include, in the body or as an attachment, a brief description of the skills and experience of each nominee for a member directorship.</P>

Thereafter, the Bank shall declare elected all such eligible nominees.

A member may not split its votes among multiple nominees for a single directorship, and, where there are multiple directorships to be filled, either within the member's voting state or at large, in the case of independent directorships, a member may not cumulatively vote for a single nominee. If any member votes, it shall by resolution of its governing body either authorize the voting for specific nominees or delegate to an individual the authority to vote for specific nominees. To vote, a member shall:</P>

              <P>(1) Mark on the ballot the name of not more than one of the nominees for <PRTPAGE P="324"/>each directorship to be filled. Each nominee so selected shall receive all of the votes that the member is entitled to cast.</P>
              <P>(2) Execute and deliver the ballot to the Bank on or before the closing date. A Bank shall not allow a member to change a ballot after it has been delivered to the Bank.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Counting ballots.</E> A Bank shall not review any ballot until after the closing date, and shall not include in the election results any ballot received after the closing date. Promptly after the closing date, each Bank shall tabulate the votes cast in the election: for the member directorships, the Bank shall tabulate votes by each voting state; for the independent directorships, the Bank shall tabulate votes for the district at-large. Any ballots cast in violation of paragraph (d) of this section shall be void.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Declaring results</E>— (1) <E T="03">For member directorships.</E> The Bank shall declare elected the nominee receiving the highest number of votes. If more than one member directorship is to be filled for a particular State, the Bank shall declare elected each successive nominee receiving the next highest number of votes until all such open directorships are filled.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">For independent directorships.</E> (i) The bank shall tabulate separately the votes received for public interest independent director nominees and those received for other independent director nominees, in each case in accordance with paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the number of nominees exceeds the number of directorships to be filled, the Bank shall declare elected the nominee receiving the highest number of votes. If more than one directorship is to be filled, the Bank shall declare elected each successive nominee receiving the next highest number of votes for such directorship until all such open directorships are filled.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the number of nominees is no more than the number of directorships to be filled, the Bank shall declare elected each nominee receiving at least 20 percent of the number of votes eligible to be cast in the election. If any directorship is not filled due to any nominee's failure to receive at least 20 percent of the votes eligible to be cast, the Bank shall continue the election process for that directorship under the procedures in paragraph (h) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Tie votes.</E> In the event of a tie for the last available directorship, the disinterested incumbent members of the board of directors of the Bank, by a majority vote, shall declare elected one of the nominees for whom the number of votes cast was tied.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Eligibility.</E> A Bank shall not declare elected a nominee that it has reason to know is ineligible to serve, nor shall it seat a director-elect that it has reason to know is ineligible to serve.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Record retention.</E> The Bank shall retain all ballots it receives for at least two years after the date of the election, and shall not disclose how any member voted.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Report of election.</E> Promptly following the election, each Bank shall deliver a notice to its members, to each nominee, and to FHFA that contains the following information:</P>

              <P>(2) For each independent directorship, the name of the director-elect, whether the director-elect will fill a public interest directorship and, if so, the consumer or community interest represented by such directorship, any qualifications under § 1261.7(e), and the expiration date of the term of office;</P>
              <P>(3) For member directorships, the total number of eligible votes, the number of members voting in the election, and the total number of votes cast for each nominee, which shall be reported by State; and</P>
              <P>(4) For independent directorships, the total number of eligible votes, the number of members voting in the election, and the total number of votes cast for each nominee, which shall be reported for the district at large.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Failure to fill all independent directorships.</E> If any independent directorship is not filled due to the failure of any nominee to receive at least 20 percent of the eligible vote, the Bank shall <PRTPAGE P="325"/>continue the election process for that directorship under the following procedures:</P>
              <P>(1) The Bank's board of directors, after again consulting with the Bank's Advisory Council, shall nominate at least as many individuals as there are independent directorships to be filled. It may nominate individuals who failed to be elected in the initial vote. The Bank thereafter shall deliver to FHFA a copy of the independent director application form executed by each nominee.</P>

              <P>(ii) The Bank may adopt a closing date that is earlier than 30 calendar days after delivery of the ballots to the eligible voting members, provided the Bank determines that an earlier closing date provides a reasonable amount of time to vote the ballots.</P>

A director shall disclose fully the nature of his or her interests in the matter and shall provide to the Bank's board of directors any information requested to aid in its consideration of the director's interest.

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Verifying eligibility.</E> Prior to any election by the board of directors, the Bank shall obtain an executed member director eligibility certification form prescribed by FHFA from each individual being considered to fill a member directorship and an executed independent director application form prescribed by FHFA from each individual being considered to fill an independent directorship. Using the executed forms, each Bank shall verify each individual's eligibility and, as to independent directors, also shall verify the individual's qualifications. Before any independent director is elected by the board of directors of a Bank, the Bank shall deliver to FHFA for its review a <PRTPAGE P="328"/>copy of the application form of each individual being considered by the board. The Bank shall retain the information it receives in accordance with § 1261.7(c) and (d).</P>

              <P>(2) For each independent directorship filled by the board of a Bank, the name of the director, the name and location of the organization with which the director is affiliated, if any, the director's title or position with such organization, and the expiration date of the director's term of office.</P>

In preparing a digest for a non-federally-insured credit union applicant, the Bank shall summarize the manner in which the applicant has complied with the requirements of § 1263.19(a).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">File.</E> The Bank shall maintain a membership file for each applicant for at least three years after the Bank decides whether to approve or deny membership or, in the case of an appeal to FHFA, for three years after the resolution of the appeal.

              <SUBJECT>Decision on application.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Authority.</E> FHFA hereby authorizes the Banks to approve or deny all applications for membership, subject <PRTPAGE P="335"/>to the requirements of this part. The authority to approve membership applications may be exercised only by a committee of the Bank's board of directors, the Bank president, or a senior officer who reports directly to the Bank president, other than an officer with responsibility for business development.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Decision resolution.</E> For each applicant, the Bank shall prepare a written resolution duly adopted by the Bank's board of directors, by a committee of the board of directors, or by an officer with delegated authority to approve membership applications. The decision resolution shall state:</P>
              <P>(1) That the statements in the digest are accurate to the best of the Bank's knowledge, and are based on a diligent and comprehensive review of all available information identified in the digest; and</P>
              <P>(2) The Bank's decision and the reasons therefor. Decisions to approve an application should state specifically that:</P>
              <P>(i) The applicant is authorized under the laws of the United States and the laws of the appropriate State to become a member of, purchase stock in, do business with, and maintain deposits in, the Bank to which the applicant has applied; and</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Action on applications.</E> The Bank shall act on an application within 60 calendar days of the date the Bank deems the application to be complete. An application is “complete” when the Bank has obtained all the information required by this part, and any other information the Bank deems necessary, to process the application. If an application that was deemed complete subsequently is deemed incomplete because the Bank determines during the review process that additional information is necessary to process the application, the Bank may suspend the 60-day processing period until the Bank again deems the application to be complete, at which time the processing period shall resume. The Bank shall notify an applicant in writing when it deems the applicant's application to be complete, and shall maintain a copy of the notice in the applicant's membership file. The Bank shall notify an applicant whenever it suspends or resumes the 60-day processing period, and shall maintain a written record of those notifications in the applicant's membership file. Within three business days of a Bank's decision on an application, the Bank shall provide the applicant and FHFA with a copy of the Bank's decision resolution.</P>

              <P>(i) Mortgage loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration of HUD under title II of the National Housing Act; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Securities representing a whole interest in the principal and interest payments due on a pool of mortgage loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration of HUD under title II of the National Housing Act.

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Certain advances to SHFAs.</E> (i) In addition to the collateral described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a Bank may make an advance to a housing associate that has satisfied the requirements of § 1264.3(b) for the purpose of facilitating residential or commercial mortgage lending that benefits individuals or families meeting the income requirements in section 142(d) or 143(f) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 142(d) or 143(f)) upon the security of the following collateral:</P>

              <P>(C) The other real estate-related collateral described in § 1266.7(a)(4), provided that such collateral comprises mortgage loans on one-to-four family or multifamily residential property.</P>
              <P>(ii) Prior to making an advance pursuant to this paragraph (b)(2), a Bank shall obtain a written certification from the housing associate that it shall use the proceeds of the advance for the purposes described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Terms and conditions</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> Subject to the provisions of this paragraph (c), a Bank, in its discretion, shall determine whether, and on what terms, it will make advances to a housing associate.</P>

              <P>(ii) A Bank shall apply the pricing criteria identified in § 1266.5(b)(2) equally to all of its member and housing associate borrowers.</P>

This limit does not apply to an advance made to a housing associate under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Transaction accounts.</E> Solely for the purpose of facilitating the making of advances to a housing associate, a <PRTPAGE P="365"/>Bank may establish a transaction account for each housing associate.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Loss of eligibility</E>—(1) <E T="03">Notification of status changes.</E> A Bank shall require a housing associate that applies for an advance to agree in writing that it will promptly inform the Bank of any change in its status as a housing associate.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">General credit risk-sharing requirement.</E> For each AMA product, the Bank shall implement and have in place at all times, a credit risk-sharing structure that:</P>
            <P>(1) Requires a participating financial institution to provide the credit enhancement necessary to enhance an eligible asset or pool to the credit quality specified by the terms and conditions of the AMA product, provided, however, that such credit enhancement results in the eligible asset or pool being at least AMA investment grade, as defined in § 1268.1; and</P>
            <P>(2) Meets the requirements of this section.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Determination of necessary credit enhancement.</E> (1) No later than 30 calendar days after the purchase of the asset or after a pool closes, the Bank shall determine the total credit enhancement necessary to enhance the asset or pool to at least AMA investment grade and to be consistent with the terms and conditions of a specific AMA product. The enhancement shall be for the life of the asset or pool. The Bank shall make this determination for each AMA product using a model and methodology that the Bank deems <PRTPAGE P="370"/>appropriate, subject to paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) A Bank shall document its basis for concluding that the contractual credit enhancement required from each participating financial institution with regard to a particular asset or pool will equal or exceed the credit enhancement level specified in the terms and conditions of the AMA product and determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Credit risk-sharing structure.</E> Under any credit risk-sharing structure, the credit enhancement provided by the participating financial institution shall at all times meet the following requirements:</P>
            <P>(1) The participating financial institution that is providing the credit enhancement required under this paragraph (c) shall in all cases:</P>
            <P>(i) Bear the direct economic consequences of actual credit losses on the asset or pool:</P>
            <P>(A) From the first dollar of loss up to the amount of expected losses; or</P>
            <P>(B) Immediately following expected losses, but in an amount equal to or exceeding the amount of expected losses; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Fully secure its direct credit enhancement obligation in accordance with § 1266.7; and</P>
            <P>(2) The participating financial institution also may provide all or a portion of the credit enhancement, with the approval of the Bank, by:</P>
            <P>(i) Contracting with an insurance affiliate of that participating financial institution to provide an enhancement, but only where such insurance is positioned in the credit risk-sharing structure so as to cover only losses remaining after the participating financial institution has borne losses as required under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section;</P>
            <P>(ii) Purchasing loan-level insurance only where:</P>
            <P>(A) The participating financial institution is legally obligated at all times to maintain such insurance with a qualified insurer; and</P>
            <P>(B) Such insurance is positioned in the credit enhancement structure so as to cover only losses remaining after the participating financial institution has borne losses as required under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section;</P>
            <P>(iii) Purchasing pool-level insurance only where:</P>
            <P>(A) The participating financial institution is legally obligated at all times to maintain such insurance with a qualified insurer;</P>
            <P>(B) Such insurance insures that portion of the required credit enhancement attributable to the geographic concentration and size of the pool; and</P>
            <P>(C) Such insurance is positioned last in the credit enhancement structure so as to cover only those losses remaining after all other elements of the credit enhancement structure have been exhausted;</P>
            <P>(iv) Contracting with another participating financial institution in the Bank's district to provide a credit enhancement consistent with this section, in return for compensation; or</P>
            <P>(v) Contracting with a participating financial institution in another Bank's district, pursuant to an arrangement between the two Banks, to provide a credit enhancement consistent with this section, in return for compensation.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Loans guaranteed or insured by a department or agency of the U.S. government.</E> Instead of the structure set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, a participating financial institution also may provide the required credit enhancement through loan-level insurance that is issued by an agency or department of the U.S. government or is a guarantee from an agency or department of the U.S. government, provided that the government insurance or guarantee remains in place for as long as the Bank owns the loan.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Qualified insurers.</E> (1) Within one year of January 18, 2017, each Bank must develop, and subsequently maintain, written financial and operational standards that an insurer must meet for the Bank to approve it as a qualified insurer. A Bank shall review qualified insurers at least once every two years to determine whether they still meet the financial and operational standards set by the Bank. A Bank may delegate responsibility for development of these standards and approval of qualified insurers to another <PRTPAGE P="371"/>Bank or group of Banks pursuant to § 1268.8.</P>
            <P>(2) Only qualified insurers may provide private loan insurance on AMA eligible assets or the loan or pool insurance allowed as part of the credit enhancement structure for AMA products under paragraphs (c)(2)(ii) or (iii) of this section.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Appropriate methodology for calculating credit enhancement.</E> A Bank shall use a model and methodology for estimating the amount of credit enhancement for an asset or pool. A Bank shall provide to FHFA upon request information about the model and methodology, including and without limitation results of any model runs and the results of any tests of the model performed by the Bank. FHFA reserves the right to direct a Bank to make changes to its model and methodology, and a Bank promptly shall institute any such FHFA-directed changes.</P>

            <P>(a) Servicing of AMA loans may be performed by or transferred to any institution, including an institution that is not a member of the Bank System, provided that the loans, after such transfer, continue to meet all requirements to qualify as AMA under §§ 1268.3, 1268.4, and 1268.5.</P>
            <P>(b) The transfer of mortgage servicing rights and responsibilities must be approved by the Bank or Banks that own the loan or a participation interest in the loan.</P>
            <P>(c) A Bank shall have in place policies and procedures to ensure that the transfer of mortgage servicing rights does not negatively affect the credit enhancement on the loans in question or substantially increase the Bank's exposure to the credit risk for the asset or pool.</P>

The existence of such a delegation, or the possibility that such a delegation may be made, must be disclosed to any potential participating financial institution as part of any AMA-related agreements signed with that participating financial institution. A Bank may contract with one or more parties, including without limitation another Bank, to provide services related to the administration of its own AMA program or the AMA program of another Bank for which it has been delegated administrative responsibility, without the necessity for further disclosure to the participating financial institutions.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Termination of agreements.</E> Any agreement made between two or more Banks in connection with the administration of any AMA program may be terminated by any party after a reasonable notice period.</P>

              <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the rights and obligations of the Banks, FHFA, the Director, the Office of Finance, the United States and the Federal Reserve Banks with respect to: A Book-entry consolidated obligation or Security Entitlement and the operation of the Book-entry system, as it applies to consolidated obligations; and the rights of any Person, including a Participant, against the Banks, FHFA, the Director, the Office of Finance, the United States and the Federal Reserve Banks with respect to: A Book-entry consolidated obligation or Security Entitlement and the operation of the Book-entry system, as it applies to consolidated obligations; are governed solely by regulations of FHFA, including the regulations of this part 1270, the applicable offering notice, applicable procedures established by the Office of Finance, and Federal Reserve Bank Operating Circulars.</P>

              <P>(b) A security interest in a Security Entitlement that is in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank from a Participant and that is not recorded on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank pursuant to <PRTPAGE P="380"/>§ 1270.14(c)(1), is governed by the law (not including the conflict-of-law rules) of the jurisdiction where the head office of the Federal Reserve Bank maintaining the Participant's Securities Account is located. A security interest in a Security Entitlement that is in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank from a Person that is not a Participant, and that is not recorded on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank pursuant to § 1270.14(c)(1), is governed by the law determined in the manner specified in § 1270.13.</P>
              <P>(c) If the jurisdiction specified in the first sentence of paragraph (b) of this section is a State that has not adopted Revised Article 8, then the law specified in the first sentence of paragraph (b) of this section shall be the law of that State as though Revised Article 8 had been adopted by that State.</P>

              <P>(a) To the extent not inconsistent with this part 1270, the law (not including the conflict-of-law rules) of a Securities Intermediary's jurisdiction governs:</P>
              <P>(1) The acquisition of a Security Entitlement from the Securities Intermediary;</P>
              <P>(2) The rights and duties of the Securities Intermediary and Entitlement Holder arising out of a Security Entitlement;</P>
              <P>(3) Whether the Securities Intermediary owes any duties to an adverse claimant to a Security Entitlement;</P>
              <P>(4) Whether an Adverse Claim can be asserted against a Person who acquires a Security Entitlement from the Securities Intermediary or a Person who purchases a Security Entitlement or interest therein from an Entitlement Holder; and</P>
              <P>(5) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the perfection, effect of perfection or non-perfection, and priority of a security interest in a Security Entitlement.</P>
              <P>(b) The following rules determine a “Securities Intermediary's jurisdiction” for purposes of this section:</P>
              <P>(1) If an agreement between the Securities Intermediary and its Entitlement Holder specifies that it is governed by the law of a particular jurisdiction, that jurisdiction is the Securities Intermediary's jurisdiction.</P>
              <P>(2) If an agreement between the Securities Intermediary and its Entitlement Holder does not specify the governing law as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, but expressly specifies that the securities account is maintained at an office in a particular jurisdiction, that jurisdiction is the Securities Intermediary's jurisdiction.</P>
              <P>(3) If an agreement between the Securities Intermediary and its Entitlement Holder does not specify a jurisdiction as provided in paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, the Securities Intermediary's jurisdiction is the jurisdiction in which is located the office identified in an account statement as the office serving the Entitlement Holder's account.</P>
              <P>(4) If an agreement between the Securities Intermediary and its Entitlement Holder does not specify a jurisdiction as provided in paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section and an account statement does not identify an office serving the Entitlement Holder's account as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the Securities Intermediary's jurisdiction is the jurisdiction in which is located the chief executive office of the Securities Intermediary.</P>
              <P>(c) Notwithstanding the general rule in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the law (but not the conflict-of-law rules) of the jurisdiction in which the Person creating a security interest is located governs whether and how the security interest may be perfected automatically or by filing a financing statement.</P>
              <P>(d) If the jurisdiction specified in paragraph (b) of this section is a State that has not adopted Revised Article 8, then the law for the matters specified in paragraph (a) of this section shall be the law of that State as though Revised Article 8 had been adopted by that State. For purposes of the application of the matters specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the Federal Reserve Bank maintaining the Securities Account is a clearing corporation, and the Participant's interest in a Bank Book-entry Security is a Security Entitlement.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Creation of Participant's Security Entitlement; security interests.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A Participant's Security Entitlement is created when a Federal Reserve Bank indicates by book entry that a Book-entry consolidated obligation has been credited to a Participant's Securities Account.</P>
              <P>(b) A security interest in a Security Entitlement of a Participant in favor of the United States to secure deposits of public money, including, without limitation, deposits to the Treasury tax and loan accounts, or other security interest in favor of the United States that is required by Federal statute, regulation, or agreement, and that is marked on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank is thereby effected and perfected, and has priority over any other interest in the Securities. Where a security interest in favor of the United States in a Security Entitlement of a Participant is marked on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank, such Federal Reserve Bank may rely, and is protected in relying, exclusively on the order of an authorized representative of the United States directing the transfer of the Security. For purposes of this paragraph (b), an “authorized representative of the United States” is the official designated in the applicable regulations or agreement to which a Federal Reserve Bank is a party, governing the security interest.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) The Banks, FHFA, the Director, the Office of Finance, the United States and the Federal Reserve Banks have no obligation to agree to act on behalf of any Person or to recognize the interest of any transferee of a security interest or other limited interest in a Security Entitlement in favor of any Person except to the extent of any specific requirement of Federal law or regulation or to the extent set forth in any specific agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank on whose books the interest of the Participant is recorded. To the extent required by such law or regulation or set forth in an agreement with a Federal Reserve Bank, or the Federal Reserve Bank Operating Circular, a security interest in a Security Entitlement that is in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank or a Person may be created and perfected by a Federal Reserve Bank marking its books to record the security interest. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a security interest in a Security Entitlement marked on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank shall have priority over any other interest in the Securities.</P>
              <P>(2) In addition to the method provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a security interest in a Security Entitlement, including a security interest in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank, may be perfected by any method by which a security interest may be perfected under applicable law as described in § 1270.12(b) or § 1270.13. The perfection, effect of perfection or non-perfection, and priority of a security interest are governed by that applicable law. A security interest in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank shall be treated as a security interest in favor of a clearing corporation in all respects under that law, including with respect to the effect of perfection and priority of the security interest. A Federal Reserve Bank Operating Circular shall be treated as a rule adopted by a clearing corporation for such purposes.</P>

              <P>(a) Except in the case of a security interest in favor of the United States or a Federal Reserve Bank or otherwise as provided in § 1270.14(c)(1), for the purposes of this part 1270, the Banks, the Office of Finance and the Federal Reserve Banks shall treat the Participant to whose Securities Account an interest in a Book-entry consolidated obligations has been credited as the person exclusively entitled to issue a Transfer Message, to receive interest and other payments with respect thereof and otherwise to exercise all the rights and powers with respect to the Security, notwithstanding any information or notice to the contrary. Neither the Banks, FHFA, the Director, the Office of Finance, the United States, nor the Federal Reserve Banks are liable to a Person asserting or having an Adverse Claim to a Security Entitlement or to Book-entry consolidated obligations in a Participant's Securities Account, including any such claim arising as a result of the transfer <PRTPAGE P="382"/>or disposition of a Book-entry consolidated obligation by a Federal Reserve Bank pursuant to a Transfer Message that the Federal Reserve Bank reasonably believes to be genuine.</P>
              <P>(b) The obligation of the Banks and the Office of Finance to make payments of interest and principal with respect to Book-entry consolidated obligations is discharged at the time payment in the appropriate amount is made as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Interest on Book-entry consolidated obligations is either credited by a Federal Reserve Bank to a Funds Account maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank or otherwise paid as directed by the Participant.</P>
              <P>(2) Book-entry consolidated obligations are paid, either at maturity or upon redemption, in accordance with their terms by a Federal Reserve Bank withdrawing the securities from the Participant's Securities Account in which they are maintained and by either crediting the amount of the proceeds, including both principal and interest, where applicable, to a Funds Account at the Federal Reserve Bank or otherwise paying such principal and interest as directed by the Participant. No action by the Participant is required in connection with the payment of a Book-entry consolidated obligation, unless otherwise expressly required.</P>

              <P>(b) Each Federal Reserve Bank may issue Operating Circulars not inconsistent with this part 1270, governing the details of its handling of Book-entry consolidated obligations, Security Entitlements, and the operation of the Book-entry system under this part 1270.</P>

            <P>Prior to undertaking an NBA, a Bank shall submit a written notice of the proposed NBA that provides a thorough, meaningful, complete, and specific description of the activity such that FHFA will be able to make an informed decision regarding the proposed activity. At a minimum, the notice should include the following information:</P>
            <P>(a) A written opinion of counsel identifying the specific statutory, regulatory, or other legal authorities under which the NBA is authorized and, for submissions raising legal questions of first impression, a reasoned analysis explaining how the cited authorities can be construed to authorize the new activity;</P>
            <P>(b) A full description of the proposed activity, including, when applicable, infographics and definitions of key terms. In addition, the Bank shall indicate whether the proposed activity represents a modification to a previously approved activity in which the Bank is engaged or is an activity that FHFA has approved for any other Banks, if known to the requesting Bank, and if applicable;</P>
            <P>(c) A discussion of why the Bank proposes to engage in the new activity and how the activity supports the housing finance and community investment mission of the Bank;</P>
            <P>(d) A discussion of the risks presented by the new activity and how the Bank will manage these risks; and</P>
            <P>(e) A good faith estimate of the anticipated dollar volume of the activity, and the income and expenses associated with implementing and operating the new activity, over the initial three years of operation.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Review process.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Within 30 business days of the NBA Notice Date, FHFA will take one of the following actions:</P>
            <P>(1) Approve the proposed NBA;</P>
            <P>(2) Deny the proposed activity; or</P>
            <P>(3) Inform the Bank that the activity raises policy, legal, or supervisory issues that require further evaluation. If FHFA fails to take any of those actions by the 30th business day following the NBA Notice Date, the NBA notice shall be deemed to have been approved and the Bank may commence the activity for which the notice was submitted.</P>
            <P>(b) In the case of any notice that FHFA has determined requires further evaluation, FHFA will approve or deny the notice by no later than the 80th business day following the NBA Notice Date. If FHFA fails to approve or deny a NBA notice by that date, and the Director has not extended the review period, the NBA notice shall be deemed to have been approved and the Bank may commence the activity for which the notice was submitted.</P>
            <P>(c) For purposes of calculating the review period, no days will be counted between the date that FHFA has requested additional information from the Bank pursuant to § 1272.5 and the date that the Bank responds to all questions communicated.</P>
            <P>(d) Notwithstanding anything contained in this part, the Director may extend the 80 business-day review period by an additional 60 business days if the Director determines that additional time is required to consider the notice. In such a case, FHFA will inform the Bank of any such extension before the 80th business day following the NBA Notice Date, and the Bank may not commence the NBA until FHFA has affirmatively approved the notice.</P>
            <P>(e) In considering any NBA notice, FHFA will assess whether the proposed activity will be conducted in a safe and sound manner and is consistent with the housing finance, community investment, and liquidity missions of the Banks and the cooperative nature of the Bank System. FHFA may deny an NBA notice or may approve the notice, which approval may be made subject to the Bank's compliance with any conditions that FHFA determines are appropriate to ensure that the Bank conducts the new activity in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with applicable laws or regulations and the Bank's mission.</P>

            <P>FHFA may request additional information from a Bank necessary to issue a determination regarding an NBA. After an initial request for information, FHFA may make subsequent requests for information only to the extent that the information provided by the Bank does not fully respond to a previous request, the subsequent request seeks information needed to clarify the Bank's previous response, or the information provided by the Bank raises new legal, policy, or supervisory issues not evident based on the Bank's NBA notice or responses to previous requests for information.

              <E T="03">A. Related-party transactions.</E> Item 404 of Regulation S-K, 17 CFR 229.404, requires the disclosure of certain relationships and related party transactions. In light of the cooperative nature of the Bank System, related-party transactions are to be expected, and a disclosure of all related-party transactions that meet the threshold would not be meaningful. Instead, the combined annual report will disclose the percent of advances to members an officer of which serves as a Bank director, and list the top ten holders of advances in the Bank System and the top five holders of advances by Bank, with a further disclosure indicating which of these members had an officer that served as a Bank director. The combined financial report will also disclose the top ten holders of advances in the Bank System by holding company, where the advances of all affiliates within a holding company are aggregated.</P>

              <E T="03">B. Biographical information.</E> The biographical information required by Items 401 and 405 of Regulation S-K, 17 CFR 229.401 and 405, will be provided only for members of the OF board of directors, including the Bank presidents, the Chair and Vice-Chair of the board <PRTPAGE P="399"/>of directors of each Bank, and the Chief Executive Officer of OF.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">C. Compensation.</E> The information on compensation required by Item 402 of Regulation S-K, 17 CFR 229.402, will be provided only for Bank presidents and the CEO of the OF.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">D. Submission of matters to a vote of stockholders.</E> No information will be presented on matters submitted to shareholders for a vote, as otherwise required by Item 4 of the SEC's form 10-K, 17 CFR 249.310.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">E. Exhibits.</E> The exhibits required by Item 601 of Regulation S-K, 17 CFR 229.601, are not applicable and will not be provided.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">F. Per share information.</E> The statement of financial information required by Items 301 and 302 of Rule S-K, 17 CFR 229.301 and 302, is inapplicable because the shares of the Banks are subscription capital that trades at par, and the shares expand or contract with changes in member assets or advance levels.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">G. Beneficial ownership.</E> Item 403 of Rule S-K, 17 CFR 229.403, requires the disclosure of security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management. The combined financial report will provide a listing of the ten largest holders of capital stock in the Bank System and a listing of the five largest holders of capital stock by Bank. This listing will also indicate which members had an officer that served as a director of a Bank. The combined financial report will also disclose the top ten holders of Bank stock in the Bank System by holding company, where the Bank stock of all affiliates within a holding company is aggregated.</P>

A Bank shall issue its stock only to its members, or to former members to the extent those institutions are required to maintain a minimum stock investment for existing activities under the capital plan, and only in book-entry form.

              <P>(c) A Bank may require that the minimum investment requirement be satisfied through the purchase of either Class A or Class B stock, or through the purchase of one or more combinations of Class A and Class B stock that have been authorized by the board of directors of the Bank in its capital plan. A Bank, in its discretion, may establish a lower minimum investment to the extent the requirement is met through investment in Class B stock than if the requirement is met through investment in Class A stock, provided that such reduced investment provides sufficient capital for the Bank to remain in compliance with its regulatory capital requirements.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Redemption and repurchase of capital stock.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Redemption.</E> (1) A member or former member may have its stock in a Bank redeemed by providing written notice to the Bank in accordance with this section. A member or former member shall provide six-months written notice for Class A stock and five-years written notice for Class B stock. The notice shall indicate the number of shares of Bank stock that are to be redeemed. No more than one notice of redemption may be outstanding at one time for the same shares of Bank stock. At the expiration of the applicable notice period, the Bank shall pay to the member or other institution holding the stock the stated par value of that stock in cash.</P>
              <P>(2) A member may cancel a notice of redemption by so informing the Bank in writing, and the Bank may impose a fee (to be specified in its capital plan) with respect to any cancellation of a pending notice of redemption. A request by a member (whose membership has not been terminated) to redeem specific shares of stock shall automatically be cancelled if the Bank is prevented from redeeming the member's stock by paragraph (c) of this section within five business days from the end of the expiration of the applicable redemption notice period because the member would fail to maintain its minimum investment in the stock of the Bank after such redemption. The automatic cancellation of a member's redemption request shall have the same effect as if the member had cancelled its notice to redeem stock prior to the end of the redemption notice period, and a Bank may impose a fee (to be specified in its capital plan) for automatic cancellation of a redemption request.</P>
              <P>(3) A Bank shall not be obligated to redeem its capital stock other than in accordance with this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Repurchase.</E> A Bank, in its discretion and without regard to the applicable redemption periods, may repurchase excess stock in accordance with the capital plan of that Bank. A Bank undertaking such a stock repurchase at its own initiative shall provide reasonable notice prior to repurchasing any excess stock, with the period of such notice to be specified in the Bank's capital plan, and shall pay the stated par value of that stock in cash. A member's submission of a notice of intent to withdraw from membership, or its <PRTPAGE P="403"/>termination of membership in any other manner, shall not, in and of itself, cause any Bank stock to be deemed excess stock for purposes of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Limitation.</E> In no event may a Bank redeem or repurchase any stock if, following the redemption or repurchase, the Bank would fail to meet its regulatory capital requirements, or if the member or former member would fail to maintain its minimum investment in the stock of the Bank, as required by § 1277.22.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Other restrictions on the repurchase or redemption of Bank stock.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Capital impairment.</E> A Bank may not redeem or repurchase any capital stock without the prior written approval of the Director if the Director or the board of directors of the Bank has determined that the Bank has incurred or is likely to incur losses that result in or are likely to result in charges against the capital of the Bank. This prohibition shall apply even if a Bank is currently in compliance with its regulatory capital requirements, and shall remain in effect for however long the Bank continues to incur such charges or until the Director determines that such charges are not expected to continue.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Bank discretion to suspend redemption.</E> A Bank, upon the approval of its board of directors, or of a subcommittee thereof, may suspend redemption of stock if the Bank reasonably believes that continued redemption of stock would cause the Bank to fail to meet its regulatory capital requirements, would prevent the Bank from maintaining adequate capital against a potential risk that may not be adequately reflected in its regulatory capital requirements, or would otherwise prevent the Bank from operating in a safe and sound manner. A Bank shall notify the Director in writing within two business days of the date of the decision to suspend the redemption of stock, providing the reasons for the suspension and the Bank's strategies and time frames for addressing the conditions that led to the suspension. The Director may require the Bank to re-institute the redemption of stock. A Bank shall not repurchase any stock without the written permission of the Director during any period in which the Bank has suspended redemption of stock under this paragraph.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Bank capital plans.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Each Bank shall have in place a capital plan approved by the Bank's board of directors and the Director. The capital plan shall include, at a minimum, provisions addressing the following matters:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Minimum investment.</E> (1) The capital plan shall require each member, and if applicable each former member, to purchase and maintain a minimum investment in the capital stock of the Bank and prescribe the manner for calculating the minimum investment, in accordance with § 1277.22.</P>
              <P>(2) The capital plan shall specify the amount and class (or classes) of Bank stock that an institution is required to own in order to become and remain a member of the Bank, and to obtain advances from, or to engage in other business transactions with, the Bank. If a Bank requires that the minimum investment be satisfied through the purchase of one or more combinations of Class A and Class B stock, the authorized combinations of stock shall be specified in the capital plan, which shall afford the option of satisfying the minimum investment through the purchase of any such combination of stock.</P>
              <P>(3) The capital plan shall require the board of directors of the Bank to monitor and, as necessary, to adjust, the minimum investment to ensure that outstanding stock remains sufficient for the Bank to comply with its regulatory capital requirements. The plan shall require each member or, where required by the plan, former member, to comply promptly with any adjusted minimum investment established by the board of directors of the Bank, but may allow a reasonable time to do so and may allow a reduction in outstanding business with the Bank as an alternative to purchasing additional stock.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Classes of capital stock.</E> The capital plan shall specify the class or classes of <PRTPAGE P="404"/>stock (including subclasses, if any) that the Bank will issue, and shall establish the par value, rights, terms, and preferences associated with each class (or subclass) of stock. A Bank may establish preferences relating to, but not limited to, the dividend, voting, or liquidation rights for each class or subclass of Bank stock. Any voting preferences established by the Bank pursuant to § 1261.6 of this chapter shall expressly state the voting rights of each class of stock with regard to the election of Bank directors. The capital plan shall provide that the owners of the Class B stock own the retained earnings, surplus, undivided profits, and equity reserves of the Bank, but shall have no right to receive any portion of those items, except through declaration of a dividend or capital distribution approved by the board of directors or through the liquidation of the Bank.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Dividends.</E> The capital plan shall establish the manner in which the Bank will pay dividends, if any, on each class or subclass of stock, and shall provide that the Bank may not declare or pay any dividends if it is not in compliance with any regulatory capital requirement or if after paying the dividend it would not be in compliance with any regulatory capital requirement.</P>

              <P>(1) <E T="03">The numerator.</E> The numerator of each fraction is the number of AMA-approved mortgage purchases of a Bank in a particular year that finance owner-occupied single-family properties that count toward achievement of a particular housing goal.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">The denominator.</E> The denominator of each fraction is the total number of AMA-approved mortgage purchases of a Bank in a particular year that finance owner-occupied, single-family properties. A separate denominator shall be calculated for purchase money mortgages and for refinancing mortgages.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Missing data or information for the housing goals.</E> (1) When a Bank lacks sufficient data or information to determine whether the purchase of a mortgage originated after 1992 counts toward achievement of a particular housing goal, that mortgage purchase shall be included in the denominator for that housing goal and shall not be included in the numerator for that housing goal.</P>

              <P>(2) Mortgage purchases financing owner-occupied single-family properties shall be evaluated based on the income of the mortgagors and the area median income at the time the mortgage was originated. To determine whether mortgages may be counted under a particular family income level (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> low- or very low-income), the income of the mortgagors is compared to the median income for the area at the time of the mortgage application, using the appropriate percentage factor provided under § 1281.1.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Credit toward multiple goals.</E> A mortgage purchase by a Bank in a particular year shall count toward the achievement of each housing goal for which such purchase qualifies in that year.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Application of median income.</E> For purposes of determining an area's median income under § 1281.1, the area is:</P>
              <P>(1) The metropolitan area, if the property which is the subject of the mortgage is in a metropolitan area; and</P>
              <P>(2) In all other areas, the county in which the property is located, except that where the State nonmetropolitan median income is higher than the county's median income, the area is the State nonmetropolitan area.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Sampling not permitted.</E> Performance under the housing goals for each year shall be based on a complete tabulation of mortgage purchases for that year; a sampling of such purchases is not acceptable.<PRTPAGE P="416"/>
              </P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Newly available data.</E> When a Bank uses data to determine whether a mortgage purchase counts toward achievement of any housing goal, and new data is released after the start of a calendar quarter, the Bank need not use the new data until the start of the following quarter.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Not counted.</E> The following transactions or activities shall not be counted for purposes of the housing goals and shall not be included in the numerator or the denominator in calculating a Bank's performance under the housing goals, even if the transaction or activity would otherwise be counted under paragraph (c) of this section:</P>
              <P>(1) Purchases of non-conventional single-family mortgages;</P>

              <P>(6) Mortgage purchases to the extent they finance any dwelling units that are secondary residences;</P>
              <P>(7) Single-family refinancing mortgages that result from conversion of balloon notes to fully amortizing notes, if a Bank already owns, or has an interest in, the balloon note at the time conversion occurs;</P>
              <P>(8) Purchases of subordinate lien mortgages (second mortgages);</P>
              <P>(9) Purchases of mortgages that were previously counted by a Bank under any current or previous housing goal within the five years immediately preceding the current performance year;</P>
              <P>(10) Purchases of mortgages where the property has not been approved for occupancy; and</P>
              <P>(11) Any combination of factors in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(10) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Other special rules.</E> Subject to FHFA's determination of whether a Bank shall receive full, partial, or no credit for a transaction toward achievement of any of the housing goals as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the transactions and activities identified in this paragraph (c) shall be treated as mortgage purchases as described. A transaction or activity that is covered by more than one paragraph below must satisfy the requirements of each such paragraph. The mortgages from each such transaction or activity shall be included in the denominator in calculating a Bank's performance under the housing goals, and shall be included in the numerator, as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Cooperative housing and condominiums.</E> The purchase by a Bank of a mortgage on a cooperative housing unit (“a share loan”) or a mortgage on a condominium unit shall be treated as a mortgage purchase for purposes of the housing goals.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Seasoned mortgages.</E> The purchase of a seasoned mortgage by a Bank shall be treated as a mortgage purchase for purposes of the housing goals, except where the Bank has already counted the mortgage under any current or previous housing goal within the five years immediately preceding the current performance year.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Purchase of refinancing mortgages.</E> The purchase of a refinancing mortgage by a Bank shall be treated as a mortgage purchase for purposes of the housing goals only if the refinancing is an arms-length transaction that is borrower-driven.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">HOEPA mortgages and mortgages with unacceptable terms or conditions.</E> The purchase by a Bank of HOEPA mortgages and mortgages with unacceptable terms or conditions, as defined in § 1281.1, shall be treated as mortgage purchases for purposes of the housing goals and shall be included in the denominator for each applicable housing goal, but such mortgages shall not be counted in the numerator for any housing goal.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">FHFA review of transactions.</E> FHFA may determine whether and how any transaction or class of transactions shall be counted for purposes of the housing goals. FHFA will notify each <PRTPAGE P="417"/>Bank in writing of any determination regarding the treatment of any transaction or class of transactions under the housing goals.</P>

Neither the numerator nor the denominator shall include Enterprise transactions or activities that are not mortgage purchases as defined by FHFA or that are specifically excluded as ineligible under § 1282.16(b).</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">The numerator.</E> The numerator of each fraction is the number of mortgage purchases of an Enterprise in a particular year that finance owner-occupied single-family properties that count toward achievement of a particular single-family housing goal.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">The denominator.</E> The denominator of each fraction is the total number of mortgage purchases of an Enterprise in a particular year that finance owner-occupied single-family properties. A separate denominator shall be calculated for purchase money mortgages and for refinancing mortgages.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Counting owner-occupied units.</E> (1) Mortgage purchases financing owner-occupied single-family properties shall be evaluated based on the income of the mortgagors and the area median income at the time the mortgage was originated. To determine whether mortgages may be counted under a particular family income level, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> low- or very low-income, the income of the mortgagors is compared to the median income for the area at the time the mortgage was originated, using the appropriate percentage factor provided under § 1282.17.</P>
              <P>(2) Mortgage purchases financing owner-occupied single-family properties for which the income of the mortgagors is not available shall be included in the denominator for the single-family housing goals and subgoal, but such mortgages shall not be counted in the numerator of any single-family housing goal or subgoal.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Counting dwelling units for multifamily housing goal and subgoals.</E> Performance under the multifamily housing goal and subgoals shall be measured by counting the number of dwelling units that count toward achievement of a particular housing goal or subgoal in all multifamily properties financed by mortgages purchased by an Enterprise in a particular year. Only dwelling units that are financed by mortgage purchases, as defined by FHFA, and that are not specifically excluded as ineligible under § 1282.16(b), may be counted for purposes of the multifamily housing goal and subgoals.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Counting rental units</E>—(1) <E T="03">Use of rent.</E> For purposes of counting rental units toward achievement of the multifamily housing goal and subgoals, mortgage purchases financing such units shall be evaluated based on rent and whether the rent is affordable to the income group targeted by the housing goal and subgoals. A rent is affordable if the rent does not exceed the maximum levels as provided in § 1282.19.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Affordability of rents based on housing program requirements.</E> Where a multifamily property is subject to an affordability restriction under a housing program that establishes the maximum permitted income level for a tenant or a prospective tenant or the maximum permitted rent, the affordability of units in the property may be determined based on the maximum permitted income level or maximum permitted rent established under such housing program for those units. If using income, the maximum income level must be no greater than the maximum income level for each goal, adjusted for family or unit size as provided in § 1282.17 or § 1282.18, as appropriate. If using rent, the maximum rent level must be no greater than the maximum rent level for each goal, adjusted for unit size as provided in § 1282.19.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Unoccupied units.</E> Anticipated rent for unoccupied units may be the market rent for similar units in the neighborhood as determined by the lender or appraiser for underwriting purposes. A unit in a multifamily property that is unoccupied because it is being used as a model unit or rental office may be counted for purposes of the multifamily housing goal and subgoals only if an Enterprise determines that the number of such units is reasonable and minimal considering the size of the multifamily property.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Timeliness of information.</E> In evaluating affordability under the multifamily housing goal and subgoals, each Enterprise shall use tenant and rental information as of the time of mortgage acquisition.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Missing data or information for multifamily housing goal and subgoals.</E> (1) <PRTPAGE P="428"/>Rental units for which bedroom data are missing shall be considered efficiencies for purposes of calculating unit affordability.</P>
              <P>(2) When an Enterprise lacks sufficient information to determine whether a rental unit in a property securing a multifamily mortgage purchased by an Enterprise counts toward achievement of the multifamily housing goal or subgoals because rental data is not available, an Enterprise's performance with respect to such unit may be evaluated using estimated affordability information by multiplying the number of rental units with missing affordability information in properties securing multifamily mortgages purchased by the Enterprise in each census tract by the percentage of all rental dwelling units in the respective tracts that would count toward achievement of each goal and subgoal, as determined by FHFA.</P>
              <P>(3) The estimation methodology in paragraph (e)(2) of this section may be used up to a nationwide maximum of 5 percent of the total number of rental units in properties securing multifamily mortgages purchased by the Enterprise in the current year. Multifamily rental units in excess of this maximum, and any units for which estimation information is not available, shall not be counted for purposes of the multifamily housing goal and subgoals.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Credit toward multiple goals.</E> A mortgage purchase (or dwelling unit financed by such purchase) by an Enterprise in a particular year shall count toward the achievement of each housing goal for which such purchase (or dwelling unit) qualifies in that year.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Application of median income.</E> For purposes of determining an area's median income under §§ 1282.17 through 1282.19 and the definitions in § 1282.1, the area is:</P>
              <P>(1) The metropolitan area, if the property which is the subject of the mortgage is in a metropolitan area; and</P>
              <P>(2) In all other areas, the county in which the property is located, except that where the State non-metropolitan median income is higher than the county's median income, the area is the State non-metropolitan area.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Sampling not permitted.</E> Performance under the housing goals for each year shall be based on a complete tabulation of mortgage purchases (or dwelling units) for that year; a sampling of such purchases (or dwelling units) is not acceptable.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Newly available data.</E> When an Enterprise uses data to determine whether a mortgage purchase (or dwelling unit) counts toward achievement of any goal and new data is released after the start of a calendar quarter, the Enterprise need not use the new data until the start of the following quarter.</P>

              <P>(ii) The purchase of a blanket mortgage on a cooperative building or a mortgage on a condominium project shall be treated as a mortgage purchase for purposes of the housing goals. The purchase of a blanket mortgage on a cooperative building shall be counted in the same manner as a mortgage purchase of a multifamily rental property, except that affordability must be determined based solely on the comparable market rents used in underwriting the blanket loan. If the underwriting rents are not available, the loan shall not be treated as a mortgage purchase for purposes of the housing goals.

              <SECTNO>§ 1282.38</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>General requirements for loan purchases.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> This section applies to Enterprise mortgage purchases that may receive duty to serve credit under the loan purchase evaluation area for a particular underserved market in a Plan. Only dwelling units securing a mortgage purchased by the Enterprise in that year and not specifically excluded under § 1282.37(b) and (d) may receive credit.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Counting dwelling units.</E> Performance under the loan purchase evaluation area will be measured by counting dwelling units affordable to very low-, low-, and moderate-income families.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Credit for owner-occupied units.</E>—(1) Mortgage purchases financing owner-occupied single-family properties will be evaluated based on the income of the mortgagor(s) and the area median income at the time the mortgage was originated. To determine whether mortgages may receive duty to serve credit under a particular family income level, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> very low-, low-, or moderate-income, the income of the mortgagor(s) is compared to the median income for the area at the time the mortgage was originated, using the appropriate percentage factor provided under § 1282.17.</P>
              <P>(2) Mortgage purchases financing owner-occupied single-family properties for which the income of the mortgagor(s) is not available will not receive duty to serve credit under the loan purchase evaluation area.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Credit for rental units.</E>—(1) <E T="03">Use of rent.</E> For Enterprise mortgage purchases financing single-family rental <PRTPAGE P="443"/>units and multifamily rental units, affordability is determined based on rent and whether the rent is affordable to the income groups targeted by the duty to serve. A rent is affordable if the rent does not exceed the maximum levels as provided in § 1282.19.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Affordability of rents based on housing program requirements.</E> Where a multifamily property is subject to an affordability restriction under a housing program that establishes the maximum permitted income level for a tenant or a prospective tenant or the maximum permitted rent, the affordability of units in the property may be determined based on the maximum permitted income level or maximum permitted rent established under such housing program for those units. If using income, the maximum income level must be no greater than the maximum income level for each income group targeted by the duty to serve, adjusted for family or unit size as provided in § 1282.17 or § 1282.18, as appropriate. If using rent, the maximum rent level must be no greater than the maximum rent level for each income group targeted by the duty to serve, adjusted for unit size as provided in § 1282.19.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Unoccupied units.</E> Anticipated rent for unoccupied units may be the market rent for similar units in the neighborhood as determined by the lender or appraiser for underwriting purposes. A unit in a multifamily property that is unoccupied because it is being used as a model unit or rental office may receive duty to serve credit only if the Enterprise determines that the number of such units is reasonable and minimal considering the size of the multifamily property.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Timeliness of information.</E> In evaluating affordability for single-family rental properties, an Enterprise must use tenant income and area median income available at the time the mortgage was originated. For multifamily rental properties, the Enterprise must use tenant income and area median income available at the time the mortgage was acquired.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Missing data or information for rental units.</E>—(1) When calculating unit affordability, rental units for which bedroom data are missing will be considered efficiencies.</P>
              <P>(2) When an Enterprise lacks sufficient information to determine whether a rental unit in a single-family or multifamily property securing a mortgage purchased by the Enterprise receives duty to serve credit under the loan purchase evaluation area because rental data are not available, the Enterprise's performance with respect to such unit may be evaluated using estimated affordability information, except that an Enterprise may not estimate affordability of rental units for purposes of receiving extra credit for residential economic diversity activities. The estimated affordability information is calculated by multiplying the number of rental units with missing affordability information in properties securing the mortgages purchased by the Enterprise in each census tract by the percentage of all moderate-income rental dwelling units in the respective tracts, as determined by FHFA.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Affordability of manufactured housing communities.</E> For an Enterprise purchase of a blanket loan on a manufactured housing community, unless otherwise determined by FHFA, the affordability of the homes in the community shall be determined using one of the methodologies in paragraphs (f)(1) or (f)(2) of this section, as applicable, except that for purposes of determining extra credit for residential economic diversity activities or objectives, the methodology in paragraph (f)(2) of this section may not be used.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Methodology for government-, nonprofit- or resident-owned manufactured housing communities.</E> For a manufactured housing community owned by a government unit or instrumentality, a nonprofit organization, or the residents, if laws or regulations governing the affordability of the community, or the community's or ownership entity's founding, chartering, governing, or financing documents, require that a certain number or percentage of the community's homes be affordable consistent with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, then any homes subject to such affordability restriction are treated as affordable.<PRTPAGE P="444"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Census tract methodology for any type of manufactured housing community.</E> For any type of manufactured housing community, except for purposes of determining extra credit for residential economic diversity activities or objectives, the affordability of the homes in the community is determined as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) If the median income of the census tract in which the manufactured housing community is located is less than or equal to the area median income, then all homes in the community are treated as affordable;</P>
              <P>(ii) If the median income of the census tract in which the manufactured housing community is located exceeds the area median income, then the number of homes that are treated as affordable is determined by dividing the area median income by the median income of the census tract in which the community is located and multiplying the resulting ratio by the total number of homes in the community.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Application of median income.</E>—(1) To determine an area's median income under §§ 1282.17 through 1282.19 and the definitions in § 1282.1, the area is:</P>
              <P>(i) The metropolitan area, if the property which is the subject of the mortgage is in a metropolitan area; and</P>
              <P>(ii) In all other areas, the county in which the property is located, except that where the State non-metropolitan median income is higher than the county's median income, the area is the State non-metropolitan area.</P>

              <P>(2) When an Enterprise cannot precisely determine whether a mortgage is on dwelling unit(s) located in one area, the Enterprise must determine the median income for the split area in the manner prescribed by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council for reporting under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (12 U.S.C. 2801 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), if the Enterprise can determine that the mortgage is on dwelling unit(s) located in:</P>
              <P>(i) A census tract; or</P>
              <P>(ii) A census place code.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Newly available data.</E> When an Enterprise uses data to determine whether a dwelling unit may receive duty to serve credit under the loan purchase evaluation area and new data is released after the start of a calendar quarter, the Enterprise need not use the new data until the start of the following quarter.</P>
            </SECTION>

              <SECTNO>§ 1282.39</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Special requirements for loan purchases.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Subject to FHFA's determination of whether an activity or objective will receive duty to serve credit under a particular underserved market, the activities or objectives identified in this section will be treated as mortgage purchases as described and receive credit under the loan purchase evaluation area. An activity or objective that is covered by more than one paragraph below must satisfy the requirements of each such paragraph.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Credit enhancements.</E>—(1) Dwelling units financed under a credit enhancement entered into by an Enterprise will be treated as mortgage purchases only when:</P>
              <P>(i) The Enterprise provides a specific contractual obligation to ensure timely payment of amounts due under a mortgage or mortgages financed by the issuance of housing bonds (such bonds may be issued by any entity, including a State or local housing finance agency); and</P>
              <P>(ii) The Enterprise assumes a credit risk in the transaction substantially equivalent to the risk that would have been assumed by the Enterprise if it had securitized the mortgages financed by such bonds.</P>
              <P>(2) When an Enterprise provides a specific contractual obligation to ensure timely payment of amounts due under any mortgage originally insured by a public purpose mortgage insurance entity or fund, the Enterprise may, on a case-by-case basis, seek approval from the Director for such transactions to receive credit under the loan purchase evaluation area for a particular underserved market.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Risk-sharing.</E> Mortgages purchased under risk-sharing arrangements between an Enterprise and any federal agency under which the Enterprise is responsible for a substantial amount of the risk will be treated as mortgage purchases.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Participations.</E> Participations purchased by an Enterprise will be treated as mortgage purchases only when the <PRTPAGE P="445"/>Enterprise's participation in the mortgage is 50 percent or more.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Cooperative housing and condominiums.</E>—(1) The purchase of a mortgage on a cooperative housing unit (“a share loan”) or a mortgage on a condominium unit will be treated as a mortgage purchase. Such a purchase will receive duty to serve credit in the same manner as a mortgage purchase of single-family owner-occupied units, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> affordability is based on the income of the mortgagor(s).</P>
              <P>(2) The purchase of a blanket mortgage on a cooperative building or a mortgage on a condominium project will be treated as a mortgage purchase. The purchase of a blanket mortgage on a cooperative building will receive duty to serve credit in the same manner as a mortgage purchase of a multifamily rental property, except that affordability must be determined based solely on the comparable market rents used in underwriting the blanket loan. If the underwriting rents are not available, the loan will not be treated as a mortgage purchase. The purchase of a mortgage on a condominium project will receive duty to serve credit in the same manner as a mortgage purchase of a multifamily rental property.</P>
              <P>(3) Where an Enterprise purchases both a blanket mortgage on a cooperative building and share loans for units in the same building, both the mortgage on the cooperative building and the share loans will be treated as mortgage purchases. Where an Enterprise purchases both a mortgage on a condominium project and mortgages on individual dwelling units in the same project, both the mortgage on the condominium project and the mortgages on individual dwelling units will be treated as mortgage purchases.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Seasoned mortgages.</E> An Enterprise's purchase of a seasoned mortgage will be treated as a mortgage purchase.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Purchase of refinancing mortgages.</E> The purchase of a refinancing mortgage by an Enterprise will be treated as a mortgage purchase only if the refinancing is an arms-length transaction that is borrower-driven.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Mortgage revenue bonds.</E> The purchase or guarantee by an Enterprise of a mortgage revenue bond issued by a state or local housing finance agency will be treated as a purchase of the underlying mortgages only to the extent the Enterprise has sufficient information to determine whether the underlying mortgages or mortgage-backed securities serve the income groups targeted by the duty to serve.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Seller dissolution option.</E>—(1) Mortgages acquired through transactions involving seller dissolution options will be treated as mortgage purchases only when:</P>
              <P>(i) The terms of the transaction provide for a lockout period that prohibits the exercise of the dissolution option for at least one year from the date on which the transaction was entered into by the Enterprise and the seller of the mortgages; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The transaction is not dissolved during the one-year minimum lockout period.</P>
              <P>(2) FHFA may grant an exception to the one-year minimum lockout period described in paragraphs (i)(1)(i) and (i)(1)(ii) of this section, in response to a written request from an Enterprise, if FHFA determines that the transaction furthers the purposes of the Enterprise's Charter Act and the Safety and Soundness Act.</P>
              <P>(3) For purposes of paragraph (i) of this section, “seller dissolution option” means an option for a seller of mortgages to the Enterprises to dissolve or otherwise cancel a mortgage purchase agreement or loan sale.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Nature of housing plan.</E> If the Director requires a housing plan, the housing plan must:</P>
              <P>(1) Be feasible;</P>
              <P>(2) Be sufficiently specific to enable the Director to monitor compliance periodically;</P>
              <P>(3) Describe the specific actions that the Enterprise will take:</P>
              <P>(i) To comply with the duty to serve a particular underserved market for the next calendar year; or</P>
              <P>(ii) To make such improvements and changes in its operations as are reasonable in the remainder of the year, if the Director determines that there is a substantial probability that the Enterprise will fail to comply with the duty to serve a particular underserved market in such year; and</P>
              <P>(4) Address any additional matters relevant to the housing plan as required, in writing, by the Director.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Deadline for submission.</E> The Enterprise must submit the housing plan to the Director within 45 days after issuance of a notice requiring the Enterprise to submit a housing plan. The Director may extend the deadline for submission of a housing plan, in writing and for a time certain, to the extent the Director determines an extension is necessary.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Review of housing plans.</E> The Director will review and approve or disapprove housing plans in accordance with 12 U.S.C. 4566(c)(4) and (c)(5).</P>

The Director may extend the deadline if the Director determines that an extension is in the public interest. If the amended housing plan is not acceptable to the Director, the Director may afford the Enterprise 15 days to submit a new housing plan.</P>

              <P>Projects receiving AHP subsidies pursuant to a Bank's General Fund and any Targeted Funds must meet the following eligibility requirements:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Owner-occupied or rental housing.</E> The AHP subsidy shall be used exclusively for:</P>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Rental housing.</E> The purchase, construction, or rehabilitation of a rental project, where at least 20 percent of the units in the project are occupied by and affordable for very low-income households.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Projects that are not occupied.</E> For a rental project that is not occupied at the time the AHP application is submitted to the Bank for approval, a household must have an income meeting the income targeting commitments in the approved AHP application upon initial occupancy of the rental unit.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Projects that are occupied.</E> (A) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, for a rental project involving purchase or rehabilitation that is occupied at the time the AHP application is submitted to the Bank for approval, a household must have an income meeting the income targeting commitments in the approved AHP application at the time of such submission.</P>
              <P>(B) If the project has a relocation plan for current occupants that is approved by one of its federal, state, or local government funders, or a reasonable relocation plan for current occupants that is otherwise approved by the Bank according to standards included in the Bank's AHP Implementation Plan, a household may have an income meeting the income targeting commitments upon initial occupancy of the rental unit after completion of the purchase or rehabilitation.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Project feasibility</E>—(1) <E T="03">Developmental feasibility.</E> The project must be likely to be completed and occupied, based on relevant factors contained in the Bank's project feasibility guidelines, including, but not limited to, the development budget, market analysis, and project sponsor's experience in providing the requested assistance to households.</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Timing of AHP subsidy use.</E> Some or all of the AHP subsidy must be likely to be drawn down by the project or used by the project to procure other financing commitments within 12 months of the date of approval of the application for AHP subsidy funding the project.<PRTPAGE P="466"/>
              </P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Retention agreements</E>—(1) <E T="03">Owner-occupied projects.</E> Each AHP-assisted unit in an owner-occupied project for which the AHP subsidy was used for purchase, or for purchase in conjunction with rehabilitation, of the unit by the AHP-assisted household, is, or is committed to be, subject to a five-year retention agreement described in § 1291.15(a)(7).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Eligible uses.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Eligible uses of AHP subsidy.</E> AHP subsidies shall be used only for:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Owner-occupied housing.</E> The purchase, construction, or rehabilitation of owner-occupied housing.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Rental housing.</E> The purchase, construction, or rehabilitation of rental housing.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Need for AHP subsidy</E>—(i) <E T="03">Review of project development budget.</E> The project's estimated sources of funds shall equal its estimated uses of funds, as reflected in the project's development budget. The difference between the project's sources of funds (excluding AHP subsidy) and uses of funds is the project's need for AHP subsidy, which is the maximum amount of AHP subsidy the project may receive. A Bank, in its discretion, may permit a project's sources of funds to include or exclude the estimated market value of in-kind donations and voluntary professional labor or services (excluding the value of sweat equity), provided that the project's uses of funds also include or exclude, respectively, the value of such estimates.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Cash sources of funds.</E> A project's cash sources of funds shall include any cash contributions by the sponsor, any cash from sources other than the sponsor, and estimates of funds the project sponsor intends to obtain from other sources but which have not yet been committed to the project. In the case of homeownership projects where the sponsor extends permanent financing to the homebuyer, the sponsor's cash contribution shall include the present value of any payments the sponsor is to receive from the buyer, which shall include any cash down payment from the buyer, plus the present value of any purchase note the sponsor holds on the unit. If the note carries a market interest rate commensurate with the credit quality of the buyer, the present value of the note equals the face value of the note. If the note carries an interest rate below the market rate, the present value of the note shall be determined using the market rate to discount the cash flows.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Cash uses.</E> A project's cash uses are the actual outlay of cash needed to pay for materials, labor, and acquisition or other costs of completing the project. Cash costs do not include in-kind donations, voluntary professional labor or services, or sweat equity.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Project costs</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> (A) Taking into consideration the geographic location of the project, development conditions, and other non-financial household or project characteristics, a Bank shall determine that a project's costs, as reflected in the project's development budget, are reasonable, in accordance with the Bank's project cost guidelines.</P>
              <P>(B) For purposes of determining the reasonableness of a developer's fee for a project as a percentage of total development costs, a Bank may, in its discretion, include estimates of the market value of in-kind donations and volunteer professional labor or services (excluding the value of sweat equity) committed to the project as part of the total development costs.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Cost of property and services provided by a member.</E> The purchase price of property or services, as reflected in the project's development budget, sold to the project by a member providing AHP subsidy to the project, or, in the case of property, upon which such member holds a mortgage or lien, may not exceed the market value of such property or services as of the date the <PRTPAGE P="467"/>purchase price was agreed upon. In the case of real estate owned property sold to a project by a member providing AHP subsidy to the project, or property sold to the project upon which the member holds a mortgage or lien, the market value of such property is deemed to be the “as-is” or “as-rehabilitated” value of the property, whichever is appropriate. That value shall be reflected in an independent appraisal of the property performed by a state certified or licensed appraiser, as defined in 12 CFR 564.2(j) and (k), within 6 months prior to the date the Bank disburses AHP subsidy to the project.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Financing costs.</E> The rate of interest, points, fees, and any other charges for all loans that are made for the project in conjunction with the AHP subsidy shall not exceed a reasonable market rate of interest, points, fees, and other charges for loans of similar maturity, terms, and risk.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Counseling costs.</E> Counseling costs, provided:</P>
              <P>(i) Such costs are incurred in connection with counseling of homebuyers who actually purchase an AHP-assisted unit; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The cost of the counseling has not been covered by another funding source, including the member.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Refinancing.</E> Refinancing of an existing single-family or multifamily mortgage loan, provided that the refinancing produces equity proceeds and such equity proceeds up to the amount of the AHP subsidy in the project shall be used only for the purchase, construction, or rehabilitation of housing units meeting the eligibility requirements of this part.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Calculation of AHP subsidy.</E> (i) Where an AHP direct subsidy is provided to a project to write down the interest rate on a loan extended by a member, sponsor, or other party to a project, the net present value of the interest foregone from making the loan below the lender's market interest rate shall be calculated as of the date the application for AHP subsidy is submitted to the Bank, and subject to adjustment under § 1291.30(d).</P>
              <P>(ii) Where an AHP subsidized advance is provided to a project, the net present value of the interest revenue foregone from making a subsidized advance at a rate below the Bank's cost of funds shall be determined as of the earlier of the date of disbursement of the subsidized advance or the date prior to disbursement on which the Bank first manages the funding to support the subsidized advance through its asset/liability management system, or otherwise.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Prohibited uses of AHP subsidy.</E> AHP subsidy may not be used to pay for:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Certain prepayment fees.</E> Prepayment fees imposed by a Bank on a member for a subsidized advance that is prepaid, unless:</P>
              <P>(i) The project is in financial distress that cannot be remedied through a project modification pursuant to § 1291.29;</P>
              <P>(ii) The prepayment of the subsidized advance is necessary to retain the project's affordability and income targeting commitments;</P>
              <P>(iii) Subsequent to such prepayment, the project will continue to comply with the terms of the approved AHP application and the requirements of this part for the duration of the original retention period;</P>
              <P>(iv) Any unused AHP subsidy is returned to the Bank and made available for other AHP projects or households; and</P>
              <P>(v) The amount of AHP subsidy used for the prepayment fee may not exceed the amount of the member's prepayment fee to the Bank;</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Cancellation fees.</E> Cancellation fees and penalties imposed by a Bank on a member for a subsidized advance commitment that is canceled;</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Processing fees.</E> Processing fees charged by members for providing AHP direct subsidies to a project; or</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Reserves and certain expenses.</E> Capitalized reserves, periodic deposits to reserve accounts, operating expenses, or supportive services expenses.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Optional Bank district eligibility requirements.</E> A Bank may require a project receiving AHP subsidies to meet one or more of the following additional eligibility requirements adopted by the Bank's board of directors and included in its AHP Implementation Plan after consultation with its Advisory Council:<PRTPAGE P="468"/>
              </P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">AHP subsidy limits.</E> A requirement that the amount of AHP subsidy requested for the project does not exceed limits established by the Bank as to the maximum amount of AHP subsidy available per member, per project sponsor, per project, or per project unit in a single AHP funding round. A Bank may establish only one maximum subsidy limit per member, per sponsor, per project, or per project unit for the General Fund and for each Targeted Fund, which shall apply to all applicants to the specific Fund, but the maximum subsidy limit per project or per project unit may differ among the Funds; or</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Homebuyer or homeowner counseling.</E> A requirement that a household must complete a homebuyer or homeowner counseling program provided by, or based on one provided by, an organization recognized as experienced in homebuyer or homeowner counseling, respectively.</P>
              <P>(d)<E T="03"> Applications to multiple Funds—subsidy amount.</E> If an application for a project is submitted to more than one Fund at the same time, the application for each Fund must be for the same amount of AHP subsidy.</P>

              <P>(a)(1) <E T="03">Written scoring methodologies.</E> A Bank shall establish a written scoring methodology for its General Fund and for any Targeted Fund setting forth the Bank's scoring point allocations as required in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, scoring criteria adopted pursuant to the requirements of §§ 1291.26 and 1291.27, as applicable, and related definitions. The scoring methodology for each Fund may be different. A Bank shall not adopt scoring points allocations or scoring criteria for its General Fund and any Targeted Funds except as specifically authorized under this paragraph (a)(1) and §§ 1291.26 and 1291.27, respectively.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Scoring points allocations</E>—(i) <E T="03">General Fund.</E> A Bank shall allocate 100 points among all of the scoring criteria adopted by the Bank for its General Fund pursuant to § 1291.26. The scoring criterion for targeting in § 1291.26(d) shall be allocated at least 20 points. The remaining scoring criteria shall be allocated at least 5 points each, except that if a Bank adopts the scoring criterion for home purchase by low- or moderate-income households in § 1291.26(c) as an optional scoring criterion, the Bank may allocate fewer than the full 5 points to it, with the remainder of such points allocated to one or a combination of the other scoring criteria in § 1291.26 other than to the scoring criterion for Bank district priorities in § 1291.26(h). If a Bank adopts a scoring criterion under its Bank district priorities for housing located in the Bank's district, the Bank may not allocate points to the scoring criterion in a way that excludes all out-of-district projects from its General Fund.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Targeted Funds.</E> A Bank shall allocate 100 points among all of the scoring criteria adopted by the Bank for each Targeted Fund pursuant to § 1291.27. A Bank may not allocate more than 50 points to any one scoring criterion for a Targeted Fund.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Fixed-point and variable-point scoring criteria.</E> A Bank shall designate each scoring criterion as either a fixed-point or a variable-point criterion, defined as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Fixed-point scoring criteria are those that cannot be satisfied in varying degrees and are either satisfied or not, with the total number of points allocated to the criterion awarded by the Bank to an application meeting the criterion; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Variable-point criteria are those where there are varying degrees to which an application can satisfy the criteria, with the number of points that may be awarded to an application for meeting the criterion varying, depending on the extent to which the application satisfies the criterion, based on a fixed scale or on a scale relative to the other applications being scored. A Bank shall designate the targeting scoring criterion in § 1291.26(d) as a variable-point criterion.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Satisfaction of scoring criteria.</E> A Bank shall award scoring points to applications to a particular Fund based on satisfaction of the scoring criteria in the Bank's scoring methodology for that Fund.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Scoring tied applications.</E> A Bank shall establish and implement, as necessary, a scoring tie-breaker policy to <PRTPAGE P="469"/>address the case of two or more applications to its General Fund or any Targeted Fund receiving identical scores in the same AHP funding round and there is insufficient AHP subsidy to approve all of the tied applications but sufficient subsidy to approve one of them. A Bank shall meet the following requirements in establishing its scoring tie-breaker policy:</P>
              <P>(1) The Bank shall consult with its Advisory Council prior to adoption of its policy;</P>
              <P>(2) The Bank shall adopt the policy in advance of an AHP funding round and include it in its AHP Implementation Plan;</P>
              <P>(3) The policy shall include the methodology used to break a scoring tie, which may differ for each Fund, and which shall be drawn from the particular Fund's scoring criteria adopted in the Bank's AHP Implementation Plan;</P>
              <P>(4) The scoring tie-breaker methodology shall be reasonable, transparent, verifiable, and impartial;</P>
              <P>(5) The scoring tie-breaker methodology shall be used solely to break a scoring tie and may not affect the eligibility of the applications, including financial feasibility, or their scores and resultant rankings;</P>
              <P>(6) The Bank shall approve a tied application as an alternate pursuant to § 1291.28(b) if the application does not prevail under the scoring tie-breaker methodology, or if the application is tied with another application but requested more subsidy than the amount of AHP funds that remain to be awarded, if the Bank has a written policy to approve alternates for funding under the applicable Fund; and</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Approval of AHP applications.</E> Subject to the requirements in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, a Bank shall approve applications for AHP subsidy under its General Fund and any Targeted Funds that meet all of the applicable AHP eligibility requirements in this part in descending order, starting with the highest scoring application until the total funding amount for the particular AHP funding round, except for any amount insufficient to fund the next highest scoring application, has been approved.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">AHP application alternates.</E> For the General Fund and any Targeted Funds, the Bank also may, in its discretion, approve a specified number, as determined by the Bank, of the next highest scoring applications as alternates eligible for funding, and may approve any tied applications as alternates eligible for funding pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, if any previously committed AHP subsidies become available, pursuant to a written policy on approving alternates for funding established by the Bank and included in the Bank's AHP Implementation Plan. If a Bank has established such a policy for approving alternates for funding and sufficient previously committed AHP subsidies become available within one year of application approval, the Bank shall approve the designated alternates for funding within that one-year period.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Tied applications.</E> (1) Where two or more applications to a General Fund or Targeted Fund have identical scores in the same AHP funding round and there is insufficient AHP subsidy to approve all of the tied applications but sufficient subsidy to approve one of them, a Bank shall approve the tied application that prevails under the Bank's scoring tie-breaker methodology in its policy adopted pursuant to § 1291.25(c).</P>
              <P>(2) A tied application that does not prevail under the Bank's scoring tie-breaker methodology, or is tied with another application but requested more subsidy than the amount of AHP funds that remain to be awarded under the Fund, shall be approved as an alternate for funding if the Bank has a written policy to approve alternates for funding under the Fund.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Modification procedure.</E> If, prior to or after final disbursement of funds to a project from all funding sources, in order to remedy noncompliance or receive additional subsidy, there is or will be a change in the project that would change the score that the project application received in the AHP funding round in which it was originally scored and approved, had the changed facts been operative at that time, a Bank shall approve in writing a request for a modification to the terms of the approved application, provided that:</P>
              <P>(1) The Bank first requests that the project sponsor or owner make a reasonable effort to cure any noncompliance within a reasonable period of time, and the noncompliance could not be cured within a reasonable period of time;</P>
              <P>(2) The project, incorporating any such changes, would meet the eligibility requirements of this part;</P>
              <P>(3) The application, as reflective of such changes, continues to score high enough to have been approved in the AHP funding round in which the application was originally scored and approved by the Bank, which is as high as the lowest ranking alternate approved for funding by the Bank if the Bank has a written policy to approve alternates for funding; and</P>
              <P>(4) There is good cause for the modification, which may not be solely remediation of noncompliance, and the analysis and justification for the modification, including why a cure of noncompliance was not successful or attempted, are documented by the Bank in writing.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">AHP subsidy increases; no delegation</E>—(1) <E T="03">AHP subsidy increases.</E> A Bank's board of directors may, in its discretion, approve or disapprove requests for modifications involving an increase in AHP subsidy in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">No delegation.</E> The authority to approve or disapprove requests for modifications involving an increase in AHP subsidy shall not be delegated by the Bank's board of directors to Bank officers or other Bank employees.</P>

              <P>(2) If an institution with an approved application for AHP subsidy loses its membership in a Bank, the Bank may disburse AHP subsidies to a member of such Bank to which the institution has transferred its obligations under the approved AHP application, or the Bank may disburse AHP subsidies through another Bank to a member of that Bank that has assumed the institution's obligations under the approved AHP application.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Progress towards use of AHP subsidy.</E> A Bank shall establish and implement policies, including time limits, for determining whether progress is being made towards draw-down and use of AHP subsidies by approved projects, and whether to cancel AHP application approvals for lack of such progress. If a Bank cancels any AHP application approvals due to lack of such progress, the Bank shall make the AHP subsidies available for other AHP-eligible projects or households.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Compliance upon disbursement of AHP subsidies.</E> A Bank shall establish and implement policies for determining, prior to its initial disbursement of AHP subsidy for an approved project, and prior to each subsequent disbursement, that the project meets the eligibility requirements of this part and all obligations committed to in the approved AHP application. If a Bank cancels any AHP application approvals due to noncompliance with eligibility requirements of this part, the Bank shall make the AHP subsidies available for other AHP-eligible projects or households.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Changes in approved AHP subsidy amount where a direct subsidy is used to write down prior to closing the principal amount or interest rate on a loan.</E> If a member is approved to receive AHP direct subsidy to write down prior to <PRTPAGE P="473"/>closing the principal amount or the interest rate on a loan to a project, and the amount of AHP subsidy required to maintain the debt service cost for the loan decreases from the amount of AHP subsidy initially approved by the Bank due to a decrease in market interest rates between the time of approval and the time the lender commits to the interest rate to finance the project, the Bank shall reduce the AHP subsidy amount accordingly. If market interest rates rise between the time of approval and the time the lender commits to the interest rate to finance the project, the Bank, in its discretion, may increase the AHP subsidy amount accordingly.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">AHP outlay adjustment.</E> If a Bank reduces the amount of AHP subsidy approved for a project, the amount of such reduction shall be returned to the Bank's AHP fund. If a Bank increases the amount of AHP subsidy approved for a project, the amount of such increase shall be drawn first from any currently uncommitted or repaid AHP subsidies and then from the Bank's required AHP contribution for the next year.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Project sponsor notification of re-use of repaid AHP direct subsidy.</E> Prior to disbursement by a project sponsor of AHP direct subsidy repaid to and retained by such project sponsor pursuant to a subsidy re-use program authorized by the Bank under § 1291.64(b), the project sponsor shall provide written notice to the member and the Bank of its intent to disburse the repaid AHP subsidy to a household satisfying the requirements of this part and the commitments made in the approved AHP application.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Review of application.</E> A Bank shall review the application for AHP subsidy to determine that the criteria for the initial lending of the subsidy, the specific proposed project if applicable, and the criteria for subsequent lending of subsidy principal and interest repayments, meet the eligibility requirements of § 1291.23, and shall evaluate the criteria for the initial lending of the subsidy and the specific proposed project, if applicable, pursuant to the scoring methodology established by the Bank pursuant to §§ 1291.25, 1291.26, and 1291.27, as applicable.</P>

              <P>(2) If an owner-occupied unit or project funded under this paragraph (c) <PRTPAGE P="474"/>is in noncompliance with the commitments in the approved AHP application, or is sold or refinanced prior to the end of the applicable AHP retention period, the required amount of AHP subsidy shall be repaid to the revolving loan fund in accordance with §§ 1291.15(a)(7), 1291.15(a)(8), and 1291.60, and the revolving loan fund shall re-lend such repaid subsidy, excluding the amounts of AHP subsidy principal already repaid to the revolving loan fund, to another owner-occupied unit or project meeting the initial lending requirements of this paragraph (c) for the remainder of the retention period.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Subsequent lending of AHP subsidy principal and interest repayments.</E> (1) AHP subsidy principal and interest repayments received by the revolving loan fund from the initial lending of the AHP direct subsidy shall be re-lent by the revolving loan fund in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph (d), except that the revolving loan fund, in its discretion, may provide part or all of such repayments as nonrepayable grants to eligible projects in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph (d).</P>

Both initial purchases of loans for the AHP loan pool and subsequent purchases of loans to substitute for repaid loans in the pool shall be made pursuant to the terms of such forward commitment and subject to time limits on the use of the AHP subsidy as specified by the Bank in its AHP Implementation Plan and the Bank's agreement with the loan pool sponsor, which shall not exceed one year from the date of approval of the AHP application.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Remedial actions for project noncompliance.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Scope.</E> This section sets forth the requirements applicable to the Banks in the event of noncompliance by an AHP-assisted project with the commitments made in its application for AHP subsidies and the requirements of this part, including any use of AHP subsidy by the project sponsor or owner for purposes other than those committed to in the AHP application. This section does not apply to individual AHP-assisted households or to the sale or refinancing by such households of their homes.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Elimination of project noncompliance</E>—(1) <E T="03">Cure.</E> In the event of project noncompliance, the Bank shall request that the project sponsor or owner make a reasonable effort to cure the noncompliance within a reasonable period of time. If the noncompliance cannot be cured within a reasonable period of time, the requirements for project modification in paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall apply. If the noncompliance is cured within a reasonable period of time, the Bank shall not require the project sponsor or owner to repay AHP subsidy to the Bank.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Project modification.</E> If the project sponsor or owner cannot cure the noncompliance within a reasonable period of time, the Bank shall determine whether the circumstances of the noncompliance can be eliminated through a modification of the terms of the AHP application pursuant to § 1291.29. When the circumstances of the noncompliance can be eliminated through a modification, the Bank shall approve the modification and shall not require the project sponsor or owner to repay AHP subsidy to the Bank.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Reasonable collection efforts</E>—(1) <E T="03">Demand for repayment.</E> If the circumstances of a project's noncompliance cannot be eliminated through a cure or modification, the Bank, or the member if delegated the responsibility, shall make a demand on the project sponsor or owner for repayment of the full amount of the AHP subsidy not used in compliance with the commitments in the AHP application or the requirements of this part (plus interest, if appropriate). If the noncompliance is occupancy by households with incomes exceeding the income-targeting commitments in the AHP application, the amount of AHP subsidy due is calculated based on the number of units in noncompliance, the length of the noncompliance, and the portion of the AHP subsidy attributable to the noncompliant units.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Settlement.</E> (i) If the demand for repayment of the full amount due is unsuccessful, the Bank, or the member if delegated the responsibility and in consultation with the Bank, shall make reasonable efforts to collect the subsidy from the project sponsor or owner, which may include settlement for less than the full amount due, taking into account factors such as the financial capacity of the project sponsor or owner, assets securing the AHP subsidy, other assets of the project sponsor or owner, the degree of culpability of the project sponsor or owner, and <PRTPAGE P="480"/>the extent of the Bank's or member's collection efforts.</P>
              <P>(ii) The settlement with the project sponsor or owner must be supported by sufficient documentation showing that the sum agreed to be repaid under the settlement is reasonably justified, based on the facts and circumstances of the noncompliance, including any factors in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section that were considered in reaching the settlement.</P>

Generally, this section divides agency records into three major categories and provides methods by which each category of records is to be made available to the public. The three major categories of records are as follows:</P>
          <P>(1) Information required to be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> (see § 1301.3);</P>
          <P>(2) Information required to be made available for public inspection in an electronic format or, in the alternative, to be published and offered for sale (see § 1301.4); and</P>
          <P>(3) Information required to be made available to any member of the public upon specific request (see §§ 1301.5 through 1301.12).</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Right of access.</E> Subject to the exemptions and exclusions set forth in the FOIA (5 U.S.C. 552(b) and (c)), and the regulations set forth in this subpart, any person shall be afforded access to records.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Exemptions.</E> (1) The disclosure requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552(a) do not apply to certain records which are exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552(b); nor do the disclosure requirements apply to certain records which are excluded under 5 U.S.C. 552(c).</P>
          <P>(2) The Council shall withhold records or information under the FOIA only when it reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by a FOIA exemption or when disclosure is prohibited by law. Whenever the Council determines that full disclosure of a requested record is not possible, the Council shall consider whether partial disclosure is possible and shall take reasonable steps to segregate and release nonexempt information. Nothing in this paragraph requires disclosure of information that is otherwise exempted from disclosure under 12 U.S.C. 552(b)(3).</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Subject to the application of the FOIA exemptions and exclusions (5 U.S.C. 552(b) and (c)), the Council shall, in conformance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2), make available for public inspection in an electronic format, or, in the alternative, promptly publish and offer for sale:</P>
          <P>(1) Final opinions, including concurring and dissenting opinions, and orders, made in the adjudication of cases;</P>

          <P>(2) Those statements of policy and interpretations which have been adopted by the Council but which are not published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>;</P>
          <P>(3) Its administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect a member of the public;</P>
          <P>(4) Copies of all records, regardless of form or format, that have been released previously to any person under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3) and §§ 1301.5 through 1301.12, and that the Council determines have become or are likely to become the subject of subsequent requests for substantially the same records. When the Council receives three (3) or more requests for substantially the same records, then the Council shall place those requests in front of any existing processing backlog and make the released records available in the Council's public reading room and in the electronic reading room on the Council's Web site.</P>
          <P>(5) A general index of the records referred to in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Information made available online.</E> For records required to be made available for public inspection in an electronic format pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2) and paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section, the Council shall make such records available on its Web site as soon as practicable but in any case no later than one year after such records are created.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Redaction.</E> Based upon applicable exemptions in 5 U.S.C. 552(b), the Council may redact certain information contained in any matter described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section before making such information available for inspection or publishing it. The justification for the redaction shall be explained in writing, and the extent of such redaction shall be indicated on the portion of the record which is made available or published, unless including that indication would harm an interest protected by the exemption in 5 U.S.C. 552(b) under which the redaction is made. If technically feasible, the extent of the redaction shall be indicated at the place in the record where the redaction was made.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Public reading room.</E> The Council shall make available for public inspection in an electronic format, in a reading room or otherwise, the material described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section. Fees for duplication shall be charged in accordance with § 1301.12. The location of the Council's reading room is the Department of the Treasury's Library. The Library is located in the Freedman's Bank Building (formerly the Treasury Annex), Room 1020, 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20220. For building security purposes, visitors are required to make an appointment by calling (202) 622-0990.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Indices.</E> (1) The Council shall maintain and make available for public inspection in an electronic format current indices identifying any material described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section. In addition, the Council shall promptly publish, quarterly or more frequently, and distribute (by sale or otherwise) copies of each index or supplement unless the Council determines by order published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> that the publication would be unnecessary and impractical, in which case the Council shall nonetheless provide copies of the index on request at a cost not to exceed the direct cost of duplication.<PRTPAGE P="491"/>

          <SUBJECT>Requests for Council records.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Except for records made available under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(1) and (a)(2) and subject to the application of the FOIA exemptions and exclusions (5 U.S.C. 552(b) and (c)), the Council shall promptly make its records available to any person pursuant to a request that conforms to the rules and procedures of this section.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Form and content of request.</E> A request for records of the Council shall be made as follows:</P>
          <P>(1) The request for records shall be made in writing and submitted by mail or via the Internet and should state, both in the request itself and on any envelope that encloses it, that it comprises a FOIA request. A request that does not explicitly state that it is a FOIA request, but clearly indicates or implies that it is a request for records, may also be processed under the FOIA.</P>
          <P>(2) If a request is sent by mail, it shall be addressed and submitted as follows: FOIA Request—Financial Stability Oversight Council, U.S. Department of the Treasury, 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Washington DC 20220. If a request is made via the Internet, it shall be submitted as set forth on the Council's Web site.</P>
          <P>(3) In order to ensure the Council's ability to respond in a timely manner, a FOIA request must describe the records that the requester seeks in sufficient detail to enable Council personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. Whenever possible, the request must include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, and subject matter of the record. If known, the requester must include any file designations or descriptions for the records requested. In general, a requester is encouraged to provide more specific information about the records or types of records sought to increase the likelihood that responsive records can be located.</P>
          <P>(4) The request shall include the name of and contact information for the requester, including a mailing address, telephone number, and, if available, an email address at which the Council may contact the requester regarding the request.</P>
          <P>(5) For the purpose of determining any fees that may apply to processing a request, a requester shall indicate in the request whether the requester is a commercial user, an educational institution, non-commercial scientific institution, representative of the news media, or “other” requester, as those terms are defined in § 1301.12(c), or in the alternative, state how the records released will be used. The Council shall use this information solely for the purpose of determining the appropriate fee category that applies to the requester and shall not use this information to determine whether to disclose a record in response to the request.</P>
          <P>(6) If a requester seeks a waiver or reduction of fees associated with processing a request, then the request shall include a statement to that effect, pursuant to § 1301.12(f). Any request that does not seek a waiver or reduction of fees shall constitute an agreement of the requester to pay any and all fees (of up to $25) that may apply to the request, unless or until a request for waiver is sought and granted. The requester also may specify in the request an upper limit (of not less than $25) that the requester is willing to pay to process the request.</P>
          <P>(i) Any request for waiver or reduction of fees should be filed together with or as part of the FOIA request, or at a later time prior to the Council incurring costs to process the request.</P>
          <P>(ii) A waiver request submitted after the Council incurs costs will be considered in accordance with § 1301.12(f); however, the requester must agree in writing to pay the fees already incurred if the waiver is denied.</P>
          <P>(7) If a requester seeks expedited processing of a request, then the request must include a statement to that effect as is required by § 1301.7(c).</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Request receipt; effect of request deficiencies.</E> The Council shall deem itself to have received a request on the date that it receives a complete request containing the information required by paragraph (b) of this section. The Council need not accept a request, process a request, or be bound by any <PRTPAGE P="492"/>deadlines in this subpart for processing a request that fails materially to conform to the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. If the Council determines that it cannot process a request because the request is deficient, then the Council shall return it to the requester and advise the requester in what respect the request is deficient. The requester may then resubmit the request, which the Council shall treat as a new request. A determination by the Council that a request is deficient in any respect is not a denial of a request for records, and such determinations are not subject to appeal.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Processing of request containing technical deficiency.</E> Notwithstanding paragraph (c) of this section, the Council shall not reject a request solely due to one or more technical deficiencies contained in the request. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term “technical deficiency” means an error or omission with respect to an item of information required by paragraph (b) of this section which, by itself, does not prevent that part of the request from conforming to the applicable requirement, and includes without limitation a non-material error relating to the contact information for the requester, or similar error or omission regarding the date, title or name, author, recipient, or subject matter of the record requested.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Responsibility for responding to requests for Council records.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> In determining which records are responsive to a request, the Council ordinarily will include only information contained in records that the Council maintains, or are in its possession and control, as of the date the Council begins its search for responsive records. If any other date is used, the Council shall inform the requester of that date.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Authority to grant or deny requests.</E> The records officer shall be authorized to make an initial determination to grant or deny, in whole or in part, a request for a record.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Referrals.</E> When the Council receives a request for a record or any portion of a record in its possession that originated with another agency, including but not limited to a constituent agency of the Council, it shall:</P>
          <P>(1) In the case of a record originated by a federal agency subject to the FOIA, refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that record to the originating agency to determine whether to disclose it; and</P>
          <P>(2) In the case of a record originated by a state agency, respond to the request after giving notice to the originating state agency and a reasonable opportunity to provide input or to assert any applicable privileges.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Notice of referral.</E> Whenever the Council refers all or any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another agency, the Council shall notify the requester of the referral and inform the requester of the name of each agency to which the request has been referred and of the part of the request that has been referred.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Timing of responses to requests for Council records.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Except as set forth in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, the Council shall respond to requests according to their order of receipt.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Multitrack processing.</E> (1) The Council may establish tracks to process separately simple and complex requests. The Council may assign a request to the simple or complex track based on the amount of work and/or time needed to process the request. The Council shall process requests in each track according to the order of their receipt.</P>
          <P>(2) The Council may provide a requester in its complex track with an opportunity to limit the scope of the request to qualify for faster processing within the specified limits of the simple track(s).</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Requests for expedited processing.</E> (1) The Council shall respond to a request out of order and on an expedited basis whenever a requester demonstrates a compelling need for expedited processing in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph (c).</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Form and content of a request for expedited processing.</E> A request for expedited processing shall be made as follows:<PRTPAGE P="493"/>
          </P>
          <P>(i) A request for expedited processing shall be made in writing or via the Internet and submitted as part of the initial request for records. When a request for records includes a request for expedited processing, both the envelope and the request itself must be clearly marked “Expedited Processing Requested.” A request for expedited processing that is not clearly so marked, but satisfies the requirements in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section, may nevertheless be granted.</P>
          <P>(ii) A request for expedited processing shall contain a statement that demonstrates a compelling need for the requester to obtain expedited processing of the requested records. A “compelling need” may be established under the standard in either paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section by demonstrating that:</P>
          <P>(A) Failure to obtain the requested records on an expedited basis could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual. The requester shall fully explain the circumstances warranting such an expected threat so that the Council may make a reasoned determination that a delay in obtaining the requested records would pose such a threat; or</P>
          <P>(B) With respect to a request made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information, urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity. A person “primarily engaged in disseminating information” does not include individuals who are engaged only incidentally in the dissemination of information. The standard of “urgency to inform” requires that the records requested pertain to a matter of current exigency to the American general public and that delaying a response to a request for records would compromise a significant recognized interest to and throughout the American general public. The requester must adequately explain the matter or activity and why the records sought are necessary to be provided on an expedited basis.</P>
          <P>(iii) The requester shall certify the written statement that purports to demonstrate a compelling need for expedited processing to be true and correct to the best of the requester's knowledge and belief. The certification must be in the form prescribed by 28 U.S.C. 1746: “I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief. Executed on [date].”</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Determinations of requests for expedited processing.</E> Within ten (10) calendar days of its receipt of a request for expedited processing, the Council shall decide whether to grant the request and shall notify the requester of the determination in writing.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Effect of granting expedited processing.</E> If the Council grants a request for expedited processing, then the Council shall give the expedited request priority over non-expedited requests and shall process the expedited request as soon as practicable. The Council may assign expedited requests to their own simple and complex processing tracks based upon the amount of work and/or time needed to process them. Within each such track, an expedited request shall be processed in the order of its receipt.</P>
          <P>(5) <E T="03">Appeals of denials of requests for expedited processing.</E> If the Council denies a request for expedited processing, then the requester shall have the right to submit an appeal of the denial determination in accordance with § 1301.11. The Council shall communicate this appeal right as part of its written notification to the requester denying expedited processing. The requester shall clearly mark its appeal request and any envelope that encloses it with the words “Appeal for Expedited Processing.”</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Time period for responding to requests for records.</E> Ordinarily, the Council shall have twenty (20) days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) from when a request that satisfies the requirements of § 1301.5(b) is received by the Council to determine whether to grant or deny a request for records. The twenty-day time period set forth in this paragraph shall not be tolled by the Council except that the Council may:</P>

          <P>(1) Make one reasonable demand to the requester for clarifying information about the request and toll the twenty-day time period while it awaits the clarifying information; or<PRTPAGE P="494"/>
          </P>
          <P>(2) Toll the twenty-day time period while awaiting receipt of the requester's response to the Council's request for clarification regarding the assessment of fees.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Unusual circumstances</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, if the Council determines that, due to unusual circumstances, it cannot respond either to a request within the time period set forth in paragraph (d) of this section or to an appeal within the time period set forth in § 1301.11, the Council may extend the applicable time periods by informing the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances and of the date by which the Council expects to complete its processing of the request or appeal. Any extension or extensions of time shall not cumulatively total more than ten (10) days (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays).</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Additional time.</E> If the Council determines that it needs additional time beyond a ten-day extension to process the request or appeal, then the Council shall notify the requester and provide the requester with an opportunity to limit the scope of the request or appeal or to arrange for an alternative time frame for processing the request or appeal or a modified request or appeal. The requester shall retain the right to define the desired scope of the request or appeal, as long as it meets the requirements contained in this part. To aid the requester, the Council shall make available its FOIA Public Liaison, who shall assist in defining the desired scope of the request, and shall notify the requester of the right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services.</P>
          <P>(3) As used in this paragraph (e), “unusual circumstances” means, but only to the extent reasonably necessary to the proper processing of the particular requests:</P>
          <P>(i) The need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the office processing the request;</P>
          <P>(ii) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in a single request; or</P>
          <P>(iii) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request, or among two or more components or component offices having substantial subject matter interest therein.</P>
          <P>(4) Where the Council reasonably believes that multiple requests submitted by a requester, or by a group of requesters acting in concert, constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances, and the requests involve clearly related matters, they may be aggregated. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters will not be aggregated. The Council may disaggregate and treat as separate requests a single request that has multiple unrelated components. The Council shall notify the requester if a request is disaggregated.</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">Acknowledgement of requests.</E> Upon receipt of a request that meets the requirements of § 1301.5(b), the Council ordinarily shall assign to the request a unique tracking number and shall send an acknowledgement letter or email to the requester that contains the following information:</P>
          <P>(1) A brief description of the request;</P>
          <P>(2) The applicable request tracking number;</P>
          <P>(3) The date of receipt of the request, as determined in accordance with § 1301.5(c); and</P>
          <P>(4) A confirmation, with respect to any fees that may apply to the request pursuant to § 1301.12, that the requester has sought a waiver or reduction in such fees, has agreed to pay any and all applicable fees, or has specified an upper limit (of not less than $25) that the requester is willing to pay in fees to process the request.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Initial determination to grant or deny a request</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> The Council records officer (as designated in § 1301.6(b)) shall make initial determinations to grant or to deny in whole or in part requests for records.<PRTPAGE P="495"/>
          </P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Granting of request.</E> If the request is granted in full or in part, the Council shall provide the requester with a copy of the releasable records, and shall do so in the format specified by the requester to the extent that the records are readily producible by the Council in the requested format. The Council also shall send the requester a statement of the applicable fees, broken down by search, review and duplication fees, either at the time of the determination or shortly thereafter. The Council shall also advise the requester of the right to seek assistance from the FOIA Public Liaison.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Denial of requests.</E> If the Council determines that the request for records should be denied in whole or in part, the Council shall notify the requester in writing. The notification shall:</P>
          <P>(i) State the exemptions relied on in not granting the request;</P>
          <P>(ii) If technically feasible, indicate the volume of information redacted (including the number of pages withheld in part and in full) and the exemptions under which the redaction is made at the place in the record where such redaction is made (unless providing such indication would harm an interest protected by the exemption relied upon to deny such material);</P>
          <P>(iii) Set forth the name and title or position of the responsible official;</P>
          <P>(iv) Advise the requester of the right to administrative appeal in accordance with § 1301.11 and specify the official or office to which such appeal shall be submitted; and</P>
          <P>(v) Advise the requester of the right to seek assistance from the FOIA Public Liaison or seek dispute resolution services offered by the Office of Government Information Services.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">No records found.</E> If it is determined, after an adequate search for records by the responsible official or his/her delegate, that no records could be located, the Council shall so notify the requester in writing. The notification letter shall advise the requester of the right to seek assistance from the FOIA Public Liaison, seek dispute resolution services offered by the Office of Government Information Services, and administratively appeal the Council's determination that no records could be located (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> to challenge the adequacy of the Council's search for responsive records) in accordance with § 1301.11. The response shall specify the official to whom the appeal shall be submitted for review.</P>

Whenever a record contains information that has been derivatively classified by the Council because it contains information classified by another agency, the Council shall refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that information to the agency that classified the underlying information or shall consult with that agency prior to processing the record for disclosure or withholding.</P>

          <P>(2) <E T="03">Submitter</E> means any person or entity from whom the Council obtains business information, directly or indirectly. The term includes corporations, state, local, and tribal governments, and foreign governments.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Exemption 4</E> means Exemption 4 of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4).</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Designation of business information.</E> A submitter of business information shall use good-faith efforts to designate, by appropriate markings, either at the time of submission or at a reasonable time thereafter, any portions of its submission that it considers to be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4. These designations will expire ten (10) years after the date of the submission unless the submitter on his or her own initiative requests otherwise, and provides justification for, a longer designation period.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Notice to submitters.</E> The Council shall provide a submitter with prompt written notice of receipt of a request or appeal encompassing the business information of the submitter whenever required in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section. Such written notice shall either describe the exact nature of the business information requested or provide copies of the records or portions of records containing the business information. When a voluminous number of submitters must be notified, the Council may post or publish such notice in a place reasonably likely to accomplish such notification.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">When notice is required.</E> The Council shall provide a submitter with notice of receipt of a request or appeal whenever:</P>
          <P>(1) The information has been designated in good faith by the submitter as information considered protected from disclosure under Exemption 4; or</P>
          <P>(2) The Council has reason to believe that the information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 because disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm to the submitter.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Opportunity to object to disclosure.</E> (1) Through the notice described in paragraph (d) of this section, the Council shall notify the submitter in writing that the submitter shall have ten (10) days from the date of the notice (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) to provide the Council with a detailed statement of any objection to disclosure. Such statement shall specify all grounds for withholding any of the information under Exemption 4, including a statement of why the information is considered to be a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential. In the event that the submitter fails to respond to the notice within the time specified, the submitter shall be considered to have no objection to disclosure of the information. Information provided by a submitter pursuant to this paragraph (f) may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.</P>
          <P>(2) When notice is given to a submitter under this section, the Council shall advise the requester that such notice has been given to the submitter. The requester shall be further advised that a delay in responding to the request may be considered a denial of access to records and that the requester may proceed with an administrative appeal or seek judicial review, if appropriate. However, the Council shall invite the requester to agree to an extension of time so that the Council may review the submitter's objection to disclosure.</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Notice of intent to disclose.</E> The Council shall consider carefully a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure prior to determining whether to disclose business information responsive to the request. If the Council decides to disclose business information over the objection of a submitter, the Council shall provide the submitter with a written notice which shall include:</P>
          <P>(1) A statement of the reasons for which the submitter's disclosure objections were not sustained;</P>
          <P>(2) A description of the business information to be disclosed; and</P>

          <P>(3) A specified disclosure date which is not less than ten (10) days (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the notice of the final decision to release the requested information has been provided to the submitter. Except as otherwise prohibited <PRTPAGE P="497"/>by law, notice of the final decision to release the requested information shall be forwarded to the requester at the same time.</P>
          <P>(h) <E T="03">Notice of FOIA lawsuit.</E> Whenever a requester brings suit seeking to compel disclosure of business information covered in paragraph (c) of this section, the Council shall promptly notify the submitter.</P>
          <P>(i) <E T="03">Exception to notice requirement.</E> The notice requirements of this section shall not apply if:</P>
          <P>(1) The Council determines that the information shall not be disclosed;</P>
          <P>(2) The information lawfully has been published or otherwise made available to the public; or</P>
          <P>(3) Disclosure of the information is required by statute (other than the FOIA) or by a regulation issued in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12600 (3 CFR, 1987 Comp., p. 235).</P>

          <P>(e) <E T="03">Determinations to grant or deny administrative appeals.</E> The Chairperson of the Council or his/her designee is authorized to and shall decide whether to affirm or reverse the initial determination (in whole or in part), and shall notify the requester of this decision in writing within twenty (20) days (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the date of receipt of the appeal, unless extended pursuant to § 1301.7(e).</P>
          <P>(1) If it is decided that the appeal is to be denied (in whole or in part) the requester shall be—</P>

          <P>(v) Provided with notification that mediation services may be available to the requester as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation through the Office of Government Information Services in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(h)(3).</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 1301.12</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Fees for processing requests for Council records.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> The Council shall charge the requester for processing a request under the FOIA in the amounts and for the services set forth in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, except if a waiver or reduction of fees is granted under paragraph (f) of this section, or if, pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the failure of the Council to comply with certain time limits precludes it from assessing certain fees. No fees shall be charged if the amount of fees incurred in processing the request is below $25.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Fees chargeable for specific services.</E> The fees for services performed by the Council shall be imposed and collected as set forth in this paragraph (b).</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Duplicating records.</E> The Council shall charge a requester fees for the cost of copying records as follows:</P>
          <P>(i) $0.08 per page, up to 8<FR>1/2</FR> x 14″, made by photocopy or similar process.</P>
          <P>(ii) Photographs, films, and other materials—actual cost of duplication.</P>
          <P>(iii) Other types of duplication services not mentioned above—actual cost.</P>
          <P>(iv) Material provided to a private contractor for copying shall be charged to the requester at the actual cost charged by the private contractor.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Search services.</E> The Council shall charge a requester for all time spent by its employees searching for records that are responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line identification of responsive information within records, even if no responsive records are found. The Council shall charge the requester fees for search time as follows:</P>
          <P>(i) <E T="03">Searches for other than electronic records.</E> The Council shall charge for search time at the salary rate(s) (basic pay plus sixteen (16) percent) of the employee(s) who conduct the search. This charge shall also include transportation of employees and records at actual cost. Fees may be charged for search time even if the search does not yield any responsive records, or if records are exempt from disclosure.</P>
          <P>(ii) <E T="03">Searches for electronic records.</E> The Council shall charge the requester for the actual direct cost of the search, including computer search time, runs, and the operator's salary. The fee for computer output shall be the actual direct cost. For a requester in the “other” category, when the cost of the search (including the operator time and the cost of operating the computer to process a request) equals the equivalent dollar amount of two hours of the salary of the person performing the search (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the operator), the charge for the computer search will begin.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Review of records.</E> The Council shall charge a requester for time spent by its employees examining responsive records to determine whether any portions of such record are withholdable from disclosure, pursuant to the FOIA exemptions of 5 U.S.C. 552(b). The Council shall also charge a requester for time spent by its employees redacting any such withholdable information from a record and preparing a record for release to the requester. The Council shall charge a requester for time spent reviewing records at the salary rate(s) (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> basic pay plus sixteen (16) percent) of the employees who conduct the review. Fees may be charged for review time even if records ultimately are not disclosed.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Inspection of records in the reading room.</E> Fees for all services provided <PRTPAGE P="499"/>shall be charged whether or not copies are made available to the requester for inspection. However, no fee shall be charged for monitoring a requester's inspection of records.</P>
          <P>(5) <E T="03">Other services.</E> Other services and materials requested which are not covered by this part nor required by the FOIA are chargeable at the actual cost to the Council. Charges permitted under this paragraph may include:</P>
          <P>(i) Certifying that records are true copies; and</P>
          <P>(ii) Sending records by special methods (such as by express mail, etc.).</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Fees applicable to various categories of requesters</E>—(1) <E T="03">Generally.</E> The Council shall assess the fees set forth in paragraph (b) of this section in accordance with the requester fee categories set forth below.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Requester selection of fee category.</E> A requester shall identify, in the initial FOIA request, the purpose of the request in one of the following categories:</P>
          <P>(i) <E T="03">Commercial.</E> A commercial use request refers to a request from or on behalf of a person who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made, which can include furthering those interests through litigation. The Council may determine from the use specified in the request that the requester is a commercial user.</P>
          <P>(ii) <E T="03">Educational institution.</E> This refers to a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate higher education, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an institution of professional education, and an institution of vocational education, which operates a program or programs of scholarly research. This includes a request from a teacher or student at any such institution making the request in connection with his or her role at the educational institution.</P>
          <P>(iii) <E T="03">Non-commercial scientific institution.</E> This refers to an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis, as that term is defined in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, and which is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.</P>
          <P>(iv) <E T="03">Representative of the news media.</E> This refers to any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. In this paragraph (c)(2)(iv), the term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news-media entities are television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large and publishers of periodicals (but only if such entities qualify as disseminators of “news”) who make their products available for purchase by subscription or by free distribution to the general public. These examples are not all-inclusive. Moreover, as methods of news delivery evolve (for example, the adoption of the electronic dissemination of newspapers through telecommunications services), such alternative media shall be considered to be news media entities. A freelance journalist shall be regarded as working for a news media entity if the journalist can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that entity, whether or not the journalist is actually employed by the entity. A publication contract would present a solid basis for such an expectation; the Council may also consider the past publication record of the requester in making such a determination.</P>
          <P>(v) <E T="03">Other requester.</E> This refers to a requester who does not fall within any of the categories described in paragraphs (c)(2)(i)-(iv) of this section.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Fees applicable to each category of requester.</E> The Council shall apply the fees set forth in this paragraph, for each category described in paragraph (c) of this section, to requests processed by the Council under the FOIA.</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Commercial use.</E> A requester seeking records for commercial use shall be charged the full direct costs of searching for, reviewing, and duplicating the records they request as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. Moreover, <PRTPAGE P="500"/>when a request is received for disclosure that is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester, the Council is not required to consider a request for a waiver or reduction of fees based upon the assertion that disclosure would be in the public interest. The Council may recover the cost of searching for and reviewing records even if there is ultimately no disclosure of records or no records are located.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Educational and non-commercial scientific uses.</E> A requester seeking records for educational or non-commercial scientific use shall be charged only for the cost of duplicating the records they request, except that the Council shall provide the first one hundred (100) pages of duplication free of charge. To be eligible, the requester must show that the request is made in connection with the requester's role at an educational institution or is made under the auspices of a non-commercial scientific institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use, but are sought in furtherance of scholarly (if the request is from an educational institution) or scientific (if the request is from a non-commercial scientific institution) research.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">News media uses.</E> A requester seeking records under the news media use category shall be charged only for the cost of duplicating the records they request, except that the Council shall provide the requester with the first one hundred (100) pages of duplication free of charge.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Other requests.</E> A requester seeking records for any other use shall be charged the full direct cost of searching for and duplicating records that are responsive to the request, as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, except that the Council shall provide the first one hundred (100) pages of duplication and the first two hours of search time free of charge. The Council may recover the cost of searching for records even if there is ultimately no disclosure of records, or no records are located.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Other circumstances when fees are not charged.</E> (1) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, the Council may not charge a requester a fee for processing a FOIA request if—:</P>
          <P>(i) Services were performed without charge;</P>
          <P>(ii) The cost of collecting a fee would be equal to or greater than the fee itself; or</P>
          <P>(iii) The fees were waived or reduced in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
          <P>(2) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, the Council may not charge a requester search fees or, in the case of a requester described in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii) through (iv) of this section, duplication fees if the Council fails to comply with any time limit under § 1301.7 or § 1301.11; provided that:</P>
          <P>(i) If unusual circumstances (as that term is defined in § 1301.7(e)) apply to the processing of the request and the Council has provided a timely notice to the requester in accordance with § 1301.7(e)(1), then a failure to comply with such time limit shall be excused for an additional ten days;</P>
          <P>(ii) If unusual circumstances (as that term is defined in § 1301.7(e)) apply to the processing of the request, more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, the Council has provided a timely written notice to the requester in accordance with § 1301.7(e)(2), and the Council has discussed with the requester via written mail, electronic mail, or telephone (or made not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request in accordance with § 1301.7(e)(2), then the Council may charge a requester such fees; and</P>
          <P>(iii) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist, then a failure to comply with such time limit shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Waiver or reduction of fees.</E> (1) A requester shall be entitled to receive from the Council a waiver or reduction in the fees otherwise applicable to a FOIA request whenever the requester:</P>

          <P>(i) Requests such waiver or reduction of fees in writing and submits the written request to the Council together with or as part of the FOIA request, or at a later time consistent with § 1301.5(b)(7) to process the request; and<PRTPAGE P="501"/>
          </P>
          <P>(ii) Demonstrates that the fee reduction or waiver request is in the public interest because:</P>
          <P>(A) Furnishing the information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government; and</P>
          <P>(B) Furnishing the information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.</P>
          <P>(2) To determine whether the requester has satisfied the requirements of paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, the Council shall consider:</P>
          <P>(i) The subject of the requested records must concern identifiable operations or activities of the federal government, with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated;</P>
          <P>(ii) The disclosable portions of the requested records must be meaningfully informative about government operations or activities in order to be “likely to contribute” to an increased public understanding of those operations or activities. The disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in either a duplicative or a substantially identical form, would not be as likely to contribute to such understanding where nothing new would be added to the public's understanding;</P>
          <P>(iii) The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's expertise in the subject area and ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public shall be considered. It shall be presumed that a representative of the news media will satisfy this consideration.</P>
          <P>(iv) The public's understanding of the subject in question, as compared to the level of public understanding existing prior to the disclosure, must be enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent.</P>
          <P>(3) To determine whether the requester satisfies the requirement of paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, the Council shall consider:</P>
          <P>(i) Any commercial interest of the requester (with reference to the definition of “commercial use” in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section), or of any person on whose behalf the requester may be acting, that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. In the administrative process, a requester may provide explanatory information regarding this consideration; and</P>
          <P>(ii) Whether the public interest is greater in magnitude than that of any identified commercial interest in disclosure. The Council ordinarily shall presume that, if a news media requester satisfies the public interest standard, the public interest will be the interest primarily served by disclosure to that requester. Disclosure to data brokers or others who merely compile and market government information for direct economic return shall not be presumed to primarily serve the public interest.</P>
          <P>(4) Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the requirements for a waiver or reduction of fees, a waiver or reduction shall be granted for those records.</P>
          <P>(5) <E T="03">Determination of request to reduce or waive fees.</E> The Council shall notify the requester in writing regarding its determinations to reduce or waive fees.</P>
          <P>(6) <E T="03">Effect of denying request to reduce or waive fees.</E> If the Council denies a request to reduce or waive fees, then the Council shall advise the requester, in the denial notification letter, that the requester may incur fees as a result of processing the request. In the denial notification letter, the Council shall advise the requester that the Council will not proceed to process the request further unless the requester, in writing, directs the Council to do so and either agrees to pay any fees that may apply to processing the request or specifies an upper limit (of not less than $25) that the requester is willing to pay to process the request. If the Council does not receive this written direction and agreement/specification within thirty (30) days of the date of the denial notification letter, then the Council shall deem the FOIA request to be withdrawn.</P>
          <P>(7) <E T="03">Appeals of denials of requests to reduce or waive fees.</E> If the Council denies a request to reduce or waive fees, then the requester shall have the right to submit an appeal of the denial determination in accordance with § 1301.11. The Council shall communicate this <PRTPAGE P="502"/>appeal right as part of its written notification to the requester denying the fee reduction or waiver request. The requester shall clearly mark its appeal request and any envelope that encloses it with the words “Appeal for Fee Reduction/Waiver.”</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Notice of estimated fees; advance payments.</E> (1) When the Council estimates the fees for processing a request will exceed the limit set by the requester, and that amount is less than $250, the Council shall notify the requester of the estimated costs, broken down by search, review and duplication fees. The requester must provide an agreement to pay the estimated costs, except that the requester may reformulate the request in an attempt to reduce the estimated fees.</P>
          <P>(2) If the requester fails to state a limit and the costs are estimated to exceed $250, the requester shall be notified of the estimated costs, broken down by search, review and duplication fees, and must pay such amount prior to the processing of the request, or provide satisfactory assurance of full payment if the requester has a history of prompt payment of FOIA fees. Alternatively, the requester may reformulate the request in such a way as to constitute a request for responsive records at a reduced fee.</P>
          <P>(3) The Council reserves the right to request advance payment after a request is processed and before records are released.</P>
          <P>(4) If a requester previously has failed to pay a fee within thirty (30) calendar days of the date of the billing, the requester shall be required to pay the full amount owed plus any applicable interest, and to make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated fee before the Council begins to process a new request or the pending request.</P>
          <P>(h) <E T="03">Form of payment.</E> Payment may be made by check or money order paid to the Treasurer of the United States.</P>
          <P>(i) <E T="03">Charging interest.</E> The Council may charge interest on any unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the date of billing the requester. Interest charges will be assessed at the rate provided in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the date of the billing until payment is received by the Council. The Council will follow the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749), as amended, and its administrative procedures, including the use of consumer reporting agencies, collection agencies, and offset.</P>
          <P>(j) <E T="03">Aggregating requests.</E> If the Council reasonably determines that a requester or a group of requesters acting together is attempting to divide a request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding fees, the Council may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly. The Council may presume that multiple requests involving related matters submitted within a thirty (30) calendar day period have been made in order to avoid fees.

            <P>Section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) <SU>1</SU>

              <FTREF/> authorizes the Financial Stability Oversight Council (the “Council”) to determine that a nonbank financial company will be supervised by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Board of Governors”) and be subject to prudential standards in accordance with title I of the Dodd-Frank Act if either of two standards is met. Under the first standard, the Council may subject a nonbank financial <PRTPAGE P="512"/>company to supervision by the Board of Governors and prudential standards if the Council determines that “material financial distress” at the nonbank financial company could pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States. Under the second standard, the Council may determine that a nonbank financial company will be supervised by the Board of Governors and subject to prudential standards if the nature, scope, size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness, or mix of the activities of the nonbank financial company could pose a threat to U.S. financial stability. Section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act also lists 10 considerations that the Council must take into account in making a determination.<SU>2</SU>

            <P>Section II of this document describes the manner in which the Council intends to apply the statutory standards and considerations in making determinations under section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act. First, section II defines “threat to the financial stability of the United States” and describes channels through which a nonbank financial company could pose such a threat. Second, it discusses each of the two statutory standards for determination. Third, it describes the six-category framework that the Council intends to use to evaluate nonbank financial companies under each of the 10 statutory considerations. Section II also includes lists of sample metrics that may be used to evaluate individual nonbank financial companies under each of the six categories.</P>
            <P>Section III of this document outlines the process that the Council intends to follow in non-emergency situations when determining whether to subject a nonbank financial company to Board of Governors supervision and prudential standards. Section III also provides a detailed description of the analysis that the Council intends to conduct during each stage of its review. In the first stage of the process, the Council will apply six uniform quantitative thresholds to nonbank financial companies to identify those nonbank financial companies that will be subject to further evaluation by the Council. Because the Council is relying in the first stage on quantitative thresholds using information available through existing public and regulatory sources, nonbank financial companies should be able to assess whether they will be subject to further evaluation by the Council. During the second stage of the evaluation process, the Council will analyze the identified nonbank financial companies using a broad range of information available to the Council primarily through existing public and regulatory sources. The third stage of the process will involve a comprehensive analysis of those nonbank financial companies using information collected directly from the nonbank financial company, as well as the information used in the first two stages.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Council Determination Authority and Framework</HD>
            <P>As noted above, the Council may determine that a nonbank financial company will be supervised by the Board of Governors and be subject to prudential standards if the Council determines that (i) material financial distress at the nonbank financial company could pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States (the “First Determination Standard”) or (ii) the nature, scope, size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness, or mix of the activities of the nonbank financial company could pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States (the “Second Determination Standard,” and, together with the First Determination Standard, the “Determination Standards”).</P>
            <P>The Council intends to interpret the term “company” broadly with respect to nonbank financial companies and other companies in connection with section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act, to include any corporation, limited liability company, partnership, business trust, association, or similar organization.</P>
            <P>This section provides definitions of the terms “threat to the financial stability of the United States” and “material financial distress” and describes how the Council expects to apply the Determination Standards.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">a. Threat to the Financial Stability of the United States</HD>
            <P>The Determination Standards require the Council to determine whether a nonbank financial company could pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States. The Council will consider a “threat to the financial stability of the United States” to exist if there would be an impairment of financial intermediation or of financial market functioning that would be sufficiently severe to inflict significant damage on the broader economy.</P>

            <P>In evaluating a nonbank financial company under one of the Determination Standards, the Council intends to assess how a nonbank financial company's material financial distress or activities could be transmitted to, or otherwise affect, other firms or markets, thereby causing a broader impairment of financial intermediation or of financial market functioning. An impairment of financial intermediation and financial market functioning can occur through several channels. The Council has identified the following channels as most likely to facilitate the transmission of the negative effects of a <PRTPAGE P="513"/>nonbank financial company's material financial distress or activities to other financial firms and markets:</P>
            <P>• <E T="03">Exposure.</E> A nonbank financial company's creditors, counterparties, investors, or other market participants have exposure to the nonbank financial company that is significant enough to materially impair those creditors, counterparties, investors, or other market participants and thereby pose a threat to U.S. financial stability. In its initial analysis of nonbank financial companies with respect to this channel, the Council expects to consider metrics including total consolidated assets, credit default swaps outstanding, derivative liabilities, total debt outstanding, and leverage ratio.</P>
            <P>• <E T="03">Asset liquidation.</E> A nonbank financial company holds assets that, if liquidated quickly, would cause a fall in asset prices and thereby significantly disrupt trading or funding in key markets or cause significant losses or funding problems for other firms with similar holdings. This channel would likely be most relevant for a nonbank financial company whose funding and liquid asset profile makes it likely that it would be forced to liquidate assets quickly when it comes under financial pressure. For example, this could be the case if a large nonbank financial company relies heavily on short-term funding. In its initial analysis of nonbank financial companies with respect to this channel, the Council expects to consider metrics including total consolidated assets and short-term debt ratio.</P>
            <P>• <E T="03">Critical function or service.</E> A nonbank financial company is no longer able or willing to provide a critical function or service that is relied upon by market participants and for which there are no ready substitutes. The analysis of this channel will incorporate a review of the competitive landscape for markets in which a nonbank financial company participates and for the services it provides (including the provision of liquidity to the U.S. financial system, the provision of credit to low-income, minority, or underserved communities, or the provision of credit to households, businesses and state and local governments), the nonbank financial company's market share, and the ability of other firms to replace those services. Due to the unique ways in which a nonbank financial company may provide a critical function or service to the market, the Council expects to apply company-specific analyses with respect to this channel, rather than applying a broadly applicable quantitative metric.</P>
            <P>The Council believes that the threat a nonbank financial company may pose to U.S. financial stability through the impairment of financial intermediation and financial market functioning is likely to be exacerbated if the nonbank financial company is sufficiently complex, opaque, or difficult to resolve in bankruptcy such that its resolution in bankruptcy would disrupt key markets or have a material adverse impact on other financial firms or markets.</P>
            <P>The Council intends to continue to evaluate additional transmission channels and may, at its discretion, consider other channels through which a nonbank financial company may transmit the negative effects of its material financial distress or activities and thereby pose a threat to U.S. financial stability.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">b. First Determination Standard: Material Financial Distress</HD>
            <P>Under the First Determination Standard, the Council may subject a nonbank financial company to supervision by the Board of Governors and prudential standards if the Council determines that “material financial distress” at the nonbank financial company could pose a threat to U.S. financial stability. The Council believes that material financial distress exists when a nonbank financial company is in imminent danger of insolvency or defaulting on its financial obligations.</P>
            <P>For purposes of considering whether a nonbank financial company could pose a threat to U.S. financial stability under this Determination Standard, the Council intends to assess the impact of the nonbank financial company's material financial distress in the context of a period of overall stress in the financial services industry and in a weak macroeconomic environment. The Council believes this is appropriate because in such a context, a nonbank financial company's distress may have a greater effect on U.S. financial stability.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">c. Second Determination Standard: Nature, Scope, Size, Scale, Concentration, Interconnectedness, or Mix of Activities</HD>

            <P>Under the Second Determination Standard, the Council may subject a nonbank financial company to supervision by the Board of Governors and prudential standards if the Council determines that the nature, scope, size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness, or mix of the activities of the nonbank financial company could pose a threat to U.S. financial stability. The Council believes that this Determination Standard will be met if the Council determines that the nature of a nonbank financial company's business practices, conduct, or operations could pose a threat to U.S. financial stability, regardless of whether the nonbank financial company is experiencing financial distress. The Council expects that there likely will be significant overlap between the outcome of an assessment of a nonbank financial company under the First and Second Determination Standards, because, in many cases, a nonbank financial company that could pose a threat to <PRTPAGE P="514"/>U.S. financial stability because of the nature, scope, size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness, or mix of its activities could also pose a threat to U.S. financial stability if it were to experience material financial distress.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">d. Analytic Framework for Statutory Considerations</HD>
            <P>As required by section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Council's determination will be based on its judgment that a firm meets one of the Determination Standards described above. In evaluating whether a firm meets one of the Determination Standards, the Council will consider each of the statutory considerations. The discussion below outlines the analytic framework that the Council intends to use to organize its evaluation of a nonbank financial company under the statutory considerations and provides additional detail on the key data and analyses that the Council intends to use to assess the considerations.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Grouping of Statutory Considerations Into Six-Category Framework</HD>
            <P>The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Council to consider 10 considerations (described below) when evaluating the potential of a nonbank financial company to pose a threat to U.S. financial stability. The statute also authorizes the Council to consider “any other risk-related factors that the Council deems appropriate.” These statutory considerations will help the Council to evaluate whether one of the Determination Standards, as described in sections II.b and II.c above, has been met. The Council has developed an analytic framework that groups all relevant factors, including the 10 statutory considerations and any additional risk-related factors, into six categories: size, interconnectedness, substitutability, leverage, liquidity risk and maturity mismatch, and existing regulatory scrutiny. The Council expects to use these six categories to guide its evaluation of whether a particular nonbank financial company meets either Determination Standard. However, the Council's ultimate determination decision regarding a nonbank financial company will not be based on a formulaic application of the six categories. Rather, the Council intends to analyze a nonbank financial company using quantitative and qualitative data relevant to each of the six categories, as the Council determines is appropriate with respect to the particular nonbank financial company.</P>
            <P>Each of the six categories reflects a different dimension of a nonbank financial company's potential to pose a threat to U.S. financial stability. Three of the six categories—size, substitutability, and interconnectedness—seek to assess the potential impact of the nonbank financial company's financial distress on the broader economy. Material financial distress at nonbank financial companies that are large, provide critical financial services for which there are few substitutes, or are highly interconnected with other financial firms or markets are more likely to have a financial or operational impact on other companies, markets, and consumers that could pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States. The remaining three categories—leverage, liquidity risk and maturity mismatch, and existing regulatory scrutiny of the nonbank financial company—seek to assess the vulnerability of a nonbank financial company to financial distress. Nonbank financial companies that are highly leveraged, have a high degree of liquidity risk or maturity mismatch, and are under little or no regulatory scrutiny are more likely to be more vulnerable to financial distress.</P>
            <P>Each of the statutory considerations in sections 113(a)(2) and (b)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Act would be considered as part of one or more of the six categories. This is reflected in the following table, using the considerations relevant to a U.S. nonbank financial company for illustrative purposes.<SU>3</SU>

            <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Six-Category Framework</HD>
            <P>The discussion below describes each of the six categories and how these categories relate to a firm's likelihood to pose a threat to financial stability. The sample metrics set forth below under each category are representative, not exhaustive, and may not apply to all nonbank financial companies under evaluation. The Council may apply the sample metrics in the context of stressed market conditions.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Interconnectedness</HD>
            <P>Interconnectedness captures direct or indirect linkages between financial companies that may be conduits for the transmission of the effects resulting from a nonbank financial company's material financial distress or activities. Examples of the key conduits through which the effects may travel are a nonbank financial company's direct or indirect exposures to counterparties (including creditors, trading and derivatives counterparties, investors, borrowers, and other participants in the financial markets). Interconnectedness depends not only on the number of counterparties that a nonbank financial company has, but also on the importance of that nonbank financial company to its counterparties and the extent to which the counterparties are interconnected with other financial firms, the financial system and the broader economy. The Council's assessment of interconnectedness is intended to determine whether a nonbank financial company's exposure to its counterparties would pose a threat to U.S. financial stability if that company encountered material financial distress.</P>
            <P>For example, metrics that may be used to assess interconnectedness include:</P>
            <P>• Counterparties' exposures to a nonbank financial company, including derivatives, reinsurance, loans, securities borrowing and lending, and lines of credit that facilitate settlement and clearing activities.</P>
            <P>• Number, size, and financial strength of a nonbank financial company's counterparties, including the proportion of its counterparties' exposure to the nonbank financial company relative to the counterparties' capital.</P>
            <P>• Identity of a nonbank financial company's principal contractual counterparties, which reflects the concentration of the nonbank financial company's assets financed by particular firms and the importance of the nonbank financial company's counterparties to the market.</P>
            <P>• Aggregate amounts of a nonbank financial company's gross or net derivatives exposures and the number of its derivatives counterparties.</P>
            <P>• The amount of gross notional credit default swaps outstanding for which a nonbank financial company or its parent is the reference entity.</P>
            <P>• Total debt outstanding, which captures a nonbank financial company's sources of funding.</P>
            <P>• Reinsurance obligations, which measure the reinsurance risk assumed from non-affiliates net of retrocession.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Substitutability</HD>

            <P>Substitutability captures the extent to which other firms could provide similar financial services in a timely manner at a similar price and quantity if a nonbank financial company withdraws from a particular market. Substitutability also captures situations in which a nonbank financial company is the primary or dominant provider of services in a market that the Council determines to be essential to U.S. financial stability. An example of the manner in which the Council may determine a nonbank financial company's substitutability is to consider its market share. The Council's evaluation of a nonbank financial company's market share regarding a particular product or service will include assessments of the ability of the nonbank financial company's competitors to expand to meet market needs; the costs that market participants would incur if forced to switch providers; the timeframe within which a disruption in the provision of the product or service would materially affect market participants or market functioning; and the economic implications of such a disruption. Concern about a potential lack of substitutability could be greater if a nonbank financial company and its competitors are likely <PRTPAGE P="516"/>to experience stress at the same time because they are exposed to the same risks. The Council may also analyze a nonbank financial company's core operations and critical functions and the importance of those operations and functions to the U.S. financial system and assess how those operations and functions would be performed by the nonbank financial company or other market participants in the event of the nonbank financial company's material financial distress. The Council also intends to consider substitutability with respect to any nonbank financial company with global operations to identify the substitutability of critical market functions that the company provides in the United States in the event of material financial distress of a foreign parent company.</P>
            <P>For example, metrics that may be used to assess substitutability include:</P>
            <P>• The market share, using the appropriate quantitative measure (such as loans originated, loans outstanding, and notional transaction volume) of a nonbank financial company and its competitors in the market under consideration.</P>
            <P>• The stability of market share across the firms in the market over time.</P>
            <P>• The market share of the company and its competitors for products or services that serve a substantially similar economic function as the primary market under consideration.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Size</HD>
            <P>Size captures the amount of financial services or financial intermediation that a nonbank financial company provides. Size also may affect the extent to which the effects of a nonbank financial company's financial distress are transmitted to other firms and to the financial system. For example, financial distress at an extremely large nonbank financial company that is highly interconnected likely would transmit risk on a larger scale than would financial distress at a smaller nonbank financial company that is similarly interconnected. Size is conventionally measured by the assets, liabilities and capital of the firm. However, such measures of size may not provide complete or accurate assessments of the scale of a nonbank financial company's risk potential. Thus, the Council also intends to take into account off-balance sheet assets and liabilities and assets under management in a manner that recognizes the unique and distinct nature of these classes. Other measures of size, such as numbers of customers and counterparties, may also be relevant.</P>
            <P>For example, metrics that may be used to assess size include:</P>
            <P>• Total consolidated assets or liabilities, as determined under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) or the nonbank financial company's applicable financial reporting standards, depending on the availability of data and the stage of the determination process.</P>
            <P>• Total risk-weighted assets, as appropriate for different industry sectors.</P>
            <P>• Off-balance sheet exposures where a nonbank financial company has a risk of loss, including, for example, lines of credit. For foreign nonbank financial companies, this would be evaluated based on the extent and nature of U.S.-related off-balance sheet exposures.</P>
            <P>• The extent to which assets are managed rather than owned by a nonbank financial company and the extent to which ownership of assets under management is diffuse.</P>
            <P>• Direct written premiums, as reported by insurance companies. This is the aggregate of direct written premiums reported by insurance entities under all lines of business and serves as a proxy for the amount of insurance underwritten by the insurance entities.</P>
            <P>• Risk in force, which is the aggregate risk exposure from risk underwritten in insurance related to certain financial risks, such as mortgage insurance.</P>
            <P>• Total loan originations, by loan type, in number and dollar amount.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Leverage</HD>
            <P>Leverage captures a company's exposure or risk in relation to its equity capital. Leverage amplifies a company's risk of financial distress in two ways. First, by increasing a company's exposure relative to capital, leverage raises the likelihood that a company will suffer losses exceeding its capital. Second, by increasing the size of a company's liabilities, leverage raises a company's dependence on its creditors' willingness and ability to fund its balance sheet. Leverage can also amplify the impact of a company's distress on other companies, both directly, by increasing the amount of exposure that other firms have to the company, and indirectly, by increasing the size of any asset liquidation that the company is forced to undertake as it comes under financial pressure. Leverage can be measured by the ratio of assets to capital, but it can also be defined in terms of risk, as a measure of economic risk relative to capital. The latter measurement can better capture the effect of derivatives and other products with embedded leverage on the risk undertaken by a nonbank financial company.</P>
            <P>For example, metrics that may be used to assess leverage include:</P>
            <P>• Total assets and total debt measured relative to total equity, which is intended to measure financial leverage.</P>

            <P>• Gross notional exposure of derivatives and off-balance sheet obligations relative to total equity or to net assets under management, which is intended to show how much off-balance sheet leverage a nonbank financial company may have.<PRTPAGE P="517"/>
            </P>
            <P>• The ratio of risk to statutory capital, which is relevant to certain insurance companies and is intended to show how much risk exposure a nonbank financial company has in relation to its ability to absorb loss.</P>
            <P>• Changes in leverage ratios, which may indicate that a nonbank financial company is rapidly increasing its risk profile.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Liquidity Risk and Maturity Mismatch</HD>
            <P>Liquidity risk generally refers to the risk that a company may not have sufficient funding to satisfy its short-term needs, either through its cash flows, maturing assets, or assets salable at prices equivalent to book value, or through its ability to access funding markets. For example, if a company holds assets that are illiquid or that are subject to significant decreases in market value during times of market stress, the company may be unable to liquidate its assets effectively in response to a loss of funding. In order to assess liquidity, the Council may examine a nonbank financial company's assets to determine if it possesses cash instruments or readily marketable securities, such as Treasury securities, which could reasonably be expected to have a liquid market in times of distress. The Council may also review a nonbank financial company's debt profile to determine if it has adequate long-term funding, or can otherwise mitigate liquidity risk. Liquidity problems also can arise from a company's inability to roll maturing debt or to satisfy margin calls, and from demands for additional collateral, depositor withdrawals, draws on committed lines, and other potential draws on liquidity.</P>
            <P>A maturity mismatch generally refers to the difference between the maturities of a company's assets and liabilities. A maturity mismatch affects a company's ability to survive a period of stress that may limit its access to funding and to withstand shocks in the yield curve. For example, if a company relies on short-term funding to finance longer-term positions, it will be subject to significant refunding risk that may force it to sell assets at low market prices or potentially suffer through significant margin pressure. However, maturity mismatches are not confined to the use of short-term liabilities and can exist at any point in the maturity schedule of a nonbank financial company's assets and liabilities. For example, in the case of a life insurance company, liabilities may have maturities of 30 years or more, whereas the market availability of equivalently long-term assets may be limited, exposing the company to interest rate fluctuations and reinvestment risk.</P>
            <P>For example, metrics that may be used to assess liquidity and maturity mismatch include:</P>
            <P>• Fraction of assets that are classified as level 2 and level 3 under applicable accounting standards, as a measure of how much of a nonbank financial company's balance sheet is composed of hard-to-value and potentially illiquid securities.</P>
            <P>• Liquid asset ratios, which are intended to indicate a nonbank financial company's ability to repay its short-term debt.</P>
            <P>• The ratio of unencumbered and highly liquid assets to the net cash outflows that a nonbank financial company could encounter in a short-term stress scenario.</P>
            <P>• Callable debt as a fraction of total debt, which provides one measure of a nonbank financial company's ability to manage its funding position in response to changes in interest rates.</P>
            <P>• Asset-backed funding versus other funding, to determine a nonbank financial company's susceptibility to distress in particular credit markets.</P>
            <P>• Asset-liability duration and gap analysis, which is intended to indicate how well a nonbank financial company is matching the re-pricing and maturity of the nonbank financial company's assets and liabilities.</P>
            <P>• Short-term debt as a percentage of total debt and as a percentage of total assets, which indicates a nonbank financial company's reliance on short-term debt markets.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD3">Existing Regulatory Scrutiny</HD>
            <P>The Council will consider the extent to which nonbank financial companies are already subject to regulation, including the consistency of that regulation across nonbank financial companies within a sector, across different sectors, and providing similar services, and the statutory authority of those regulators.</P>
            <P>For example, metrics that may be used to assess existing regulatory scrutiny include:</P>
            <P>• The extent of state or federal regulatory scrutiny, including processes or systems for peer review; inter-regulatory coordination and cooperation; and whether existing regulators have the ability to impose detailed and timely reporting obligations, capital and liquidity requirements, and enforcement actions, and to resolve the company.</P>
            <P>• Existence and effectiveness of consolidated supervision, and a determination of whether and how non-regulated entities and groups within a nonbank financial company are supervised on a group-wide basis.</P>
            <P>• For entities based outside the United States, the extent to which a nonbank financial company is subject to prudential standards on a consolidated basis in its home country that are administered and enforced by a comparable foreign supervisory authority.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. The Determination Process</HD>

            <P>The Council expects generally to follow a three-stage process of increasingly in-depth <PRTPAGE P="518"/>evaluation and analysis leading up to a proposed determination (a “Proposed Determination”) that a nonbank financial company could pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States. Quantitative metrics, together with qualitative analysis, will inform the judgment of the Council when it is evaluating a nonbank financial company for a Proposed Determination. The purpose of this process is to help determine whether a nonbank financial company could pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States.</P>
            <P>In the first stage of the process (“Stage 1”), a set of uniform quantitative metrics will be applied to a broad group of nonbank financial companies in order to identify nonbank financial companies for further evaluation and to provide clarity for nonbank financial companies that likely will not be subject to further evaluation. In Stage 1, the Council will rely solely on information available through existing public and regulatory sources. The purpose of Stage 1 is to enable the Council to identify a group of nonbank financial companies that are most likely to satisfy one of the Determination Standards.</P>
            <P>In the second stage (“Stage 2”), the nonbank financial companies identified in Stage 1 will be analyzed and prioritized, based on a wide range of quantitative and qualitative information available to the Council primarily through public and regulatory sources. The Council will also begin the consultation process with the primary financial regulatory agencies or home country supervisors, as appropriate. As part of that consultation process, the Council intends to consult with the primary financial regulatory agency, if any, of each significant subsidiary of the nonbank financial company, to the extent the Council deems appropriate. The Council also intends to fulfill its statutory obligation to rely whenever possible on information available through the Office of Financial Research (the “OFR”), member agencies, or the nonbank financial company's primary financial regulatory agencies before requiring the submission of reports from any nonbank financial company.<SU>4</SU>

            </FTNT>
            <P>Following Stage 2, nonbank financial companies that are selected for additional review will receive notice that they are being considered for a Proposed Determination and will be subject to in-depth evaluation during the third stage of review (“Stage 3”). Stage 3 will involve the evaluation of information collected directly from the nonbank financial company, in addition to the information considered during Stages 1 and 2. At the end of Stage 3, the Council may consider whether to make a Proposed Determination with respect to the nonbank financial company. If a Proposed Determination is made by the Council, the nonbank financial company may request a hearing in accordance with section 113(e) of the Dodd-Frank Act and § 1310.21(c) of the Council's rule.<SU>5</SU>

            </FTNT>
            <P>The Council expects to follow this three-stage process and to consider the categories, metrics, thresholds, and channels described in this guidance to assess a nonbank financial company's potential to pose a threat to U.S. financial stability. In addition to the information described herein that the Council generally expects to consider, the Council also will consider quantitative and qualitative information that it deems relevant to a particular nonbank financial company, as each determination will be made on a company-specific basis. The Council may consider any nonbank financial company for a Proposed Determination at any point in the three-stage evaluation process described in this guidance if the Council believes such company could pose a threat to U.S. financial stability.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">a. Stage 1: Initial Identification of Nonbank Financial Companies for Evaluation</HD>
            <P>In Stage 1, the Council will seek to identify a set of nonbank financial companies that merit company-specific evaluation. In this stage, the Council intends to apply quantitative thresholds to a broad group of nonbank financial companies. A nonbank financial company that is selected for further evaluation during Stage 1 will be assessed during Stage 2. During the Stage 1 process, the Council will evaluate nonbank financial companies using only data available to the Council, such as publicly available information and information member agencies possess in their supervisory capacities.</P>

            <P>In the Stage 1 quantitative analysis, the Council intends to apply thresholds that relate to the framework categories of size, interconnectedness, leverage, and liquidity risk and maturity mismatch. These thresholds were selected based on (1) their applicability to nonbank financial companies that operate in different types of financial markets and industries, (2) the meaningful initial assessment that such thresholds provide regarding the potential for a nonbank financial company to pose a threat to financial stability in diverse financial markets, and (3) the current availability of data. These thresholds are intended to measure both the susceptibility of a nonbank financial company to financial distress and the potential for that nonbank financial company's financial distress to spread throughout the financial system. A nonbank financial company will be evaluated further in Stage 2 if it meets both the total consolidated assets <PRTPAGE P="519"/>threshold and any one of the other thresholds.<SU>6</SU>
              <FTREF/> The thresholds are:</P>
            <FTNT>
              <P>
                <SU>6</SU> While the Council expects that its determinations under section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act will be with respect to individual legal entities, the Council has authority to assess nonbank financial companies, and their relationships with other nonbank financial companies and market participants, in a manner that addresses the statutory considerations and such other factors as the Council deems appropriate. For example, for purposes of applying the six thresholds to investment funds (including private equity firms and hedge funds), the Council may consider the aggregate risks posed by separate funds that are managed by the same adviser, particularly if the funds' investments are identical or highly similar. In performing this analysis, the Council may use data reported on Form PF with the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.</P>
            </FTNT>
            <P>• <E T="03">Total Consolidated Assets.</E> The Council intends to apply a size threshold of $50 billion in total consolidated assets. This threshold is consistent with the Dodd-Frank Act threshold of $50 billion in assets for subjecting bank holding companies to enhanced prudential standards.</P>
            <P>• <E T="03">Credit Default Swaps Outstanding.</E> The Council intends to apply a threshold of $30 billion in gross notional credit default swaps (“CDS”) outstanding for which a nonbank financial company is the reference entity. Gross notional value equals the sum of CDS contracts bought (or equivalently sold). If the amount of CDS sold on a particular nonbank financial company is greater than $30 billion, this indicates that a large number of institutions may be exposed to that nonbank financial company and that if the nonbank financial company fails, a significant number of financial market participants may be affected. This threshold was selected based on an analysis of the distribution of outstanding CDS data for nonbank financial companies included in a list of the top 1,000 CDS reference entities.</P>
            <P>• <E T="03">Derivative Liabilities.</E> The Council intends to apply a threshold of $3.5 billion of derivative liabilities. Derivative liabilities equal the fair value of derivative contracts in a negative position. For nonbank financial companies that disclose the effects of master netting agreements and cash collateral held with the same counterparty on a net basis, the Council intends to calculate derivative liabilities after taking into account the effects of these arrangements. This threshold serves as a proxy for interconnectedness, as a nonbank financial company that has a greater level of derivative liabilities would have higher counterparty exposure throughout the financial system.</P>
            <P>• <E T="03">Total Debt Outstanding.</E> The Council intends to apply a threshold of $20 billion in total debt outstanding. The Council will define total debt outstanding broadly and regardless of maturity to include loans (whether secured or unsecured), bonds, repurchase agreements, commercial paper, securities lending arrangements, surplus notes (for insurance companies), and other forms of indebtedness. This threshold serves as a proxy for interconnectedness, as nonbank financial companies with a large amount of outstanding debt are generally more interconnected with the broader financial system, in part because financial institutions hold a large proportion of outstanding debt. An analysis of the distribution of debt outstanding for a sample of nonbank financial companies was performed to determine the $20 billion threshold. Historical testing of this threshold demonstrated that it would have captured many of the nonbank financial companies that encountered material financial distress during the financial crisis in 2007-2008, including Bear Stearns, Countrywide, and Lehman Brothers.</P>
            <P>• <E T="03">Leverage Ratio.</E> The Council intends to apply a threshold leverage ratio of total consolidated assets (excluding separate accounts) to total equity of 15 to 1. The Council intends to exclude separate accounts from this calculation because separate accounts are not available to claims by general creditors of a nonbank financial company. Measuring leverage in this manner benefits from simplicity, availability and comparability across industries. An analysis of the distribution of the historical leverage ratios of large financial institutions was used to identify the 15 to 1 threshold. Historical testing of this threshold demonstrated that it would have captured the major nonbank financial companies that encountered material financial distress and posed a threat to U.S. financial stability during the financial crisis, including Bear Stearns, Countrywide, IndyMac Bancorp, and Lehman Brothers.</P>
            <P>• <E T="03">Short-Term Debt Ratio.</E> The Council intends to apply a threshold ratio of total debt outstanding (as defined above) with a maturity of less than 12 months to total consolidated assets (excluding separate accounts) of 10 percent. An analysis of the historical distribution of the short-term debt ratios of large financial institutions was used to determine the 10 percent threshold. Historical testing of this threshold demonstrated that it would have captured a number of the nonbank financial companies that faced short-term funding issues during the financial crisis, including Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers.</P>

            <P>The Council intends generally to apply the Stage 1 thresholds using GAAP when such information is available. If GAAP information with respect to a nonbank financial company is not available, the Council may <PRTPAGE P="520"/>rely on data reported under statutory accounting principles, international financial reporting standards, or such other data as are available to the Council.</P>
            <P>For purposes of evaluating any U.S. nonbank financial company, the Council intends to apply each of the Stage 1 thresholds based on the global assets, liabilities and operations of the company and its subsidiaries. In contrast, for purposes of evaluating any foreign nonbank financial company, the Council intends to calculate the Stage 1 thresholds based solely on the U.S. assets, liabilities and operations of the foreign nonbank financial company and its subsidiaries.</P>
            <P>The Council intends to reapply the Stage 1 thresholds to nonbank financial companies using the most recently available data on a quarterly basis, or less frequently for nonbank financial companies with respect to which quarterly data are unavailable.</P>
            <P>The Council intends to review the appropriateness of both the Stage 1 thresholds and the levels of the thresholds that are specified in dollars as needed, but at least every five years, and to adjust the thresholds and levels as the Council may deem advisable.</P>
            <P>The Stage 1 thresholds are intended to identify nonbank financial companies for further evaluation by the Council and to help a nonbank financial company predict whether such company will be subject to additional review. Because the uniform quantitative thresholds may not capture all types of nonbank financial companies and all of the potential ways in which a nonbank financial company could pose a threat to financial stability, the Council may initially evaluate any nonbank financial company based on other firm-specific qualitative or quantitative factors, irrespective of whether such company meets the thresholds in Stage 1.</P>
            <P>A nonbank financial company that is identified for further evaluation in Stage 1 would be further assessed during Stage 2 (the “Stage 2 Pool”).</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">b. Stage 2: Review and Prioritization of Stage 2 Pool</HD>
            <P>After the Stage 2 Pool has been identified, the Council intends to conduct a robust analysis of the potential threat that each of those nonbank financial companies could pose to U.S. financial stability. In general, this analysis will be based on information already available to the Council through existing public and regulatory sources, including information possessed by the company's primary financial regulatory agency or home country supervisor, as appropriate, and information voluntarily submitted by the company. In contrast to the application of uniform quantitative thresholds to a broad group of nonbank financial companies in Stage 1, the Council intends to evaluate the risk profile and characteristics of each individual nonbank financial company in the Stage 2 Pool based on a wide range of quantitative and qualitative industry-specific and company-specific factors. This analysis will use the six-category analytic framework described in section II.d above. In addition, the Stage 2 evaluation will include a review, based on available data, of qualitative factors, including whether the resolution of a nonbank financial company, as described below, could pose a threat to U.S. financial stability, and the extent to which the nonbank financial company is subject to regulation.</P>
            <P>Based on this analysis, the Council intends to contact those nonbank financial companies that the Council believes merit further evaluation in Stage 3 (the “Stage 3 Pool”).</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">c. Stage 3: Review of Stage 3 Pool</HD>
            <P>In Stage 3, the Council, working with the OFR, will conduct a review of each nonbank financial company in the Stage 3 Pool using information collected directly from the nonbank financial company, as well as the information used in the first two stages. The review will focus on whether the nonbank financial company could pose a threat to U.S. financial stability because of the company's material financial distress or the nature, scope, size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness, or mix of the activities of the company. The transmission channels discussed above, and other appropriate factors, will be used to evaluate a nonbank financial company's potential to pose a threat to U.S. financial stability. The analytic framework consisting of the six categories set forth above, and the metrics used to measure each of the six categories, will assist the Council in assessing the extent to which the transmission of material financial distress is likely to occur.</P>
            <P>Each nonbank financial company in the Stage 3 Pool will receive a notice (a “Notice of Consideration”) that the nonbank financial company is under consideration for a Proposed Determination. The Notice of Consideration likely will include a request that the nonbank financial company provide information that the Council deems relevant to the Council's evaluation, and the nonbank financial company will be provided an opportunity to submit written materials to the Council.<SU>7</SU>
              <FTREF/> This information will generally be collected by the OFR.<SU>8</SU>
              <FTREF/> Before requiring the <PRTPAGE P="521"/>submission of reports from any nonbank financial company that is regulated by a member agency or any primary financial regulatory agency, the Council, acting through the OFR, will coordinate with such agencies and will, whenever possible, rely on information available from the OFR or such agencies. Council members and their agencies and staffs will maintain the confidentiality of such information in accordance with applicable law.</P>

                <SU>7</SU> <E T="03">See</E> section 1310.21(a) of the rule.</P>

            <FTNT>
              <P>
                <SU>8</SU> Under section 112(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act, if the Council is unable to determine whether a U.S. nonbank financial company poses a threat to U.S. financial stability based on such information, the Council may request that the Board of Governors conduct an examination of the nonbank financial <PRTPAGE/>company to determine whether it should be supervised by the Board of Governors.</P>
            </FTNT>
            <P>Information requests likely will involve both qualitative and quantitative data. Information relevant to the Council's analysis may include confidential business information such as internal assessments, internal risk management procedures, funding details, counterparty exposure or position data, strategic plans, resolvability, potential acquisitions or dispositions, and other anticipated changes to the nonbank financial company's business or structure that could affect the threat to U.S. financial stability posed by the nonbank financial company.</P>
            <P>In evaluating qualitative factors during Stage 3, the Council expects to have access, to a greater degree than during earlier stages of review, to information relating to factors that are not easily quantifiable or that may not directly cause a company to pose a threat to financial stability, but could mitigate or aggravate the potential of a nonbank financial company to pose a threat to the United States. Such factors may include the opacity of the nonbank financial company's operations, its complexity, and the extent to which it is subject to existing regulatory scrutiny and the nature of such scrutiny.</P>
            <P>The Stage 3 analysis will also include an evaluation of a nonbank financial company's resolvability, which may mitigate or aggravate the potential of a nonbank financial company to pose a threat to U.S. financial stability. An evaluation of a nonbank financial company's resolvability entails an assessment of the complexity of the nonbank financial company's legal, funding, and operational structure, and any obstacles to the rapid and orderly resolution of the nonbank financial company in a manner that would mitigate the risk that the nonbank financial company's failure would have a material adverse effect on financial stability. In addition to the factors described above, a nonbank financial company's resolvability is also a function of legal entity and cross-border operations issues. These factors include the ability to separate functions and spin off services or business lines; the likelihood of preserving franchise value in a recovery or resolution scenario, and of maintaining continuity of critical services within the existing or in a new legal entity or structure; the degree of the nonbank financial company's intra-group dependency for liquidity and funding, payment operation, and risk management needs; and the size and nature of the nonbank financial company's intra-group transactions.</P>
            <P>The Council anticipates that the information necessary to conduct an in-depth analysis of a particular nonbank financial company may vary significantly based on the nonbank financial company's business and activities and the information already available to the Council from existing public sources and domestic or foreign regulatory authorities. The Council will also consult with the primary financial regulatory agency, if any, for each nonbank financial company or subsidiary of a nonbank financial company under consideration in a timely manner before the Council makes any final determination with respect to such nonbank financial company, and with appropriate foreign regulatory authorities, to the extent appropriate.</P>
            <P>Before making a Proposed Determination, the Council intends to notify each nonbank financial company in the Stage 3 Pool when the Council believes that the evidentiary record regarding such nonbank financial company is complete.</P>
            <P>Based on the analysis performed in Stages 2 and 3, a nonbank financial company will be considered for a Proposed Determination. Before a vote of the Council with respect to a particular nonbank financial company, the Council members will review information relevant to the consideration of the nonbank financial company for a Proposed Determination. After this review, the Council may, by a vote of two-thirds of its members (including an affirmative vote of the Council Chairperson), make a Proposed Determination with respect to the nonbank financial company. Following a Proposed Determination, the Council intends to issue a written notice of the Proposed Determination to the nonbank financial company, which will include an explanation of the basis of the Proposed Determination. The Council expects to notify any nonbank financial company in the Stage 3 Pool if the nonbank financial company, either before or after a Proposed Determination of such nonbank financial company, ceases to be considered for determination. Any nonbank financial company that ceases to be considered at any time in the Council's determination process may be considered for a Proposed Determination in the future at the Council's discretion.</P>

            <P>A nonbank financial company that is subject to a Proposed Determination may request a nonpublic hearing to contest the Proposed Determination in accordance with section 113(e) of the Dodd-Frank Act. If the nonbank financial company requests a hearing in accordance with the procedures set <PRTPAGE P="522"/>forth in § 1310.21(c) of the Council's rule,<SU>9</SU>
              <FTREF/> the Council will set a time and place for such hearing. The Council will (after a hearing, if a hearing is requested), determine by a vote of two-thirds of the voting members of the Council (including the affirmative vote of the Chairperson) whether to subject such company to supervision by the Board of Governors and prudential standards. The Council will provide the nonbank financial company with written notice of the Council's final determination, including an explanation of the basis for the Council's decision. When practicable and consistent with the purposes of the determination process, the Council intends to provide a nonbank financial company with a notice of a final determination at least one business day before publicly announcing the determination pursuant to § 1310.21(d)(3), § 1310.21(e)(3) or § 1310.22(d)(3) of the Council's rule.<SU>10</SU>
              <FTREF/> The Council does not intend to publicly announce the name of any nonbank financial company that is under evaluation for a determination prior to a final determination with respect to such company. In accordance with section 113(h) of the Dodd-Frank Act, a nonbank financial company that is subject to a final determination may bring an action in U.S. district court for an order requiring that the determination be rescinded.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Official records of the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation shall, upon any request for records which reasonably describes them and is made in accordance with the provisions of this subpart, make the records available as promptly as practicable to any person, except exempt records, which include the following:</P>
            <P>(1) Records specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and are in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive order;</P>
            <P>(2) Records related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation, including matters which are for the guidance of agency personnel;</P>
            <P>(3) Records which are specifically exempted from disclosure by statute;</P>
            <P>(4) Trade secret, commercial, proprietary, or financial information obtained from any person or organization and privileged or confidential;</P>
            <P>(5) Inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a private party in litigation with the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation or in litigation in which the United States, as a real party in interest on behalf of the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation, is a party;</P>
            <P>(6) Personnel and similar files, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;</P>
            <P>(7) Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records or information:</P>
            <P>(i) Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings;</P>
            <P>(ii) Would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication;</P>
            <P>(iii) Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;</P>
            <P>(iv) Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source, including a State, local, or foreign agency or authority or any private institution which furnished information on a confidential basis, and, in the case of a record or information compiled by criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, information furnished by a confidential source;</P>
            <P>(v) Would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law; or</P>
            <P>(vi) Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual; and</P>
            <P>(8) Records of or related to examination, operation, reports of condition and performance, or reports of or related to Farm Credit System institutions and that are prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation.</P>
            <P>(b) Any reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided to any person requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt under this section.</P>
            <P>(c) This section does not authorize withholding of information or limit the availability of records to the public, except as specifically stated in this section. This section is not authority to withhold information from Congress.</P>

            <P>The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation will make available for public inspection and copying a current index to provide identifying information as to any matter required by 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2)(C) to be made available or published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> Because of the anticipated infrequency of requests for material required to be indexed, it is determined that the publication of the index in the <E T="04">Federal <PRTPAGE P="533"/>Register</E> is unnecessary and impracticable. However, the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation will provide a copy of such index to a member of the public upon request therefor at a cost not in excess of the direct cost of duplication.</P>

            <P>Requests for records shall be in writing and addressed to the attention of the Freedom of Information Officer, Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation, McLean, Virginia 22102. A request improperly addressed will be deemed not to have been received for purposes of the 20-day time period set forth in § 1402.14(a) of this part until it is received, or would have been received, by the Freedom of Information Officer, with the exercise of due diligence by Corporation personnel. Records requested in conformance with this subpart and which are not exempt records may be received in person or by mail as specified in the request. Records to be received in person will be available for inspection or copying during business hours on a regular business day in the office of the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation, 1501 Farm Credit Drive, McLean, Virginia, 22102.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Response to requests for records.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Within 20 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays), or any extensions thereof as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, of the receipt of a request by the Freedom of Information Officer, the Freedom of Information Officer shall determine whether to comply with or deny such a request and transmit a written notice thereof to the requester.</P>
            <P>(b) Within 90 days of the receipt of a notice denying, in whole or in part, a request for records, the requester may appeal the denial. The appeal shall be in writing addressed to the Chief Financial Officer, Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation, McLean, Virginia 22102, and both the letter and envelope shall clearly be marked “FOIA Appeal.” An appeal improperly addressed shall be deemed not to have been received for purposes of the 20-day time period set forth in paragraph (c) of this section until it is received, or would have been received with the exercise of due diligence by Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation personnel. You also have the right to seek dispute resolution services from the Corporation's FOIA Public Liaison, McLean, Virginia 22102, and the Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road—OGIS, College Park, Maryland 20740-6001.</P>

            <P>(c) Within 20 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays), or any extension thereof as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, of the receipt of an appeal, the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation shall act upon the appeal and place a notice of the determination thereof in writing in the mail addressed to the requester. If the determination on the appeal upholds in whole or in part the denial of the request for records, or, if a determination on the appeal has not been mailed at the end of the 20-day period or the last extension thereof, the requester is deemed to have exhausted that person's administrative remedies, giving rise to a right of review in a district court of the United States as specified in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4). When a determination cannot be mailed within the applicable time limit, the appeal will nevertheless be processed. In such case, upon the expiration of the time limit, the requester will be informed of the reason for the delay, of the date on which a determination may be expected to be mailed, and of that person's right to seek judicial review. The requester may be asked to forego judicial review until determination of the appeal.<PRTPAGE P="534"/>
            </P>

            <P>(d) In “unusual circumstances,” the 20-day time limit prescribed in paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section, or both, may be extended by the Freedom of Information Officer or, in the case of an appeal, by the General Counsel, provided that the total of all extensions does not exceed 10 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays). Extensions shall be made by written notice to the requester setting forth the reason for the extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be dispatched. As used in this paragraph, <E T="03">“unusual circumstances”</E> means, but only to the extent reasonably necessary to the proper processing of the request:</P>
            <P>(1) The need to search for and collect the requested records from facilities or other establishments that are separate from the office processing the request;</P>
            <P>(2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in a single request; or</P>
            <P>(3) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or more components of the agency having a substantial subject matter interest therein.</P>
            <P>(e) A requester may obtain, upon request, expedited processing of a request for records when the requester demonstrates a “compelling need” for the information. The Freedom of Information Officer will notify the requester within 10 calendar days after receipt of such a request whether the Corporation granted expedited processing. If expedited processing was granted, the request will be processed as soon as practicable.</P>
            <P>(1) For the purposes of this paragraph, “<E T="03">compelling need</E>” means:</P>
            <P>(i) That a failure to obtain requested records on an expedited basis could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or</P>
            <P>(ii) With respect to a request made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information, urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity.</P>
            <P>(2) A requester shall demonstrate a compelling need by a statement certified by the requester to be true and correct to the best of such person's knowledge and belief.</P>
            <P>(3) The procedures of this paragraph (e) for expedited processing apply to both requests for information and to administrative appeals.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Business information.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Business information provided to the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation by a business submitter shall not be disclosed pursuant to a Freedom of Information Act request except in accordance with this section. The requirements of this section shall not apply if:</P>
            <P>(1) The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation determines that the information should not be disclosed;</P>
            <P>(2) The information lawfully has been published or otherwise made available to the public; or</P>
            <P>(3) Disclosure of the information is required by law (other than 5 U.S.C. 552).</P>
            <P>(b) For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Business information</E> means trade secrets or other commercial or financial information.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Business submitter</E> means any person or entity which provides business information to the government.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Requester</E> means the person or entity making the Freedom of Information Act request.</P>
            <P>(c)(1) The Freedom of Information Officer shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide a business submitter with prompt written notice of a request encompassing its business information whenever required under paragraph (d) of this section. Such notice shall either describe the exact nature of the business information requested or provide copies of the records or portions thereof containing the business information.</P>

            <P>(2) Whenever the Freedom of Information Officer provides a business submitter with the notice set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the Freedom of Information Officer shall notify the requester that the request <PRTPAGE P="535"/>includes information that may arguably be exempt from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4) and that the person or entity who submitted the information to the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation has been given the opportunity to comment on the proposed disclosure of information.</P>
            <P>(d)(1) The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation shall provide a business submitter with notice of a request whenever:</P>
            <P>(i) The business submitter has in good faith designated the information as commercially or financially sensitive information; or</P>
            <P>(ii) The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation has reason to believe that the disclosure of the information may result in commercial or financial injury to the business submitter.</P>
            <P>(2) Notice of a request for business information falling within paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section shall be required for a period of not more than 10 years after the date of submission unless the business submitter requests and provides acceptable justification for a specific notice period of greater duration.</P>
            <P>(3) Whenever possible, the business submitter's claim of confidentiality should be supported by a statement or certification by an officer or authorized representative of the business submitter that the information in question is in fact a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential.</P>
            <P>(e) Through the notice described in paragraph (c) of this section, the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation shall, to the extent permitted by law, afford a business submitter a reasonable period within which it can provide the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation with a detailed statement of any objection to disclosure. Such statement shall specify all grounds for withholding any of the information under any exemption of the Freedom of Information Act and, in the case of the exemption provided by 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), shall demonstrate why the information is contended to be a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential. Information provided by a business submitter pursuant to this paragraph may itself be subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
            <P>(f)(1) The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation shall consider carefully a business submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure prior to determining whether to disclose business information. Whenever the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation decides to disclose business information over the objection of a business submitter, the Freedom of Information Officer shall forward to the business submitter a written notice which shall include:</P>
            <P>(i) A statement of the reasons for which the business submitter's disclosure objections were not sustained;</P>
            <P>(ii) A description of the business information to be disclosed; and</P>
            <P>(iii) A specified disclosure date.</P>
            <P>(2) The notice of intent to disclose required by this paragraph shall be sent, to the extent permitted by law, within a reasonable number of days prior to the specified date upon which disclosure is intended.</P>
            <P>(3) The Freedom of Information Officer shall send a copy of such disclosure notice to the requester at the same time the notice is sent to the business submitter.</P>
            <P>(g) Whenever a requester brings suit seeking to compel disclosure of business information covered by paragraph (d) of this section, the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation shall promptly notify the business submitter of such action.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1402.20</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>For the purpose of this subpart, the following definitions shall apply:</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Commercial use request</E> means a request for information that is from or on behalf of an individual or entity seeking information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or on whose behalf the request is being made. To determine whether a request is properly classified as a commercial use request, the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation shall determine the purpose for which the documents requested will be used. If the <PRTPAGE P="536"/>Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation has reasonable cause to doubt the purpose specified in the request, for which a requester will use the records sought, or where the purpose is not clear from the request itself, the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation shall seek additional clarification before assigning the request to a specified category.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Direct costs</E> means those expenditures the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation actually incurs in searching for and reproducing documents to respond to a request for information. In the case of a commercial use request, the term also means those expenditures the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation actually incurs in reviewing documents to respond to the request. The direct cost shall include the salary of the employee performing work (the basic rate of pay for the employee plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating reproduction equipment. Not included in direct costs are overhead expenses such as costs of space, and heating or lighting the facility in which the records are stored.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Educational institution</E> means a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an institution of graduate higher education, an institution of professional education, and an institution of vocational education that operates a program or programs of scholarly research.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Noncommercial scientific institution</E> refers to an institution that is not operated on a commercial, trade, or profit basis and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Representative of the news media</E> means any person actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public. The term <E T="03">news</E> means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of periodicals (but only in those instances when the periodicals can qualify as disseminators of “news”) who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the general public. These examples are not intended to be all-inclusive. As traditional methods of news delivery evolve (e.g., electronic dissemination of newspapers through telecommunication services), such alternative media would be included in this category. “Freelance” journalists may be regarded as working for a news organization if they can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that organization even though they are not actually employed by the organization. A publication contract would be the clearest proof that a journalist is working for a news organization, but the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation may look to a requester's past publication record to determine whether a journalist is working for a news organization.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Reproduce</E> and <E T="03">reproduction</E> mean the process of making a copy of a document necessary to respond to a request for information. Such copies take the form of paper copy, microfilm, audio-visual materials, or machine readable documentation (e.g., magnetic tape or disk), among others. The copy provided shall be in a form that is reasonably usable by requesters.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Review</E> means the process of examining documents located in response to a request for information to determine whether any portion of any document located is permitted to be withheld. It also includes processing any documents for disclosure (e.g., doing all that is necessary to prepare the documents for release). The term review does not include the time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions. The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation shall only charge fees for reviewing documents in response to a commercial use request.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Search</E> includes all time spent looking for material that is responsive to a request for information, including page-by-page or line-by-line identification of material within documents. Searching for material shall be done in the most efficient and least expensive manner so as to minimize the costs of <PRTPAGE P="537"/>the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation and the requester. For example, a line-by-line search for responsive material should not be performed when merely reproducing an entire document would be the less expensive and the faster method of complying with a request for information. Searches may be done manually or by computer using existing programming. A “search” for material that is responsive to a request should be distinguished from a “review” of material to determine whether the material is exempt from disclosure.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Categories of requesters—fees.</SUBJECT>
            <P>There are four categories of requesters: Commercial use requesters; educational and noncommercial scientific institutions; representatives of the news media; and all other requesters.</P>
            <P>(a) The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation shall charge fees for records requested by or on behalf of educational institutions and noncommercial scientific institutions in an amount which equals the cost of reproducing the documents responsive to the request, excluding the costs of reproducing the first 100 pages. For a request to be included in this category, requesters must show that the request being made is authorized by and under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use but are sought in furtherance of scholarly research (if the request is from an educational institution) or scientific research (if the request is from a noncommercial scientific institution).</P>
            <P>(b) The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation shall charge fees for records requested by representatives of the news media in an amount which equals the cost of reproducing the documents responsive to the request, excluding the costs of reproducing the first 100 pages. For a request to be included in this category, the requester must qualify as a representative of the news media and the request must not be made for a commercial use. A request for records supporting the news dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered to be a request that is for a commercial use.</P>
            <P>(c) The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation shall charge fees for records requested by persons or entities making a commercial use request in an amount that equals the full direct costs for searching for, reviewing for release, and reproducing the records sought. Commercial use requesters are not entitled to 2 hours of free search time nor 100 free pages of reproduction of documents. In accordance with § 1402.26, commercial use requesters may be charged the costs of searching for and reviewing records even if there is ultimately no disclosure of records.</P>
            <P>(d) The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation shall charge fees for records requested by persons or entities that are not classified in any of the categories listed in paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) of this section in an amount that equals the full reasonable direct cost of searching for and reproducing records that are responsive to the request, excluding the first 2 hours of search time and the cost of reproducing the first 100 pages of records. In accordance with § 1402.26, requesters in this category may be charged the cost of searching for records even if there is ultimately no disclosure of records, excluding the first 2 hours of search time.</P>

            <P>(e) For purposes of the exceptions contained in this section on assessment of fees, the word <E T="03">pages</E> refers to paper copies of “8<FR>1/2</FR> × 11” or “11 × 14.” Thus, requesters are not entitled to 100 microfiche or 100 computer disks, for example. A microfiche containing the equivalent of 100 pages or a computer disk containing the equivalent of 100 pages of computer printout meets the terms of the exception.</P>

            <P>(f) For purposes of paragraph (d) of this section, the term <E T="03">search time</E> has as its basis, manual search. To apply this term to searches made by computer, the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation will determine the hourly cost of operating the central processing unit and the operator's hourly salary plus 16 percent of that rate. When the cost of search (including the operator time and the cost of operating the computer to process a request) equals the equivalent dollar amount of 2 hours of the salary of the person performing the search, i.e., the operator, the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation <PRTPAGE P="538"/>will begin assessing charges for computer search.</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 1402.22</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Fees to be charged.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Generally, the fees charged for requests for records shall cover the full allowable direct costs of searching for, reproducing, and reviewing documents that are responsive to a request for information.</P>
            <P>(b) Manual searches for records will be charged at the salary rate(s) (i.e., basic pay plus 16 percent of that rate) of the employee(s) making the search.</P>
            <P>(c) Computer searches for records will be charged at the actual direct cost of providing the service. This will include the cost of operating the central processing unit for that portion of operating time that is directly attributable to searching for records and the operator/programmer salary apportionable to the search. A charge shall also be made for any substantial amounts of special supplies or materials used to contain, present, or make available the output of computers, based upon the prevailing levels of costs to the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation for the type and amount of such supplies of materials that are used. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to entitle any person or entity, as a right, to any services in connection with computerized records, other than services to which such person or entity may be entitled under the provisions of this subpart.</P>
            <P>(d) Only requesters who are seeking documents for commercial use may be charged for time spent reviewing records to determine whether they are exempt from mandatory disclosure. Charges may be assessed only for the initial review; i.e., the review undertaken the first time the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation analyzes the applicability of a specific exemption to a particular record or portion of a record. Records or portions of records withheld in full under an exemption that is subsequently determined not to apply may be reviewed again to determine the applicability of other exemptions not previously considered. The costs for such a subsequent review is assessable.</P>
            <P>(e) Records will be reproduced at a rate of $.15 per page. For copies prepared by computer, such as tapes or printouts, the requester shall be charged the actual cost, including operator time, of production of the tape or printout. For other methods of reproduction, the actual direct costs of producing the document(s) shall be charged.</P>
            <P>(f) The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation will recover the full costs of providing services such as those enumerated below when it elects to provide them:</P>
            <P>(1) Certifying that records are true copies; or</P>
            <P>(2) Sending records by special methods such as express mail.</P>
            <P>(g) Remittances shall be in the form either of a personal check or bank draft drawn on a bank in the United States, or a postal money order. Remittances shall be made payable to the order of the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation.</P>
            <P>(h) We will not assess fees if we fail to comply with any time limit under the FOIA or these regulations, and have not timely notified the requester, in writing, that an unusual circumstance exists. If an unusual circumstance exists, and timely, written notice is given to the requester, we may be excused an additional 10 working days before fees are automatically waived under this paragraph (h).</P>
            <P>(i) If we determine that unusual circumstances apply and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to a request, we may charge fees if we provided a timely, written notice to the requester and discussed with the requester via mail, Email, or telephone (or made at least three good faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request.</P>
            <P>(j) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist, a failure to comply with time limits imposed by these regulations or FOIA shall be excused for the length of time provided by court order.</P>
            <P>(k) A receipt for fees paid will be given upon request.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Waiver or reduction of fees.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation may grant a waiver or reduction of fees if the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation determines that the disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Government, and the disclosure of the information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.</P>
            <P>(b) The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation will not charge fees to any requester, including commercial use requesters, if the cost of collecting a fee would be equal to or greater than the fee itself. The elements to be considered in determining the “cost of collecting a fee” are the administrative costs of receiving and recording a requester's remittance and processing the fee.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Advance payments—notice.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Where it is anticipated that the fees chargeable will amount to more than $25 and the requester has not indicated in advance a willingness to pay fees as high as are anticipated, the requester shall be promptly notified of the amount of the anticipated fee or such portion thereof that can be readily estimated.</P>
            <P>(b) If the anticipated fees exceed $250 and if the requester has a history of promptly paying fees charged in connection with information requests, the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation may obtain satisfactory assurances that the requester will fully pay the fees anticipated.</P>
            <P>(c) If the anticipated fees exceed $250 and if the requester has no history of paying fees charged in connection with information requests, the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation may require an advance payment of fees in an amount up to the full amount anticipated.</P>
            <P>(d) If the requester has previously failed to pay a fee charged within 30 days of the date of a billing for fees charged in connection with information requests, the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation may require the requester to pay the fees owed, plus interest, or demonstrate that the full amount owed has been paid, and require the requester to make an advance payment of the full amount of the fees anticipated before processing a new request or a pending request from that requester.</P>
            <P>(e) The notice of the amount of an anticipated fee or a request for an advance deposit shall include an offer to the requester to confer with identified Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation personnel to attempt to reformulate the request in a manner which will meet the needs of the requester at a lower cost.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Interest.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation may begin charging interest on unpaid fees, starting on the 31st day following the day on which the bill for such fees was sent. Interest will not accrue if payment of the fees has been received by the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation, even if said payment has not been processed. Interest will accrue at the rate prescribed in section 3717 of title 31, United States Code, and will accrue from the day on which the bill for such fees was sent.</P>

            <P>The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation may assess charges for time spent searching for records on behalf of requesters in the categories provided for in § 1402.21 (c) and (d), even if there are no records that are responsive to the request or there is ultimately no disclosure of records. The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation may assess charges for time spent reviewing records for requesters in the category provided for in § 1402.21(c) even if the records located are determined to be exempt from disclosure.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Aggregating requests.</SUBJECT>

            <P>A requester may not file multiple requests at the same time, each seeking portions of a document or documents, solely in order to avoid payment of fees. When the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation reasonably believes that a requester, or a group of requesters acting in concert, is attempting to break a request down into <PRTPAGE P="540"/>a series of requests for the purpose of evading the assessment of fees, the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation may aggregate any such requests and charge accordingly. One element to be considered in determining whether a belief would be reasonable is the time period over which the requests have occurred.</P>

            <P>The Corporation official(s) designated by the Chairman of the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation are authorized to perform all duties which the Chairman is authorized to perform under these regulations, the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended, and the joint regulations issued under that Act.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1408.5</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Responsibility for collection.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The collection of claims shall be aggressively pursued in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended, the joint regulations issued under that Act, and these regulations. Debts owed to the United States, together with charges for interest, penalties, and administrative costs, should be collected in one lump sum unless otherwise provided by law. If a debtor requests installment payments, the debtor, as requested by the Corporation, shall provide sufficient information to demonstrate that the debtor is unable to pay the debt in one lump sum. When appropriate, the Corporation shall arrange an installment payment schedule. Claims which cannot be collected directly or by administrative offset shall be either written off as administratively uncollectible or referred to the General Counsel for further consideration.</P>
            <P>(b) The Chairman, or designee of the Chairman, may compromise claims for money or property arising out of the activities of the Corporation, where the claim (exclusive of charges for interest, penalties, and administrative costs) does not exceed $100,000. When the claim exceeds $100,000 (exclusive of charges for interest, penalties, and administrative costs), the authority to accept a compromise rests solely with the Department of Justice. The standards governing the compromise of claims are set forth in 4 CFR part 103.</P>
            <P>(c) The Chairman, or designee of the Chairman, may suspend or terminate the collection of claims which do not exceed $100,000 (exclusive of charges for interest, penalties, and administrative costs) after deducting the amount of any partial payments or collections. If, after deducting the amount of any partial payments or collections, a claim exceeds $100,000 (exclusive of charges for interest, penalties, and administrative costs), the authority to suspend or terminate rests solely with the Department of Justice. The standards governing the suspension or termination of claim collections are set forth in 4 CFR part 104.</P>
            <P>(d) The Corporation shall refer claims to the Department of Justice for litigation or to the General Accounting Office (GAO) for claims arising from audit exceptions taken by the GAO to payments made by the Corporation in accordance with 4 CFR part 105.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1408.6</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Demand for payment.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A total of three progressively stronger written demands at not more than 30-day intervals should normally be made upon a debtor, unless a response or other information indicates that additional written demands would either be unnecessary or futile. When necessary to protect the Government's interest, written demands may be preceded by other appropriate actions under Federal law, including immediate referral for litigation and/or administrative offset.</P>
            <P>(b) The initial demand for payment shall be in writing and shall inform the debtor of the following:</P>
            <P>(1) The amount of the debt, the date it was incurred, and the facts upon which the determination of indebtedness was made;</P>
            <P>(2) The payment due date, which shall be 30 calendar days from the date of mailing or hand delivery of the initial demand for payment;</P>
            <P>(3) The right of the debtor to inspect and copy the records of the agency related to the claim or to receive copies if personal inspection is impractical. The debtor shall be informed that the debtor may be assessed for the cost of copying the documents in accordance with § 1408.7;</P>
            <P>(4) The right of the debtor to obtain a review of the Corporation's determination of indebtedness;</P>
            <P>(5) The right of the debtor to offer to enter into a written agreement with the agency to repay the amount of the claim. The debtor shall be informed that the acceptance of such an agreement is discretionary with the agency;</P>
            <P>(6) That charges for interest, penalties, and administrative costs will be assessed against the debtor, in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717, if payment is not received by the payment due date;</P>
            <P>(7) That if the debtor has not entered into an agreement with the Corporation to pay the debt, has not requested the Corporation to review the debt, or has not paid the debt by the payment due date, the Corporation intends to collect the debt by all legally available means, which may include initiating legal action against the debtor, referring the debt to a collection agency for collection, collecting the debt by offset, or asking other Federal agencies for assistance in collecting the debt by offset;</P>
            <P>(8) The name and address of the Corporation official to whom the debtor shall send all correspondence relating to the debt; and</P>
            <P>(9) Other information, as may be appropriate.</P>
            <P>(c) If, prior to, during, or after completion of the demand cycle, the Corporation determines to collect the debt by either administrative or salary offset, the Corporation shall follow, as applicable, the requirements for a Notice of Intent to Collect by Administrative Offset or a Notice of Intent to Collect by Salary Offset set forth in § 1408.22.</P>
            <P>(d) If no response to the initial demand for payment is received by the payment due date, the Corporation shall take further action under this part, under the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended, under the joint regulations (4 CFR parts 101-105), or under any other applicable State or Federal law. These actions may include reports to credit bureaus, referrals to collection agencies, termination of contracts, debarment, and salary or administrative offset.</P>

            <P>The debtor may inspect and copy the Corporation records related to the claim. The debtor shall give the Corporation reasonable advanced notice that he/she intends to inspect and copy the records involved. The debtor shall pay copying costs unless they are waived by the Corporation. Copying costs shall be assessed pursuant to § 1402.22 of this chapter.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Right to offer to repay claim.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The debtor may offer to enter into a written agreement with the Corporation to repay the amount of the claim. The acceptance of such an offer and the decision to enter into such a written agreement is at the discretion of the Corporation.</P>

            <P>(b) If the debtor requests a repayment arrangement because payment of the amount due would create a financial hardship, the Corporation shall analyze the debtor's financial condition. The Corporation may enter into a <PRTPAGE P="546"/>written agreement with the debtor permitting the debtor to repay the debt in installments if the Corporation determines, in its sole discretion, that payment of the amount due would create an undue financial hardship for the debtor. The written agreement shall set forth the amount and frequency of installment payments and shall, in accordance with § 1408.12, provide for the imposition of charges for interest, penalties, and administrative costs unless waived by the Corporation.</P>
            <P>(c) The written agreement may require the debtor to execute a confess-judgment note when the total amount of the deferred installments will exceed $750. The Corporation shall provide the debtor with a written explanation of the consequences of signing a confess-judgment note. The debtor shall sign a statement acknowledging receipt of the written explanation. The statement shall recite that the written explanation was read and understood before execution of the note and that the debtor signed the note knowingly and voluntarily. Documentation of these procedures will be maintained in the Corporation's file on the debtor.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Right to agency review.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) If the debtor disputes the claim, the debtor may request a review of the Corporation's determination of the existence of the debt or of the amount of the debt. If only part of the claim is disputed, the undisputed portion should be paid by the payment due date.</P>
            <P>(b) To obtain a review, the debtor shall submit a written request for review to the Corporation official named in the initial demand letter, within 15 calendar days after receipt of the letter. The debtor's request for review shall state the basis on which the claim is disputed.</P>
            <P>(c) The Corporation shall promptly notify the debtor, in writing, that the Corporation has received the request for review. The Corporation shall conduct its review of the claim in accordance with § 1408.10.</P>
            <P>(d) Upon completion of its review of the claim, the Corporation shall notify the debtor whether the Corporation's determination of the existence or amount of the debt has been sustained, amended, or canceled. The notification shall include a copy of the written decision issued by the hearing official pursuant to § 1408.10(e). If the Corporation's determination is sustained, this notification shall contain a provision which states that the Corporation intends to collect the debt by all legally available means, which may include initiating legal action against the debtor, referring the debt to a collection agency for collection, collecting the debt by offset, or asking other Federal agencies for assistance in collecting the debt by offset.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Review procedures.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Unless an oral hearing is required by § 1408.23(d), the Corporation's review shall be a review of the written record of the claim.</P>
            <P>(b) If an oral hearing is required under § 1408.23(d) the Corporation shall provide the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for such a hearing. The oral hearing, however, shall not be an adversarial adjudication and need not take the form of a formal evidentiary hearing. All significant matters discussed at the hearing, however, will be carefully documented.</P>
            <P>(c) Any review required by this part, whether a review of the written record or an oral hearing, shall be conducted by a hearing official. In the case of a salary offset, the hearing official shall not be under the supervision or control of the Chairman of the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation.</P>
            <P>(d) The Corporation may be represented by legal counsel. The debtor may represent himself or herself or may be represented by an individual of the debtor's choice and at the debtor's expense.</P>

            <P>(e) The hearing official shall issue a final written decision based on documentary evidence and, if applicable, information developed at an oral hearing. The written decision shall be issued as soon as practicable after the review but not later than 60 days after the date on which the request for review was received by the Corporation, unless the debtor requests a delay in the proceedings. A delay in the proceedings shall be granted if the hearing official determines, in his or her sole discretion, that there is good cause to grant <PRTPAGE P="547"/>the delay. If a delay is granted, the 60-day decision period shall be extended by the number of days by which the review was postponed.</P>
            <P>(f) Upon issuance of the written opinion, the Corporation shall promptly notify the debtor of the hearing official's decision. Said notification shall include a copy of the written decision issued by the hearing official pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Special review.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) An employee subject to salary offset, under subpart C of this part, or a voluntary repayment agreement, may, at any time, request a special review by the Corporation of the amount of the salary offset or voluntary repayment, based on materially changed circumstances such as, but not limited to, catastrophic illness, divorce, death, or disability.</P>
            <P>(b) To determine whether an offset would prevent the employee from meeting essential subsistence expenses (costs incurred for food, housing, clothing, transportation, and medical care), the employee shall submit a detailed statement and supporting documents for the employee, his or her spouse, and dependents indicating:</P>
            <P>(1) Income from all sources;</P>
            <P>(2) Assets;</P>
            <P>(3) Liabilities;</P>
            <P>(4) Number of dependents;</P>
            <P>(5) Expenses for food, housing, clothing, and transportation;</P>
            <P>(6) Medical expenses; and</P>
            <P>(7) Exceptional expenses, if any.</P>
            <P>(c) If the employee requests a special review under this section, the employee shall file an alternative proposed offset or payment schedule and a statement, with supporting documents, showing why the current salary offset or payments result in an extreme financial hardship to the employee.</P>
            <P>(d) The Corporation shall evaluate the statement and supporting documents, and determine whether the original offset or repayment schedule imposes an undue financial hardship on the employee. The Corporation shall notify the employee in writing of such determination, including, if appropriate, a revised offset or payment schedule.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Charges for interest, administrative costs, and penalties.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the Corporation shall:</P>
            <P>(1) Assess interest on unpaid claims;</P>
            <P>(2) Assess administrative costs incurred in processing and handling overdue claims; and</P>
            <P>(3) Assess penalty charges not to exceed 6 percent a year on any part of a debt more than 90 days past due.</P>
            <P>The imposition of charges for interest, administrative costs, and penalties shall be made in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717.</P>
            <P>(b)(1) Interest shall accrue from the date of mailing or hand delivery of the initial demand for payment or the Notice of Intent to Collect by either Administrative or Salary Offset if the amount of the claim is not paid within 30 days from the date of mailing or hand delivery of the initial demand or notice.</P>
            <P>(2) The 30-day period may be extended on a case-by-case basis if the Corporation reasonably determines that such action is appropriate. Interest shall only accrue on the principal of the claim and the interest rate shall remain fixed for the duration of the indebtedness, except, as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, in cases where a debtor has defaulted on a repayment agreement and seeks to enter into a new agreement, or if the Corporation reasonably determines that a higher rate is necessary to protect the interests of the United States.</P>
            <P>(c) If a debtor defaults on a repayment agreement and seeks to enter into a new agreement, the Corporation may assess a new interest rate on the unpaid claim. In addition, charges for interest, administrative costs, and penalties which accrued but were not collected under the original repayment agreement shall be added to the principal of the claim to be paid under the new repayment agreement. Interest shall accrue on the entire principal balance of the claim, as adjusted to reflect any increase resulting from the addition of these charges.</P>

            <P>(d) The Corporation may waive charges for interest, administrative costs, and/or penalties if it determines that:<PRTPAGE P="548"/>
            </P>
            <P>(1) The debtor is unable to pay any significant sum toward the claim within a reasonable period of time;</P>
            <P>(2) Collection of charges for interest, administrative costs, and/or penalties would jeopardize collection of the principal of the claim;</P>
            <P>(3) Collection of charges for interest, administrative costs, or penalties would be against equity and good conscience; or</P>
            <P>(4) It is otherwise in the best interest of the United States, including the situation where an installment payment agreement or offset is in effect.</P>

            <P>(2) The degree to which the Corporation is certain that its determination of the existence and amount of the debt is correct;</P>
            <P>(3) The practicality of collecting the debt by offset. The cost, in time and money, of collecting the debt by offset and the amount of money which can reasonably be expected to be recovered through offset will be relevant to this determination; and</P>
            <P>(4) Whether the use of offset will substantially interfere with or defeat the purpose of a program authorizing payments against which the offset is contemplated. For example, under a grant program in which payments are made in advance of the grantee's performance, the imposition of offset against such a payment may be inappropriate.</P>
            <P>(d) The collection of a debt by offset may not be feasible when there are circumstances which would indicate that the likelihood of collection by offset is less than probable.</P>
            <P>(e) The offset will be effected 31 days after the debtor receives a Notice of Intent to Collect by Administrative Offset (or Notice of Intent to Collect by Salary Offset if the offset is a salary offset), or upon the expiration of a stay of offset, unless the Corporation determines under § 1408.24 that immediate action is necessary.</P>
            <P>(f) If the debtor owes more than one debt, amounts recovered through offset may be applied to them in any order. Applicable statutes of limitation would be considered before applying the amounts recovered to any debts owed.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Notice requirements before offset.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Except as provided in § 1408.24, the Corporation will provide the debtor with 30 calendar days' written notice that unpaid debt amounts shall be collected by administrative [or salary] offset (Notice of Intent to Collect by Administrative [or Salary] Offset) before the Corporation imposes offset against any money that is to be paid to the debtor.</P>
            <P>(b) The Notice of Intent to Collect by Administrative [or Salary] Offset shall be delivered to the debtor by hand or by mail and shall provide the following information:</P>
            <P>(1) The amount of the debt, the date it was incurred, and the facts upon which the determination of indebtedness was made;</P>
            <P>(2) In the case of an administrative offset, the payment due date, which shall be 30 calendar days from the date of mailing or hand delivery of the Notice;</P>

            <P>(4) The right of the debtor to inspect and copy the records of the Corporation related to the claim or to receive copies if personal inspection is impractical. The debtor shall be informed that he/she shall be assessed for the cost of copying the documents in accordance with § 1408.7 of this part;</P>
            <P>(5) The right of the debtor to obtain a review of, and to request a hearing, on the Corporation's determination of indebtedness, the propriety of collecting the debt by offset, and, in the case of salary offset, the propriety of the proposed repayment schedule (i.e., the percentage of disposable pay to be deducted each pay period). The debtor shall be informed that to obtain a review, the debtor shall deliver a written request for a review to the Corporation official named in the Notice, within 15 calendar days after the debtor's receipt of the Notice. In the case of a salary offset, the debtor shall also be informed that the review shall be conducted by an official arranged for by the Corporation who shall be a hearing official not under the control of the Chairman of the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation, or an administrative law judge;</P>

            <P>(6) That the filing of a petition for hearing within 15 calendar days after receipt of the Notice will stay the commencement of collection proceedings;<PRTPAGE P="550"/>

The debtor shall be informed that such assessments must be made unless excused in accordance with the Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR parts 103 and 104);</P>
            <P>(10) The amount of accrued interest and the amount of any other penalties or administrative costs which may have been added to the principal debt;</P>
            <P>(11) That if the debtor has not entered into an agreement with the Corporation to pay the debt, has not requested the Corporation to review the debt, or has not paid the debt prior to the date on which the offset is to be imposed, the Corporation intends to collect the debt by administrative [or salary] offset or by requesting other Federal agencies for assistance in collecting the debt by offset. The debtor shall be informed that the offset shall be imposed against any funds that might become available to the debtor, until the principal debt and all accumulated interest and other charges are paid in full;</P>
            <P>(12) The date on which the offset will be imposed, which shall be 31 calendar days from the date of mailing or hand delivery of the Notice. The debtor shall be informed that the Corporation reserves the right to impose an offset prior to this date if the Corporation determines that immediate action is necessary;</P>
            <P>(13) That any knowingly false or frivolous statements, representations, or evidence may subject the debtor to:</P>

            <P>(14) The name and address of the Corporation official to whom the debtor shall send all correspondence relating to the debt or the offset;</P>
            <P>(15) Any other rights and remedies available to the debtor under statutes or regulations governing the program for which the collection is being made;</P>
            <P>(16) That unless there are applicable contractual or statutory provisions to the contrary, amounts paid on or deducted for the debt, which are later waived or found not owed to the United States, will be promptly refunded to the employee; and</P>
            <P>(17) Other information, as may be appropriate.</P>
            <P>(c) When the procedural requirements of this section have been provided to the debtor in connection with the same debt or under some other statutory or regulatory authority, the Corporation is not required to duplicate those requirements before effecting offset.</P>

            <P>(a) If the debtor disputes the claim, the debtor may request a review of the Corporation's determination of the existence of the debt, the amount of the debt, the propriety of collecting the debt by offset, and in the case of salary offset, the propriety of the proposed repayment schedule. If only part of the claim is disputed, the undisputed portion should be paid by the payment due date.</P>

            <P>(b) To obtain a review, the debtor shall submit a written request for review to the Corporation official named in the Notice of Intent to Collect by Administrative [or Salary] Offset within 15 calendar days after receipt of the notice. The debtor's written request for review shall state the basis on which the claim is disputed and shall specify whether the debtor requests an oral hearing or a review of the written <PRTPAGE P="551"/>record of the claim. If an oral hearing is requested, the debtor shall explain in the request why the matter cannot be resolved by a review of the documentary evidence alone.</P>
            <P>(c) The Corporation shall promptly notify the debtor, in writing, that the Corporation has received the request for review. The Corporation shall conduct its review of the claim in accordance with § 1408.10.</P>
            <P>(d) The Corporation's review of the claim, under this section, shall include providing the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for an oral hearing if:</P>
            <P>(1) An applicable statute authorizes or requires the Corporation to consider waiver of the indebtedness, the debtor requests waiver of the indebtedness, and the waiver determination turns on an issue of credibility or veracity; or</P>
            <P>(2) The debtor requests reconsideration of the debt and the Corporation determines that the question of the indebtedness cannot be resolved by reviewing the documentary evidence; for example, when the validity of the debt turns on an issue of credibility or veracity.</P>
            <P>(e) A debtor waives the right to a hearing and will have his or her debt offset in accordance with the proposed offset schedule if the debtor:</P>
            <P>(1) Fails to file a written request for review within the timeframe set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, unless the Corporation determines that the delay was the result of circumstances beyond his or her control; or</P>
            <P>(2) Fails to appear at an oral hearing of which he or she was notified unless the hearing official determines that the failure to appear was due to circumstances beyond the employee's control.</P>
            <P>(f) Upon completion of its review of the claim, the Corporation shall notify the debtor whether the Corporation's determination of the existence or amount of the debt has been sustained, amended, or canceled. The notification shall include a copy of the written decision issued by the hearing official, pursuant to § 1408.10(e). If the Corporation's determination is sustained, this notification shall contain a provision which states that the Corporation intends to collect the debt by offset or by requesting other Federal agencies for assistance in collecting the debt.</P>
            <P>(g) When the procedural requirements of this section have been provided to the debtor in connection with the same debt or under some other statutory or regulatory authority, the Corporation is not required to duplicate those requirements before effecting offset.</P>

            <P>(a)(1) Any creditor agency which requests the Corporation to impose an offset against amounts owed to the debtor shall submit to the Corporation a claim certification which meets the requirements of this paragraph. The Corporation shall submit the same certification to any agency that the Corporation requests to effect an offset.</P>
            <P>(2) The claim certification shall be in writing. It shall certify the debtor owes the debt and that all of the applicable requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3716 and 4 CFR part 102 have been met. If the intended offset is to be a salary offset, a claim certification shall instead certify that the debtor owes the debt and that the applicable requirements of 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K, have been met.</P>

            <P>(3) A certification that the debtor owes the debt shall state the amount of the debt, the factual basis supporting the determination of indebtedness, and the date on which payment of the debt <PRTPAGE P="552"/>was due. A certification that the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3716 and 4 CFR part 102 have been met shall include a statement that the debtor has been sent a Notice of Intent to Collect by Administrative Offset at least 31 calendar days prior to the date of the intended offset or a statement that pursuant to 4 CFR 102.3(b)(5) said Notice was not required to be sent. A certification that the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K, have been met shall include a statement that the debtor has been sent a Notice of Intent to Collect by Salary Offset at least 31 calendar days prior to the date of the intended offset or a statement that pursuant to 4 CFR 102.3(b)(5) said Notice was not required to be sent.</P>
            <P>(b)(1) The Corporation shall not effect an offset requested by another Federal agency without first obtaining the claim certification required by paragraph (a) of this section. If the Corporation receives an incomplete claim certification, the Corporation shall return the claim certification with notice that a claim certification which complies with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section must be submitted to the Corporation before the Corporation will consider effecting an offset.</P>
            <P>(2) The Corporation may rely on the information contained in the claim certification provided by a requesting creditor agency. The Corporation is not authorized to review a creditor agency's determination of indebtedness.</P>
            <P>(c) Only the creditor agency may agree to enter into an agreement with the debtor for the repayment of the claim. Only the creditor agency may agree to compromise, suspend, or terminate collection of the claim.</P>
            <P>(d) The Corporation may decline, for good cause, a request by another agency to effect an offset. Good cause includes that the offset might disrupt, directly or indirectly, essential Corporation operations. The refusal and the reasons shall be sent in writing to the creditor agency.</P>

            <P>(a)(1) When a creditor agency receives a debtor's request for inspection of agency records, the offset is stayed for 10 calendar days beyond the date set for the record inspection.</P>
            <P>(2) When a creditor agency receives a debtor's offer to enter into a repayment agreement, the offset is stayed until the debtor is notified as to whether the proposed agreement is acceptable.</P>

            <P>(b) When offset is stayed, the amount of the debt and the amount of any accrued interest or other charges will be withheld from payments to the debtor. The withheld amounts shall not be applied against the debt until the stay expires. If withheld funds are later determined not to be subject to offset, they will be promptly refunded to the debtor.</P>

            <P>The purpose of this subpart is to implement section 5 of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365 (5 U.S.C. 5514)), which authorizes the collection of debts owed by Federal employees to the Federal Government by means of salary offsets. These regulations provide procedures for the collection of a debt owed to the Government by the <PRTPAGE P="553"/>imposition of a salary offset against amounts payable to a Federal employee as salary. These regulations are consistent with the regulations on salary offset published by the Office of Personnel Management, codified in 5 CFR part 550, subpart K. Since salary offset is a type of administrative offset, the requirements of subpart B also apply to salary offsets.</P>

            <P>(2) Where the Corporation is owed a debt by an individual who is currently employed by the Corporation; or</P>
            <P>(3) Where the Corporation currently employs an individual who owes a debt to another Federal agency. Upon receipt of proper certification from the creditor agency, the Corporation will offset the debtor-employee's salary in accordance with these regulations.</P>

            <P>(b) These regulations do not apply to the following: (1) Debts or claims arising under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (26 U.S.C. 1 <E T="03">et seq.</E>); the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 301 <E T="03">et seq.</E>); the tariff laws of the United States; or to any case where collection of a debt by salary offset is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute (e.g., travel advances in 5 U.S.C. 5705 and employee training expenses in 5 U.S.C. 4108).</P>
            <P>(2) Any adjustment to pay arising from an employee's election of coverage or a change in coverage under a Federal benefits program requiring periodic deductions from pay if the amount to be recovered was accumulated over four pay periods or less.</P>
            <P>(3) A claim which has been outstanding for more than 10 years after the creditor agency's right to collect the debt first accrued, unless facts material to the Government's right to collect were not known and could not reasonably have been known by the official or officials charged with the responsibility for discovery and collection of such debts.</P>

            <P>(a) The Chairman, or designee of the Chairman, shall determine the amount of an employee's disposable pay and the amount to be deducted from the employee's disposable pay at regular pay intervals.</P>
            <P>(b) Deductions shall begin within three official pay periods following the date of mailing or delivery of the Notice of Intent to Collect by Salary Offset.</P>
            <P>(c)(1) If the amount of the debt is equal to or is less than 15 percent of the employee's disposable pay, such debt should be collected in one lump-sum deduction.</P>
            <P>(2) If the amount of the debt is not collected in one lump-sum deduction, the debt shall be collected in installment deductions over a period of time not greater than the anticipated period of employment. The size and frequency of installment deductions will bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the employee's ability to pay. However, the amount deducted from any pay period will not exceed 15 percent of the employee's disposable pay for that period, unless the employee has agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount.</P>
            <P>(3) A deduction exceeding the 15-percent disposable pay limitation may be made from any final salary payment pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716 in order to liquidate the debt, whether the employee is being separated voluntarily or involuntarily.</P>
            <P>(4) Whenever an employee subject to salary offset is separated from the Corporation and the balance of the debt cannot be liquidated by offset of the final salary check pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716, the Corporation may offset any later payments of any kind against the balance of the debt.</P>
            <P>(d) In instances where two or more creditor agencies are seeking salary offsets against current employees of the Corporation or where two or more debts are owed to a single creditor agency, the Corporation, at its discretion, may determine whether one or more debts should be offset simultaneously within the 15-percent limitation. Debts owed to the Corporation should generally take precedence over debts owed to other agencies.</P>

            <P>(a) To request a paying agency to impose a salary offset against amounts owed to the debtor, the Corporation shall provide the paying agency with a claim certification which meets the requirements set forth in § 1408.25(a) of this part. The Corporation shall also provide the paying agency with a repayment schedule determined under the provisions of § 1408.39 or in accordance with a repayment agreement entered into with the debtor.</P>

            <P>(b) If the employee separates from the paying agency before the debt is paid in full, the paying agency shall certify the total amount collected on the debt. A copy of this certification shall be sent to the employee and a copy shall be sent to the Corporation. If the paying agency is aware that the employee is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, or other similar payments, it must provide written notification to the agency responsible for making such payments that the debtor owes a debt (including the amount) and that the provisions of this section have been fully complied with. However, the Corporation must submit a properly <PRTPAGE P="555"/>certified claim to the agency responsible for making such payments before the collection can be made.</P>
            <P>(c) When an employee transfers to another paying agency, the Corporation is not required to repeat the due process procedures set forth in 5 U.S.C. 5514 and this part to resume the collection. The Corporation shall, however, review the debt upon receiving the former paying agency's notice of the employee's transfer to make sure the collection is resumed by the new paying agency.</P>
            <P>(d) If a special review is conducted pursuant to § 1408.11 and results in a revised offset or repayment schedule, the Corporation shall provide a new claim certification to the paying agency.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Permissible golden parachute payments.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) A System institution may agree to make or may make a golden parachute payment if and to the extent that:</P>
          <P>(1) The FCA, with the written concurrence of the Corporation, determines that such a payment or agreement is permissible; or</P>
          <P>(2) Such an agreement is made in order to hire a person to become an IRP either at a time when the System institution satisfies or in an effort to prevent it from imminently satisfying any of the criteria set forth in § 1412.2(f)(1)(ii), and the FCA and the Corporation consent in writing to the amount and terms of the golden parachute payment. Such consent by the Corporation and the FCA shall not improve the IRP's position in the event of the insolvency of the institution since such consent can neither bind a receiver nor affect the provability of receivership claims. In the event that the institution is placed into receivership or conservatorship, the Corporation and/or the FCA shall not be obligated to pay the promised golden parachute and the IRP shall not be accorded preferential treatment on the basis of such prior approval; or</P>

          <P>(3) Such a payment is made pursuant to an agreement which provides for a reasonable severance payment, not to exceed 18-months' salary, to an IRP in the event of a change in control of the System institution; <E T="03">provided, however,</E>
            <PRTPAGE P="564"/>that the System institution shall obtain the consent of the FCA prior to making such a payment and this paragraph (a)(3) shall not apply to any change in control of System institution which results from an assisted transaction as described in section 5.61 of the Farm Credit Act; 12 U.S.C. 2277a-10 or the System institution being placed into conservatorship or receivership; and</P>
          <P>(4) A System institution or IRP making a request pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section shall demonstrate that it is not aware of any information, evidence, documents or other materials which would indicate that there is a reasonable basis to believe, at the time such payment is proposed to be made, that:</P>
          <P>(i) The IRP has committed any fraudulent act or omission, breach of trust or fiduciary duty, or insider abuse with regard to the System institution that has had or is likely to have a material adverse effect on the institution;</P>
          <P>(ii) The IRP is substantially responsible for the insolvency of, the appointment of a conservator or receiver for, or the troubled condition, as defined by applicable regulations concerning the System institution;</P>
          <P>(iii) The IRP has materially violated any applicable Federal or state law or regulation that has had or is likely to have a material effect on the System institution; and</P>
          <P>(iv) The IRP has violated or conspired to violate section 215, 657, 1006, 1014, or 1344 of title 18 of the United States Code or section 1341 or 1343 of such title affecting a Farm Credit System institution.</P>
          <P>(b) In making a determination under paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section the FCA and the Corporation may consider:</P>
          <P>(1) Whether, and to what degree, the IRP was in a position of managerial or fiduciary responsibility;</P>
          <P>(2) The length of time the IRP was affiliated with the System institution, and the degree to which the proposed payment represents reasonable compensation earned over the period of employment and reasonable payment for services rendered; and</P>
          <P>(3) Any other factors or circumstances which would indicate that the proposed payment would be contrary to the intent of the Act or this part.</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 1412.6</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Permissible indemnification payments.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) A System institution may make or agree to make reasonable indemnification payments to an IRP with respect to an administrative proceeding or civil action initiated by the FCA if:</P>
          <P>(1) The System institution's board of directors, in good faith, determines in writing after due investigation and consideration that the IRP acted in good faith and in a manner he/she believed to be in the best interests of the institution;</P>
          <P>(2) The System institution's board of directors, in good faith, determines in writing after due investigation and consideration that the payment of such expenses will not materially adversely affect the institution's safety and soundness;</P>
          <P>(3) The indemnification payments do not constitute prohibited indemnification payments as that term is defined in § 1412.2(l); and</P>
          <P>(4) The IRP agrees in writing to reimburse the System institution, to the extent not covered by payments from insurance or bonds purchased pursuant to § 1412.2(l)(2), for that portion of the advanced indemnification payments which subsequently become prohibited indemnification payments, as defined herein.</P>

          <P>(b) An IRP requesting indemnification payments shall not participate in any way in the board's discussion and approval of such payments; <E T="03">provided, however,</E> that such IRP may present his/her request to the board and respond to any inquiries from the board concerning his/her involvement in the circumstances giving rise to the administrative proceeding or civil action.</P>

          <P>(c) In the event that a majority of the members of the board of directors are named as respondents in an administrative proceeding or civil action and request indemnification, the remaining members of the board may authorize independent legal counsel to review the indemnification request and provide the remaining members of the board with a written opinion of counsel as to whether the conditions delineated in <PRTPAGE P="565"/>paragraph (a) of this section have been met. If independent legal counsel opines that said conditions have been met, the remaining members of the board of directors may rely on such opinion in authorizing the requested indemnification.</P>
          <P>(d) In the event that all of the members of the board of directors are named as respondents in an administrative proceeding or civil action and request indemnification, the board shall authorize independent legal counsel to review the indemnification request and provide the board with a written opinion of counsel as to whether the conditions delineated in paragraph (a) of this section have been met. If independent legal counsel opines that said conditions have been met, the board of directors may rely on such opinion in authorizing the requested indemnification.</P>

          <P>The provisions of this part or any consent or approval granted under the provisions of this part by the Corporation (in its corporate capacity), shall not in any way bind any receiver of a failed System institution. Any consent or approval granted under the provisions of this part by the Corporation or the FCA shall not in any way obligate such agency or receiver to pay any claim or obligation pursuant to any golden parachute, severance, indemnification or other agreement. Claims for employee welfare benefits or other benefits which are contingent, even if otherwise vested, when the Corporation is appointed as receiver for any System institution, including any contingency for termination of employment, are not provable claims or actual, direct compensatory damage claims against such receiver. Nothing in this part may be construed to permit the payment of salary or any liability or legal expense of any IRP contrary to 12 U.S.C. 2277a-10b(d).</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">What information must the request contain?</E> A request submitted under this section must be in writing and must:</P>

            <P>(iii) Changes or reasonably expected changes in the technology for delivering financial services; and</P>
            <P>(iv) Whether the activity is necessary or appropriate to allow a bank and the subsidiaries of a bank to—</P>
            <P>(A) Compete effectively with any company seeking to provide financial services in the United States;</P>

            <P>(B) Efficiently deliver information and services that are financial in nature through the use of technological <PRTPAGE P="577"/>means, including any application necessary to protect the security or efficacy of systems for the transmission of data or financial transactions; and</P>

            <P>(2) Because the Secretary is required to consider the factors in paragraph (c)(1) of this section in making his determination, any request should address the factors in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The Secretary may also consider other relevant factors.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Scope and purpose.</E> Section 5136A of the Revised Statutes permits a national bank that is within the second 50 largest insured banks to own or control a financial subsidiary only if, among other requirements, the bank satisfies the eligible debt requirement set forth in section 5136A or an alternative criteria jointly established by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. This section establishes the alternative criteria that a national bank among the second 50 largest insured banks may meet, which criteria is comparable to and consistent with the purposes of the eligible debt requirement established by section 5136A.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Alternative criteria.</E> A national bank satisfies the alternative criteria referenced in Section 5136A(a)(2)(E) of the Revised Statutes (12 U.S.C. 24a) and 12 CFR 5.39(g)(3) if the bank has a current long-term issuer credit rating from at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization that is within the three highest investment grade rating categories used by the organization.</P>

            <P>(1) The acquisition of a Security Entitlement from the Securities Intermediary;</P>

            <P>(3) If an agreement between the Securities Intermediary and its Entitlement Holder does not specify a jurisdiction as provided in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, the Securities Intermediary's jurisdiction is the jurisdiction in which is located the office identified in an account statement as the office serving the Entitlement Holder's account.<PRTPAGE P="585"/>
            </P>
            <P>(4) If an agreement between the Securities Intermediary and its Entitlement Holder does not specify a jurisdiction as provided in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section and an account statement does not identify an office serving the Entitlement Holder's account as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the Securities Intermediary's jurisdiction is the jurisdiction in which is located the chief executive office of the Securities Intermediary.</P>
            <P>(c) Notwithstanding the general rule in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the law (but not the conflict-of-law rules) of the jurisdiction in which the Person creating a security interest is located governs whether and how the security interest may be perfected automatically or by filing a financing statement.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1511.4</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Creation of Participant's Security Entitlement; security interests.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A Participant's Security Entitlement is created when a Federal Reserve Bank indicates by book-entry that a Book-entry Funding Corporation Security has been credited to a Participant's Securities Account.</P>
            <P>(b) A security interest in a Security Entitlement of a Participant in favor of the United States to secure deposits of public money, including without limitation deposits to the Treasury tax and loan accounts, or other security interest in favor of the United States that is required by Federal statute, regulation, or agreement, and that is marked on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank is thereby effected and perfected, and has priority over any other interest in the securities. Where a security interest in favor of the United States in a Security Entitlement of a Participant is marked on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank, such Reserve Bank may rely, and is protected in relying, exclusively on the order of an authorized representative of the United States directing the transfer of the security. For purposes of this paragraph, an “authorized representative of the United States” is the official designated in the applicable regulations or agreement to which a Federal Reserve Bank is a party, governing the security interest.</P>
            <P>(c)(1) The Funding Corporation and the Federal Reserve Banks have no obligation to agree to act on behalf of any Person or to recognize the interest of any transferee of a security interest or other limited interest in favor of any Person except to the extent of any specific requirement of Federal law or regulation or to the extent set forth in any specific agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank on whose books the interest of the Participant is recorded. To the extent required by such law or regulation or set forth in an agreement with a Federal Reserve Bank, or the Federal Reserve Bank Operating Circular, a security interest in a Security Entitlement that is in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank, the Funding Corporation, or a Person may be created and perfected by a Federal Reserve Bank marking its books to record the security interest. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a security interest in a Security Entitlement marked on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank shall have priority over any other interest in the securities.</P>

            <P>(2) In addition to the method provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a security interest in a Security Entitlement, including a security interest in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank, may be perfected by any method by which a security interest may be perfected under applicable law as described in § 1511.2(b) or § 1511.3. The perfection, effect of perfection or non-perfection and priority of a security interest are governed by such applicable law. A security interest in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank shall be treated as a security interest in favor of a <PRTPAGE P="586"/>clearing corporation in all respects under such law, including with respect to the effect of perfection and priority of such security interest. A Federal Reserve Bank Operating Circular shall be treated as a rule adopted by a clearing corporation for such purposes.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Obligations of Funding Corporation; no adverse claims.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Except in the case of a security interest in favor of the United States or a Federal Reserve Bank or otherwise as provided in § 1511.4(c)(1), for the purposes of this part 1511, the Funding Corporation and the Federal Reserve Banks shall treat the Participant to whose Securities Account an interest in a Book-entry Funding Corporation Security has been credited as the Person exclusively entitled to issue a Transfer Message, to receive interest and other payments with respect thereof and otherwise to exercise all the rights and powers with respect to such Security, notwithstanding any information or notice to the contrary. Neither the Federal Reserve Banks nor the Funding Corporation is liable to a Person asserting or having an Adverse Claim to a Security Entitlement or to a Book-entry Funding Corporation Security in a Participant's Securities Account, including any such claim arising as a result of the transfer or disposition of a Book-entry Funding Corporation Security by a Federal Reserve Bank pursuant to a Transfer Message that the Federal Reserve Bank reasonably believes to be genuine.</P>
            <P>(b) The obligation of the Funding Corporation to make payments of interest and principal with respect to Book-entry Funding Corporation Securities is discharged at the time payment in the appropriate amount is made as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) Interest on Book-entry Funding Corporation Securities is either credited by a Federal Reserve Bank to a Funds Account maintained at such Bank or otherwise paid as directed by the Participant.</P>
            <P>(2) Book-entry Funding Corporation Securities are redeemed in accordance with their terms by a Federal Reserve Bank withdrawing the securities from the Participant's Securities Account in which they are maintained and by either crediting the amount of the redemption proceeds, including both principal and interest where applicable, to a Funds Account at such Bank or otherwise paying such principal and interest, as directed by the Participant. The principal of such Securities shall be paid using the proceeds of the noninterest bearing instruments maintained by the Funding Corporation for such purpose.</P>

          <P>This section applies to the employees of the Office of Financial Research and is in addition to 5 CFR 3101.101-104, and 31 CFR part 0:</P>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions</E>—For purposes of this subpart:</P>
          <P>(1) “Business confidential information” shall include trade secret or other formula, practice, process, design, instrument, pattern, or compilation of information which is not generally known or reasonably ascertainable, by which a business can obtain an economic advantage over competitors or customers. This shall include non-public position and transaction data, as well as data provided to supervisors or regulators that is unpublished.</P>
          <P>(2) “Position data” is defined as:</P>
          <P>(i) Data on financial assets or liabilities held on the balance sheet of a financial company, where positions are created or changed by the execution of a financial transaction; and</P>
          <P>(ii) Includes information that identifies counterparties, the valuation by the financial company of the position, and information that makes possible an independent valuation of the position.</P>
          <P>(3) “Transaction data” is defined as the structure and legal description of a financial contract, with sufficient detail to describe the rights and obligations between counterparties and make possible an independent valuation.</P>
          <P>(4) “Micro-level data” is defined as information specific to an individual transaction or position.</P>
          <P>(5) “Masked data” is defined as data that has been altered to prevent attribution to a particular financial company.</P>

          <P>(6) “Financial company” has the same meaning given to such term in title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, 12 U.S.C. 5301 <E T="03">et seq.</E> (2010), and includes an insured depository institution and an insurance company.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">One-year post-employment restriction.</E> (1) A current or former employee of the Office of Financial Research who has had access to the transaction or position data or business confidential information maintained by the Data Center about financial entities required to report to the Office may not, within one year after last having had access in the course of official duties to such transaction or position data or business confidential information, be employed by or provide advice or consulting services to a financial company, regardless of whether that financial company is required to report to the Office.</P>
          <P>(2) A current or former employee of the Office of Financial Research who has had limited access to the transaction or position data or business confidential information maintained by the Data Center about financial entities required to report to the Office may request a written waiver pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section from the Designated Agency Ethics Official to be employed by or provide advice or consulting services to a financial company, provided that the issuance of the waiver would not compromise any data or business confidential information.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Waivers</E>—The post-employment restrictions set forth in section 152(g) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act may be waived in whole or in part for an employee with limited access to the transaction or position data or business confidential information maintained by the Data Center if—</P>

          <P>(1) The Designated Agency Ethics Official, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Financial Research or the Department's General Counsel in instances where consultation with the Director poses a conflict or the Director's position is vacant, determines in writing that such waiver is unlikely to compromise any financial company's business confidential information, unfairly advantage or disadvantage any financial company, or affect <PRTPAGE P="592"/>the integrity or effectiveness of the Office of Financial Research.</P>
          <P>(2) Relevant factors to be considered by the Designated Agency Ethics Official and the Director or General Counsel include—</P>
          <P>(i) The nature and importance of the employee's position and the degree to which the employee had access to non-public or business confidential data for the purpose of analysis, standardization, or performing applied research or essential long-term research;</P>
          <P>(ii) Whether the information to which the employee had access revealed positions or transactions of an individual financial company;</P>
          <P>(iii) Whether the data, especially position data, remains sensitive considering changing circumstances or the passage of time;</P>
          <P>(iv) Whether the employee had access to micro-level data, as compared to aggregated information;</P>
          <P>(v) If the employee had access to micro-level data, whether it was sufficiently masked or coded to protect the identity of the provider or the subject financial company;</P>
          <P>(vi) Whether the information to which the employee had access would provide a financial company employer with a competitive commercial advantage;</P>
          <P>(vii) Whether the financial company employer has made a satisfactory representation that it has adopted screening measures which will effectively prevent a potential employee from sharing any transaction or position data or business confidential information acquired at the Office of Financial Research one year prior to accepting employment with the company;</P>
          <P>(viii) Whether granting the waiver would affect the willingness of a financial company to continue to provide transaction or position data or business confidential information to the Office; and</P>
          <P>(ix) Whether the proposed employment would create an appearance of impropriety or would otherwise adversely affect the interests of the government or compromise the integrity of the office.</P>
          <P>(d) The following examples are illustrative of how the OFR post-employment prohibitions would apply under certain circumstances:</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Example 1.</E> (i) Fact pattern: OFR employs a business data manager and such employee has no access to the transaction or position data maintained by the Data Center or other business confidential information about financial entities required to report to OFR.</P>
          <P>(ii) Designated Agency Ethics Official's Determination: Upon termination of their employment by OFR, such employee would not be prohibited from being employed by or providing advice or consulting services to a financial company, regardless of whether that financial company is required to report to the Office.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Example 2.</E> (i) Fact pattern: OFR employs a data analyst and such employee has access to transaction or position data across all sectors maintained by the Data Center or other business confidential information about specific financial entities required to report to OFR.</P>
          <P>(ii) Designated Agency Ethics Official's Determination: Upon termination of their employment by OFR, such employee would be prohibited, for a period of one year immediately after leaving OFR, from being employed by or providing advice or consulting services to a financial company, regardless of whether that financial company is required to report to the Office.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Example 3.</E> (i) Fact pattern: OFR employs a data analyst and such employee has access to transaction or position data across all sectors maintained by the Data Center or other business confidential information about specific financial entities required to report to OFR. Employee last had access to such data six months before termination of her employment at OFR.</P>

          <P>(ii) Designated Agency Ethics Official's Determination: Upon termination of employment by OFR, such employee would be prohibited, for a period of six months immediately after leaving OFR, from being employed by or providing advice or consulting services to a financial company, regardless of whether that financial company is required to report to the Office.<PRTPAGE P="593"/>
          </P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Example 4.</E> (i) Fact pattern: OFR employs a researcher and such employee has access only to “aggregated” or “masked” transaction or position data maintained by the Data Center or other business confidential information about financial entities required to report to OFR.</P>
          <P>(ii) Designated Agency Ethics Official's Determination: Upon termination of their employment by OFR, such employee would not be prohibited from being employed by or providing advice or consulting services to a financial company, regardless of whether that financial company is required to report to the Office.</P>
          <P>(5) <E T="03">Example 5.</E> (i) Fact pattern: OFR employs a data analyst and such employee has access to transaction or position data maintained by the Data Center or other business confidential information <E T="03">relating to a particular sector (i.e. banking).</E>
          </P>

          <P>(ii) Designated Agency Ethics Official's Determination: Upon termination of employment by OFR, such employee would be prohibited, for a period of one year immediately after leaving OFR, from being employed by or providing advice or consulting services to a financial company <E T="03">in that particular sector (i.e. banking)</E> where such employment or services involves employment or advice or consulting services, regardless of whether that financial company is required to report to the Office. Such employee would be granted a waiver to work in other designated sectors immediately after leaving OFR.</P>
          <P>(6) <E T="03">Example 6.</E> (i) Fact pattern: OFR employs a data analyst and such employee has access to business confidential information in an area where data, such as equity mutual fund holdings, changes frequently. Employee last had access to such data six months before termination of her employment at OFR and, because of portfolio turnover, there is no risk of compromising business confidential information.</P>
          <P>(ii) Designated Agency Ethics Official's Determination: Upon termination of their employment by OFR, such employee would not be prohibited from being employed by or providing advice or consulting services to a financial company, regardless of whether that financial company is required to report to the Office.</P>
          <P>(7) <E T="03">Example 7.</E> (i) Fact pattern: OFR employs an information technology specialist and such employee has access only to “masked” transaction or position data maintained by the Data Center or other “masked” business confidential information about specific financial entities required to report to OFR.</P>
          <P>(ii) Designated Agency Ethics Official's Determination: Upon termination of their employment by OFR, such employee would not be prohibited from being employed by or providing advice or consulting services to a financial company, regardless of whether that financial company is required to report to the Office.</P>

              <P>1. The minimum capital components for interest rate and foreign exchange rate contracts are computed on the basis of the credit equivalent amounts of such contracts. Credit equivalent amounts are computed for each of the following off-balance sheet interest rate and foreign exchange rate contracts:</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">a. Interest Rate Contracts</HD>
              <P>i. Single currency interest rate swaps.</P>
              <P>ii. Basis swaps.</P>

              <P>iv. Interest rate options purchased (including caps, collars, and floors purchased).</P>
              <P>v. Any other instrument that gives rise to similar credit risks (including when-issued securities and forward deposits accepted).</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">b. Foreign Exchange Rate Contracts</HD>
              <P>i. Cross-currency interest rate swaps.</P>
              <P>ii. Forward foreign exchange rate contracts.</P>
              <P>iii. Currency options purchased.</P>
              <P>iv. Any other instrument that gives rise to similar credit risks.</P>
              <P>2. Foreign exchange rate contracts with an original maturity of 14 calendar days or less and foreign exchange rate contracts traded on exchanges that require daily payment of variation margins are excluded from the minimum capital requirement computation. Over-the-counter options purchased, however, are included and treated in the same way as the other interest rate and foreign exchange rate contracts.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">3. Calculation of Credit Equivalent Amounts</HD>
              <P>a. The minimum capital components for interest rate and foreign exchange rate contracts are computed on the basis of the credit equivalent amounts of such contracts. The credit equivalent amount of an off-balance sheet interest rate and foreign exchange rate contract that is not subject to a qualifying bilateral netting contract in accordance with this appendix A is equal to the sum of the current exposure (sometimes referred to as the replacement cost) of the contract and an estimate of the potential future credit exposure over the remaining life of the contract.</P>
              <P>b. The current exposure is determined by the mark-to-market value of the contract. If the mark-to-market value is positive, then the current exposure is the mark-to-market value. If the mark-to-market value is zero or negative, then the current exposure is zero. Mark-to-market values are measured in United States dollars, regardless of the currency or currencies specified in the contract, and should reflect changes in the relevant rates, as well as counterparty credit quality.</P>
              <P>c. The potential future credit exposure of a contract, including a contract with a negative mark-to-market value, is estimated by multiplying the notional principal amount of the contract by a credit conversion factor. The effective rather than the apparent or stated notional amount must be used in this calculation. The credit conversion factors are:</P>

              <P>d. Because foreign exchange rate contracts involve an exchange of principal upon maturity, and foreign exchange rates are generally more volatile than interest rates, higher conversion factors have been established for foreign exchange rate contracts than for interest rate contracts.</P>
              <P>e. No potential future credit exposure is calculated for single currency interest rate swaps in which payments are made based upon two floating rate indexes, so-called floating/floating or basis swaps. The credit exposure on these contracts is evaluated solely on the basis of their mark-to-market values.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">4. Avoidance of Double Counting</HD>
              <P>In certain cases, credit exposures arising from the interest rate and foreign exchange instruments covered by this appendix A may already be reflected, in part, on the balance sheet. To avoid double counting such exposures in the assessment of capital adequacy, counterparty credit exposures arising from the types of instruments covered by this appendix A may need to be excluded from balance sheet assets in calculating the minimum capital requirement.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">5. Collateral</HD>
              <P>a. The sufficiency of collateral for off-balance sheet items is determined by the market value of the collateral in relation to the credit equivalent amount. Collateral held against a netting contract is not recognized for minimum capital standard purposes unless it is legally available to support the single legal obligation created by the netting contract. Excess collateral held against one contract or a group of contracts for which a recognized netting agreement exists may not be considered.</P>

              <P>b. The only forms of collateral that are formally recognized by the minimum capital standard framework are cash on deposit; securities issued or guaranteed by the central <PRTPAGE P="601"/>governments of the OECD-based group of countries, United States Government agencies, or United States Government-sponsored agencies; and securities issued by multilateral lending institutions or regional development banks.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">6. Netting</HD>
              <P>a. For purposes of this appendix A, netting refers to the offsetting of positive and negative mark-to-market values in the determination of a current exposure to be used in the calculation of a credit equivalent amount. Any legally enforceable form of bilateral netting (that is, netting with a single counterparty) of interest rate and foreign exchange rate contracts is recognized for purposes of calculating the credit equivalent amount provided that the following criteria are met:</P>
              <P>i. Netting must be accomplished under a written netting contract that creates a single legal obligation, covering all included individual contracts, with the effect that the Enterprise would have a claim to receive, or obligation to pay, only the net amount of the sum of the positive and negative mark-to-market values on included individual contracts in the event that a counterparty, or a counterparty to whom the contract has been validly assigned, fails to perform due to default, insolvency, liquidation, or similar circumstances.</P>
              <P>ii. The Enterprise must obtain a written and reasoned legal opinion(s) representing that in the event of a legal challenge—including one resulting from default, insolvency, liquidation, or similar circumstances—the relevant court and administrative authorities would find the Enterprise's exposure to be such a net amount under—</P>
              <P>A. The law of the jurisdiction in which the counterparty is chartered or the equivalent location in the case of noncorporate entities, and if a branch of the counterparty is involved, then also under the law of the jurisdiction in which the branch is located;</P>
              <P>B. The law that governs the individual contracts covered by the netting contract; and</P>
              <P>C. The law that governs the netting contract.</P>
              <P>iii. The Enterprise must establish and maintain procedures to ensure that the legal characteristics of netting contracts are kept under review in the event of possible changes in relevant law.</P>
              <P>iv. The Enterprise must maintain in its files documentation adequate to support the netting of rate contracts, including a copy of the bilateral netting contract and necessary legal opinions.</P>
              <P>b. A contract containing a walkaway clause is not eligible for netting for purposes of calculating the credit equivalent amount. <SU>1</SU>
                <FTREF/>
              </P>
              <FTNT>
                <P>
                  <SU>1</SU> A walkaway clause is a provision in a netting contract that permits a non-defaulting counterparty to make lower payments than it would make otherwise under the contract, or no payment at all, to a defaulter or to the estate of a defaulter, even if the defaulter or the estate of the defaulter is a net creditor under the contract.</P>
              </FTNT>
              <P>c. By netting individual contracts for the purpose of calculating its credit equivalent amount, the Enterprise represents that it has met the requirements of this appendix A and all the appropriate documents are in the Enterprise's files and available for inspection by OFHEO. OFHEO may determine that an Enterprise's files are inadequate or that a netting contract, or any of its underlying individual contracts, may not be legally enforceable under any one of the bodies of law described in this appendix A. If such a determination is made, the netting contract may be disqualified from recognition for minimum capital standard purposes or underlying individual contracts may be treated as though they are not subject to the netting contract.</P>
              <P>d. The credit equivalent amount of interest rate and foreign exchange rate contracts that are subject to a qualifying bilateral netting contract is calculated by adding the current exposure of the netting contract and the sum of the estimates of the potential future credit exposures on all individual contracts subject to the netting contract, estimated in accordance with paragraph 3 of this appendix A. Offsetting contracts in the same currency maturing on the same date will have lower potential future exposure as well as lower current exposure. Therefore, for purposes of calculating potential future credit exposure to a netting counterparty for foreign exchange rate contracts and other similar contracts in which notional principal is equivalent to cash flows, total notional principal is defined as the net receipts falling due on each value date in each currency.</P>

              <P>e. The current exposure of the netting contract is determined by summing all positive and negative mark-to-market values of the individual contracts included in the netting contract. If the net sum of the mark-to-market values is positive, then the current exposure of the netting contract is equal to that sum. If the net sum of the mark-to-market values is zero or negative, then the current exposure of the netting contract is zero. OFHEO may determine that a netting contract qualifies for minimum capital standard netting treatment even though certain individual contracts may not qualify. In such instances, the nonqualifying contracts should be treated as individual contracts that are not subject to the netting contract.<PRTPAGE P="602"/>
              </P>
              <P>f. In the event a netting contract covers contracts that are normally excluded from the minimum capital requirement computation—for example, foreign exchange rate contracts with an original maturity of 14 calendar days or less, or instruments traded on exchanges that require daily payment of variation margin—an Enterprise may elect consistently either to include or exclude all mark-to-market values of such contracts when determining net current exposure.</P>

              <P>(a) Each Enterprise shall file with the Director a Risk-Based Capital Report each quarter, and at such other times as the Director may require, in his or her discretion. The report shall contain the information required by the Director in the instructions to the Risk-Based Capital Report in the format or media specified therein and <PRTPAGE P="604"/>such other information as may be required by the Director.</P>
              <P>(b) The quarterly Risk-Based Capital Report shall contain information for the last day of the quarter and shall be submitted not later than 30 days after the end of the quarter. Reports required by the Director other than quarterly reports shall be submitted within such time period as the Director shall specify.</P>
              <P>(c) When an Enterprise contemplates entering a new activity, as the term is defined in section 3.11 of appendix A to this subpart, the Enterprise shall notify the Director as soon as possible while the transaction or activity is under consideration, but in no event later than 5 calendar days after settlement or closing. The Enterprises shall provide to the Director such information regarding the activity as the Director may require to determine a stress test treatment. OFHEO will inform the Enterprise as soon as possible thereafter of the proposed stress test treatment of the new activity. In addition, the notice of proposed capital classification required by § 1777.21 of this chapter will inform the Enterprise of the capital treatment of such new activity used in the determination of the risk-based capital requirement.</P>
              <P>(d) If an Enterprise discovers that a Risk-Based Capital Report previously filed with OFHEO contains any errors or omissions, the Enterprise shall notify OFHEO immediately of such discovery and file an amended Risk-Based Capital Report not later than three days thereafter.</P>
              <P>(e) Each capital classification shall be determined by OFHEO on the basis of the Risk-Based Capital Report filed by the Enterprise under paragraph (a) of this section; provided that, in the event an amended Risk-Based Capital Report is filed prior to the issuance of the final notice of capital classification, the Director has the discretion to determine the Enterprise's capital classification on the basis of the amended report.</P>
              <P>(f) Each Risk-Based Capital Report or any amended Risk-Based Capital Report shall contain a declaration by the officer who has been designated by the Board as responsible for overseeing the capital adequacy of the Enterprise that the report is true and correct to the best of such officer's knowledge and belief.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Risk-based capital level computation.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Risk-Based Capital Test</E>—OFHEO shall compute a risk-based capital level for each Enterprise at least quarterly by applying the risk-based capital test described in appendix A to this subpart to determine the amount of total capital required for each Enterprise to maintain positive capital during the stress period. In making this determination, the Director shall take into account any appropriate distinctions among types of mortgage products, differences in seasoning of mortgages, and other factors determined appropriate by the Director in accordance with the methodology specified in appendix A to this subpart. The stress period has the following characteristics:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Credit risk</E>—With respect to mortgages owned or guaranteed by the Enterprise and other obligations of the Enterprise, losses occur throughout the United States at a rate of default and severity reasonably related, in accordance with appendix A to this subpart, to the benchmark loss experience.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Interest rate risk</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> Interest rates decrease as described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section or increase as described in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, whichever would require more capital in the stress test for the Enterprise. Appendix A to this subpart contains a description of the methodology applied to implement the interest rate scenarios described in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Decreases.</E> The 10-year constant maturity Treasury yield decreases during the first year of the stress period and remains at the new level for the remainder of the stress period. The yield decreases to the lesser of—</P>
              <P>(A) 600 basis points below the average yield during the 9 months immediately preceding the stress period, or</P>

              <P>(B) 60 percent of the average yield during the 3 years immediately preceding the stress period, but in no case to a yield less than 50 percent of the <PRTPAGE P="605"/>average yield during the 9 months immediately preceding the stress period.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Increases.</E> The 10-year constant maturity Treasury yield increases during the first year of the stress period and will remain at the new level for the remainder of the stress period. The yield increases to the greater of—</P>
              <P>(A) 600 basis points above the average yield during the 9 months immediately preceding the stress period, or</P>
              <P>(B) 160 percent of the average yield during the 3 years immediately preceding the stress period, but in no case to a yield greater than 175 percent of the average yield during the 9 months immediately preceding the stress period.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Different terms to maturity.</E> Yields of Treasury instruments with terms to maturity other than 10 years will change relative to the 10-year constant maturity Treasury yield in patterns and for durations that are reasonably related to historical experience and are judged reasonable by the Director. The methodology used by the Director to adjust the yields of those other instruments is specified in appendix A to this subpart.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Large increases in yields.</E> If the 10-year constant maturity Treasury yield is assumed to increase by more than 50 percent over the average yield during the 9 months immediately preceding the stress period, the Director shall adjust the losses resulting from the conditions specified in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section to reflect a correspondingly higher rate of general price inflation. The method of such adjustment by the Director is specified in appendix A to this subpart.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">New business.</E> Any contractual commitments of the Enterprise to purchase mortgages or issue securities will be fulfilled. The characteristics of resulting mortgages purchased, securities issued, and other financing will be consistent with the contractual terms of such commitments, recent experience, and the economic characteristics of the stress period, as more fully specified in appendix A to this subpart. No other purchases of mortgages shall be assumed.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Other activities.</E> Losses or gains on other activities, including interest rate and foreign exchange hedging activities, shall be determined by the Director, in accordance with appendix A to this subpart and on the basis of available information, to be consistent with the stress period.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Consistency.</E> Characteristics of the stress period other than those specifically set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, such as prepayment experience and dividend policies, will be determined by the Director, in accordance with appendix A to this subpart, on the basis of available information, to be most consistent with the stress period.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Risk-Based Capital Level.</E> The risk-based capital level of an Enterprise, to be used in determining the appropriate capital classification of each Enterprise, as required by section 1364 of the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 (12 U.S.C. 4614), shall be equal to the sum of the following amounts:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Credit and Interest Rate Risk.</E> The amount of total capital determined by applying the risk-based capital test under paragraph (a) of this section to the Enterprise.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Management and Operations Risk.</E> To provide for management and operations risk, 30 percent of the amount of total capital determined by applying the risk-based capital test under paragraph (a) of this section to the Enterprise.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD1">1.0 Identification of the Benchmark Loss Experience</HD>
              <P>OFHEO will use the definitions, data, and methodology described below to identify the Benchmark Loss Experience.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">1.1 Definitions</HD>
              <P>The terms defined in the Glossary to this appendix shall apply for this appendix.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">1.2 Data</HD>
              <P>[a] OFHEO identifies the Benchmark Loss Experience (BLE) using historical loan-level data required to be submitted by each of the two Enterprises. OFHEO's analysis is based entirely on the data available through 1995 on conventional, 30-year, fixed-rate loans secured by first liens on single-unit, owner-occupied, detached properties. For this purpose, detached properties are defined as single family properties excluding condominiums, planned urban developments, and cooperatives. The data includes only loans that were purchased by an Enterprise within 12 months after loan origination and loans for which the Enterprise has no recourse to the lender.</P>
              <P>[b] OFHEO organizes the data from each Enterprise to create two substantially consistent data sets. OFHEO separately analyzes default and severity data from each Enterprise. Default rates are calculated from loan records meeting the criteria specified above. Severity rates are calculated from the subset of defaulted loans for which loss data are available.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">1.3 Procedures</HD>
              <P>[a] Cumulative ten-year default rates for each combination of states and origination years (state/year combination) that OFHEO examines are calculated for each Enterprise by grouping all of the Enterprise's loans originated in that combination of states and years. For origination years with less than ten-years of loss experience, cumulative-to-date default rates are used. The two Enterprise default rates are averaged, yielding an “average default rate” for that state/year combination.</P>
              <P>[b] An “average severity rate” for each state/year combination is determined in the same manner as the average default rate. For each Enterprise, the aggregate severity rate is calculated for all loans in the relevant state/year combination and the two Enterprise severity rates are averaged.</P>
              <P>[c] The “loss rate” for any state/year combination examined is calculated by multiplying the average default rate for that state/year combination by the average severity rate for that combination.</P>
              <P>[d] The rates of default and Loss Severity of loans in the state/year combination containing at least two consecutive origination years and contiguous areas with a total population equal to or greater than five percent of the population of the United States with the highest loss rate constitutes the Benchmark Loss Experience.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">2.0 Identification of a New Benchmark Loss Experience</HD>
              <P>OFHEO will periodically monitor available data and reevaluate the Benchmark Loss Experience using the methodology set forth in this appendix. Using this methodology, OFHEO may identify a new Benchmark Loss Experience that has a higher rate of loss than the Benchmark Loss Experience identified at the time of the issuance of this regulation.

              <P>[a] The Stress Test requires data on all of an Enterprise's assets, liabilities, stockholders equity, accounting entries, operations and off-balance sheet obligations, as well as economic factors that affect them: interest rates, house prices, rent growth rates, and vacancy rates. The Enterprises are responsible for compiling and aggregating data on at least a quarterly basis into a standard format called the Risk-Based Capital Report (RBC Report). Each Enterprise is required to certify that the RBC Report submission is complete and accurate. Data on economic factors, such as interest rates, are compiled from public sources. The Stress Test uses proprietary and public data directly, and also uses values derived from such data in the form of constants or default values. (See Table 3-1, Sources of Stress Test Input Data.) Data fields from each of these sources for Stress Test computations are described in the following tables and in each section of this appendix.</P>

              <P>[b] The RBC Report includes information for all the loans owned or guaranteed by an Enterprise, as well as securities and derivative contracts, the dollar balances of these instruments and obligations, as well as all characteristics that bear on their behavior under stress conditions. As detailed in the RBC Report, data are required for all the following categories of instruments and obligations:
              </P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3.1.2 Risk-Based Capital Report</HD>

              <P>The Risk-Based Capital Report is comprised of information on whole loans, mortgage-related securities, nonmortgage instruments (including liabilities and derivatives), and accounting items (including off-balance sheet guarantees). In addition to their reported data, the Enterprises may report scale factors in order to reconcile this reported data with their published financials (<E T="03">see</E> section 3.10.2[b] of this appendix). If so, specific data items, as indicated, are adjusted by appropriate scale factors before any calculations occur.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3.1.2.1 Whole Loan Inputs</HD>
              <P>[a] Whole loans are individual single family or multifamily mortgage loans. The Stress Test distinguishes between whole loans that the Enterprises hold in their investment portfolios (retained loans) and those that underlie mortgage-backed securities (sold loans). Consistent with Table 3-2, Whole Loan Classification Variables, each Enterprise aggregates the data for loans with similar portfolio (retained or sold), risk, and product characteristics. The characteristics of these loan groups determine rates of mortgage Default, Prepayment and Loss Severity and cash flows.</P>
              <P>[b] The characteristics that are the basis for loan groups are called “classification variables” and reflect categories, e.g., fixed interest rate versus floating interest rate, or identify a value range, e.g., original loan-to-value (LTV) ratio greater than 80 percent and less than or equal to 90 percent.</P>

              <P>[c] All loans with the same values for each of the relevant classification variables included in 3-2 (and where applicable 3-3 and 3-4) comprise a single loan group. For example, one loan group includes all loans with the following characteristics:
              </P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-1">• Single family</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-1">• Sold portfolio</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-1">• 30-year fixed rate conventional loan</FP>

              <P>The Enterprises make contractual commitments to purchase or securitize mortgages. The Stress Test provides for deliveries of mortgages into the commitments that exist at the start of the Stress Period. These mortgages are grouped into “Commitment Loan Groups” that reflect the characteristics of the mortgages that were originated in the six months preceding the start of the Stress Period and securitized by the Enterprise, except that they are assigned coupon rates consistent with the projected delivery month in each interest rate scenario. These Commitment Loan Groups are added to the Enterprise's sold portfolio and the Stress Test projects their performance during the Stress Period. In the down-rate scenario, the Stress Test provides that 100 percent of the mortgages specified in the commitments are delivered within the first three months. In the up-rate scenario, 75 percent are delivered within the first six months.</P>

              <P>[a] The Interest Rates component of the Stress Test projects Constant Maturity Treasury yields as well as other interest rates and indexes (collectively, “Interest Rates”) that are needed to project mortgage performance and calculate cash flows for mortgages and other financial instruments for each of the 120 months in the Stress Period.</P>

              <P>[b] The process for determining Interest Rates is as follows: first, identify the values for the necessary Interest Rates at time zero; second, project the ten-year CMT for each month of the Stress Period as specified in the 1992 Act; third, project the 1-month Treasury yield, the 3-month, 6-month, 1-, 2-, 3-, 5-, 20-year, and 30-year CMTs; fourth, project non-treasury Interest Rates, including the Federal Agency Cost of Funds Index; and fifth, project the Enterprises Cost of Funds Index, which provides borrowing rates for the Enterprises during the Stress Period, by increasing the Agency Cost of Funds Index by 10 basis points for the last 108 months of the Stress Test. Guidance in determining interest rates is available under OFHEO Guideline No. 402, “Risk Based Capital Process for Capturing and Utilizing Interest Rates Files,” which is available on OFHEO's Web site, <E T="03">http://www.OFHEO.Gov.</E>

              <P>[a] The Property Valuation component applies inflation adjustments to the single family house price growth rates and multifamily rent growth rates that are used to determine single family property values and multifamily current debt-service coverage ratios during the up-rate scenario, as required by the 1992 Act.</P>
              <P>[b] Single family house price growth rates during the 120 months of the Stress Test are calculated from the HPI series for the West South Central Census Division for the years 1984-1993, as derived from OFHEO's Third Quarter, 1996 HPI Report. The West South Central Census Division includes Texas and all of the Benchmark states except Mississippi. This series is applied to single family loans nationwide during the Stress Test because the 1992 Act applies a regional loss experience (the BLE) to the entire nation. In contrast, house prices are brought forward to the start of the Stress Test based on local Census Division HPI values available at the start of the Stress Test.</P>

              <P>[c] Multifamily rent growth rates during the 120 months of the Stress Test are computed using a population-weighted average of the monthly growth of the Rent of Primary <PRTPAGE P="643"/>Residence component of the Consumer Price Index-Urban, which is generated by the U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics. The metropolitan areas used for this computation are the Dallas/Ft. Worth CMSA, the Houston/Galveston/Brazoria CMSA, and the New Orleans MSA.</P>
              <P>[d] Multifamily rental vacancy rates during the 120 months of the Stress Test are computed using a population-weighted average of annual rental vacancy rates from the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census' Housing Vacancy Survey. The metropolitan areas used for this computation are the Dallas, Houston and Fort Worth PMSAs and the San Antonio, New Orleans and Oklahoma City MSAs.</P>
              <P>[e] <E T="03">Inflation adjustment.</E> In the up-rate scenario, if the ten-year CMT rises more than 50 percent above the average yield during the nine months preceding the Stress Period, rent and house price growth rates are adjusted to account for inflation as required by the 1992 Act. The single family House Price Growth Rates and the multifamily Rent Growth Rates are increased by the amount by which the ten-year CMT exceeds 50 percent of its annualized monthly yield averaged over the nine months preceding the Stress Test. The inflation adjustment is applied only in the last 60 months of the Stress Period.</P>

              <P>The Counterparty Defaults component of the Stress Test accounts for the risk of default by credit enhancement and derivative contract counterparties, corporate securities, municipal securities, and mortgage-related securities. The Stress Test recognizes five rating categories (“AAA”, “AA”, “A”, “BBB”, and “Below BBB and Unrated”) and establishes appropriate credit loss factors that are applied during the Stress Period. Securities rated below BBB are treated as unrated securities, unless OFHEO determines to specify a different treatment upon a showing by an Enterprise that a different treatment is warranted.</P>

              <P>For counterparties and securities, information on counterparty type and the lowest public rating of the counterparty is required. The Stress Test uses credit ratings issued by Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (“NRSROs”) to assign rating categories to counterparties and securities.

              <P>The Maximum Haircut for a given Counterparty Type and Rating Classification is used in section 3.6, Whole Loan Cash Flows, section 3.7, Mortgage-Related Securities Cash Flows, and section 3.8, Nonmortgage Instrument Cash Flows, of this appendix.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">3.6 Whole Loan Cash Flows</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3.6.1 Whole Loan Cash Flows Overview</HD>
              <P>[a] <E T="03">Loan Aggregation.</E> In the Stress Test calculations (except as described in section 3.6.3.6.4, Mortgage Credit Enhancement, of this appendix), individual loans having similar characteristics are aggregated into Loan Groups as described in section 3.1.2.1, Whole Loan Inputs, of this appendix (RBC Report). All individual loans within a Loan Group are considered to be identical for computational purposes. In the discussions in this section, quantities described as “loan level” will actually be computed at the Loan Group level.</P>
              <P>[b] <E T="03">Loan Participations.</E> In some cases, an Enterprise may hold only a <E T="03">pari passu</E> fractional ownership interest in a loan. This interest is referred to as a participation, and is specified by the ownership percentage held by the Enterprise (the participation percentage). In such cases, the Unpaid Principal Balance (UPB) and Mortgage Payment reported in the RBC Report will be only the Enterprise's participation percentage of the loan's actual UPB and Mortgage Payment. The actual UPB is not explicitly used in the calculations described in this section 3.6 but it is used in the creation of the RBC Report.</P>
              <P>[c] <E T="03">Retained Loans vs. Sold Loans.</E> The Stress Test models cash flows from single family and multifamily mortgage loans that are held in portfolio (Retained Loans) and loans that are pooled into Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBSs) that are sold to investors and guaranteed by the Enterprises (Sold Loans). Together, Retained Loans and Sold Loans are referred to as “Whole Loans.” The treatment of cash flows for loans not guaranteed by the Enterprises, e.g., loans backing GNMA Certificates and private label MBSs and REMICs, is discussed in section 3.7, Mortgage-Related Securities Cash Flows, of this appendix.</P>
              <P>[d] <E T="03">Repurchased MBSs.</E> From time to time an Enterprise may repurchase all or part of one of its own previously issued single-class MBSs for its own securities portfolio. At an Enterprise's option, these “Repurchased MBSs” may be reported with the underlying Whole Loans for computation in this section 3.6 rather than in section 3.7, Mortgage-Related Securities Cash Flows, of this appendix. In such cases, the Enterprise will report the underlying Whole Loans as sold loans, along with the appropriate Fraction Repurchased and any security unamortized balances associated with the purchase of the MBS (not with the original sale of the underlying loans, which unamortized balances are reported separately).</P>
              <P>[e] <E T="03">Sources of Enterprise Whole Loan Cash Flows.</E> For Retained Loans, the Enterprises receive all principal and interest payments on the loans, except for a portion of the interest payment retained by the servicer as compensation (the Servicing Fee). For Sold Loans, the Enterprises receive Guarantee Fees and Float Income. Float Income is the earnings on the investment of loan principal and interest payments (net of the Servicing Fee and Guarantee Fee) from the time these payments are received from the servicer until they are remitted to security holders. The length of this period depends on the security payment cycle (the remittance cycle). For both retained and sold loans, the Enterprises retain 100 percent of their credit losses <PRTPAGE P="647"/>and experience amortization of discounts as income and amortization of premiums as expense. For Repurchased MBSs, the Enterprise receives the Fraction Repurchased of the cash flows it remits to investors, and retains 100 percent of the Credit Losses and the Guarantee Fee. <E T="03">See</E> section 3.6.3.7, Stress Test Whole Loan Cash Flows and section 3.6.3.8, Whole Loan Accounting Flows, of this appendix.</P>
              <P>[f] <E T="03">Required Inputs.</E> The calculation of Whole Loan cash flows requires mortgage Amortization Schedules, mortgage Prepayment, Default and Loss Severity rates, and Credit Enhancement information. The four mortgage performance components of the Stress Test are single family Default and Prepayment, single family Loss Severity, multifamily Default and Prepayment, and multifamily Loss Severity. Mortgage Amortization Schedules are computed from input data in the RBC Report. (For ARMs, selected interest rate indexes from section 3.3, Interest Rates, of this appendix, are also used.) Prepayment and Default Rates are computed by combining explanatory variables and weighting coefficients according to a set of logistic equations. The explanatory variables are computed from the mortgage Amortization Schedule and external economic variables such as Interest Rates (section 3.3, Interest Rates, of this appendix), historical house-price indexes (HPIs) or rental-price indexes (RPIs), and Stress Period HPI growth rate, RPI and Vacancy Rate (RVR) series from section 3.4, Property Valuation, of this appendix. The weighting coefficients determine the relative importance of the different explanatory variables, and are estimated from a statistical analysis of data from the Benchmark Loss region and time period as described in section 1, Identification of the Benchmark Loss Experience, of this appendix. Mortgage Amortization information is also combined with HPI, RPI and VR series to determine Gross Loss Severity rates, which are offset by Credit Enhancements. Finally, the Amortization Schedules, Default and Prepayment rates and Net Loss Severity rates are combined to produce Stress Test Whole Loan Cash Flows to the Enterprises for each Loan Group, as well as amortization of any discounts, premiums and fees.</P>
              <P>[g] <E T="03">Specification of Mortgage Prepayment.</E> Mortgages are assumed to prepay in full. The model makes no specific provision for partial Prepayments of principal (curtailments).</P>
              <P>[h] <E T="03">Specification of Mortgage Default and Loss.</E> Mortgage Defaults are modeled as follows: Defaulting loans enter foreclosure after a number of missed payments (MQ, Months in Delinquency), and are foreclosed upon several months later. Months in Foreclosure (MF) is the total number of missed payments through foreclosure. Upon completion of foreclosure, the loan as such ceases to exist and the property becomes Real Estate Owned by the lender (REO). Foreclosure expenses are paid and MI proceeds received when foreclosure is completed. After several more months (MR, Months in REO), the property is sold, REO expenses are paid, and sales proceeds and other credit enhancements are received. These timing differences are not modeled explicitly in the cash flows, but their economic effect is taken into account by calculating the present value of the Default-related cash flows back to the initial month of Default.</P>
              <P>[i] <E T="03">Combining Cash Flows from Scheduled Payments, Prepayments and Defaults.</E> Aggregate Whole Loan Cash Flows, adjusted for the effects of mortgage performance, are based on the following conceptual equation, which is made more explicit in the calculations in the sections specified in section 3.6.2 of this appendix:</P>

              <P>[a] <E T="03">Calculations are monthly.</E> The Stress Test operates monthly, with all events of a given type assumed to take place on the same day of the month. For mortgages, unless otherwise specified, all payments and other mortgage-related cash flows that are due on the first day of the month are received on the fifteenth. Biweekly loans are mapped into their closest term-equivalent monthly counterpart.</P>
              <P>[b] <E T="03">“Time Zero” for Calculations.</E> Time Zero refers to the beginning of the Stress Test. For example, if the 2Q2000 Stress Test uses Enterprise Data as of June 30, “month zero” represents conditions as of June 30, the Stress Period begins July 1, and July 2000 is month one of the Stress Test. In this document, UPB<E T="52">0</E> is the Unpaid Principal Balance of a loan immediately prior to (as of) the start of the Stress Test, i.e. as reported by the Enterprise in the RBC Report. Origination refers to the beginning of the life of the loan, which will be prior to the start of the Stress Test for all loans except those delivered later under Commitments, for which Origination refers to the delivery month (<E T="03">See</E> section 3.2, Commitments, of this appendix).</P>
              <P>[c] <E T="03">Definition of Mortgage Age.</E> The Mortgage Age at a given time is the number of scheduled mortgage payment dates that have occurred prior to that time, whether or not the borrower has actually made the payments. Prior to the first payment date, the Mortgage Age would be zero. From the first payment date until (but not including) the second loan payment date, the Mortgage Age would be one. The Mortgage Age at Time Zero (A<E T="52">0</E>) is thus the number of scheduled loan payment dates that have occurred prior to the start of the Stress Test. The scheduled payment date for all loans is assumed to be the first day of each month; therefore, the Mortgage Age will be A<E T="52">1</E> on the first day of the Stress Test (except for Commitments that are delivered after the start of the Stress Test).</P>
              <P>[d] <E T="03">Interest Rate Setting Procedure.</E> Mortgage interest is due in arrears, i.e., on the first day following the month in which it is accrued. Thus, a payment due on the first day of month m is for interest accrued during the <E T="03">prior</E> month. For example, for Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARMs) the Mortgage Interest Rate (MIR<E T="52">m</E>) applicable to the July reset is set on the first day of June, and is generally based on the May or April value of the underlying Index, as specified in the loan terms. This Lookback Period (LB) is specified in the Stress Test as a period of one or two months, respectively. Thus, PMT<E T="52">m</E> will be based on MIR<E T="52">m</E>, which is based on INDEX<E T="52">m−1−LB</E>.</P>
              <P>[e] <E T="03">Prepayment Interest Shortfall.</E> In some remittance cycles, the period between an Enterprise's receipt of Prepayments and transmittal to investors exceeds a full month. In those cases, the Enterprise must remit an additional month's interest (at the Pass-Through Rate) to MBS investors. <E T="03">See</E> section 3.6.3.7.3, Stress Test Whole Loan Cash Flow Procedures, of this appendix.</P>
              <P>[f] <E T="03">Certain Calculations Extend Beyond the End of the Stress Test.</E> Even though the Stress Test calculates capital only through the ten year Stress Period, certain calculations (for example, the level yield amortization of discounts, premiums and fees, as described in section 3.10, Operations, Taxes, and Accounting, of this appendix) require cash flows throughout the life of the instrument. For such calculations in the Stress Test, the conditions of month 120 are held constant throughout the remaining life of the instrument: specifically, Interest Rates (which are already held constant for months 13 through 120), Prepayment and Default rates for months m &gt;120 are taken to be equal to their respective values in month 120.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3.6.3.2.1 Allocation of Mortgage Interest</HD>
              <P>[a] <E T="03">Components of Mortgage Interest.</E> The interest portion of the Mortgage Payment is allocated among several components. For all Whole Loans, a Servicing Fee is retained by the servicer. For Sold Loans, the Enterprise retains a Guarantee Fee. An additional amount of interest (Spread) <SU>1</SU>
                <FTREF/> may be deposited into a Spread Account to reimburse potential future credit losses on loans covered by this form of Credit Enhancement, as described further in section 3.6.3.6.4, Mortgage Credit Enhancement, of this appendix. The remaining interest amount is either retained by the Enterprise (Net Yield on Retained Loans) or passed through to MBS investors (Pass-Through Interest on Sold Loans).</P>
              <FTNT>
                <P>
                  <SU>1</SU> The spread may or may not be embedded in the recorded Servicing Fee.</P>
              </FTNT>
              <P>[b] <E T="03">Effect of Negative Amortization.</E> If the Mortgage Payment is contractually limited to an amount less than the full amount accrued (as may be the case with loans that permit Negative Amortization), then the Servicing Fee, the Guarantee Fee and the <PRTPAGE P="649"/>spread are paid in full, and the shortfall is borne entirely by the recipient of the Net Yield or Pass-Through Interest.</P>
              <P>[c] <E T="03">Effect of Variable Rates.</E> For ARMs, the Servicing Fee, Guarantee Fee and Spread rates are taken to be constant over time, as they are for Fixed Rate Loans. Thus in the Stress Test the Mortgage Interest Rate and the Net Yield or Pass-through Rate will change simultaneously by equal amounts. All other details of the rate and payment reset mechanisms are modeled in accordance with the contractual terms using the inputs specified in section 3.6.3.3.2, Mortgage Amortization Schedule Inputs, of this appendix.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3.6.3.2.2 Allocation of Mortgage Principal</HD>
              <P>[a] Scheduled Principal is that amount of the mortgage payment that amortizes principal. For calculational purposes, when a loan prepays in full the amount specified in the Amortization Schedule is counted as Scheduled Principal, and the rest is Prepayment Principal. For a Balloon Loan, the final Balloon Payment includes the remaining UPB, all of which is counted as Scheduled Principal.</P>
              <P>[b] Mortgages that prepay are assumed to prepay in full. Partial Prepayments (curtailments) are not modeled.</P>
              <P>[c] Any loan that does not prepay or Default remains on its original Amortization Schedule.</P>

              <P>[a] The Stress Test requires an Amortization Schedule for each Loan Group. A mortgage is paid down, or amortized over time, to the extent that the contractual mortgage payment exceeds the amount required to cover interest due.</P>

In order that UPB<E T="52">RM</E> = 0, the principal component of the resulting lump sum final payment (the Balloon Payment, equal to UPB<E T="52">RM−1</E>) is counted as Scheduled Principal, not as a Prepayment.</P>
              <P>[c] <E T="03">Special Cases.</E> In general the UPB of a mortgage decreases monotonically over time, i.e. UPB<E T="52">m</E> &gt;UPB<E T="52">m + 1</E>, reaching zero at maturity except for Balloon Loans as described in [b]2. in this section. However, in practice certain exceptions must be handled.</P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">1. <E T="03">Interest-Only Loans.</E> Certain loans are interest-only for all or part of their term. The monthly payment covers only the interest due, and the UPB stays constant until maturity (in some cases), in which case a Balloon Payment is due or a changeover date (in other cases) at which time the payment is recast so that the loan begins to amortize over its remaining term. If the loan does not amortize fully over its remaining term, a Balloon Payment will be due at maturity.</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">2. <E T="03">Negative Amortization.</E> For some loans, the UPB may increase for a period of time if the mortgage payment is contractually limited to an amount that is less than the amount of interest due, and the remainder is added to the UPB. At some point, however, the payment must exceed the interest due or else the loan balance will never be reduced to zero. In the calculation, this is permitted to occur only for payment-capped ARMs that contractually specify negative amortization. Certain types of FRMs, notably Graduated Payment Mortgages (GPMs) and Tiered Payment Mortgages (TPMs), also have variable payment schedules that result in negative amortization, but in the Stress Test all such loans are assumed to have passed their negative amortization periods.</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">3. <E T="03">Early Amortization.</E>
              </FP>

              <FP SOURCE="FP1-2">a. If a borrower has made additional principal payments (curtailments or partial prepayments) on a FRM prior to the start of the Stress Test, the contractual mortgage payment will amortize the loan prior to its final maturity, i.e. UPB<E T="52">m</E> = 0 for some m &lt;RM. <E T="03">This is an acceptable outcome in the Stress Test. Note:</E> for ARMs, the mortgage payment is recalculated, and thus the amortization schedule is recast to end exactly at m = RM, on each rate or payment reset date.</FP>

              <FP SOURCE="FP1-2">b. When this calculation is performed for a fully amortizing FRM using weighted average values to represent a Loan Group, the final scheduled payment may exceed the amount required to reduce the UPB to zero, or the UPB may reach zero prior to month RM. This is because the mortgage payment calculation is nonlinear, and as a result the average mortgage <PRTPAGE P="650"/>payment is not mathematically guaranteed to amortize the average UPB using the average MIR. This is an acceptable outcome in the Stress Test.</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">4. <E T="03">Late Amortization.</E> According to its contractual terms, the UPB of a mortgage loan must reach zero at its scheduled maturity. The borrower receives a disclosure schedule that explicitly sets forth such an Amortization Schedule. If the characteristics of a mortgage loan representing a Loan Group in the RBC Report do not result in UPB<E T="52">RM</E> = 0, it must be for one of three reasons: a data error, an averaging artifact, or an extension of the Amortization Schedule related to a delinquency prior to the start of the Stress Test. In any such case, the Stress Test does not recognize cash flows beyond the scheduled maturity date and models the performing portion of UPB<E T="52">RM</E> in month RM as a credit loss.</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">5. <E T="03">Biweekly Loans.</E> Biweekly loans are mapped into the FRM category that most closely approximates their final maturity.</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">6. <E T="03">Step-Rate (or “Two-Step”) Loans.</E> Certain loans have an initial interest rate for an extended period of time (typically several years) and then “step” to a final fixed rate for the remaining life of the loan. This final fixed rate may be either a predetermined number or a margin over an index. Such loans can be exactly represented as ARMs with the appropriate Initial Mortgage Interest Rate and Initial Rate Period, Index and Margin (if applicable). If the final rate is a predetermined rate (e.g., 8 percent per annum) then the ARM's Maximum and Minimum Rate should be set to that number. The Rate and Payment Reset Periods should be set equal to the final rate period after the step.</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">7. <E T="03">Reverse Mortgages.</E> In a reverse mortgage, a borrower receives one or more payments from the lender and the lender is repaid with a lump sum when the borrower dies, sells the property or moves out of the home permanently. The stress test models reverse mortgages as a ladder of zero-coupon securities:</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">a. 11 proxy securities for each reverse mortgage program are created.</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">b. A 10% conditional payment rate is used to create the zero-coupon securities that will mature in every year of the stress test. The zero-coupon securities are a laddered series of floating-rate coupon-bearing accreting bonds with a first payment date at maturity.</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">c. The 11th zero-coupon security will mature three months after the stress test to reflect the 35% of UPB not paid down during the stress period.</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">d. An OFHEO credit rating equivalent to AAA for the FHA insured programs and AA for other reverse mortgage programs is assigned.</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">8. <E T="03">Split-Rate ARM Loans.</E> In split-rate ARM loans, the principal portion of the payment is based on a fixed-rate amortization schedule while the interest portion is based on a floating rate index. These multifamily loans are available as fully amortizing product or with a balloon feature. The stress test model does not provide treatment for split-rate ARM loans. Split-rate loans shall be treated as ARMs when they are issued without a balloon payment feature or as Balloon ARMs when the loans contain a balloon payment feature.</FP>

              <P>[a] The Stress Test projects conditional Default and Prepayment rates for each single family Loan Group for each month of the Stress Period. The conditional rate is the percentage (by principal balance) of the remaining loans in a Loan Group that defaults or prepays during a given period of time. Computing Default and Prepayment rates for a Loan Group requires information on the Loan Group characteristics at the beginning of the Stress Test, historical and projected interest rates from section 3.3, Interest Rates, and house price growth rates and volatility measures from section 3.4, Property Valuation, of this appendix.</P>
              <P>[b] <E T="03">Explanatory Variables.</E> Several explanatory variables are used in the equations to determine Default and Prepayment rates for single family loans: Mortgage Age, Original Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio, Probability of Negative Equity, Burnout, the percentage of Investor-owned Loans, Relative Interest Rate Spread, Payment Shock (for ARMs only), Initial Rate Effect (for ARMs only), Yield Curve Slope, Relative Loan Size, and Mortgage Product Type. Regression coefficients (weights) are associated with each variable. All of this information is used to compute conditional quarterly Default and Prepayment rates throughout the Stress Test. The quarterly rates are then converted to monthly conditional Default and Prepayment rates, which are used to calculate Stress Test Whole Loan cash flows and Default losses. <E T="03">See</E> section 3.6.3.7, Stress Test Whole Loan Cash Flows, of this appendix.</P>

              <P>[c] The regression coefficients for each Loan Group will come from one of three models. The choice of model will be determined by the values of the single family product code and Government Flag in the RBC Report. <E T="03">See</E> section 3.6.3.4.3.2, Prepayment and Default Rates and Performance Fractions, of this appendix.</P>
              <P>[d] <E T="03">Special Provision for Accounting Calculations.</E> For accounting calculations that require cash flows over the entire remaining life of the instrument, Default and Prepayment rates for months beyond the end of the Stress Test are held constant at their values for month 120.<PRTPAGE P="654"/>

              <P>[a] The Stress Test projects conditional Default and Prepayment rates for each multifamily Loan Group for each month of the Stress Period. Computing Default rates for a Loan Group requires information on the Loan Group characteristics at the beginning of the Stress Test and the economic conditions of the Stress Period—interest rates (section 3.3 of this appendix), vacancy rates and rent growth rates (section 3.4 of this appendix). These input data are used to create values for the explanatory variables in the Multifamily Default component.</P>
              <P>[b] <E T="03">Explanatory Variables for Default Rates.</E> Eight explanatory variables are used as specified in the equations in section 3.6.3.5.3.1, of this appendix, to determine Default rates for multifamily loans: Mortgage Age, Mortgage Age Squared, New Book indicator, Not Ratio-updated ARM indicator, current Debt-Service Coverage Ratio, Underwater Current Debt-Service Coverage indicator, Loan-To-Value Ratio at origination/acquisition, and a Balloon Maturity indicator. Regression coefficients (weights) are associated with each variable. All of this information is used to compute conditional annual Default rates throughout the Stress Test. The annualized Default rates are converted to monthly conditional Default rates and are used together with monthly conditional Prepayment rates to calculate Stress Test Whole Loan Cash Flows. (<E T="03">See</E> section 3.6.3.7, Stress Test Whole Loan Cash Flows, of this appendix).</P>
              <P>[c] <E T="03">Specification of Multifamily Prepayment Rates.</E> Multifamily Prepayment rates are not generated by a statistical model but follow a set of Prepayment rules that capture the effect of yield maintenance, Prepayment penalties and other mechanisms that effectively curtail or eliminate multifamily Prepayments for a specified period of time.</P>
              <P>[d] <E T="03">Special Provision for Accounting Calculations.</E> For accounting calculations, which require cash flows over the entire remaining life of the instrument, Default and Prepayment rates for months beyond the end of the <PRTPAGE P="661"/>Stress Test are held constant at their values for month 120.</P>

              <P>[a] <E T="03">Definition.</E> Loss Severity is the net cost to an Enterprise of a loan Default. Though losses may be associated with delinquency, loan restructuring and/or modification and other loss mitigation efforts, foreclosures are the only loss events modeled during the Stress Test.</P>
              <P>[b] <E T="03">Calculation.</E> The Loss Severity rate is expressed as a fraction of the Unpaid Principal Balance (UPB) at the time of Default. The Stress Test calculates Loss Severity rates for each Loan Group for each month of the Stress Period. Funding costs (and offsetting revenues) of defaulted loans are captured by discounting the Loss Severity elements using a cost-of-funds interest rate that varies during the Stress Period. Table 3-41 specifies the Stress Test Loss Severity timeline. Loss Severity rates also depend upon the application of Credit Enhancements and the credit ratings of enhancement providers.</P>

              <P>[c] <E T="03">Timing of the Default Process.</E> Mortgage Defaults are modeled as follows: defaulting loans enter foreclosure after a number of months (MQ, Months in Delinquency) and are foreclosed upon several months later. MF (Months in Foreclosure) is the total number of missed payments. Upon completion of foreclosure, the loan as such ceases to exist and the property becomes Real Estate Owned by the lender (REO). After several more months (MR, Months in REO), the property <PRTPAGE P="664"/>is sold. Foreclosure expenses are paid and MI proceeds (and, for multifamily loans, loss sharing proceeds) are received when foreclosure is completed. REO expenses are paid, and sales proceeds and other Credit Enhancements are received, when the property is sold. These timing differences are not modeled explicitly in the cash flows, but their economic effect is taken into account by present-valuing the default-related cash flows to the month of Default.</P>
              <P>[d] <E T="03">Gross Loss Severity, Credit Enhancement, and Net Loss Severity.</E> The calculation of mortgage losses is divided into three parts. First, Gross Loss Severity is determined by expressing the principal loss plus unpaid interest plus expenses as a percentage of the loan UPB at the time of Default (section 3.6.3.6.2, Single Family Gross Loss Severity, and section 3.6.3.6.3, Multifamily Gross Loss Severity, of this appendix). Second, Credit Enhancements (CEs) are applied according to their terms to offset losses on loans that are covered by one or more CE arrangements (section 3.6.3.6.4, Mortgage Credit Enhancement, of this appendix). Finally, to account for the timing of these different cash flows, net losses are discounted back to the month in which the Default initially occurred (section 3.6.3.6.5, Single Family and Multifamily Net Loss Severity, of this appendix).</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3.6.3.6.2.1 Single Family Gross Loss Severity Overview</HD>
              <P>The Loss Severity calculation adds the discounted present value of various costs and offsetting revenues associated with the foreclosure of single family properties, expressed as a fraction of UPB on the date of Default. The loss elements are:</P>
              <P>[a] <E T="03">Unpaid Principal Balance.</E> Because all Loss Severity elements are expressed as a fraction of Default date UPB, the outstanding loan balance is represented as 1.</P>
              <P>[b] <E T="03">Unpaid Interest.</E> Unpaid interest at the Mortgage Interest Rate is included in the MI claim amount. Unpaid interest at the Pass-Through Rate must be paid to MBS holders until the Defaulted loan is repurchased from the MBS pool.</P>
              <P>[c] <E T="03">Foreclosure Expenses and REO Expenses.</E> Foreclosure expenses are reimbursed by MI. REO expenses are incurred in connection with the maintenance and sale of a property after foreclosure is completed. Stress Test values for these quantities are derived from historical Enterprise REO experience.</P>
              <P>[d] <E T="03">Net Recovery Proceeds from REO sale (RP).</E> This amount is less than the sale price for ordinary properties as predicted by the HPI, because of the distressed nature of the sale.</P>

              <P>[a] <E T="03">Types of Mortgage Credit Enhancements.</E> Credit Enhancements (CE) reimburse losses on individual loans. The CE most often utilized by the Enterprises at the present time is primary Mortgage Insurance (MI) including both private and government MI or loan guarantees (e.g. FHA, VA), which pays claims up to a given limit on each loan. Most other types of CE do not limit the amount payable on each loan individually, but do limit the aggregate amount available under a given CE arrangement or Contract. These two types of CE must be computed differently. To denote this distinction, this appendix will refer to “Loan Limit” and “Aggregate Limit” CE types. Loan Limit CE includes Mortgage Insurance for single family loans and Loss-Sharing Arrangements (LSA) for multifamily loans. Aggregate Limit CE includes Pool Insurance, Spread Accounts, Letters of Credit, Cash or Collateral Accounts, and Subordination Agreements. For operational convenience in the Stress Test, the Aggregate Limit classification also includes Unlimited Recourse, which has neither loan-level nor aggregate-level coverage limits, and Modified Pool Insurance, Limited Recourse, Limited Indemnification and FHA risk-sharing, which may have both loan-level and aggregate-level coverage limits.</P>
              <P>[b] <E T="03">Loan Limit Credit Enhancements.</E> Loan Limit Credit Enhancements are applied to every covered loan individually, without regard to how much has been paid on any other covered loan. For example, an MI policy covers losses on an individual loan up to a specified limit. If every loan with MI were to Default, every claim would be payable regardless of the total outlay on the part of the MI provider. Loss Sharing Arrangements on multifamily loans operate the same way.</P>
              <P>[c] <E T="03">Aggregate Limit Credit Enhancements.</E> Aggregate Limit Credit Enhancements cover a group of loans on an aggregate basis. In most such arrangements, the coverage for any individual loan is unlimited, except that the total outlay by the provider cannot exceed a certain aggregate limit. Thus, the amount of Aggregate Limit coverage available to an individual loan depends, in practice, on how much has been paid on all previous claims under the specified Contract.</P>
              <P>[d] <E T="03">Credit Enhancement Counterparty Defaults.</E> CE payments from a rated counterparty are subject to Haircuts to simulate counterparty failures during the Stress Test. These Haircuts are based on the rating of the counterparty or guarantor immediately prior to the Stress Test, and are applied each month as described in section 3.5, Counterparty Defaults, of this appendix.</P>
              <P>[e] <E T="03">Stress Test Application of Credit Enhancement.</E> The Stress Test calculates mortgage cash flows for aggregated Loan Groups, within which individual loans are assumed to have identical characteristics, and therefore are not differentiated in the computations. However, a single Loan Group may include loans with Loan Limit CE and/or one or more types of Aggregate Limit CE. Additionally, this coverage may come from a rated provider or from cash or cash-equivalent collateral. Therefore, for computational purposes it is necessary to distinguish among the different possible CE combinations that each loan or subset of loans in a Loan Group may have. In the Stress Test, this is accomplished by creating Distinct Credit Enhancement Combinations (DCCs).</P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">1. <E T="03">Distinct Credit Enhancement Combinations.</E> When aggregating individual loans into Loan Groups for the RBC Report, the applicable CE arrangements will have been identified for each loan:</FP>

              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">2. Individual loans for which all of the entries in step 1) of this section (except UPB and Loan-Limit Coverage Percent) are identical, are aggregated into a DCCs. For example, all loans in a given Loan Group with MI from a AAA-rated provider and no other CE would comprise one DCC whose balance is the aggregate of the included loans and whose MI Coverage Percent is the weighted average of that of the included loans. In each month, within each Loan Group, for each DCC, each applicable form of CE is applied in priority order to reduce Gross Loss Severity as much as possible to zero. The total CE payment for each DCC, as a percentage of Defaulted UPB is converted to a total CE payment for each Loan Group and then factored into the calculation of Net Loss Severity in section 3.6.3.6.5, Single Family and Multifamily Net Loss Severity, of this appendix.</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">3. <E T="03">DCC First and Second Priority Available Aggregate CE Balance.</E> In the Stress Test, First and Second Priority Available Aggregate CE Balances are allocated to the DCCs that are parties to each Contract on a pro-rata basis. Third and Fourth Priority Aggregate Limit Contracts are not modeled because they are extremely rare. In each month of the Stress Test these CE Balances, adjusted by appropriate Haircuts, are reduced by the losses incurred by each DCC that is a party to each Contract. Spread Account deposits, if applicable, are included in the First and Second Priority DCC Available Aggregate CE Balances.</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP1-2">a. Spread Accounts may take one of two forms: Balance-Limited, or Deposit-Limited. A Balance-Limited Spread Account receives monthly spread payments based on the UPB of the covered loans until a required balance is achieved and maintained. Any amounts paid to cover losses must be replenished by future spread payments from the covered loans that are still performing. Thus, there is no known limit to the amount of spread deposits that may be made over the life of the covered loans. In contrast, for a Deposit-Limited Spread Account the limit is similar to a customary coverage limit. The total amount of spread deposits made into the account is limited to a maximum amount specified in the Contract.</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP1-2">b. In the Stress Test, the Available Contract Balance of a Spread Account is adjusted prior to the calculation of the DCC Available Balance as reported in the RBC Report. For each Spread Account contract, the Enterprises report the Remaining Limit Amount, which represents the maximum dollar amount of additional spread deposits that could be required under the Contract. For Deposit-Limited Spread Accounts, this amount is the maximum remaining dollar amount of spread deposits required under the Contract. For Balance-Limited Spread Accounts, this amount is defined as one-twelfth of the annualized spread rate times the UPB of the covered loans at the start of the Stress Test times the weighted average Remaining term to Maturity of those loans. However, the maximum amount of spread deposits that could be received will generally be higher than the amount reasonably expected to be received during the Stress Test, because the UPB of the covered loans, which is the basis for determining the amounts of future spread deposits, declines over the term of the Contract due to Amortization, Defaults, and Prepayments. Therefore, the Enterprises report an adjusted Available Contract Balance for both types of Spread Accounts before reporting the DCC Available Balance by adding the lesser of the Remaining Limit Amount or one-twelfth of the spread rate times the UPB of the covered loans at the start of the stress test times 60 months.</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP1-2">c. Modified Pool Insurance, Limited Recourse, Limited Indemnification and FHA risk-sharing contracts may have both loan-level and aggregate-level coverage limits. To account for this aspect of these types of Aggregate Limit CE, the Enterprises report a DCC Loan Level Coverage Limit Amount, which represents the share of each loss after deductibles (such as MI or First Priority Contract payments) covered by a given MPI Contract. (The Loan Level Coverage Limit Amount takes the value of one if the Contract is not of this type, representing that 100 percent of losses are covered by other types of Contracts).</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP1-2">d. In practice, Unlimited Recourse Contracts have neither loan-level nor aggregate-level coverage limits. However, the Enterprises report the Available Aggregate CE Balance of Unlimited Recourse Contracts as the summation of the Original UPB of all covered loans.</FP>

              <FP SOURCE="FP1-2">e. The Available Aggregate CE Balances of Collateral Account Contracts funded with anything other than Cash or Cash-<PRTPAGE P="669"/>equivalents are discounted by thirty percent to account for market risk in securities that are not cash equivalents.</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP1-2">f. Enterprise Loss Positions are treated as Aggregate Limit CE in terms of reducing remaining losses eligible to be covered by a next-priority Contract. However, since Enterprise Loss Positions are typically a deductible for other forms of supplementary coverage, payments from such accounts do not reduce loss severity.</FP>
              <P>[f] <E T="03">Multiple Layers of Credit Enhancement.</E> For loans with more than one type of Credit Enhancement, MI or Loss Sharing is applied first, and then other types of CE (if available) are applied in priority order to the remaining losses. MI and Loss Sharing claims are payable regardless of whether (and to what extent) a loan is also covered by other forms of CE. MI is unique in that the MI payment is based on a percentage of a Claim Amount equal to the entire Defaulted UPB plus expenses, not the actual loss incurred upon liquidation. Therefore, an Enterprise can receive MI payments on a defaulted loan in excess of the actual realized loss on that loan. However, it is frequently the case that MI payments are insufficient to cover the entire loss amount. In such cases, one or more types of Aggregate Limit CE may be available to make up the deficiency. Unlike MI claims, however, the Claim Amounts for Loss Sharing and for all Aggregate Limit CE types do depend on the actual losses incurred; and unlike Loss Sharing and MI, Claim Amounts payable under other forms of CE are net of payments received on account of other forms of CE. When a single loan is covered by multiple forms of CE, the order in which they are to be applied (First Priority, Second Priority, etc.) must be specified. To avoid double-counting, a higher-numbered priority CE only covers losses that were not covered by a lower-numbered priority CE.</P>

              <P>[a] For accounting purposes, cash flows are adjusted to reflect (1) the value over time of discounts, premiums and fees paid or received (Deferred Balances) when an asset was acquired; and (2) the fact that mortgage interest is paid in arrears, i.e. it is received in the month after it is earned. In the Stress Test calculations, payments are indexed by the month in which they are received. Therefore, interest received in month m was earned in month m−1. However, principal is accounted for in the month received.</P>
              <P>[b] Deferred Balances are amortized over the remaining life of the asset. Therefore, these calculations go beyond the end of the Stress Test if the Remaining Maturity (RM) is greater than the 120 months of the Stress Test. The projection of cash flows beyond the end of the Stress Test is discussed in the individual sections where the cash flows are first calculated. In general, for interest rate indexes, monthly Prepayment rates and monthly Default rates, the value for m = 120 is used for all months 120 &lt;m ≤RM, but LS = 0 for m &gt;120.</P>

              <P>The final outputs for section 3.6, Whole Loan Cash Flows, of this appendix are as specified in Table 3-52, and Table 3-55.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">3.7 Mortgage-Related Securities Cash Flows</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3.7.1 Mortgage-Related Securities Overview</HD>
              <P>[a] Mortgage-Related Securities (MRSs) include Single Class MBSs, Multi-class MBSs (REMICs or Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (CMOs)), Mortgage Revenue Bonds (MRBs), and Derivative Mortgage Securities such as Interest-Only and Principal-Only Stripped MBSs. MBSs and Derivative Mortgage Securities are issued by the Enterprises, Ginnie Mae and private issuers. MRBs are issued by State and local governments or their instrumentalities. For computational purposes, certain Asset-Backed Securities (ABS) backed by mortgages (Mortgage ABSs backed by manufactured housing loans, second mortgages or home equity loans) are treated as REMICs in the Stress Test.</P>
              <P>[b] Cash flows from Single Class MBSs represent the pass-through of all principal and interest payments, net of servicing and guarantee fees, on the underlying pools of mortgages. Cash flows from Multi-Class MBSs and Derivative Mortgage Securities represent a specified portion of the cash flows produced by an underlying pool of mortgages and/or Mortgage-Related Securities, determined according to rules set forth in offering documents for the securities. MRBs may have specific maturity schedules and call provisions, whereas MBSs have only expected maturities and, in most cases, no issuer call provision (other than “cleanup calls” if the pool balance becomes quite small). However, the timing of principal payments for MRBs is still closely related to that of their underlying mortgage collateral. The Stress Test treats most MRBs in a manner similar to single class MBSs. Finally, a small number of Enterprise and private label REMIC securities for which modeling information is not readily available and which are not modeled by a commercial information service (referred to as “miscellaneous MRS”) are treated separately.</P>

              <P>[c] In addition to reflecting the defaults of mortgage borrowers during the Stress Period, the Stress Test considers the possibility of issuer Default on Mortgage-Related Securities. Credit impairments throughout the Stress Period are based on the rating of these securities, and are modeled by reducing contractual interest payments and “writing down” principal. No Credit Losses are assumed for the Enterprise's own securities and Ginnie Mae securities (<E T="03">see</E> section 3.5.3, Counterparty Defaults Procedures, of this appendix).</P>
              <P>[d] The calculation of cash flows for Mortgage-Related Securities requires information from the Enterprises identifying their holdings, publicly available information characterizing the securities, and information on the interest rate, mortgage performance and credit rating (for rated securities).</P>
              <P>[e] Cash and accounting flows—monthly principal and interest payments and amortization expense—are produced for each month of the Stress Period for each security. (Principal- and interest-only securities pay principal or interest respectively.) These cash flows are input to the Operations, Taxes, and Accounting component of the Stress Test.</P>

              <P>[f] In a currency swap, the Enterprise receives payments that are denominated in a foreign currency and it makes payments in U.S. dollars. The main difference between currency swaps and the type of swaps discussed above is that in a currency swap principal amounts are actually exchanged between the two counterparties. Currency swaps are divided into two classes, as shown in Table 3-65. <SU>5</SU>

              <P>[a] The Nonmortgage Instrument Cash Flows component of the Stress Test requires numerous inputs. Instrument level inputs provided by the Enterprises in the RBC Report are listed in Table 3-66. Many instrument classes require simulated Interest Rates because their interest payments adjust periodically based on rates tied to various indexes. These rates are generated as described in section 3.3, Interest Rates, of this appendix.<PRTPAGE P="690"/>

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3.8.3.6.2 Complex Financial Instruments</HD>
              <P>[a] Some instruments have more complex or non-standard features than those described in section 3.8.3.6.1, Non-Complex Financial Instruments, of this appendix. These complexities can include more sophisticated variants of characteristics such as principal or notional amortization schedules, interest accrual methodologies, coupon reset formulas, and option features. In these instances, additional information may be required to completely specify the contractual cash flows or a proxy treatment for these instruments.</P>
              <P>[b] An example of an instrument with complex features is an indexed amortizing swap. This instrument is non-standard because its notional amount declines in a way that is related to the level of interest rates. Its amortization table contains a notional amount reduction factor for a given range of interest rates. To compute cash flows for this instrument, reduce the notional amount on each payment date as specified in the amortization table. (The notional amount at the beginning of the Stress Period is given as an input to the calculation.)</P>
              <P>[c] Special treatment is also required for foreign-currency-linked notes, the redemption value of which is tied to a specific foreign exchange rate. These require special treatment because the Stress Test does not forecast foreign currency rates. If these instruments are currency-hedged, then the note plus the hedge comprise a synthetic debt instrument for which only the pay side of the swap is modeled. If these instruments are not currency-hedged, the following treatment applies:</P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">1. In the up-rate scenario, the U.S. dollar per unit of foreign currency ratio is increased in proportion to the increase in the ten-year CMT; therefore, the amount of an interest or principal payment is increased accordingly. For example, if the ten-year CMT shifts up by 50 percent, then the U.S. dollar per unit of foreign currency ratio shifts up by 50 percent. In the Stress Test, the payment would be multiplied by 1.5.</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">2. In the down-rate scenario, the foreign currency per U.S. dollar ratio is decreased in proportion to the decrease in the ten-year CMT.</FP>
              <P>[d] Futures and Options on Futures also require special treatment:</P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">1. Settle positions on their expiration dates. Exercise only in-the-money options (settlement value greater than zero).</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">2. Settle all contracts for cash</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">3. Calculate the cash settlement amount—the change in price of a contract from the contract trade date to its expiration date.

              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">2. Calculate a “normalized” fixed-pay coupon by subtracting the spread over the index, if any, from the coupon on the fixed-rate swap leg.</FP>

              <P>[f] CPI-Linked Instruments also require special treatment. The stress test lacks the ability to accommodate floating-rate instruments that reset in response to changes in the consumer price index (CPI) as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Enterprise issuance of CPI-linked instruments is tied to swap market transactions intended to create desired synthetic debt structure and terms. In such cases, the true economic position nets to the payment terms of the related derivative contract. Accordingly, in order to accommodate and address the existence of CPI-linked instruments in the Enterprises' portfolios, the net synthetic position shall be evaluated in the stress test. That is, for CPI-linked instruments tied to swap transactions that are formally linked in a hedge accounting relationship, the Enterprise should substitute the CPI-linked instrument's coupon payment terms with those of the related swap contract.</P>

              <P>[g] Pre-refunded municipal bonds also require special treatments. Pre-refunded municipal bonds are collateralized by securities that are structured to fund all the cash flows <PRTPAGE P="696"/>of the refunded municipal bonds until the bonds are callable. Since the call date for the bonds, also referred to as the pre-refunded date, is a more accurate representation of the payoff date than the contractual maturity date of the bonds, the stress test models the bonds to mature on the call date.</P>
              <P>[h] If a financial instrument's inputs are described in section 3.1, Data, of this appendix, then model the instrument according to its terms; however, the Director reserves the authority to determine a more appropriate treatment if modeling the instrument according to its terms does not capture the instrument's impact on Enterprise risk. If the financial instrument's inputs are not described in section 3.1, then treat it as described in section 3.9, Alternative Modeling Treatments, of this appendix.</P>

              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">1. Project cash flows for the instrument with the imbedded option assuming that the option is not exercised. If the instrument is tied to an index, assume that the index remains constant at its value on that date.</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">2. Determine the discount rate that equates the outstanding balance of the security plus option premium and accrued interest to the sum of the discounted values of the projected cash flows. This discount rate is called the yield-to-maturity.</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">3. Convert the yield-to-maturity to a bond-equivalent yield and compare the bond-equivalent yield with the projected Enterprise Cost of Funds for debt with an equivalent maturity. Interpolate linearly if the maturity is not equal to one of the maturities specified in section 3.3, Interest Rates, of this appendix.</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">4. If the equivalent-maturity Enterprise Cost of Funds is lower (higher) than 50 basis points below (above) the bond-equivalent yield of the callable (putable) instrument, then the option is exercised. Otherwise, the option is not exercised, and it is evaluated at the next period when the option can be exercised.</FP>
              <P>[c] Some swap derivative contracts have cancellation features that allow either counterparty to terminate the contracts on certain dates. The cancellation feature is evaluated by comparing the fixed-rate leg of the swap to the Enterprise Cost of Funds. If either leg of the swap is cancelled, then the other leg is cancelled concurrently. Cancellable swaps are treated in the following manner:</P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">1. For each period when an option can be exercised, compare the swap's fixed-leg coupon rate to the Enterprise Cost of Funds with a maturity equivalent to the maturity date of the swap.</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">2. If the option is a Call, it is deemed to be exercisable at the discretion of the Enterprise. If the option is a Put, it is deemed to be exercisable at the discretion of the Counterparty. If the option is a PutCall, it is deemed to be exercisable at the discretion of either party to the swap. Exercise the option when the swap is out of the money for the party who holds the option. A swap is considered out of the money when the rate on its fixed leg is at least 50 basis point higher or lower, depending upon whether the fixed rate is paid or received, than the like-maturity Enterprise Cost of Funds. For zero coupon swaps in all option exercise periods, use the yield to maturity calculated by equating the notional amount plus the unamortized discount at the start of the Stress Test to the present value of the notional amount at maturity.</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP1-2">a. For example, if the Enterprise holds a call option for a fixed-pay swap and the coupon rate on the fixed-pay leg is at least 50 basis points above the Enterprise cost of funds for a maturity equivalent to that of the swap, then cancel the swap. Otherwise, the swap is not cancelled and it is evaluated the next time that the swap can be cancelled.</FP>

              <P>[a] Monthly interest accruals are calculated by prorating the interest cash flows on an actual-day basis. In this section, the term “from” means from and including, “to” means up to and not including, and “through” means up to and including. As an example, from the first to the third of a month is two days from the first through the third is three days. This convention is used to facilitate the day count and does not imply on which day's payments or accruals are actually made. Use one of the three following methodologies with the exception <PRTPAGE P="697"/>that interest cash flow dates occurring on or after the 30th of a month are considered as occurring on the last day of the month:</P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">1. If the final interest cash flow occurs within the month, the interest accrual for that month is calculated by multiplying the final interest cash flow amount (as calculated in section 3.8.3.6 of this appendix) times the number of days from the beginning of the month through the final maturity date divided by the number of days from the previous interest cash flow date to the maturity date.</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">2. If an interest cash flow other than the final interest cash flow occurs within a month, the interest accrual for that month is determined by multiplying the interest cash flow amount for the current month times the number of days from the beginning of the month through the interest cash flow date, divided by the number of days from the previous interest cash flow date (or issue date) to this interest cash flow date. To this add the interest cash flow amount for the next interest cash flow date times the number of days from the current month's interest cash flow date to the end of the month, divided by the number of days from the current month's interest cash flow date to the following next interest cash flow date.</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">3. If no interest cash flows occur during a month other than the issue month, the monthly interest accrual is calculated by multiplying the next interest cash flow amount times the number of days in the month divided by the number of days from the previous interest cash flow date to the next interest cash flow date.</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">4. If the issue month occurs after the start of the Stress Test, the monthly interest accrual is calculated by multiplying the next interest cash flow amount by the number of days in the month minus the day of issue, divided by the number of days from the issue date to the next interest cash flow date.</FP>

              <P>[a] Finally, the interest and principal cash flows received by the Enterprises for non-mortgage instruments other than swaps and foreign currency-related instruments are <PRTPAGE P="699"/>Haircut (i.e., reduced) by a percentage to account for the risk of counterparty insolvency, if a counterparty obligation exists. The amount of the Haircut is calculated based on the public rating of the counterparty and time during the stress period in which the cash flow occurs, as specified in section 3.5, Counterparty Defaults, of this appendix.</P>
              <P>[b] An Enterprise may issue debt denominated in, or indexed to, foreign currencies, and eliminate the resulting foreign currency exposure by entering into currency swap agreements. The combination of the debt and the swap creates synthetic debt with principal and interest payments denominated in U.S. dollars. The Haircuts for currency swaps are applied to the pay (dollar-denominated) side of the currency swaps, or to the cash outflows of the synthetic debt instrument. Therefore, the payments made by the Enterprise on a foreign currency contract are increased by the haircut amount. The Haircuts and the Phase-in periods for currency swaps are detailed in Table 3-31, under Derivative Contracts.</P>
              <P>[c] Haircuts for swaps that are not foreign currency related are applied to the Monthly Interest Accruals (as calculated in section 3.8.3.8, of this appendix) on the receive leg minus the Monthly Interest Accruals on the pay leg when this difference is positive. Use the maximum haircut from Table 3-31 for periods before and after the implementation of netting, as appropriate. After the implementation of netting, net the swap proceeds for each counterparty before applying the haircuts. The following example applies to an Enterprise having two swaps with the same counterparty. On the first swap, the Enterprise pays fixed and receives floating and on the second swap it pays floating and receives fixed. If the counterparty is a net payer to the Enterprise, the haircuts will be applied to the sum of the two receive legs net of the sum of the two pay legs.</P>

              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">3. Provide an implicit procedure by exact substitution, i.e., by representing the item as a computationally equivalent combination of other items that are specified in paragraphs (1) or (2) in this section (i.e., the appendix specifies treatments for two or more instruments, which, in combination, exactly produce the item's cash flows); or</FP>

Permit the approximation of one or more computational characteristics by other similar values that are explicitly specified in this appendix, or in the RBC Report instructions (i.e., the appendix specifies a treatment, or combination of treatments, that can be used as a reasonable proxy for the computational characteristics of the item). Such proxy treatments must be approved by OFHEO. OFHEO may, in its discretion, approve a proposed proxy treatment, adopt a different proxy treatment, or treat items for which a proxy treatment has been proposed by the Enterprises according to the remaining provisions of section 3.9, Alternative Modeling Treatments, of this appendix.</FP>

              <P>[c] For a given on- or off-balance sheet item, the appropriate AMT is determined according to the categories specified in section <PRTPAGE P="700"/>3.9.3, Alternative Modeling Treatments Procedures, of this appendix, based on the information available for that item.

              <P>For each item, one of the following alternatives will be applied:</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3.9.3.1 Off-Balance Sheet Items</HD>
              <P>[a] If the item is a guarantee of a tax-exempt multifamily housing bond, or a single family or multifamily whole-loan REMIC class rated triple-A, or other similar transaction guaranteed by the Enterprises, multiply the face value of the guaranteed instruments by 0.45 percent. This amount is added to the amount of capital required to maintain positive total capital throughout the ten-year Stress Period. Any instruments or obligations with 100 percent of collateral guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) are excluded from this calculation.</P>
              <P>[b] Otherwise, add to the amount of capital required to maintain positive total capital throughout the ten-year Stress Period an amount equal to the face or notional value of the item at the beginning of the Stress Period times three percent.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3.9.3.2 Reconciling Items</HD>
              <P>Reconciling items falling into this category will be treated according to the specifications in section 3.10, Operations, Taxes, and Accounting, of this appendix.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3.9.3.3 Balance Sheet Items</HD>
              <P>[a] If the item is a trading security recorded at fair value according to FAS 115, then the book value (the face value adjusted for deferred balances) will be converted to cash in the first month of the Stress Test.</P>
              <P>[b] Otherwise, if the item is an earning asset, then it is treated as a held-to-maturity asset, based on book value, as follows:</P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">1. In the up-rate scenario, it will be treated as a held-to-maturity bond paying compound interest on a 30/360 basis at maturity, with the item's contractual maturity and rate. The item will be Haircut according to its rating. If no maturity is provided, maturity will be set at 120 months. If no rate is provided, a rate will be assigned at the Initial Enterprise Cost of Funds whose term is equal to the remaining maturity, less 200 basis points (but not less than zero). If no rating is provided, the asset will be classified as unrated.</FP>

              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">2. In the down-rate scenario, it will be treated as a held-to-maturity bond paying compound interest on a 30/360 basis at maturity, with the item's contractual <PRTPAGE P="701"/>maturity and rate. The item will be Haircut according to its rating. If no maturity is provided, maturity will be set at 120 months. If no rate is provided, a rate will be assigned at the floating one-month Enterprise Cost of Funds less 200 basis points (but not less than zero). If no rating is provided, the asset will be classified as unrated.</FP>
              <P>[c] If the item is a non-earning asset it will remain on the books and earn no interest throughout the Stress Period.</P>
              <P>[d] Otherwise, if the item is a liability, then it is treated as follows, based on book value:</P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">1. In the up-rate scenario, it will be treated as non-callable and monthly coupon-paying to maturity on a 30/360 basis. If the coupon rate is not specified, the liability will be given a floating rate at the one-month Enterprise Cost of Funds plus 200 basis points. If no maturity is provided, maturity will be set at 120 months.</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">2. In the down-rate scenario, it will be treated as non-callable and monthly coupon paying to maturity. If no coupon is provided, the liability will be given a fixed rate at the Initial Enterprise Cost of Funds plus 200 basis points. If no maturity is provided, maturity will be set at ten years.</FP>
              <P>[e] Unamortized Balances should be amortized on a straight-line basis over the designated remaining maturity of the instrument.</P>
              <P>[f] All items in this section are treated as if they had no options or cancellation features. The face value will be held constant until maturity. If an item has an adjustable rate, it is assumed that the interest rate will adjust monthly with no caps and a lifetime floor of zero percent.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3.9.4 Alternative Modeling Treatments Outputs</HD>
              <P>For each AMT item, the output is a set of cash and accounting flows appropriate to its respective treatment as specified in section 3.9.3, Alternative Modeling Treatments Procedures, or specific amounts to be applied in section 3.12, Calculation of the Risk-Based Capital Requirement, of this appendix.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3.10.1 Operations, Taxes, and Accounting Overview</HD>
              <P>This section describes the procedures for determining new debt issuance and investments, computing capital distributions, calculating operating expenses and taxes, and creating pro forma balance sheets and income statements. Input data include an Enterprise's balance sheet at the beginning of the Stress Period, interest rates from the Interest Rates component of the Stress Test, and the outputs from cash flow components of the Stress Test. The outputs of the procedures discussed in this section—monthly pro forma balance sheets, cash flow and income statements for each month of the Stress Test—are the basis for the capital calculation described in section 3.12, Calculation of the Risk-Based Capital Requirement, of this appendix.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3.10.2 Operations, Taxes, and Accounting Inputs</HD>
              <P>[a] Data described in section 3.1, Data, section 3.3.4, Interest Rates Outputs, section 3.6.4, Final Whole Loan Cash Flow Outputs, section 3.7.4, Mortgage-Related Securities Outputs, and section 3.8.4, Nonmortgage Instrument Outputs, of this appendix, is used to produce monthly pro forma balance sheets and income statements for the Enterprises.

              <P>The Stress Test calculates new debt and investments, dividends, allowances for loan losses, operating expenses, and income taxes. These calculations are determined by, and also affect, the pro forma balance sheets and income statements during the Stress Period.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3.10.3.1 New Debt and Investments</HD>
              <P>[a] For each month of the Stress Test, cash deficits and surpluses are eliminated by issuing new debt or purchasing new investments. The Stress Test calculates cash received and cash disbursed each month in order to determine the net availability of cash. Depending on the calculated net cash position at month end, new short term investments are purchased at mid-month or a mix of long and short term debt is issued at mid-month so that the recalculated net cash position at month end is zero.</P>
              <P>[b] For each month of the Stress Test, the following calculations are performed to determine the amount and type of new debt and investments. The short-term investments and appropriate mix of long-term and short-term debt are reflected in the pro forma balance sheets. Interest income or interest expense for the new investments or debt are reflected in the pro forma income statements.</P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">1. In any month in which the cash position is positive at the end of the month, the Stress Test invests the Enterprise's excess cash on the 15th day of that month in one-month Treasury bills that yield the six-month Treasury rate for that month as specified in section 3.3, Interest Rates, of this appendix.</FP>

              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">2. In any month in which the cash position is negative at the end of the month, the Stress Test issues a mix of new short-term and long-term debt on the 15th day of that month. New short-term debt issued is six-month discount notes with a <PRTPAGE P="706"/>discount rate at the six-month Enterprise Cost of Funds as specified in section 3.3, Interest Rates, of this appendix, with interest accruing on a 30/360 basis. New long-term debt issued is five-year bonds not callable for the first year (“five-year-no call-one”) with an American call at par after the end of the first year, semiannual coupons on a 30/360 basis with principal paid at maturity or call, and a coupon rate set at the five year Enterprise Cost of Funds as specified in section 3.3, Interest Rates, of this appendix, plus a 50 basis point premium for the call option. During the Stress Test, the call option for new long-term debt issued is not executed in the up-rate scenario and in the down-rate scenario follows the same call exercise rule as other debt. An issuance cost of 2.5 basis points is assessed on new short-term debt at issue and an issuance cost of 20 basis points is assessed on new long-term debt at issue. New long-term debt is issued to target a total debt mix of short- to long-term debt that is the same as the short- to long-term debt mix at the beginning of the Stress Test. Issuance fees for new debt are amortized on a straight line basis to the maturity of the appropriate instrument.</FP>

Dividends are decided upon and paid during the first month after the end of the quarter for which they are declared. If any dividends are paid, the dividend payout cannot exceed an amount equal to core capital less the estimated minimum capital requirement at the end of the quarter. Share repurchases are made during the middle month of the quarter.</P>

Preferred stock dividends may not exceed core capital less the estimated minimum capital requirement at the end of the preceding quarter.</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">2. <E T="03">Common Stock.</E> In the first year of the Stress Test, dividends are paid on common stock in each of the four quarters after preferred dividends, if any, are paid unless the Enterprise's capital is, or after the payment, would be, below the estimated minimum capital requirement.</FP>

Net stock repurchases equal repurchases less receipts from new stock issued, but not less than zero. Repurchases in each of the first two quarters may occur only up to the point that the amount of core capital exceeds the estimated minimum capital requirement at the end of the first month of the quarter.</FP>

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3.10.3.3 Allowances for Loan Losses and Other Charge-Offs</HD>
              <P>[a] The Stress Test calculates a tentative allowance for loan losses monthly by multiplying current-month Credit Losses (CL in Table 3-52) by twelve, thus annualizing current month Credit Losses. This is a proxy for a loss contingency where it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. For both the retained and sold portfolios, these credit losses include lost principal (net of recoveries from credit enhancements and disposition of the real estate collateral), and foreclosure, holding, and disposition costs. If the tentative allowance for loan losses for the current period is greater than the balance from the prior month less charge-offs (i.e., credit losses) for the current month, a provision (i.e., expense) is recorded. Otherwise, no provision is made and the allowance for loan losses is equal to the prior period amount less current month charge-offs.</P>
              <P>[b] Other charge-offs result from Haircuts related to mortgage revenue bonds, private-issue MBS, and non mortgage investments, described in their respective cash flow components.</P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">1. In the case of Enterprise investments in securities, these Haircuts result in the receipt of less principal and interest than is contractually due. Lost principal is recorded as Other Losses when due and not received, while lost interest is recorded as a reduction of Interest Income.</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">2. In the case of interest rate derivative instruments, these Haircuts result in the receipt of less net interest than is contractually due from, or the payment of more interest than is contractually due to, an Enterprise counterparty. For those swaps that are linked to Enterprise investments, the increase or decrease of net swap interest due is recorded as an adjustment of Interest Income. For those swaps that are linked to Enterprise debt obligations, the increase or decrease of net swap interest due is recorded as an adjustment of Interest Expense.</FP>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3.10.3.4 Operating Expenses</HD>
              <P>[a] The Stress Test calculates operating expenses, which include non-interest costs such as those related to an Enterprise's salaries and benefits, professional services, property, equipment and office space. Over the Stress Period, operating expenses are equal to the sum of two components. The first component in each month is equal to one-third (<FR>1/3</FR>) of the average monthly operating expenses of the Enterprise in the quarter immediately preceding the start of the Stress Test. The second component changes in proportion to the change in the size of the Enterprise's mortgage portfolio (i.e., the sum of outstanding principal balances of its retained and sold mortgage portfolios). The Stress Test calculates the Enterprise's mortgage portfolio at the end of each month of the Stress Period as a percentage of the portfolio at the start of the Stress Test, and then multiplies the percentage of assets remaining by two-thirds (<FR>2/3</FR>) of the average monthly operating expenses of the Enterprise in the quarter immediately preceding the start of the Stress Test.</P>
              <P>[b] The sum of the two components in paragraph [a], of this section, is multiplied by a factor which equals</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3.10.3.5 Income Taxes</HD>
              <P>[a] Both Enterprises are subject to Federal income taxes, but neither is subject to state or local income taxes.</P>
              <P>[b] The Stress Test applies an effective Federal income tax rate of 30 percent when calculating the monthly provision for income taxes (e.g., income tax expense). OFHEO may change the 30 percent income tax rate if there are significant changes in Enterprise experience or changes in the statutory income tax.</P>

              <P>[c] The Stress Test sets income tax expense for tax purposes equal to the provision for income taxes. The effects of timing differences between taxable income and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles <PRTPAGE P="709"/>(GAAP) income before income taxes are ignored. Income before taxes is adjusted by the ratio of Enterprise retained earnings and retained earnings after adjustments are made that revert investment securities and derivatives to amortized cost. Therefore, Net Operating Loss (NOL) occurs only when the net income, before the provision for income taxes, is negative.</P>
              <P>[d] Payments for estimated income taxes are made quarterly, in the month after the end of the quarter. At the end of each year, the annual estimated tax amount is compared to the annual actual tax amount. In March of the next year, a payment of remaining taxes is made or a refund for overpayment of income taxes is received.</P>
              <P>[e] The NOL for the current year is “carried back” to offset taxes in any or all of the preceding two calendar years. (The Enterprises' tax year is the same as the calendar year.) This offset of the prior years' taxes results in a negative provision for income taxes (e.g., income) for the current year. Use of a carry back reduces available carry backs in subsequent years. Any NOL remaining after carry backs are exhausted becomes a carry forward.</P>
              <P>[f] Carry forwards represent NOLs that cannot be carried back to offset previous years' taxes, but can be used to offset taxes in any or all of the subsequent 20 years. Carry forwards accumulate until used, or until they expire 20 years after they are generated.</P>
              <P>[g] A valuation adjustment is used to eliminate any deferred tax asset.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3.10.3.6 Accounting</HD>

              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">2. The par or stated value of outstanding perpetual, noncumulative preferred stock,</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">3. Paid-in capital, and</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">4. Retained earnings.</FP>
              <P>[b] In order to determine the amount of total capital an Enterprise must hold to maintain positive total capital throughout the ten-year Stress Period, the Stress Test projects the four components of equity listed in paragraph [a] of this section plus general loss allowances as part of the monthly pro forma balance sheets.</P>
              <P>[c] Details of an Enterprise's actual balance sheet at the beginning of the Stress Test are recorded from a combination of starting position balances for all instruments for which other components of the Stress Test calculate cash flows and other starting position balances for assets, liabilities, and equity accounts needed to complete an Enterprise's balance sheet.</P>
              <P>[d] After recording an Enterprise's balance sheet at the beginning of the Stress Period, the Stress Test creates monthly pro forma balance sheets and income statements by recording output from the cash flow components of the Stress Test; recording new debt and investments (and related interest), dividends, loss allowances, operating expenses, and taxes; and applying accounting rules pertaining to pro forma balance sheets and income statements.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3.10.3.6.1 Accounting for Cash Flows and Accounting Flows</HD>
              <P>[a] Balances at the beginning of the Stress Test are obtained from the RBC Report. Subsequent changes to related pro forma balance sheet and income statement accounts are obtained from data generated by cash flow components of the Stress Test as follows:</P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">1. <E T="03">Retained Loans.</E> For Retained Loans, interest cash flows in the first month of the Stress Period reduce accrued interest receivable at the beginning of the Stress Test. Subsequent months interest cash flows are recorded as accrued interest receivable and interest income in the month prior to receipt. When the interest cash flows are received, accrued interest receivable is reduced. Monthly principal cash flows (including Prepayments and defaulted principal) are recorded as reductions in the outstanding balance of the loan group. Net losses on Defaults are charged off against the allowance for loan losses. Amortization of deferred discounts increases interest income; amortization of deferred premiums decreases interest income.</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">2. <E T="03">Mortgage Revenue Bonds.</E> For mortgage revenue bonds, interest cash flows in the first month of the Stress Period reduce accrued interest receivable at the beginning of the Stress Test. Subsequent months' interest cash flows are recorded as accrued interest receivable and interest income in the month prior to receipt. When the interest cash flows are received, accrued interest receivable is reduced. Monthly principal cash flows (including Prepayments) are recorded in the month received as a reduction in the outstanding balance of mortgage assets. Defaulted principal is charged off when due and is not received. Amortization of deferred discounts increases interest income; amortization of deferred premiums decreases interest income.</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">3. <E T="03">Nonmortgage Instruments.</E> Principal repayments of nonmortgage instruments reduce the nonmortgage instrument and <PRTPAGE P="710"/>increases or decreases cash. When the interest cash flows are received or paid, accrued interest receivable or payable is reduced. Accrued interest includes both amounts at the beginning of the Stress Period and subsequent monthly accruals (also recorded as interest income or interest expense). Amortization of deferred discounts and premiums increases or decreases interest income or interest expense. Defaulted principal is charged off when due and not received.</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">4. <E T="03">Sold Portfolio.</E> Sold portfolio cash flows include monthly guarantee fees, float, and principal and interest due MBS investors. Guarantee fees are recorded as income in the month received. Principal and interest due mortgage security investors does not affect the balance sheet; however, interest earned on these amounts (float) is recorded as income in the month the underlying principal and interest payments are received. Principal payments received and defaulted loan balances reduce the outstanding balance of the sold portfolio. Losses (net of recoveries) are charged off against the allowance for losses on the sold portfolio (a liability on the pro forma balance sheets) and reduce cash. Amortization of deferred premiums and discounts increases or decreases guarantee fees.</FP>

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3.10.4 Operations, Taxes, and Accounting Outputs</HD>

              <P>For each month of the Stress Period, the Stress Test produces a pro forma balance sheet and income statement. The Operations, Taxes and Accounting component outputs 121 monthly and 11 annual balance sheets, 120 monthly and 10 annual income statements, and 120 monthly and 10 annual cash flow statements, including part-year statements for the first and last calendar years of the Stress Test when necessary. These pro forma financial statements are the inputs for calculation of the risk-based capital requirement (<E T="03">see</E> section 3.12, Calculation of the Risk-Based Capital Requirement, of this appendix).</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">3.11 Treatment of New Enterprise Activities</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3.11.1 New Enterprise Activities Overview</HD>
              <P>[a] Given rapid innovation in the financial services industry, OFHEO anticipates the Enterprises will become involved with new mortgage products, investments, debt and derivative instruments, and business activities, which must be accommodated in the Stress Test in order to capture all of the risk in the Enterprises' businesses. New accounting entries resulting from these innovations and changes in accounting must also be accommodated. The regulation is sufficiently flexible and complete to address new Enterprise activities as they emerge, using the procedures outlined in this section. However, OFHEO will monitor the Enterprises' activities and, when appropriate, propose amendments to this regulation addressing the treatment of new instruments, activities, or accounting treatments.</P>
              <P>[b] For the purpose of this section of the appendix, the term New Activity means any type of asset, liability, off-balance-sheet item, accounting entry, or activity to which a Stress Test treatment has not previously been applied. In addition, the Director has the discretion to treat as a New Activity: (1) any activity or instrument with characteristics or unusual features that create risks or hedges for the Enterprise that are not reflected adequately in the specified treatments for similar activities or instruments; and (2) any activity or instrument for which the specified treatment no longer adequately reflects the risk/benefit to the Enterprise, either because of increased volume or because new information concerning those risks/hedges has become available.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3.11.2 New Enterprise Activities Inputs</HD>

              <P>[a] Complete data and full explanations of the operation of the New Activity sufficient to understand the risk profile of the New Activity must be provided by the Enterprise. The Enterprises are required to notify OFHEO, pursuant to § 1750.12(c), of proposals related to New Activities as soon as possible, but in any event no later than five calendar days after the date on which the transaction closes or is settled. The Enterprises are encouraged to suggest an appropriate capital treatment that will fully capture the credit and interest rate risk in the New Activity. Information on New Activities must also be <PRTPAGE P="712"/>submitted and appropriately identified as such in the RBC Report.</P>
              <P>[b] The Stress Test will not give an Enterprise the capital benefit associated with a New Activity where OFHEO determines that the impact of that activity on the risk-based capital level of the Enterprise is not commensurate with the economic benefit to the Enterprise.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3.11.3 New Enterprise Activities Procedures</HD>
              <P>[a] OFHEO will analyze the risk characteristics and determine whether an existing approach specified in the appendix appropriately captures the risk of the New Activity or whether some combination or adaptation of existing approaches specified in the appendix is appropriate. For example, the Stress Test might employ its mortgage performance components and adapt its cash flow components to simulate accurately the loss mitigating effects and counterparty credit risk of credit derivatives.</P>
              <P>[b] Where there is no reasonable approach using existing combinations or adaptations of treatments specified in this appendix that could be applied within the timeframe for computing a quarterly capital calculation, the Stress Test will employ an appropriately conservative treatment, consistent with OFHEO's role as a safety and soundness regulator. Such treatment may include an alternative modeling treatment specified in section 3.9, Alternative Modeling Treatments, of this appendix, or some other conservative treatment that OFHEO deems more appropriate.</P>
              <P>[c] OFHEO will provide the Enterprise with its estimate of the capital treatment as soon as possible after receiving notice of the New Activity. In any event, the Enterprise will be notified of the capital treatment in accordance with the notice of proposed capital classification provided for in § 1777.21 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>[d] After a treatment has been incorporated into a final capital classification, OFHEO will provide notice of such treatment to the public, including the other Enterprise. OFHEO will consider any comments it receives from the public regarding the treatment during subsequent quarters. OFHEO may change the treatment as a result of such input or otherwise, if OFHEO determines that the risks of the New Activity are not appropriately reflected in a treatment previously adopted.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3.11.4 New Enterprise Activities Outputs</HD>

              <HD SOURCE="HD3">3.12.1 Risk-Based Capital Requirement Overview</HD>
              <P>The risk-based capital requirement is the sum of (1) the minimum amount of total capital that an Enterprise must hold at the start of the Stress Test in order to maintain positive total capital throughout the ten-year Stress Period, for all financial instruments explicitly modeled in the Stress Test (Stress Test capital subtotal) and (2) certain additional amounts relating to off-balance-sheet items addressed in section 3.9, Alternative Modeling Treatments, of this appendix, and (3) 30 percent of that sum for management and operations risk. The Stress Test capital subtotal is determined based on monthly total capital figures from the pro forma financial statements, the additional amounts related to off-balance-sheet items, and Enterprise short term borrowing and investment rates.</P>

              <P>[a] The following eight steps are used to determine the Stress Test capital subtotal and the risk-based capital requirement for an Enterprise:</P>

              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">1. Determine the effective tax rate in each month. If the provision for income taxes is positive (reflecting taxes owed) or negative (reflecting tax refunds to be received), then the effective tax rate is 30 percent. If the provision for income taxes is zero after applying any valuation adjustments (<E T="03">see</E> section 3.10.3.6, Accounting, of this appendix), then the effective tax rate applied in step 3. of this section is zero.</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">2. Determine whether an Enterprise is an investor or a borrower in each month of the Stress Period. In months where an Enterprise has outstanding six-month discount notes that were issued during the stress test, then the Enterprise is a borrower. Otherwise, the Enterprise is an investor.</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">3. Determine the appropriate monthly discount factor for each month of the Stress Period:</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2"> a. In months where an Enterprise is an investor, the monthly discount factor is based on the yield of short-term assets:</FP>

              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">4. Compute the appropriate cumulative discount for each month of the Stress Period. The cumulative discount factor for a given month is the monthly discount factor for that month multiplied by the cumulative discount factor for the preceding month. (The cumulative discount factor for the first month of the Stress Period is the monthly discount factor for that month.) Thus, the cumulative discount factor for any month incorporates all of the previous monthly discount factors.</FP>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">5. Discount total capital for each month of the Stress Period to the start of the Stress Period for both interest rate scenarios. Divide the total capital for a given month by the cumulative discount factor for that month.</FP>

              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">7. From the Stress Test capital subtotal, subtract the capital required for off-balance sheet items not explicitly modeled in the Stress Test, as calculated in section 3.9.3.1, Off-Balance Sheet Items, of this appendix. Then subtract the resulting difference from the Enterprise's total capital at the start of the Stress Period. The resulting number is the amount of total capital that an Enterprise must hold at the start of the Stress Test in order to maintain positive total capital throughout the ten-year Stress Period.</FP>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Authority, purpose and scope of subpart A.</E> In addition to the authority set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, subpart A of this part is also issued pursuant to section 1314 of the 1992 Act (12 U.S.C. 4514), section 307(c) of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Act (12 U.S.C. 1456(c)), and section 309(k) of the Federal National Mortgage Association Charter Act (12 U.S.C. 1723a(k)), requiring each Enterprise to submit such reports to OFHEO as the Director of OFHEO determines, in his or her judgment, are necessary to carry out the purposes of the 1992 Act. Subpart A of this part is also issued in reliance on section 1317 of the 1992 Act (12 U.S.C. 4517) authorizing OFHEO to conduct examinations of the Enterprises. The purpose of subpart A of this part is to set forth a framework of early intervention supervisory measures, other than formal enforcement actions, that OFHEO may take to address emerging developments that merit supervisory review to ensure they do not pose a current or future threat to the safety and soundness of an Enterprise. OFHEO's initiation of procedures under subpart A does not necessarily indicate that any unsound condition exists. The supervisory responses enumerated in § 1777.11 do not constitute orders under the 1992 Act for purposes of sections 1371 and 1376 thereof (12 U.S.C. 4631 and 4636).</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Authority, purpose, and scope of subpart B.</E> In addition to the authority set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, subpart B of this part is also issued pursuant to subtitle B of the 1992 Act (12 U.S.C. 4611 through 4623), section 303(b)(2) of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Act (12 U.S.C. 1452(b)(2)), and section 303(c)(2) of the Federal National Mortgage Association Charter Act (12 U.S.C. 1718(c)(2)). These provisions authorize OFHEO to administer certain capital requirements for the Enterprises, to classify the capital of the Enterprises based on capital levels specified in the 1992 Act, and, in appropriate circumstances, to exercise discretion to reclassify an Enterprise into a lower <PRTPAGE P="718"/>capital category. Under these provisions, there are also automatic consequences for an Enterprise that is not classified as adequately capitalized, as well as discretionary authority for OFHEO to require an Enterprise to take remedial actions. Subpart B implements the provisions of sections 1364 through 1368, 1369(b) through (e), 1369C, and 1369D of the 1992 Act as they apply to the Enterprises (12 U.S.C. 4614 through 4618, 4619(b) through (e), 4622 and 4623). The principal purposes of subpart B are to identify the capital measures and capital levels that OFHEO uses in determining the capital classification of an Enterprise; to set out the procedures OFHEO uses in determining such capital classifications; to establish procedures for submission and review of capital restoration plans of an Enterprise that is not classified as adequately capitalized; and to establish procedures under which OFHEO issues orders pursuant to section 1366(b)(1) through (4) of the 1992 Act (12 U.S.C. 4616(b)(1) through (4)).</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Effective dates of capital classifications.</E> Section 1364 of the 1992 Act (12 U.S.C. 4614(d)) directs OFHEO to determine capital classifications for the Enterprises by reference to two capital standards, consisting of the minimum or critical capital level on the one hand, and the risk-based capital level on the other. Section 1364(d) of the 1992 Act (12 U.S.C. 4614(d)) excludes consideration of whether the Enterprises meet the risk-based capital level in determining capital classifications or reclassifications under 1364, until one year after the effective date of OFHEO's regulation implementing OFHEO's risk-based capital test (issued under section 1361(e) of the 1992 Act (12 U.S.C. 4611(e)), until such time, section 1364(d) provides that an Enterprise is to be classified as adequately capitalized so long as it meets the minimum capital level. Subpart B contains a currently effective set of capital classifications omitting consideration of the risk-based capital level, as well as another set of capital classifications which will take effect, and displace the current set of capital classifications, on September 13, 2002 that is, one year after the effective date of OFHEO's risk-based capital rule published at 66 FR 47730, September 13, 2001.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Supervisory standards.</E> Notwithstanding the existence of procedures in § 1777.10 for the Director of OFHEO to designate certain developments for supervisory response under subpart A of this part, nothing in this part in any way limits the authority of OFHEO otherwise to take such actions with respect to any issue as is deemed appropriate by the Director of OFHEO to ensure that the Enterprises maintain adequate capital, operate in a safe and sound manner, and comply with the 1992 Act and regulations, orders, and agreements thereunder.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Capital floor.</E> Classification of an Enterprise as adequately capitalized in accordance with subtitle B of the 1992 Act and subpart B of this part indicates that the Enterprise meets the capital levels under sections 1361 and 1362 of the 1992 Act (12 U.S.C. 4611 and 4612) and regulations promulgated thereunder as of the times specified in the classification determination. Nothing in subpart B of this part or subtitle B of the 1992 Act limits OFHEO's authority otherwise to address circumstances that would require additional capital through regulations, orders, notices, guidance, or other actions.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Form of supervisory action or response.</E> In addition to the supervisory responses contemplated under subpart A of this part, and the authority to classify and reclassify the Enterprises, to issue orders, and to appoint conservators under subpart B of this part, the 1992 Act grants OFHEO broad discretion to take such other supervisory actions as may be deemed by OFHEO to be appropriate, including issuing temporary and permanent cease and desist orders, imposing civil money penalties, appointing a conservator under section 1369(a)(1) through (2) of the 1992 Act (12 U.S.C. 4619(a)(1) through (2)), entering into a written agreement the violation of which is actionable through enforcement proceedings, or entering into any other formal or informal agreement with an Enterprise. Neither the 1992 Act nor <PRTPAGE P="719"/>this part in any way limit OFHEO's discretion over the selection of the type of these actions, and the selection of one type of action under this part or under these other statutory authorities, or a combination thereof, does not foreclose OFHEO from pursuing any other action.</P>

An Enterprise that receives such a notice to submit a new or amended capital restoration plan shall file in writing with OFHEO a complete plan that is responsive to the <PRTPAGE P="725"/>terms of and within the deadline specified in such notice.</P>

Such reclassification may be made without additional notice in accordance with § 1777.21(a)(1)(ii).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Order approving or disapproving plan.</E> Not later than thirty calendar days after receipt of the Enterprise's complete or amended capital restoration plan under this section (subject to extension upon written notice to the Enterprise for an additional thirty calendar days as OFHEO deems necessary), OFHEO shall issue an order to the Enterprise approving or disapproving the plan. An order disapproving a plan shall include the reasons therefore.</P>

              <P>(f) <E T="03">Amendment.</E> An Enterprise that has received an order approving its capital restoration plan may amend the capital restoration plan only after written notice to OFHEO and OFHEO's written approval of the modification. Pending OFHEO's review and approval <PRTPAGE P="726"/>of the amendment in OFHEO's discretion, the Enterprise shall continue to implement the capital restoration plan under the original approval order.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Termination</E>—(1) <E T="03">Termination under the terms of the plan.</E> An Enterprise that has received an order approving its capital restoration plan remains bound by each of its obligations under the plan until each such obligation terminates under express terms of the plan itself identifying a date, event, or condition upon which such obligation shall terminate.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Termination orders.</E> To the extent the plan does not include such express terms for any obligation thereunder, the Enterprise's obligation continues until OFHEO issues an order terminating such obligation under the plan. The Enterprise may also submit a written request to OFHEO seeking termination of such obligations. OFHEO will approve termination of such obligation to the extent that OFHEO determines, in its discretion, that the obligation's purpose under the plan has been fulfilled and that termination of the obligation is consistent with the overall safety and soundness of the Enterprise.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Implementation</E>—(1) An Enterprise that has received an order approving its capital restoration plan is required to implement the plan.</P>
              <P>(i) If OFHEO determines, in its discretion, that an Enterprise has failed to make, in good faith, reasonable efforts necessary to comply with the capital restoration plan and fulfill the schedule thereunder, OFHEO may reclassify the Enterprise:</P>
              <P>(A) As significantly undercapitalized if it is otherwise classified as undercapitalized; or</P>
              <P>(B) As critically undercapitalized if it is otherwise classified as significantly undercapitalized.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Duration of reclassification.</E> An Enterprise's failure to implement an approved capital restoration plan as described in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section shall continue to be grounds for reclassification at each subsequent capital classification of the Enterprise, and shall only cease being considered grounds for reclassification after OFHEO determines, in its discretion, that the Enterprise is making such efforts as are reasonably necessary to comply with the capital restoration plan and fulfill the schedule thereunder.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Successive reclassifications.</E> If an Enterprise has not remedied its failure to implement an approved capital restoration plan within such period as is determined by OFHEO to be appropriate, OFHEO may consider such failure to be the basis for additional reclassification under paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section into a lower capital classification.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Administrative enforcement action.</E> A capital plan that has received an approval order from OFHEO under this section shall constitute an order under the 1992 Act. An Enterprise, regardless of its capital classification, as well as its executive officers, and directors may be subject to action by OFHEO under sections 1371, 1372, and 1376 of the 1992 Act (12 U.S.C. 4631, 4632, and 4636) and 12 CFR part 1780 for failure to comply with such plan.</P>

            <P>(9) The extent of need for the CDFI Fund's assistance, as demonstrated by the extent of economic distress in the Applicant's Target Market and the extent to which the Applicant needs the CDFI Fund's assistance to carry out its Comprehensive Business Plan;</P>

            <P>(11) The CDFI Fund may consider any other factors, as it deems appropriate, in reviewing an application as set forth in an applicable Notice of Funds Availability.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Consultation with Appropriate Federal Banking Agencies.</E> The CDFI Fund will consult with, and consider the views of, the Appropriate Federal Banking Agency prior to providing assistance to:</P>

Where an existing loan is refinanced (meaning, a new loan is originated to pay off an existing loan, whether or not there is a change in the applicable loan terms), the CDFI Fund will only assess the value of any increase in the principal amount of the refinanced loan;</P>
            <P>(2) Project Investments at the original amount of the purchase of stock, limited partnership interest, other ownership interest, or grant;</P>
            <P>(3) Deposit Liabilities at the dollar amount deposited as measured by comparing the net change in the amount of applicable funds on deposit at the Applicant during the Baseline Period with the net change in the amount of applicable funds on deposit at the Applicant during the Assessment Period, as described in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section:</P>
            <P>(i) The Applicant shall calculate the net change in deposits during the Baseline Period by comparing the amount of applicable funds on deposit at the close of business the day before the beginning of the Baseline Period and at the close of business on the last day of the Baseline Period; and</P>

            <P>(4) Financial Services and Targeted Financial Services based on the predetermined amounts as set forth by the CDFI Fund in the applicable NOFA; and</P>
            <P>(5) Financial Services (other than those for which the CDFI Fund has established a predetermined value), Community Services, and CDFI Support Activities consisting of Technical Assistance based on the administrative costs of providing such services.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Closed transactions.</E> A transaction shall be considered to have been closed <PRTPAGE P="757"/>and carried out during the Baseline Period or the Assessment Period if the documentation evidencing the transaction:</P>
            <P>(1) Is executed on a date within the applicable Baseline Period or Assessment Period, respectively; and</P>
            <P>(2) Constitutes a legally binding agreement between the Applicant and a borrower or investee, which agreement specifies the final terms and conditions of the transaction, except that any contingencies included in the final agreement must be typical of such transaction and acceptable (both in the judgment of the CDFI Fund); and</P>
            <P>(3) An initial cash disbursement of loan or investment proceeds has occurred in a manner that is consistent with customary business practices and is reasonable given the nature of the transaction (as determined by the CDFI Fund), unless it is normal business practice to make no initial disbursement at closing and the Applicant demonstrates that the borrower has access to the proceeds, subject to reasonable conditions as may be determined by the CDFI Fund.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Reporting period.</E> An Applicant must only measure the amount of a Qualified Activity that it reasonably expects to disburse to an investee, borrower, or other recipient within one year of the end of the applicable Assessment Period, or such other period as may be set forth by the CDFI Fund in the applicable NOFA.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Sufficient funds available to cover estimated awards.</E> All BEA Program Awards are subject to the availability of funds. If the amount of appropriated funds available during a funding round is sufficient to cover all estimated award amounts for which Applicants <PRTPAGE P="758"/>are eligible, in the CDFI Fund's determination, and an Applicant meets all of the program requirements specified in this part, then such Applicant shall receive an actual award amount that is calculated by the CDFI Fund in the manner specified in § 1806.403.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Insufficient funds available to cover estimated awards.</E> If the amount of funds available during a funding round is insufficient to cover all estimated award amounts for which Applicants are eligible, in the CDFI Fund's determination, then the CDFI Fund will select Recipients and determine actual award amounts based on the process described in paragraph (c) of this section and any established maximum dollar amount of awards that may be awarded for the Distressed Community Financing Activities subcategories, as described in the applicable NOFA.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Priority of awards.</E> In circumstances where there are insufficient funds to cover estimated awards, the CDFI Fund will rank Applicants based on whether the Applicant is a CDFI or a non-CDFI, and in each category of Qualified Activity (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> Service Activities) according to the priorities described in this paragraph (c). Selections within each priority category will be based on the Applicants' relative rankings within each category, and based on whether the Applicant is a CDFI or a non-CDFI, subject to the availability of funds.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">First priority.</E> If the amount of funds available during a funding round is insufficient for all estimated award amounts, first priority will be given to CDFI Applicants that engaged in CDFI Related Activities, followed by non-CDFI Applicants that engaged in CDFI Related Activities ranked in the ratio as set forth in the applicable NOFA.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Second priority.</E> If the amount of funds available during a funding round is sufficient for all first priority Applicants but insufficient for all remaining estimated award amounts, second priority will be given to CDFI Applicants that engaged in Distressed Community Financing Activities, followed by non-CDFI Applicants that engaged in Distressed Community Financing Activities, ranked in the ratio as set forth in the applicable NOFA.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Third priority.</E> If the amount of funds available during a funding round is sufficient for all first and second priority Applicants, but insufficient for all remaining estimated award amounts, third priority will be given to CDFI Applicants that engaged in Service Activities, followed by non-CDFI Applicants that engaged in Service Activities, ranked in the ratio as set forth in the applicable NOFA.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Calculating actual award amounts.</E> The CDFI Fund will determine actual award amounts based upon the availability of funds, increases in Qualified Activities from the Baseline to the Assessment Period, and an Applicant's priority ranking. If an Applicant receives an award for more than one priority category described in this section, the CDFI Fund will combine the award amounts into a single BEA Program Award.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Unobligated or deobligated funds.</E> The CDFI Fund, in its sole discretion, may use any deobligated funds or funds not obligated during a funding round:</P>
            <P>(1) To select Applicants not previously selected, using the calculation and selection process contained in this part;</P>
            <P>(2) To make additional monies available for a subsequent funding round; or</P>
            <P>(3) As otherwise authorized by the Act.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Limitation.</E> The CDFI Fund, in its sole discretion, may deny or limit the amount of a BEA Program Award for any reason.</P>

            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Financial statement.</E> A Recipient is not required to submit its financial statement to the CDFI Fund. The CDFI Fund may obtain the necessary information from publicly available sources.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Affordable Housing—Rental Housing.</SUBJECT>
            <P>To qualify as Affordable Housing, each rental Multi-family housing Project financed with CMF Award must have at least 20 percent of the units occupied by any combination of Low-Income, Very Low-Income, or Extremely Low-Income Families and must comply with the rent limits set forth herein. However, the CDFI Fund may require a greater percentage of the units per Project to be income-targeted and/or require a specific targeted income commitment in any given application round, as set forth in the NOFA and Assistance Agreement for that application round.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Rent limitation.</E> The gross rent limits for Affordable Housing are determined under the provisions in IRC section 42(g)(2). In this determination, if this part imposes an income restriction on a unit that is greater than 60 percent of area median income, adjusted for Family size, then the provisions of IRC section 42(g)(2) are applied as if that income restriction on the unit satisfied IRC section 42(g)(1). The maximum rent is a rent that does not exceed:</P>
            <P>(1) For an Eligible-Income Family, 30 percent of the annual income of a Family whose annual income equals 120 percent of the area median income, with adjustments for number of bedrooms in the unit, as set forth in IRC section 42(g)(2).</P>

            <P>(2) For a Low-Income Family, 30 percent of the annual income of a Family whose annual income equals 80 percent of the area median income, with adjustments for number of bedrooms in the unit, as set forth in IRC section 42(g)(2). If the unit or tenant receives Federal or State rental subsidy, and the Family pays as a contribution towards rent not more than 30 percent of the Family's income, the maximum rent (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> tenant contribution plus rental subsidy) is the rent allowable under the Federal or State rental subsidy program;</P>

            <P>(3) For a Very Low-Income Family, 30 percent of the annual income of a Family whose annual income equals 50 percent of the area median income, with adjustments for number of bedrooms in the unit as described in paragraph (a) of this section. If the unit or tenant receives Federal or State rental subsidy, and the Family pays as a contribution towards rent not more than 30 percent of the Family's income, the maximum rent (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> tenant contribution plus rental subsidy) is the rent allowable under the Federal or State rental subsidy program; or</P>

            <P>(4) For an Extremely Low-Income Family, 30 percent of the annual income of a Family whose annual income equals 30 percent of the area median income, with adjustments for number of bedrooms in the unit as described in paragraph (a) of this section. If the unit or tenant receives Federal or State rental subsidy, and the Family pays as a contribution toward rent not more than 30 percent of the Family's income, the maximum rent (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> tenant contribution plus rental subsidy) is the rent allowable under the Federal or State rental subsidy program.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Nondiscrimination against rental assistance subsidy holders.</E> The Recipient shall require that the owner of a rental unit cannot refuse to lease the unit to a Section 8 Program certificate or voucher holder (24 CFR part 982, Section 8 Tenant-Based Assistance: Unified Rule for Tenant-Based Assistance under the Section 8 Rental Certificate Program and the Section 8 Rental Voucher Program) or to the holder of a comparable document evidencing participation in a HOME tenant-based rental assistance program because of the status of the prospective tenant as a holder of such certificate, voucher, or comparable HOME tenant-based assistance document.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Initial rent schedule and utility allowances.</E> The Recipient shall ensure that utility allowances and submetering rules are consistent with regulations concerning utility allowances and submetering in buildings that are subject to gross rent restrictions under IRC section 42(g)(2).</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Periods of affordability.</E> Housing under this section must meet the affordability requirements for not less than 10 years, beginning after Project Completion and at initial occupancy. The affordability requirements apply without regard to the term of any loan <PRTPAGE P="771"/>or mortgage or the transfer of ownership and must be imposed by deed restrictions, covenants running with the land, or other recordable mechanisms. Other recordable mechanisms must be approved in writing and in advance by the CDFI Fund. The affordability restrictions may terminate upon foreclosure or transfer in lieu of foreclosure. However, the affordability restrictions shall be revived according to the original terms if, during the original affordability period, the owner of record before the foreclosure, or deed in lieu of foreclosure, or any entity that includes the former owner or those with whom the former owner has or had family or business ties, obtains an ownership interest in the Project.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Subsequent rents during the affordability period.</E> Any increase in rent for a CMF-financed unit requires that tenants of those units be given at least 30 days prior written notice before the implementation of the rent increase. Regardless of changes in annual rents and in median income over time, the CMF rents for a Project are not required to be lower than the CMF rent limits for the Project in effect at the time when the Project is Committed for use.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Tenant income determination.</E> (1) Each year during the period of affordability, the tenant's income shall be re-examined; tenant income examination and verification is ultimately the responsibility of the Recipient. Annual income shall include income from all household members. The Recipient must require the Project owner to obtain information on rents and occupancy of Affordable Housing financed or assisted with a CMF Award in order to demonstrate compliance with this section.</P>
            <P>(2) One of the following two definitions of “annual income” must be used to determine whether a Family is income-eligible:</P>
            <P>(i) Adjusted gross income as defined for purposes of reporting under Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 1040 series for individual Federal annual income tax purposes; or</P>
            <P>(ii) “Annual Income” as defined at 24 CFR 5.609 (except that when determining the income of a homeowner for an owner-occupied Rehabilitation Project, the value of the homeowner's principal residence may be excluded from the calculation of Net Family Assets, as defined in 24 CFR 5.603).</P>
            <P>(3) Although either of the above two definitions of “annual income” is permitted, in order to calculate adjusted income, exclusions from income set forth at 24 CFR 5.611 shall be applied.</P>
            <P>(4) The CDFI Fund reserves the right to deem certain government programs, under which a Low-Income Family is a recipient, as income eligible for purposes of meeting the tenant income requirements under this section.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Over-income tenants.</E> (1) CMF-financed or assisted units continue to qualify as Affordable Housing despite a temporary noncompliance caused by increases in the incomes of existing tenants if actions satisfactory to the CDFI Fund are being taken to ensure that all vacancies are filled in accordance with this section until the noncompliance is corrected.</P>
            <P>(2) Tenants whose incomes no longer qualify must pay rent no greater than the lesser of the amount payable by the tenant under State or local law or 30 percent of the Family's annual income, except if the gross rent of a unit is subject to the restrictions in IRC section 42(g)(2) or the restrictions in an extended low-income housing commitment under IRC section 42(h)(6), then the tenants of that unit must pay rent governed by those restrictions. Tenants who no longer qualify as Eligible-Income are not required to pay rent in excess of the market rent for comparable, unassisted units in the neighborhood.</P>

            <P>(3) If the income of a tenant of a CMF-financed or assisted unit no longer qualifies, the Recipient may designate another unit, within the CMF-financed or assisted Project, as a replacement unit that meets the affordability qualifications for the same income category as the original unit, as further set forth in the Recipient's Assistance Agreement. If there is not an available replacement unit, the Recipient must fill the first available vacancy with a tenant that meets the affordability qualifications for the same income category of the original unit as necessary to maintain compliance with <PRTPAGE P="772"/>the CMF requirements and the Assistance Agreement.</P>

            <P>(1) The Housing must be Single-family housing.</P>
            <P>(2) The Single-family housing price does not exceed 95 percent of the median purchase price for the area as used in the HOME Program and as determined by HUD and the applicable Participating Jurisdiction.</P>
            <P>(3) The Single-family housing must be purchased by a qualifying Family as set forth in § 1807.400. The Single-family housing must be the principal residence of the Family throughout the period described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Periods of affordability.</E> Single-family housing under this section must meet the affordability requirements for at least 10 years at the time of purchase by the Family.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Resale.</E> To ensure that CMF Awards are being used for qualifying Families for the entire 10-year affordability period, recoupment and redeployment or resale strategies must be imposed by the Recipient. A recoupment strategy must ensure that, in the event the qualifying homeowner sells the Housing before the end of the 10-year affordability period and the new homeowner does not meet the affordability qualifications set forth in § 1807.400, an amount equal to the amount of the CMF Award investment in the Housing, whether recouped or not, is used to finance additional Affordable Housing Activities for a qualifying Family in the same income category for Affordable Housing Homeownership in the manner set forth in this section, except that the Housing must meet the affordability requirements only for the remaining duration of the affordability period. The Recipient may design and implement its own recoupment strategy. Deed restrictions, covenants running with the land, or other similar mechanisms may be used as the mechanism to impose a resale strategy. The Recipient shall report to the CDFI Fund the event of resale and/or recoupment and redeployment of the CMF Award, or an equivalent amount, in the manner described in the Assistance Agreement. The affordability restrictions may terminate upon occurrence of any of the following termination events: Foreclosure, transfer in lieu of foreclosure, or assignment of an FHA-insured mortgage to HUD. The Recipient may use purchase options, rights of first refusal or other preemptive rights to purchase the Housing before foreclosure to preserve affordability. The affordability restrictions shall be revived according to the original terms if, during the original affordability period, the owner of record before the termination event, obtains an ownership interest in the Housing. If there is a sale of Single-family housing funded by a CMF Award prior to the completion of the 10-year affordability period, the Recipient must demonstrate that it placed into service Single-family housing targeting the same income population (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> Extremely Low-Income, Very Low-Income, Low-Income) as the original Single-family housing, as set forth in the Assistance Agreement, financed with an equivalent amount to the recouped portion of the CMF Award, that will be tracked for the duration of the affordability period of the original Single-family housing.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Rehabilitation not involving Purchase.</E> Single-family housing that is currently owned by a qualifying Family, as set forth in § 1807.400, qualifies as Affordable Housing if it meets the requirements of this paragraph (b).</P>
            <P>(1) The estimated value of the Single-family housing, after Rehabilitation, does not exceed 95 percent of the median purchase price for the area, as used in the HOME Program and as determined by the applicable Participating Jurisdiction; or</P>

            <P>(2) The Single-family housing is the principal residence of a qualifying Family as set forth in § 1807.400, at the time that the CMF Award is Committed to the Single-family housing.<PRTPAGE P="773"/>
            </P>
            <P>(3) Single-family housing under this paragraph (b) must meet the affordability requirements for at least 10 years after Rehabilitation is completed or meet the resale provisions of paragraph (a)(5) of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Ownership interest.</E> The ownership in the Single-family housing assisted under this section must meet the definition of Homeownership as defined in § 1807.104.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">New construction without Purchase.</E> Newly constructed Single-family housing that is built on property currently owned by a Family that will occupy the Single-family housing upon completion, qualifies as Affordable Housing if it meets the requirements under paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Converting rental units to Homeownership units for existing tenants.</E> CMF-financed rental units may be converted to Homeownership units by selling, donating, or otherwise conveying the units to the existing tenants to enable the tenants to become homeowners in accordance with the requirements of this section. The Homeownership units are subject to a minimum period of affordability equal to the remaining affordability period.</P>

            <P>The purpose of the Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Bond Guarantee Program is to support CDFI lending by providing Guarantees for Bonds issued as part of a Bond Issue for Eligible Community or Economic Development Purposes, as authorized by sections 1134 and 1703 of the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 (Pub. L. 111-240; 12 U.S.C. 4713a).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Summary.</SUBJECT>
            <P>This section provides a summary overview of certain key provisions of the interim rule, the detailed requirements of which are set forth in subsequent subparts.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Guarantee.</E> Through the CDFI Bond Guarantee Program, the Guarantor will provide a Guarantee for Bonds issued by Qualified Issuers as part of a Bond Issue.<PRTPAGE P="780"/>
            </P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Bonds.</E> Pursuant to the Act at 12 U.S.C. 4713a(e), a Bond Issue shall comprise Bonds having a minimum aggregate principal amount of $100,000,000 and a maximum aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000,000. The principal amount of each Bond (or series of Bonds) shall not be less than $10,000,000. A Bond Rate for each advance of funds under a Bond will be established by the Bond Purchaser as of the date of the respective advance, as provided in the Bond.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Bond Loans to Eligible CDFIs.</E> The Qualified Issuer will use Bond Proceeds to make Bond Loans to Eligible CDFIs for Eligible Purposes, as those terms are defined in section 1808.102. The CDFI Fund will evaluate each Eligible CDFI using standard Bond Loan Requirements to assess their creditworthiness and capacity to receive a Bond Loan. Each Eligible CDFI may borrow a Bond Loan in an amount that is at least $10,000,000. The Bond Loan Rate shall be the same as the Bond Rate on the particular advance of funds under the Bond that funds the Bond Loan. The aggregate of the principal amounts of the Bond Loans must not exceed the maximum principal amount of the corresponding Bond Issue. The Qualified Issuer must execute Bond Loan documents for 100 percent of the principal amount of each Bond on the Bond Issue Date. Bond Loan proceeds may not be drawn down from the Qualified Issuer until the Eligible CDFI has an immediate use for the Bond Loan proceeds. Five percent, or such other amount that is determined by the CDFI Fund in its sole discretion, of Bond Loan proceeds may be used by an Eligible CDFI to capitalize Loan Loss Reserves.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Secondary Loans to Secondary Borrowers.</E> If the Eligible CDFI uses Bond Loan proceeds to make Secondary Loans, the Eligible CDFI must execute Secondary Loan documents (in the form of promissory notes) with Secondary Borrowers as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) Not later than 12 months after the Bond Issue Date, Secondary Loan documents representing at least 50 percent of such Eligible CDFI's Bond Loan proceeds allocated for Secondary Loans; and</P>
            <P>(2) Not later than 24 months after the Bond Issue Date, Secondary Loan documents representing 100 percent of such Eligible CDFI's Bond Loan proceeds allocated for Secondary Loans (excluding any amounts used for payment of Bond Issuance Fees pursuant to section 1808.304(b)).</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Terms and conditions.</E> Bonds, Bond Loans and Secondary Loans shall have terms and conditions as set forth in Subpart F of this interim rule including at a minimum, that:</P>
            <P>(1) Each Bond shall be a nonrecourse obligation of the Qualified Issuer, payable solely from amounts available pursuant to the Bond Documents. Each promissory note evidencing a Bond Loan shall be a general recourse obligation of the Eligible CDFI and secured by a first lien on collateral. Each Secondary Loan shall be secured by a first lien on collateral and payable solely from amounts available pursuant to the Secondary Loan documents;</P>
            <P>(2) The maturity date of a Bond shall not be later than 30 years after the Bond Issue Date. The maturity date of Bond Loans and Secondary Loans may be earlier than, but may not be later than, the maturity date of the corresponding Bond;</P>
            <P>(3) The Bonds shall be purchased by the Bond Purchaser on terms and conditions that are satisfactory to the Bond Purchaser, the Guarantor, and the CDFI Fund (under specific requirements set forth in § 1808.302 and the Bond Documents); and</P>
            <P>(4) The Guarantor shall guarantee payments on Bonds issued as part of a Bond Issue in such forms and on such terms and conditions and subject to such covenants, representations, warranties and requirements (including requirements for audits) as set forth in this interim rule in Subpart F. These requirements may be expanded upon through the program's Notice of Guarantee Availability, the Bond Documents, and the Bond Loan documents. The Qualified Issuer shall enter into the applicable Bond Documents to evidence its acceptance of the terms and conditions of the Guarantee.</P>

            <P>(b) Any interest on a Bond Loan in excess of the Bond Loan Rate derived by the Qualified Issuer during any period during which the Bond Loan Payment Default Rate applies shall also be deposited in the Risk-Share Pool Fund.</P>
            <P>(c) The Risk-Share Pool Fund shall be applied by the Master Servicer/Trustee to payments of debt service on the Bond Issue in the event that the Eligible CDFI defaults in the corresponding payment of debt service on the Bond Loan.

Monies on deposit in the Risk-Share Pool Fund shall be applied to such payments and shall be depleted in full prior to any draw on the Guarantee.</P>
            <P>(d) Eligible CDFIs (excluding the Eligible CDFI in default and responsible for a draw) shall not be required to replenish the Risk-Share Pool Fund in the event of a draw.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Major decision points.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The possible environmental effects of an Application, including any Comprehensive Business Plan, must be considered along with technical, economic, and other factors throughout the decisionmaking process. For most Fund actions there are two distinct stages in the decisionmaking process:</P>
          <P>(1) Preliminary approval stage, at which point applications are selected for funding; and</P>
          <P>(2) Final approval and funding stage.</P>
          <P>(b) Environmental review shall be integrated into the decisionmaking process of the Fund as follows:</P>
          <P>(1) During the preliminary approval stage, the designated Fund official shall determine whether the Application proposes actions which are categorically excluded, or normally require an environmental assessment or an EIS;</P>
          <P>(2) If the designated Fund official determines that the Application proposes actions which normally require an environmental assessment or an EIS, the applicant shall be informed that the final approval and funding, in addition to any other conditions, is contingent upon:</P>
          <P>(i) The applicant supplying to the Fund all information necessary for the Fund to perform or have performed any environmental review required by this part;</P>
          <P>(ii) The applicant not using any Fund financial assistance to perform any of such proposed actions in the Application that affect the physical environment until Fund approval is received; and</P>
          <P>(iii) The outcome of the environmental review required by this part;</P>
          <P>(3) The Fund will perform or have performed the environmental reviews required by this part;</P>
          <P>(4) A preliminary approval of an Application may be withdrawn or further conditions may be imposed based upon the outcome of an environmental review required by this part; and</P>
          <P>(5) If the designated Fund official determines that the Application proposes actions that require an environmental assessment or an EIS, the environmental assessment and/or EIS must be completed and circulated prior to the use of Federal funds for any activity that triggers the need for an environmental assessment and/or EIS.</P>

          <P>(a) The designated Fund official shall determine whether the proposed actions in the Application are sufficiently definite to perform a meaningful environmental review during the preliminary approval stage.</P>
          <P>(b) If the designated Fund official determines that the Application is sufficiently definite to perform a meaningful environmental review during the preliminary approval stage, no conditions for supplemental environmental review shall be imposed.</P>
          <P>(c) If the designated Fund official determines that the Application, or any part of the Application, is not sufficiently definite to complete a meaningful environmental review during the preliminary approval stage, the Fund shall require a supplemental environmental review prior to the taking of any action directly using Fund financial assistance that is not categorically excluded from environmental review or for which an environmental assessment or EIS has not been approved by the Fund. The applicant shall notify the designated Fund official when proposing any action requiring a supplemental environmental review and shall supply to the Fund all information necessary for the Fund to perform the supplemental environmental review. The Fund shall perform or have performed such a supplemental environmental review. The applicant shall not use any Fund financial assistance to perform any of the proposed actions requiring a supplemental environmental review that affect the physical environment until Fund approval for such action is received.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Determination of review requirement.</SUBJECT>
          <P>In deciding whether to prepare an EIS, the designated Fund official shall determine whether the proposal is one that normally:</P>
          <P>(a) Requires an EIS;</P>
          <P>(b) Requires an environmental assessment, but not necessarily an EIS; or</P>
          <P>(c) Does not require either an EIS or an environmental assessment (categorical exclusion).</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 1815.108</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Actions that normally require an EIS.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) If necessary, the Fund shall perform or have performed an environmental assessment to determine if an Application, or any portion of an Application, requires an EIS. However, it may be readily apparent that a proposed action in an Application will have a significant impact on the environment; in such cases, an environmental assessment is not required and the Fund shall immediately begin to prepare, or have prepared, an EIS.</P>
          <P>(b) An EIS normally is required where an Application proposes to directly use financial assistance from the Fund for any Project that would:</P>
          <P>(1) Remove, demolish, convert, or substantially rehabilitate 2,500 or more existing housing units, or would result in the construction or installation of 2,500 or more new housing units, or which would provide sites for 2,500 or more new housing units; or</P>
          <P>(2) Remove, demolish, convert, or substantially rehabilitate 1,500,000 square feet or more of commercial space, or would result in the construction or installation of 1,500,000 square feet or more of new commercial space, or which would provide sites for 1,500,000 square feet or more of new commercial space.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Preparation of an EIS.</SUBJECT>

          <P>(a) If the Fund determines that an EIS should be prepared, it shall publish a notice of intent in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> in accordance with 40 CFR 1501.7 and 1508.22 of the CEQ regulations. After publishing the notice of intent, the Fund shall begin to prepare or have prepared the EIS. Procedures for preparing the EIS are set forth in 40 CFR part 1502 of the CEQ regulations.</P>
          <P>(b) The Fund may supplement a draft or final EIS at any time. The Fund shall prepare or have prepared a supplement to either the draft or final EIS when:</P>

          <P>(1) Substantial changes are proposed to an action contained in the draft or final EIS that are relevant to environmental concerns or there are significant new circumstances or information relevant to environmental concerns and bearing on the proposed action or its impacts; or<PRTPAGE P="813"/>
          </P>
          <P>(2) Actions are proposed which relate or are similar to other action(s) taken or proposed and that together have a cumulatively significant impact on the environment.</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 1815.110</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Categorical exclusion.</SUBJECT>
          <P>The CEQ regulations provide for the categorical exclusion of actions that do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment (40 CFR 1508.4). Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an EIS is required for such actions. An action which falls into one of the categories below may still require the preparation of an EIS or environmental assessment if the designated Fund official determines it meets the criteria stated in § 1815.109 or involves extraordinary circumstances that may have a significant environmental effect. The Fund has determined the following categorical exclusions:</P>
          <P>(a) Actions directly related to the administration or operation of the Fund (e.g. personnel actions, including, but not limited to, staff recruitment and training; purchase of goods and services for the Fund, including, but not limited to, furnishings, equipment, supplies and services; space acquisition; property management; and security);</P>
          <P>(b) Actions directly related to and implementing proposals for which an environmental assessment or an environmental assessment and EIS have been prepared;</P>
          <P>(c) Actions directly related to the granting or receipt of Bank Enterprise Act awards pursuant to part 1806 of this chapter;</P>
          <P>(d) Actions directly related to training and/or technical assistance;</P>
          <P>(e) Projects for the acquisition, disposition, rehabilitation and/or modernization of 500 existing housing units or less when all the following conditions are met:</P>
          <P>(1) Unit density is not increased more than 20 percent;</P>
          <P>(2) The Project does not involve changes in land use from nonresidential to residential;</P>
          <P>(3) The estimated cost of rehabilitation is less than 75 percent of the total estimated cost of replacement after rehabilitation; and</P>
          <P>(4) The Project does not involve the demolition of one or more buildings containing the primary use served by the project that, together, have more than 20 percent of the square footage of the Project;</P>
          <P>(f) Projects for the construction of 200 housing units or less when all the following conditions are met:</P>
          <P>(1) The Project does not involve changes in existing land use from nonresidential to residential; and</P>

          <SUBJECT>Preparation of an environmental assessment.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The Fund shall begin the preparation of an environmental assessment as early as possible after the designated Fund official has determined that it is required. The Fund may prepare an environmental assessment at any time to assist planning and decisionmaking.</P>
          <P>(b) An environmental assessment is a concise public document used to determine whether to prepare an EIS. An environmental assessment aids in complying with the NEPA when no EIS is necessary, and it facilitates the preparation of an EIS, if one is necessary. The environmental assessment shall contain brief discussions of the following topics:</P>
          <P>(1) Purpose and need for the proposed action;</P>
          <P>(2) Description of the proposed action;</P>
          <P>(3) Alternatives considered, including the no action alternative;</P>
          <P>(4) Environmental effects of the proposed action and alternative actions; and</P>
          <P>(5) Listing of agencies, organizations or persons consulted.</P>
          <P>(c) The most important or significant environmental consequences and effects on the areas listed below should be addressed in the environmental assessment. Only those areas which are specifically relevant to the particular proposal should be addressed. Those areas should be addressed in as much detail as is necessary to allow an analysis of the alternatives and the proposal. The areas to be considered are the following:</P>
          <P>(1) Natural/ecological features (such as floodplain, wetlands, coastal zones, wildlife refuges, and endangered species);</P>
          <P>(2) Air quality;</P>
          <P>(3) Sound levels;</P>
          <P>(4) Water supply, wastewater treatment and water runoff;</P>
          <P>(5) Energy requirements and conservation;</P>
          <P>(6) Solid waste;</P>
          <P>(7) Transportation;</P>
          <P>(8) Community facilities and services;</P>
          <P>(9) Social and economic;</P>
          <P>(10) Historic and aesthetic; and</P>
          <P>(11) Other relevant factors.</P>
          <P>(d) If the Fund completes an environmental assessment and determines that an EIS is not required, then the Fund shall prepare a finding of no significant impact. The finding of no significant impact shall be made available to the public by the Fund as specified in 40 CFR 1506.6 of the CEQ regulations.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Public involvement.</SUBJECT>

Interested persons may obtain information concerning any pending EIS or any other element of the environmental review process of the Fund by contacting the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, Department of the Treasury, 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue NW., room 5116, Washington, DC 20220, or such other contact entity designated by the Fund.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Fund decisionmaking procedures.</SUBJECT>
          <P>To ensure that at major decisionmaking points all relevant environmental concerns are considered by the Decisionmaker, the following procedures are established:</P>

          <P>(a) An environmental document, i.e., the EIS, environmental assessment, finding of no significant impact, or notice of intent, in addition to being prepared at the earliest point in the decisionmaking process, shall accompany the relevant proposal or action through the Fund's decisionmaking process to <PRTPAGE P="815"/>ensure adequate consideration of environmental factors;</P>
          <P>(b) The Decisionmaker shall consider in its decisionmaking process only those alternatives discussed in the relevant environmental documents. Also, where an EIS has been prepared, the decisionmaker shall consider all comments received during any comment process and all alternatives described in the EIS. A written record of the consideration of alternatives during the decisionmaking process shall be maintained; and</P>
          <P>(c) Any environmental document prepared for a proposal or action shall be made part of the record of any formal rulemaking by the Fund.</P>
