      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, January 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

            <P>(ii) When determining the applicable credit risk percentage requirement from Tables 1.2 or 1.3 of this part, each Bank shall apply the following criteria:</P>
            <P>(A) For assets or items that are rated directly by an NRSRO, the credit rating shall be the NRSRO's credit rating for the asset or item as determined in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section.</P>
            <P>(B) When using Table 1.3 of this part, for an asset, off-balance sheet item, or derivative contract that is not rated directly by an NRSRO, but for which an NRSRO rating has been assigned to any corresponding obligor counterparty, third party guarantor, or collateral backing the asset, item, or derivative, the credit rating that shall apply to the asset, item, or derivative, or portion of the asset, item, or derivative so guaranteed or collateralized, shall be the credit rating corresponding to such obligor counterparty, third party guarantor, or underlying collateral, as determined in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section. If there are multiple obligor counterparties, third party guarantors, or collateral instruments backing an asset, item, or derivative not rated directly by an NRSRO, or any specific portion thereof, then the credit rating that shall apply to that asset, item, or derivative or specific portion thereof, shall be the highest credit rating among such obligor counterparties, third party guarantors, or collateral instruments, as determined in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section. Assets, items or derivatives shall be deemed to be backed by collateral for purposes of this paragraph if the collateral is:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Actually held by the Bank or an independent, third-party custodian, or, if permitted under the Bank's collateral agreement with such party, by the Bank's member or an affiliate of that member where the term “affiliate” has the same meaning as in § 950.1 of this chapter;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Legally available to absorb losses;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Of a readily determinable value at which it can be liquidated by the Bank;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) Held in accordance with the provisions of the Bank's member products policy established pursuant to § 917.4 of this chapter; and</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) Subject to an appropriate discount to protect against price decline during the holding period, as well as the costs likely to be incurred in the liquidation of the collateral.</P>
            <P>(C) When using Table 1.3 of this part, for an asset with a short-term credit rating from a given NRSRO, the credit risk percentage requirement shall be based on the remaining maturity of the asset and the long-term credit rating provided for the issuer of the asset by the same NRSRO. Should the issuer of the short-term asset not have a long-term credit rating, the long-term equivalent rating shall be determined as follows:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The highest short-term credit rating shall be equivalent to the third highest long-term rating;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The second highest short-term rating shall be equivalent to the fourth highest long-term rating;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) The third highest short-term rating shall be equivalent to the fourth highest long-term rating; and</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) If the short-term rating is downgraded to below investment grade after acquisition by the Bank, the short-term rating shall be equivalent to the second highest below investment grade long-term rating.<PRTPAGE P="9"/>
            </P>
            <P>(D) For residential mortgage assets and other assets or items, or relevant portion of an asset or item, that do not meet the requirements of paragraphs (e)(2)(ii)(A), (e)(2)(ii)(B) or (e)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, and are not identified in Tables 1.1 or Table 1.4 of this part, each Bank shall determine its own credit rating for such assets or items, or relevant portion thereof, using credit rating standards available from an NRSRO or other similar standards. This credit rating, as determined by the Bank, shall be used to identify the applicable credit risk percentage requirement under Table 1.2 of this part for residential mortgage assets, or under Table 1.3 of this part for all other assets or items.</P>
            <P>(E) The credit risk percentage requirement for mortgage assets that are acquired member assets described in § 955.2 of this chapter shall be assigned from Table 1.2 of this part based on the rating of those assets after taking into account any credit enhancement required by § 955.3 of this chapter. Should a Bank further enhance a pool of loans through the purchase of insurance or by some other means, the credit risk percentage requirement shall be based on the rating of such pool after the supplemental credit enhancement, except that the Finance Board retains the right to adjust the credit capital charge to account for any deficiencies with the supplemental enhancement on a case-by-case basis.</P>
            <P>(iii) In determining the credit ratings under paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(A), (e)(2)(ii)(B) and (e)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, each Bank shall apply the following criteria:</P>
            <P>(A) The most recent credit rating from a given NRSRO shall be considered. If only one NRSRO has rated an asset or item, that NRSRO's rating shall be used. If an asset or item has received credit ratings from more than one NRSRO, the lowest credit rating from among those NRSROs shall be used.</P>
            <P>(B) Where a credit rating has a modifier (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> A-1 + for short-term ratings and A + or A− for long-term ratings) the credit rating is deemed to be the credit rating without the modifier (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> A-1 + = A-1 and A + or A-= A);</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Calculation of credit equivalent amount for off-balance sheet items</E>—(1) <E T="03">General requirement.</E> The credit equivalent amount for an off-balance sheet item shall be determined by a Finance Board approved model or shall be equal to the face amount of the instrument multiplied by the credit conversion factor assigned to such risk category of instruments, subject to the exceptions in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, provided in the following Table 2 of this part:</P>

            <P>(i) The market value of the Bank's portfolio at risk from movements in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, and equity prices that could occur during periods of market stress, where the market value of the Bank's portfolio at risk is determined using an internal market risk model that fulfills the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section and that has been approved by the Finance Board; and<PRTPAGE P="13"/>
            </P>
            <P>(ii) The amount, if any, by which the Bank's current market value of total capital is less than 85 percent of the Bank's book value of total capital, where:</P>
            <P>(A) The current market value of the total capital is calculated by the Bank using the internal market risk model approved by the Finance Board under paragraph (d) of this section; and</P>
            <P>(B) The book value of total capital is the same as the amount of total capital reported by the Bank to the Finance Board under § 932.7 of this part.</P>
            <P>(2) A Bank may substitute an internal cash flow model to derive a market risk capital requirement in place of that calculated using an internal market risk model under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, provided that:</P>
            <P>(i) The Bank obtains Finance Board approval of the internal cash flow model and of the assumptions to be applied to the model; and</P>
            <P>(ii) The Bank demonstrates to the Finance Board that the internal cash flow model subjects the Bank's assets and liabilities, off-balance sheet items and derivative contracts, including related options, to a comparable degree of stress for such factors as will be required for an internal market risk model.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Measurement of market value at risk under a Bank's internal market risk model.</E> (1) Except as provided under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, each Bank shall use an internal market risk model that estimates the market value of the Bank's assets and liabilities, off-balance sheet items, and derivative contracts, including any related options, and measures the market value of the Bank's portfolio at risk of its assets and liabilities, off-balance sheet items, and derivative contracts, including related options, from all sources of the Bank's market risks, except that the Bank's model need only incorporate those risks that are material.</P>
            <P>(2) The Bank's internal market risk model may use any generally accepted measurement technique, such as variance-covariance models, historical simulations, or Monte Carlo simulations, for estimating the market value of the Bank's portfolio at risk, provided that any measurement technique used must cover the Bank's material risks.</P>
            <P>(3) The measures of the market value of the Bank's portfolio at risk shall include the risks arising from the non-linear price characteristics of options and the sensitivity of the market value of options to changes in the volatility of the options' underlying rates or prices.</P>
            <P>(4) The Bank's internal market risk model shall use interest rate and market price scenarios for estimating the market value of the Bank's portfolio at risk, but at a minimum:</P>
            <P>(i) The Bank's internal market risk model shall provide an estimate of the market value of the Bank's portfolio at risk such that the probability of a loss greater than that estimated shall be no more than one percent;</P>
            <P>(ii) The Bank's internal market risk model shall incorporate scenarios that reflect changes in interest rates, interest rate volatility, and shape of the yield curve, and changes in market prices, equivalent to those that have been observed over 120-business day periods of market stress. For interest rates, the relevant historical observations should be drawn from the period that starts at the end of the previous month and goes back to the beginning of 1978;</P>
            <P>(iii) The total number of, and specific historical observations identified by the Bank as, stress scenarios shall be:</P>
            <P>(A) Satisfactory to the Finance Board;</P>
            <P>(B) Representative of the periods of the greatest potential market stress given the Bank's portfolio, and</P>
            <P>(C) Comprehensive given the modeling capabilities available to the Bank; and</P>
            <P>(iv) The measure of the market value of the Bank's portfolio at risk may incorporate empirical correlations among interest rates.</P>

            <P>(5) For any consolidated obligations denominated in a currency other than U.S. Dollars or linked to equity or commodity prices, each Bank shall, in addition to fulfilling the criteria of paragraph (b)(4) of this section, calculate an estimate of the market value of its portfolio at risk due to the material foreign exchange, equity price or commodity price risk, such that, at a minimum:<PRTPAGE P="14"/>
            </P>
            <P>(i) The probability of a loss greater than that estimated shall not exceed one percent;</P>
            <P>(ii) The scenarios reflect changes in foreign exchange, equity, or commodity market prices that have been observed over 120-business day periods of market stress, as determined using historical data that is from an appropriate period; and</P>
            <P>(iii) The total number of, and specific historical observations identified by the Bank as, stress scenarios shall be:</P>
            <P>(A) Satisfactory to the Finance Board;</P>
            <P>(B) Representative of the periods of greatest potential stress given the Bank's portfolio; and</P>
            <P>(C) Comprehensive given the modeling capabilities available to the Bank; and</P>
            <P>(iv) The measure of the market value of the Bank's portfolio at risk may incorporate empirical correlations within or among foreign exchange rates, equity prices, or commodity prices.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Independent validation of Bank internal market risk model or internal cash flow model.</E> (1) Each Bank shall conduct an independent validation of its internal market risk model or internal cash flow model within the Bank that is carried out by personnel not reporting to the business line responsible for conducting business transactions for the Bank. Alternatively, the Bank may obtain independent validation by an outside party qualified to make such determinations. Validations shall be done on an annual basis, or more frequently as required by the Finance Board.</P>
            <P>(2) The results of such independent validations shall be reviewed by the Bank's board of directors and provided promptly to the Finance Board.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Finance Board approval of Bank internal market risk model or internal cash flow model.</E> Each Bank shall obtain Finance Board approval of an internal market risk model or an internal cash flow model, including subsequent material adjustments to the model made by the Bank, prior to the use of any model. Each Bank shall make such adjustments to its model as may be directed by the Finance Board.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Date of calculations.</E> Unless otherwise directed by the Finance Board, each Bank shall perform any calculations or estimates required under this section using the assets and liabilities, off-balance sheet items, and derivative contracts held by the Bank, and if applicable, the values of any such holdings, as of the close of business of the last business day of the month for which the market risk capital requirement is being calculated.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Unsecured extensions of credit to a single counterparty.</E> A Bank shall not extend unsecured credit to any single counterparty (other than a GSE) in an amount that would exceed the limits of this paragraph. A Bank shall not extend unsecured credit to a GSE in an amount that would exceed the limits set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. If a third-party provides an irrevocable, unconditional guarantee of repayment of a credit (or any part thereof), the third-party guarantor shall be considered the counterparty for purposes of calculating and applying the unsecured credit limits of this section with respect the to guaranteed portion of the transaction.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Term limits.</E> All unsecured extensions of credit by a Bank to a single counterparty that arise from the Bank's on- and off-balance sheet and derivative transactions (but excluding the amount of sales of federal funds with a maturity of one day or less and sales of federal funds subject to a continuing contract) shall not exceed the product of the maximum capital exposure limit applicable to such counterparty, as determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(4) of this section and Table 4 of this part, multiplied by the lesser of:</P>

            <P>(3) <E T="03">Limits for certain obligations issued by state, local or tribal governmental agencies.</E> The term limit set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section when applied to the marketable direct obligations of state, local or tribal government unit or agencies that are acquired member assets identified in § 955.2(a)(3) of this chapter or are otherwise excluded from the prohibition against investments in whole mortgages or whole loan or interests in such mortgages or loans by § 956.3(a)(4)(iii) of this chapter shall be calculated based on the Bank's total capital and the credit rating assigned to the particular obligation as determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section. If a Bank owns series or classes of obligations issued by a particular state, local or tribal government unit or agency or has extended other forms of unsecured credit to such entity falling into different rating categories, the total amount of unsecured credit extended by the Bank to that government unit or agency shall not exceed the term limit associated with the highest-rated obligation issued by the entity and actually purchased by the Bank.</P>

            <P>(ii) If a counterparty does not have a long-term credit rating but has received a short-term credit rating from an NRSRO, the maximum capital exposure limit applicable to that counterparty shall be based upon the short-term credit rating, as determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section, as follows:</P>
            <P>(A) The highest short-term investment grade credit rating shall correspond to the maximum capital exposure limit provided in Table 4 of this part for the third highest long-term investment grade rating;</P>
            <P>(B) The second highest short-term investment grade rating shall correspond to the maximum capital exposure limit provided in Table 4 of this part for the fourth highest long-term investment grade rating; and</P>
            <P>(C) The third highest short-term investment grade rating shall correspond to the maximum capital exposure limit provided in Table 4 of this part for the fourth highest long-term investment grade rating.</P>
            <P>(iii) If a specific debt obligation issued by a counterparty receives a credit rating from an NRSRO that is lower than the counterparty's long-term credit rating, the total amount of the lower-rated obligation held by the Bank may not exceed a sub-limit calculated in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section, except that the Bank shall use the credit rating associated with the specific obligation to determine the applicable maximum capital exposure limit. For purposes of this paragraph, the credit rating of the debt obligation shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Bank determination of applicable credit ratings.</E> The following criteria shall be applied to determine a counterparty's credit rating:</P>
            <P>(i) The counterparty's most recent credit rating from a given NRSRO shall be considered;</P>
            <P>(ii) If only one NRSRO has rated the counterparty, that NRSRO's rating shall be used. If a counterparty has received credit ratings from more than one NRSRO, the lowest credit rating from among those NRSROs shall be used;</P>
            <P>(iii) Where a credit rating has a modifier, the credit rating is deemed to be the credit rating without the modifier;</P>
            <P>(iv) If a counterparty is placed on a credit watch for a potential downgrade by an NRSRO, the credit rating from that NRSRO at the next lower grade shall be used; and</P>
            <P>(v) If a counterparty is not rated by an NRSRO, the Bank shall determine the applicable credit rating by using credit rating standards available from an NRSRO or other similar standards.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Unsecured extensions of credit to affiliated counterparties</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> The total amount of unsecured extensions of credit by a Bank to a group of affiliated counterparties that arise from the Bank's on- and off-balance sheet and derivative transactions, including sales of federal funds with a maturity of one day or less and sales of federal funds subject to a continuing contract, shall not exceed thirty percent of the Bank's total capital.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Relation to individual limits.</E> The aggregate limits calculated under this paragraph shall apply in addition to the limits on extensions of unsecured credit to a single counterparty imposed by paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Special limits for GSEs</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Unsecured extensions of credit by a Bank to a GSE that arise from the Bank's on- and off-balance sheet and derivative transactions, including from the purchase of any subordinated debt subject to the sub-limit set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, from any sales of federal funds with a maturity of one day or less and from sales of federal funds subject to a continuing contract, shall not exceed the lesser of:</P>
            <P>(i) The Bank's total capital; or</P>

            <P>(ii) The GSE's total capital (as defined by the GSE's principal regulator) or some similar comparable measure identified by the Bank.<PRTPAGE P="17"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Sub-limit for subordinated debt.</E> The maximum amount of subordinated debt issued by a GSE and held by a Bank shall not exceed the term limit calculated under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, except that a Bank shall use the credit rating of the GSE's subordinated debt to determine the applicable maximum capital exposure limit. The credit rating of the subordinated debt shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Limits applying to a GSE after a downgrade.</E> If any NRSRO assigns a credit rating to any senior debt obligation issued (or to be issued) by a GSE that is below the highest investment grade or downgrades, or places on a credit watch for a potential downgrade of the credit rating on any senior unsecured obligation issued by a GSE to below the highest investment grade, the special limits on unsecured extensions of credit under paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall cease to apply, and instead, the Bank shall calculate the maximum amount of its unsecured extensions of credit to that GSE in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Extensions of unsecured credit to other Banks.</E> The limits of this section do not apply to unsecured credit extended by one Bank to another Bank.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Extensions of unsecured credit after downgrade or placement on credit watch.</E> If an NRSRO downgrades the credit rating applicable to any counterparty or places any counterparty on a credit watch for a potential downgrade, a Bank need not unwind or liquidate any existing transaction or position with that counterparty that complied with the limits of this section at the time it was entered. In such a case, however, a Bank may extend any additional unsecured credit to such a counterparty only in compliance with the limitations that are calculated using the lower maximum exposure limits. For the purposes of this section, the renewal of an existing unsecured extension of credit, including any decision not to terminate any sales of federal funds subject to a continuing contract, shall be considered an additional extension of unsecured credit that can be undertaken only in accordance with the lower limit.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Reporting requirements</E>—(1) <E T="03">Total unsecured extensions of credit.</E> Each Bank shall report monthly to the Finance Board the amount of the Bank's total unsecured extensions of credit arising from on- and off-balance sheet and derivative transactions to any single counterparty or group of affiliated counterparties that exceeds 5 percent of:</P>
            <P>(i) The Bank's total capital; or</P>
            <P>(ii) The counterparty's, or affiliated counterparties' combined, Tier 1 capital, or if Tier 1 capital is not available, total capital (as defined by each counterparty's principal regulator) or some similar comparable measure identified by the Bank.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Total secured and unsecured extensions of credit.</E> Each Bank shall report monthly to the Finance Board the amount of the Bank's total secured and unsecured extensions of credit arising from on- and off-balance sheet and derivative transactions to any single counterparty or group of affiliated counterparties that exceeds 5 percent of the Bank's total assets.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Extensions of credit in excess of limits.</E> A Bank shall report promptly to the Finance Board any extensions of unsecured credit that exceeds any limit set forth in paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) of this section. In making this report, a Bank shall provide the name of the counterparty or group of affiliated counterparties to which the excess unsecured credit has been extended, the dollar amount of the applicable limit which has been exceeded, the dollar amount by which the Bank's extension of unsecured credit exceeds such limit, the dates for which the Bank was not in compliance with the limit, and, if applicable, a brief explanation of any extenuating circumstances which caused the limit to be exceeded.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Measurement of unsecured extensions of credit</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> For purposes of this section, unsecured extensions of credit will be measured as follows:</P>

            <P>(ii) For off-balance sheet transactions, an amount equal to the credit <PRTPAGE P="18"/>equivalent amount of such item, calculated in accordance with § 932.4(f) of this part; and</P>
            <P>(iii) For derivative transactions, an amount equal to the sum of the current and potential future credit exposures for the derivative contract, where those values are calculated in accordance with §§ 932.4(g) or 932.4(h) of this part, as applicable, less the amount of any collateral that is held in accordance with the requirements of § 932.4(e)(2)(ii)(B) of this part against the credit exposure from the derivative contract.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Status of debt obligations purchased by the Bank.</E> Any debt obligation or debt security (other than mortgage-backed securities or acquired member assets that are identified in §§ 955.2(a)(1) and (2) of this chapter) purchased by a Bank shall be considered an unsecured extension of credit for the purposes of this section, except:</P>
            <P>(i) Any amount owed the Bank against which the Bank holds collateral in accordance with § 932.4(e)(2)(ii)(B) of this part; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Any amount which the Finance Board has determined on a case-by-case basis shall not be considered an unsecured extension of credit.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Authority, scope and purpose.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Authority and scope.</E> This part, known as Regulation B, is issued by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) pursuant to title VII (Equal Credit Opportunity Act) of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, as amended (15 U.S.C. 1601 <E T="03">et seq.</E>). Except as otherwise provided herein, this part applies to all persons who are creditors, as defined in § 1002.2(l), other than a person excluded from coverage of this part by section 1029 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010, title X of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Public Law 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376. Information collection requirements contained in this part have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. 3501 <E T="03">et seq.</E> and have been assigned OMB No. 3170-0013.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The purpose of this part is to promote the availability of credit to all creditworthy applicants without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, or age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract); to the fact that all or part of the applicant's income derives from a public assistance program; or to the fact that the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act. The <PRTPAGE P="22"/>regulation prohibits creditor practices that discriminate on the basis of any of these factors. The regulation also requires creditors to notify applicants of action taken on their applications; to report credit history in the names of both spouses on an account; to retain records of credit applications; to collect information about the applicant's race and other personal characteristics in applications for certain dwelling-related loans; and to provide applicants with copies of appraisal reports used in connection with credit transactions.</P>

          <P>(c) <E T="03">Adverse action.</E> (1) The term means:</P>
          <P>(i) A refusal to grant credit in substantially the amount or on substantially the terms requested in an application unless the creditor makes a counteroffer (to grant credit in a different amount or on other terms) and the applicant uses or expressly accepts the credit offered;</P>
          <P>(ii) A termination of an account or an unfavorable change in the terms of an account that does not affect all or substantially all of a class of the creditor's accounts; or</P>
          <P>(iii) A refusal to increase the amount of credit available to an applicant who has made an application for an increase.</P>
          <P>(2) The term does not include:</P>

          <P>(iv) A refusal to extend credit because applicable law prohibits the creditor from extending the credit requested; or</P>
          <P>(v) A refusal to extend credit because the creditor does not offer the type of credit or credit plan requested.</P>
          <P>(3) An action that falls within the definition of both paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section is governed by paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</P>

          <P>(l) <E T="03">Creditor</E> means a person who, in the ordinary course of business, regularly participates in a credit decision, including setting the terms of the credit. The term creditor includes a creditor's assignee, transferee, or subrogee who so participates. For purposes of §§ 1002.4(a) and (b), the term creditor also includes a person who, in the ordinary course of business, regularly refers applicants or prospective applicants to creditors, or selects or offers to select creditors to whom requests for credit may be made.

          <P>(p) <E T="03">Empirically derived and other credit scoring systems</E>—(1) <E T="03">A credit scoring system</E> is a system that evaluates an applicant's creditworthiness mechanically, based on key attributes of the applicant and aspects of the transaction, and that determines, alone or in conjunction with an evaluation of additional information about the applicant, whether an applicant is deemed creditworthy. To qualify as an <E T="03">empirically derived, demonstrably and statistically sound, credit scoring system,</E> the system must be:</P>
          <P>(i) Based on data that are derived from an empirical comparison of sample groups or the population of creditworthy and non-creditworthy applicants who applied for credit within a reasonable preceding period of time;</P>
          <P>(ii) Developed for the purpose of evaluating the creditworthiness of applicants with respect to the legitimate business interests of the creditor utilizing the system (including, but not limited to, minimizing bad debt losses and operating expenses in accordance with the creditor's business judgment);</P>
          <P>(iii) Developed and validated using accepted statistical principles and methodology; and</P>
          <P>(iv) Periodically revalidated by the use of appropriate statistical principles and methodology and adjusted as necessary to maintain predictive ability.</P>
          <P>(2) A creditor may use an empirically derived, demonstrably and statistically sound, credit scoring system obtained from another person or may obtain credit experience from which to develop such a system. Any such system must satisfy the criteria set forth in paragraph (p)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section; if the creditor is unable during the development process to validate the system based on its own credit experience in accordance with paragraph (p)(1) of this section, the system must be validated when sufficient credit experience becomes available. A system that fails this validity test is no longer an empirically derived, demonstrably and statistically sound, credit scoring system for that creditor.</P>
          <P>(q) <E T="03">Extend credit</E> and <E T="03">extension of credit</E> mean the granting of credit in any form (including, but not limited to, credit granted in addition to any existing credit or credit limit; credit granted pursuant to an open-end credit plan; the refinancing or other renewal of <PRTPAGE P="24"/>credit, including the issuance of a new credit card in place of an expiring credit card or in substitution for an existing credit card; the consolidation of two or more obligations; or the continuance of existing credit without any special effort to collect at or after maturity).</P>
          <P>(r) <E T="03">Good faith</E> means honesty in fact in the conduct or transaction.</P>
          <P>(s) <E T="03">Inadvertent error</E> means a mechanical, electronic, or clerical error that a creditor demonstrates was not intentional and occurred notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid such errors.</P>
          <P>(t) <E T="03">Judgmental system of evaluating applicants</E> means any system for evaluating the creditworthiness of an applicant other than an empirically derived, demonstrably and statistically sound, credit scoring system.</P>
          <P>(u) <E T="03">Marital status</E> means the state of being unmarried, married, or separated, as defined by applicable state law. The term “unmarried” includes persons who are single, divorced, or widowed.</P>
          <P>(v) <E T="03">Negative factor or value,</E> in relation to the age of elderly applicants, means utilizing a factor, value, or weight that is less favorable regarding elderly applicants than the creditor's experience warrants or is less favorable than the factor, value, or weight assigned to the class of applicants that are not classified as elderly and are most favored by a creditor on the basis of age.</P>
          <P>(w) <E T="03">Open-end credit</E> means credit extended under a plan in which a creditor may permit an applicant to make purchases or obtain loans from time to time directly from the creditor or indirectly by use of a credit card, check, or other device.</P>
          <P>(x) <E T="03">Person</E> means a natural person, corporation, government or governmental subdivision or agency, trust, estate, partnership, cooperative, or association.</P>
          <P>(y) <E T="03">Pertinent element of creditworthiness,</E> in relation to a judgmental system of evaluating applicants, means any information about applicants that a creditor obtains and considers and that has a demonstrable relationship to a determination of creditworthiness.</P>
          <P>(z) <E T="03">Prohibited basis</E> means race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, or age (provided that the applicant has the capacity to enter into a binding contract); the fact that all or part of the applicant's income derives from any public assistance program; or the fact that the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act or any state law upon which an exemption has been granted by the Bureau.</P>
          <P>(aa) <E T="03">State</E> means any state, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or any territory or possession of the United States.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Rules concerning evaluation of applications.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">General rule concerning use of information.</E> Except as otherwise provided in the Act and this part, a creditor may consider any information obtained, so long as the information is not used to discriminate against an applicant on a prohibited basis. The legislative history of the Act indicates that the Congress intended an “effects test” concept, as outlined in the employment field by the Supreme Court in the cases of <E T="03">Griggs</E> v. <E T="03">Duke Power Co.,</E> 401 U.S. 424 (1971), and <E T="03">Albemarle Paper Co.</E> v. <E T="03">Moody,</E> 422 U.S. 405 (1975), to be applicable to a creditor's determination of creditworthiness.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Specific rules concerning use of information.</E> (1) Except as provided in the Act and this part, a creditor shall not take a prohibited basis into account in any system of evaluating the creditworthiness of applicants.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Age, receipt of public assistance.</E> (i) Except as permitted in this paragraph, a creditor shall not take into account an applicant's age (provided that the applicant has the capacity to enter into a binding contract) or whether an applicant's income derives from any public assistance program.</P>
          <P>(ii) In an empirically derived, demonstrably and statistically sound, credit scoring system, a creditor may use an applicant's age as a predictive variable, provided that the age of an elderly applicant is not assigned a negative factor or value.</P>
          <P>(iii) In a judgmental system of evaluating creditworthiness, a creditor may consider an applicant's age or whether an applicant's income derives from any public assistance program only for the purpose of determining a pertinent element of creditworthiness.</P>
          <P>(iv) In any system of evaluating creditworthiness, a creditor may consider the age of an elderly applicant when such age is used to favor the elderly applicant in extending credit.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Childbearing, childrearing.</E> In evaluating creditworthiness, a creditor shall not make assumptions or use aggregate statistics relating to the likelihood that any category of persons will bear or rear children or will, for that reason, receive diminished or interrupted income in the future.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Telephone listing.</E> A creditor shall not take into account whether there is a telephone listing in the name of an applicant for consumer credit but may take into account whether there is a telephone in the applicant's residence.</P>
          <P>(5) <E T="03">Income.</E> A creditor shall not discount or exclude from consideration the income of an applicant or the spouse of an applicant because of a prohibited basis or because the income is derived from part-time employment or is an annuity, pension, or other retirement benefit; a creditor may consider the amount and probable continuance of any income in evaluating an applicant's creditworthiness. When an applicant relies on alimony, child support, or separate maintenance payments in applying for credit, the creditor shall consider such payments as income to the extent that they are likely to be consistently made.</P>
          <P>(6) <E T="03">Credit history.</E> To the extent that a creditor considers credit history in evaluating the creditworthiness of similarly qualified applicants for a similar type and amount of credit, in evaluating an applicant's creditworthiness a creditor shall consider:</P>
          <P>(i) The credit history, when available, of accounts designated as accounts that the applicant and the applicant's spouse are permitted to use or for which both are contractually liable;</P>
          <P>(ii) On the applicant's request, any information the applicant may present that tends to indicate the credit history being considered by the creditor does not accurately reflect the applicant's creditworthiness; and</P>
          <P>(iii) On the applicant's request, the credit history, when available, of any account reported in the name of the applicant's spouse or former spouse that the applicant can demonstrate accurately reflects the applicant's creditworthiness.</P>
          <P>(7) <E T="03">Immigration status.</E> A creditor may consider the applicant's immigration status or status as a permanent resident of the United States, and any additional information that may be necessary to ascertain the creditor's rights and remedies regarding repayment.<PRTPAGE P="29"/>
          </P>
          <P>(8) <E T="03">Marital status.</E> Except as otherwise permitted or required by law, a creditor shall evaluate married and unmarried applicants by the same standards; and in evaluating joint applicants, a creditor shall not treat applicants differently based on the existence, absence, or likelihood of a marital relationship between the parties.</P>
          <P>(9) <E T="03">Race, color, religion, national origin, sex.</E> Except as otherwise permitted or required by law, a creditor shall not consider race, color, religion, national origin, or sex (or an applicant's or other person's decision not to provide the information) in any aspect of a credit transaction.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">State property laws.</E> A creditor's consideration or application of state property laws directly or indirectly affecting creditworthiness does not constitute unlawful discrimination for the purposes of the Act or this part.</P>

          <P>(i) Require a reapplication, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section;</P>
          <P>(ii) Change the terms of the account; or</P>
          <P>(iii) Terminate the account.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Requiring reapplication.</E> A creditor may require a reapplication for an open-end account on the basis of a change in the marital status of an applicant who is contractually liable if the credit granted was based in whole or in part on income of the applicant's spouse and if information available to the creditor indicates that the applicant's income may not support the amount of credit currently available.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Signature of spouse or other person</E>—(1) <E T="03">Rule for qualified applicant.</E> Except as provided in this paragraph, a creditor shall not require the signature of an applicant's spouse or other person, other than a joint applicant, on any credit instrument if the applicant qualifies under the creditor's standards of creditworthiness for the amount and terms of the credit requested. A creditor shall not deem the submission of a joint financial statement or other evidence of jointly held assets as an application for joint credit.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Unsecured credit.</E> If an applicant requests unsecured credit and relies in part upon property that the applicant owns jointly with another person to satisfy the creditor's standards of creditworthiness, the creditor may require the signature of the other person only on the instrument(s) necessary, or reasonably believed by the creditor to be necessary, under the law of the state in which the property is located, to enable the creditor to reach the property being relied upon in the event of the death or default of the applicant.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Unsecured credit—community property states.</E> If a married applicant requests unsecured credit and resides in a community property state, or if the applicant is relying on property located in such a state, a creditor may require the signature of the spouse on any instrument necessary, or reasonably believed by the creditor to be necessary, under applicable state law to make the community property available to satisfy the debt in the event of default if:</P>
          <P>(i) Applicable state law denies the applicant power to manage or control sufficient community property to qualify for the credit requested under the creditor's standards of creditworthiness; and</P>
          <P>(ii) The applicant does not have sufficient separate property to qualify for the credit requested without regard to community property.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Secured credit.</E> If an applicant requests secured credit, a creditor may <PRTPAGE P="30"/>require the signature of the applicant's spouse or other person on any instrument necessary, or reasonably believed by the creditor to be necessary, under applicable state law to make the property being offered as security available to satisfy the debt in the event of default, for example, an instrument to create a valid lien, pass clear title, waive inchoate rights, or assign earnings.</P>
          <P>(5) <E T="03">Additional parties.</E> If, under a creditor's standards of creditworthiness, the personal liability of an additional party is necessary to support the credit requested, a creditor may request a cosigner, guarantor, endorser, or similar party. The applicant's spouse may serve as an additional party, but the creditor shall not require that the spouse be the additional party.</P>
          <P>(6) <E T="03">Rights of additional parties.</E> A creditor shall not impose requirements upon an additional party that the creditor is prohibited from imposing upon an applicant under this section.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Insurance.</E> A creditor shall not refuse to extend credit and shall not terminate an account because credit life, health, accident, disability, or other credit-related insurance is not available on the basis of the applicant's age.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Special purpose credit programs.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Standards for programs.</E> Subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, the Act and this part permit a creditor to extend special purpose credit to applicants who meet eligibility requirements under the following types of credit programs:</P>
          <P>(1) Any credit assistance program expressly authorized by Federal or state law for the benefit of an economically disadvantaged class of persons;</P>
          <P>(2) Any credit assistance program offered by a not-for-profit organization, as defined under section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, for the benefit of its members or for the benefit of an economically disadvantaged class of persons; or</P>
          <P>(3) Any special purpose credit program offered by a for-profit organization, or in which such an organization participates to meet special social needs, if:</P>
          <P>(i) The program is established and administered pursuant to a written plan that identifies the class of persons that the program is designed to benefit and sets forth the procedures and standards for extending credit pursuant to the program; and</P>
          <P>(ii) The program is established and administered to extend credit to a class of persons who, under the organization's customary standards of creditworthiness, probably would not receive such credit or would receive it on less favorable terms than are ordinarily available to other applicants applying to the organization for a similar type and amount of credit.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Rules in other sections</E>—(1) <E T="03">General applicability.</E> All the provisions of this part apply to each of the special purpose credit programs described in paragraph (a) of this section except as modified by this section.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Common characteristics.</E> A program described in paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section qualifies as a special purpose credit program only if it was established and is administered so as not to discriminate against an applicant on any prohibited basis; however, all program participants may be required to share one or more common characteristics (for example, race, national origin, or sex) so long as the program was not established and is not administered with the purpose of evading the requirements of the Act or this part.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Special rule concerning requests and use of information.</E> If participants in a special purpose credit program described in paragraph (a) of this section are required to possess one or more common characteristics (for example, race, national origin, or sex) and if the program otherwise satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, a creditor may request and consider information regarding the common characteristic(s) in determining the applicant's eligibility for the program.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Special rule in the case of financial need.</E> If financial need is one of the criteria under a special purpose credit program described in paragraph (a) of this section, the creditor may request <PRTPAGE P="31"/>and consider, in determining an applicant's eligibility for the program, information regarding the applicant's marital status; alimony, child support, and separate maintenance income; and the spouse's financial resources. In addition, a creditor may obtain the signature of an applicant's spouse or other person on an application or credit instrument relating to a special purpose credit program if the signature is required by Federal or state law.</P>

          <P>(b) <E T="03">Form of ECOA notice and statement of specific reasons</E>—(1) <E T="03">ECOA notice.</E> To satisfy the disclosure requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section regarding section 701(a) of the Act, the creditor shall provide a notice that is substantially similar to the following: The Federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act <PRTPAGE P="32"/>prohibits creditors from discriminating against credit applicants on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age (provided the applicant has the capacity to enter into a binding contract); because all or part of the applicant's income derives from any public assistance program; or because the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act. The Federal agency that administers compliance with this law concerning this creditor is [name and address as specified by the appropriate agency or agencies listed in appendix A of this part]. Until January 1, 2013, a creditor may comply with this paragraph (b)(1) and paragraph (a)(2) of this section by including in the notice the name and address as specified by the appropriate agency in appendix A to 12 CFR part 202, as in effect on October 1, 2011.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Statement of specific reasons.</E> The statement of reasons for adverse action required by paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section must be specific and indicate the principal reason(s) for the adverse action. Statements that the adverse action was based on the creditor's internal standards or policies or that the applicant, joint applicant, or similar party failed to achieve a qualifying score on the creditor's credit scoring system are insufficient.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Incomplete applications</E>—(1) <E T="03">Notice alternatives.</E> Within 30 days after receiving an application that is incomplete regarding matters that an applicant can complete, the creditor shall notify the applicant either:</P>
          <P>(i) Of action taken, in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section; or</P>
          <P>(ii) Of the incompleteness, in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Notice of incompleteness.</E> If additional information is needed from an applicant, the creditor shall send a written notice to the applicant specifying the information needed, designating a reasonable period of time for the applicant to provide the information, and informing the applicant that failure to provide the information requested will result in no further consideration being given to the application. The creditor shall have no further obligation under this section if the applicant fails to respond within the designated time period. If the applicant supplies the requested information within the designated time period, the creditor shall take action on the application and notify the applicant in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Oral request for information.</E> At its option, a creditor may inform the applicant orally of the need for additional information. If the application remains incomplete the creditor shall send a notice in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Oral notifications by small-volume creditors.</E> In the case of a creditor that did not receive more than 150 applications during the preceding calendar year, the requirements of this section (including statements of specific reasons) are satisfied by oral notifications.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Withdrawal of approved application.</E> When an applicant submits an application and the parties contemplate that the applicant will inquire about its status, if the creditor approves the application and the applicant has not inquired within 30 days after applying, the creditor may treat the application as withdrawn and need not comply with paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Multiple applicants.</E> When an application involves more than one applicant, notification need only be given to one of them but must be given to the primary applicant where one is readily apparent.</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Applications submitted through a third party.</E> When an application is made on behalf of an applicant to more than one creditor and the applicant expressly accepts or uses credit offered by one of the creditors, notification of action taken by any of the other creditors is not required. If no credit is offered or if the applicant does not expressly accept or use the credit offered, each creditor taking adverse action must comply with this section, directly or through a third party. A notice given by a third party shall disclose the identity of each creditor on whose behalf the notice is given.</P>

A state law is not inconsistent if it is more protective of an applicant.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Preempted provisions of state law.</E> (1) A state law is deemed to be inconsistent with the requirements of the Act and this part and less protective of an applicant within the meaning of section 705(f) of the Act to the extent that the law:</P>
          <P>(i) Requires or permits a practice or act prohibited by the Act or this part;</P>
          <P>(ii) Prohibits the individual extension of consumer credit to both parties to a marriage if each spouse individually and voluntarily applies for such credit;</P>

The Bureau will grant such an exemption if the Bureau determines that:</P>
          <P>(i) The class of credit transactions is subject to state law requirements substantially similar to those of the Act and this part or that applicants are afforded greater protection under state law; and</P>
          <P>(ii) There is adequate provision for state enforcement.</P>

The applicant(s) shall be asked but not required to supply the requested information. If the applicant(s) chooses not to provide the information or any part of it, that fact shall be noted on the form.

          <P>(a) <E T="03">Providing appraisals and other valuations</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> A creditor shall provide an applicant a copy of all appraisals and other written valuations developed in connection with an application for credit that is to be secured by a first lien on a dwelling. A creditor shall provide a copy of each such appraisal or other written valuation promptly upon completion, or three business days prior to consummation of the transaction (for closed-end credit) or account opening (for open-end credit), whichever is earlier. An applicant may waive the timing requirement in this paragraph (a)(1) and agree to receive any copy at or before consummation or account opening, except where otherwise prohibited by law. Any such waiver must be obtained at least three business days prior to consummation or account opening, unless the waiver pertains solely to the applicant's receipt of a copy of an appraisal or other written valuation that contains only clerical changes from a previous version of the appraisal or other written valuation provided to the applicant three or more business days prior to consummation or account opening. If the applicant provides a waiver and the transaction is not consummated or the account is not opened, the creditor must provide these copies no later than 30 days after the creditor determines consummation will not occur or the account will not be opened.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Disclosure.</E> For applications subject to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a creditor shall mail or deliver to an applicant, not later than the third business day after the creditor receives an application for credit that is to be secured by a first lien on a dwelling, a notice in writing of the applicant's right to receive a copy of all written appraisals developed in connection with the application. In the case of an application for credit that is not to be secured by a first lien on a dwelling at the time of application, if the creditor later determines the credit will be secured by a first lien on a dwelling, the creditor shall mail or deliver the same notice in writing not later than the third business day after the creditor determines that the loan is to be secured by a first lien on a dwelling.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Reimbursement.</E> A creditor shall not charge an applicant for providing a copy of appraisals and other written valuations as required under this section, but may require applicants to pay a reasonable fee to reimburse the creditor for the cost of the appraisal or other written valuation unless otherwise provided by law.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Withdrawn, denied, or incomplete applications.</E> The requirements set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section apply whether credit is extended or denied or if the application is incomplete or withdrawn.</P>
          <P>(5) <E T="03">Copies in electronic form.</E> The copies required by § 1002.14(a)(1) may be provided to the applicant in electronic form, subject to compliance with the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act) (15 U.S.C. 7001 <E T="03">et seq.</E>).</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">General rules</E>—(1) <E T="03">Voluntary self-testing and correction.</E> The report or results of a self-test that a creditor voluntarily conducts (or authorizes) are privileged as provided in this section. <PRTPAGE P="37"/>Data collection required by law or by any governmental authority is not a voluntary self-test.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Corrective action required.</E> The privilege in this section applies only if the creditor has taken or is taking appropriate corrective action.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Other privileges.</E> The privilege created by this section does not preclude the assertion of any other privilege that may also apply.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Self-test defined</E>—(1) <E T="03">Definition.</E> A self-test is any program, practice, or study that:</P>
          <P>(i) Is designed and used specifically to determine the extent or effectiveness of a creditor's compliance with the Act or this part; and</P>
          <P>(ii) Creates data or factual information that is not available and cannot be derived from loan or application files or other records related to credit transactions.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Types of information privileged.</E> The privilege under this section applies to the report or results of the self-test, data or factual information created by the self-test, and any analysis, opinions, and conclusions pertaining to the self-test report or results. The privilege covers workpapers or draft documents as well as final documents.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Types of information not privileged.</E> The privilege under this section does not apply to:</P>
          <P>(i) Information about whether a creditor conducted a self-test, the methodology used or the scope of the self-test, the time period covered by the self-test, or the dates it was conducted; or</P>
          <P>(ii) Loan and application files or other business records related to credit transactions, and information derived from such files and records, even if the information has been aggregated, summarized, or reorganized to facilitate analysis.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Appropriate corrective action</E>—(1) <E T="03">General requirement.</E> For the privilege in this section to apply, appropriate corrective action is required when the self-test shows that it is more likely than not that a violation occurred, even though no violation has been formally adjudicated.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Determining the scope of appropriate corrective action.</E> A creditor must take corrective action that is reasonably likely to remedy the cause and effect of a likely violation by:</P>
          <P>(i) Identifying the policies or practices that are the likely cause of the violation; and</P>
          <P>(ii) Assessing the extent and scope of any violation.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Types of relief.</E> Appropriate corrective action may include both prospective and remedial relief, except that to establish a privilege under this section:</P>
          <P>(i) A creditor is not required to provide remedial relief to a tester used in a self-test;</P>
          <P>(ii) A creditor is only required to provide remedial relief to an applicant identified by the self-test as one whose rights were more likely than not violated; and</P>
          <P>(iii) A creditor is not required to provide remedial relief to a particular applicant if the statute of limitations applicable to the violation expired before the creditor obtained the results of the self-test or the applicant is otherwise ineligible for such relief.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">No admission of violation.</E> Taking corrective action is not an admission that a violation occurred.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Scope of privilege</E>—(1) <E T="03">General rule.</E> The report or results of a privileged self-test may not be obtained or used:</P>
          <P>(i) By a government agency in any examination or investigation relating to compliance with the Act or this part; or</P>
          <P>(ii) By a government agency or an applicant (including a prospective applicant who alleges a violation of § 1002.4(b)) in any proceeding or civil action in which a violation of the Act or this part is alleged.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Loss of privilege.</E> The report or results of a self-test are not privileged under paragraph (d)(1) of this section if the creditor or a person with lawful access to the report or results:</P>
          <P>(i) Voluntarily discloses any part of the report or results, or any other information privileged under this section, to an applicant or government agency or to the public;</P>
          <P>(ii) Discloses any part of the report or results, or any other information privileged under this section, as a defense to charges that the creditor has violated the Act or regulation; or</P>

          <P>(iii) Fails or is unable to produce written or recorded information about <PRTPAGE P="38"/>the self-test that is required to be retained under § 1002.12(b)(6) when the information is needed to determine whether the privilege applies. This paragraph does not limit any other penalty or remedy that may be available for a violation of § 1002.12.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Limited use of privileged information.</E> Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the self-test report or results and any other information privileged under this section may be obtained and used by an applicant or government agency solely to determine a penalty or remedy after a violation of the Act or this part has been adjudicated or admitted. Disclosures for this limited purpose may be used only for the particular proceeding in which the adjudication or admission was made. Information disclosed under this paragraph (d)(3) remains privileged under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">Administrative enforcement.</E> (1) As set forth more fully in section 704 of the Act, administrative enforcement of the Act and this part regarding certain creditors is assigned to the Comptroller of the Currency, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, National Credit Union Administration, Surface Transportation Board, Civil Aeronautics Board, Secretary of Agriculture, Farm Credit Administration, Securities and Exchange Commission, Small Business Administration, Secretary of Transportation, and Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection.</P>
          <P>(2) Except to the extent that administrative enforcement is specifically assigned to some government agency other than the Bureau, and subject to subtitle B of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010, the Federal Trade Commission is authorized to enforce the requirements imposed under the Act and this part.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Penalties and liabilities.</E> (1) Sections 702(g) and 706(a) and (b) of the Act provide that any creditor that fails to comply with a requirement imposed by the Act or this part is subject to civil liability for actual and punitive damages in individual or class actions. Pursuant to sections 702(g) and 704(b), (c), and (d) of the Act, violations of the Act or this part also constitute violations of other Federal laws. Liability for punitive damages can apply only to nongovernmental entities and is limited to $10,000 in individual actions and the lesser of $500,000 or 1 percent of the creditor's net worth in class actions. Section 706(c) provides for equitable and declaratory relief and section 706(d) authorizes the awarding of costs and reasonable attorney's fees to an aggrieved applicant in a successful action.</P>
          <P>(2) As provided in section 706(f) of the Act, a civil action under the Act or this part may be brought in the appropriate United States district court without regard to the amount in controversy or in any other court of competent jurisdiction within five years after the date of the occurrence of the violation, or within one year after the commencement of an administrative enforcement proceeding or of a civil action brought by the Attorney General of the United States within five years after the alleged violation.</P>
          <P>(3) If an agency responsible for administrative enforcement is unable to obtain compliance with the Act or this part, it may refer the matter to the Attorney General of the United States. If the Bureau, the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or the National Credit Union Administration has reason to believe that one or more creditors have engaged in a pattern or practice of discouraging or denying applications in violation of the Act or this part, the agency shall refer the matter to the Attorney General. If the agency has reason to believe that one or more creditors violated section 701(a) of the Act, the agency may refer a matter to the Attorney General.</P>

          <P>(4) On referral, or whenever the Attorney General has reason to believe that one or more creditors have engaged in a pattern or practice in violation of the Act or this part, the Attorney General may bring a civil action for such relief as may be appropriate, including actual and punitive damages and injunctive relief.<PRTPAGE P="39"/>
          </P>
          <P>(5) If the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or the National Credit Union Administration has reason to believe (as a result of a consumer complaint, a consumer compliance examination, or some other basis) that a violation of the Act or this part has occurred which is also a violation of the Fair Housing Act, and the matter is not referred to the Attorney General, the agency shall:</P>
          <P>(i) Notify the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development; and</P>
          <P>(ii) Inform the applicant that the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development has been notified and that remedies may be available under the Fair Housing Act.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Failure of compliance.</E> A creditor's failure to comply with § 1002.6(b)(6), § 1002.9, § 1002.10, § 1002.12 or § 1002.13 is not a violation if it results from an inadvertent error. On discovering an error under §§ 1002.9 and 1002.10, the creditor shall correct it as soon as possible. If a creditor inadvertently obtains the monitoring information regarding the ethnicity, race, and sex of the applicant in a dwelling-related transaction not covered by § 1002.13, the creditor may retain information and act on the application without violating the regulation.</P>

            <P>1. This appendix contains five model credit application forms, each designated for use in a particular type of consumer credit transaction as indicated by the bracketed caption <PRTPAGE P="40"/>on each form. The first sample form is intended for use in open-end, unsecured transactions; the second for closed-end, secured transactions; the third for closed-end transactions, whether unsecured or secured; the fourth in transactions involving community property or occurring in community property States; and the fifth in residential mortgage transactions which contains a model disclosure for use in complying with § 1002.13 for certain dwelling-related loans. This appendix also contains a data collection model form for collecting information concerning an applicant's ethnicity, race, and sex that complies with the requirements of § 1002.13(a)(1)(i)(A) and (ii). Appendix B to 12 CFR part 1003 provides a data collection model form for collecting information concerning an applicant's ethnicity, race, and sex that complies with the requirements of § 1002.13(a)(1)(i)(B) and (ii). All forms contained in this appendix are models; their use by creditors is optional.</P>
            <P>2. The use or modification of these forms is governed by the following instructions. A creditor may change the forms: by asking for additional information not prohibited by § 1002.5; by deleting any information request; or by rearranging the format without modifying the substance of the inquiries. In any of these three instances, however, the appropriate notices regarding the optional nature of courtesy titles, the option to disclose alimony, child support, or separate maintenance, and the limitation concerning marital status inquiries must be included in the appropriate places if the items to which they relate appear on the creditor's form.</P>
            <P>3. If a creditor uses an appropriate appendix B model form, or modifies a form in accordance with the above instructions, that creditor shall be deemed to be acting in compliance with the provisions of paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of § 1002.5 of this part.</P>

                  <P>1. This appendix contains four model credit application forms, each designated for use in a particular type of consumer credit transaction as indicated by the bracketed caption on each form. The first sample form is intended for use in open-end, unsecured transactions; the second for closed-end, secured transactions; the third for closed-end transactions, whether unsecured or secured; and the fourth in transactions involving community property or occurring in community property States.

            <EAR>Pt. 1002, App. C</EAR>
            <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix C to Part 1002—Sample Notification Forms</HD>
            <P>1. This Appendix contains ten sample notification forms. Forms C-1 through C-4 are intended for use in notifying an applicant that adverse action has been taken on an application or account under §§ 1002.9(a)(1) and (2)(i) of this part. Form C-5 is a notice of disclosure of the right to request specific reasons for adverse action under §§ 1002.9(a)(1) and (2)(ii). Form C-6 is designed for use in notifying an applicant, under § 1002.9(c)(2), that an application is incomplete. Forms C-7 and C-8 are intended for use in connection with applications for business credit under § 1002.9(a)(3). Form C-9 is designed for use in notifying an applicant of the right to receive a copy of appraisals under § 1002.14. Form C-10 is designed for use in notifying an applicant for nonmortgage credit that the creditor is requesting applicant characteristic information.</P>

            <P>2. Form C-1 contains the Fair Credit Reporting Act disclosure as required by sections 615(a) and (b) of that act. Forms C-2 through C-5 contain only the section 615(a) <PRTPAGE P="54"/>disclosure (that a creditor obtained information from a consumer reporting agency that was considered in the credit decision). A creditor must provide the section 615(a) disclosure when adverse action is taken against a consumer based on information from a consumer reporting agency. A creditor must provide the section 615(b) disclosure when adverse action is taken based on information from an outside source other than a consumer reporting agency. In addition, a creditor must provide the section 615(b) disclosure if the creditor obtained information from an affiliate other than information in a consumer report or other than information concerning the affiliate's own transactions or experiences with the consumer. Creditors may comply with the disclosure requirements for adverse action based on information in a consumer report obtained from an affiliate by providing either the section 615(a) or section 615(b) disclosure. Optional language in Forms C-1 through C-5 may be used to direct the consumer to the entity that provided the credit score for any questions about the credit score, along with the entity's contact information. Creditors may use or not use this additional language without losing the safe harbor, since the language is optional.</P>
            <P>3. The sample forms are illustrative and may not be appropriate for all creditors. They were designed to include some of the factors that creditors most commonly consider. If a creditor chooses to use the checklist of reasons provided in one of the sample forms in this appendix and if reasons commonly used by the creditor are not provided on the form, the creditor should modify the checklist by substituting or adding other reasons. For example, if “inadequate down payment” or “no deposit relationship with us” are common reasons for taking adverse action on an application, the creditor ought to add or substitute such reasons for those presently contained on the sample forms.</P>
            <P>4. If the reasons listed on the forms are not the factors actually used, a creditor will not satisfy the notice requirement by simply checking the closest identifiable factor listed. For example, some creditors consider only references from banks or other depository institutions and disregard finance company references altogether; their statement of reasons should disclose “insufficient bank references,” not “insufficient credit references.” Similarly, a creditor that considers bank references and other credit references as distinct factors should treat the two factors separately and disclose them as appropriate. The creditor should either add such other factors to the form or check “other” and include the appropriate explanation. The creditor need not, however, describe how or why a factor adversely affected the application. For example, the notice may say “length of residence” rather than “too short a period of residence.”</P>
            <P>5. A creditor may design its own notification forms or use all or a portion of the forms contained in this Appendix. Proper use of Forms C-1 through C-4 will satisfy the requirement of § 1002.9(a)(2)(i). Proper use of Forms C-5 and C-6 constitutes full compliance with §§ 1002.9(a)(2)(ii) and 1002.9(c)(2), respectively. Proper use of Forms C-7 and C-8 will satisfy the requirements of §§ 1002.9(a)(2)(i) and (ii), respectively, for applications for business credit. Proper use of Form C-9 will satisfy the requirements of § 1002.14 of this part. Proper use of Form C-10 will satisfy the requirements of § 1002.5(b)(1).</P>

            <P>1. <E T="03">Scope.</E> The Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B apply to all credit—commercial as well as personal—without regard to the nature or type of the credit or the creditor, except for an entity excluded from coverage of this part (but not the Act) by section 1029 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (12 U.S.C. 5519). If a transaction provides for the deferral of the payment of a debt, it is credit covered by Regulation B even though it may not be a credit transaction covered by Regulation Z (Truth in Lending) (12 CFR part 1026). Further, the definition of creditor is not restricted to the party or person to whom the obligation is initially payable, as is the case under Regulation Z. Moreover, the Act and regulation apply to all methods of credit evaluation, whether performed judgmentally or by use of a credit scoring system.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Foreign applicability.</E> Regulation B generally does not apply to lending activities that occur outside the United States. The regulation does apply to lending activities that take place within the United States (as well as the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and any territory or possession of the United States), whether or not the applicant is a citizen.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Bureau.</E> The term <E T="03">Bureau,</E> as used in this part, means the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection.</P>

              <E T="03">Paragraph 2(c)(1)(ii).</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Move from service area.</E> If a credit card issuer terminates the open-end account of a customer because the customer has moved out of the card issuer's service area, the termination is adverse action unless termination on this ground was explicitly provided for in the credit agreement between the parties. In cases where termination is adverse action, notification is required under § 1002.9.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Termination based on credit limit.</E> If a creditor terminates credit accounts that have low credit limits (for example, under $400) but keeps open accounts with higher credit limits, the termination is adverse action and notification is required under § 1002.9.</P>
            <P>

            <P>1. <E T="03">Default—exercise of due-on-sale clause.</E> If a mortgagor sells or transfers mortgaged property without the consent of the mortgagee, and the mortgagee exercises its contractual right to accelerate the mortgage loan, the mortgagee may treat the mortgagor as being in default. An adverse action notice need not be given to the mortgagor or the transferee. (See comment 2(e)-1 for treatment of a purchaser who requests to assume the loan.)</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Current delinquency or default.</E> The term adverse action does not include a creditor's termination of an account when the accountholder is currently in default or delinquent on that account. Notification in accordance with § 1002.9 of the regulation generally is required, however, if the creditor's action is based on a past delinquency or default on the account.</P>

            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Point-of-sale transactions.</E> Denial of credit at point of sale is not adverse action except under those circumstances specified in the regulation. For example, denial at point of sale is not adverse action in the following situations:</P>
            <P>i. A credit cardholder presents an expired card or a card that has been reported to the card issuer as lost or stolen.</P>
            <P>ii. The amount of a transaction exceeds a cash advance or credit limit.</P>
            <P>iii. The circumstances (such as excessive use of a credit card in a short period of time) suggest that fraud is involved.</P>
            <P>iv. The authorization facilities are not functioning.</P>
            <P>v. Billing statements have been returned to the creditor for lack of a forwarding address.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Application for increase in available credit.</E> A refusal or failure to authorize an account transaction at the point of sale or loan is not adverse action except when the refusal is a denial of an application, submitted in accordance with the creditor's procedures, for an increase in the amount of credit.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Paragraph 2(c)(2)(v).</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Terms of credit versus type of credit offered.</E> When an applicant applies for credit and the creditor does not offer the credit terms requested by the applicant (for example, the interest rate, length of maturity, collateral, or amount of downpayment), a denial of the application for that reason is adverse action (unless the creditor makes a counteroffer that is accepted by the applicant) and the applicant is entitled to notification under § 1002.9.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">2(e) Applicant.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Request to assume loan.</E> If a mortgagor sells or transfers the mortgaged property and the buyer makes an application to the creditor to assume the mortgage loan, the mortgagee must treat the buyer as an applicant unless its policy is not to permit assumptions.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">2(f) Application.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">General.</E> A creditor has the latitude under the regulation to establish its own application process and to decide the type and amount of information it will require from credit applicants.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Procedures used.</E> The term “procedures” refers to the actual practices followed by a creditor for making credit decisions as well as its stated application procedures. For example, if a creditor's stated policy is to require all applications to be in writing on the creditor's application form, but the creditor also makes credit decisions based on oral requests, the creditor's procedures are to accept both oral and written applications.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">When an inquiry or prequalification request becomes an application.</E> A creditor is encouraged to provide consumers with information about loan terms. However, if in giving information to the consumer the creditor also evaluates information about the consumer, decides to decline the request, and communicates this to the consumer, the creditor has treated the inquiry or prequalification request as an application and must then comply with the notification requirements under § 1002.9. Whether the inquiry or prequalification request becomes an application depends on how the creditor responds to the consumer, not on what the consumer says or asks. (See comment 9-5 for further discussion of prequalification requests; see comment 2(f)-5 for a discussion of preapproval requests.)</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Examples of inquiries that are not applications.</E> The following examples illustrate situations in which only an inquiry has taken place:</P>

            <P>i. A consumer calls to ask about loan terms and an employee explains the creditor's basic loan terms, such as interest rates, loan-to-value ratio, and debt-to-income ratio.<PRTPAGE P="61"/>
            </P>
            <P>ii. A consumer calls to ask about interest rates for car loans, and, in order to quote the appropriate rate, the loan officer asks for the make and sales price of the car and the amount of the downpayment, then gives the consumer the rate.</P>
            <P>iii. A consumer asks about terms for a loan to purchase a home and tells the loan officer her income and intended downpayment, but the loan officer only explains the creditor's loan-to-value ratio policy and other basic lending policies, without telling the consumer whether she qualifies for the loan.</P>
            <P>iv. A consumer calls to ask about terms for a loan to purchase vacant land and states his income and the sales price of the property to be financed, and asks whether he qualifies for a loan; the employee responds by describing the general lending policies, explaining that he would need to look at all of the consumer's qualifications before making a decision, and offering to send an application form to the consumer.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Examples of an application.</E> An application for credit includes the following situations:</P>
            <P>i. A person asks a financial institution to “preapprove” her for a loan (for example, to finance a house or a vehicle she plans to buy) and the institution reviews the request under a program in which the institution, after a comprehensive analysis of her creditworthiness, issues a written commitment valid for a designated period of time to extend a loan up to a specified amount. The written commitment may not be subject to conditions other than conditions that require the identification of adequate collateral, conditions that require no material change in the applicant's financial condition or creditworthiness prior to funding the loan, and limited conditions that are not related to the financial condition or creditworthiness of the applicant that the lender ordinarily attaches to a traditional application (such as certification of a clear termite inspection for a home purchase loan, or a maximum mileage requirement for a used car loan). But if the creditor's program does not provide for giving written commitments, requests for preapprovals are treated as prequalification requests for purposes of the regulation.</P>
            <P>ii. Under the same facts as above, the financial institution evaluates the person's creditworthiness and determines that she does not qualify for a preapproval.</P>
            <P>6. <E T="03">Completed application—diligence requirement.</E> The regulation defines a completed application in terms that give a creditor the latitude to establish its own information requirements. Nevertheless, the creditor must act with reasonable diligence to collect information needed to complete the application. For example, the creditor should request information from third parties, such as a credit report, promptly after receiving the application. If additional information is needed from the applicant, such as an address or a telephone number to verify employment, the creditor should contact the applicant promptly. (But see comment 9(a)(1)-3, which discusses the creditor's option to deny an application on the basis of incompleteness.)<E T="03">2(g) Business credit.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Definition.</E> The test for deciding whether a transaction qualifies as business credit is one of primary purpose. For example, an open-end credit account used for both personal and business purposes is not business credit unless the primary purpose of the account is business-related. A creditor may rely on an applicant's statement of the purpose for the credit requested.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">2(j) Credit.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">General.</E> Regulation B covers a wider range of credit transactions than Regulation Z (Truth in Lending). Under Regulation B, a transaction is credit if there is a right to defer payment of a debt—regardless of whether the credit is for personal or commercial purposes, the number of installments required for repayment, or whether the transaction is subject to a finance charge.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">2(l) Creditor.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Assignees.</E> The term creditor includes all persons participating in the credit decision. This may include an assignee or a potential purchaser of the obligation who influences the credit decision by indicating whether or not it will purchase the obligation if the transaction is consummated.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Referrals to creditors.</E> For certain purposes, the term creditor includes persons such as real estate brokers, automobile dealers, home builders, and home-improvement contractors who do not participate in credit decisions but who only accept applications and refer applicants to creditors, or select or offer to select creditors to whom credit requests can be made. These persons must comply with § 1002.4(a), the general rule prohibiting discrimination, and with § 1002.4(b), the general rule against discouraging applications.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">2(p) Empirically derived and other credit scoring systems.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Purpose of definition.</E> The definition under §§ 1002.2(p)(1)(i) through (iv) sets the criteria that a credit system must meet in order to use age as a predictive factor. Credit systems that do not meet these criteria are judgmental systems and may consider age only for the purpose of determining a “pertinent element of creditworthiness.” (Both types of systems may favor an elderly applicant. See § 1002.6(b)(2).)</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Periodic revalidation.</E> The regulation does not specify how often credit scoring systems must be revalidated. The credit scoring system must be revalidated frequently enough to ensure that it continues to meet recognized professional statistical standards for <PRTPAGE P="62"/>statistical soundness. To ensure that predictive ability is being maintained, the creditor must periodically review the performance of the system. This could be done, for example, by analyzing the loan portfolio to determine the delinquency rate for each score interval, or by analyzing population stability over time to detect deviations of recent applications from the applicant population used to validate the system. If this analysis indicates that the system no longer predicts risk with statistical soundness, the system must be adjusted as necessary to reestablish its predictive ability. A creditor is responsible for ensuring its system is validated and revalidated based on the creditor's own data.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Pooled data scoring systems.</E> A scoring system or the data from which to develop such a system may be obtained from either a single credit grantor or multiple credit grantors. The resulting system will qualify as an empirically derived, demonstrably and statistically sound, credit scoring system provided the criteria set forth in paragraph (p)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section are met. A creditor is responsible for ensuring its system is validated and revalidated based on the creditor's own data when it becomes available.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Effects test and disparate treatment.</E> An empirically derived, demonstrably and statistically sound, credit scoring system may include age as a predictive factor (provided that the age of an elderly applicant is not assigned a negative factor or value). Besides age, no other prohibited basis may be used as a variable. Generally, credit scoring systems treat all applicants objectively and thus avoid problems of disparate treatment. In cases where a credit scoring system is used in conjunction with individual discretion, disparate treatment could conceivably occur in the evaluation process. In addition, neutral factors used in credit scoring systems could nonetheless be subject to challenge under the effects test. (See comment 6(a)-2 for a discussion of the effects test).</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">2(w) Open-end credit.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Open-end real estate mortgages.</E> The term “open-end credit” does not include negotiated advances under an open-end real estate mortgage or a letter of credit.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">2(z) Prohibited basis.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Persons associated with applicant.</E> As used in this part, prohibited basis refers not only to characteristics—the race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, or age—of an applicant (or officers of an applicant in the case of a corporation) but also to the characteristics of individuals with whom an applicant is affiliated or with whom the applicant associates. This means, for example, that under the general rule stated in § 1002.4(a), a creditor may not discriminate against an applicant because of that person's personal or business dealings with members of a certain religion, because of the national origin of any persons associated with the extension of credit (such as the tenants in the apartment complex being financed), or because of the race of other residents in the neighborhood where the property offered as collateral is located.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">National origin.</E> A creditor may not refuse to grant credit because an applicant comes from a particular country but may take the applicant's immigration status into account. A creditor may also take into account any applicable law, regulation, or executive order restricting dealings with citizens (or the government) of a particular country or imposing limitations regarding credit extended for their use.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Public assistance program.</E> Any Federal, state, or local governmental assistance program that provides a continuing, periodic income supplement, whether premised on entitlement or need, is “public assistance” for purposes of the regulation. The term includes (but is not limited to) Temporary Aid to Needy Families, food stamps, rent and mortgage supplement or assistance programs, social security and supplemental security income, and unemployment compensation. Only physicians, hospitals, and others to whom the benefits are payable need consider Medicare and Medicaid as public assistance.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 1002.3—Limited Exceptions for Certain Classes of Transactions</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Scope.</E> Under this section, procedural requirements of the regulation do not apply to certain types of credit. All classes of transactions remain subject to § 1002.4(a), the general rule barring discrimination on a prohibited basis, and to any other provision not specifically excepted.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">3(a) Public-utilities credit.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Definition.</E> This definition applies only to credit for the purchase of a utility service, such as electricity, gas, or telephone service. Credit provided or offered by a public utility for some other purpose—such as for financing the purchase of a gas dryer, telephone equipment, or other durable goods, or for insulation or other home improvements—is not excepted.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Security deposits.</E> A utility company is a creditor when it supplies utility service and bills the user after the service has been provided. Thus, any credit term (such as a requirement for a security deposit) is subject to the regulation's bar against discrimination on a prohibited basis.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Telephone companies.</E> A telephone company's credit transactions qualify for the exceptions provided in § 1002.3(a)(2) only if the company is regulated by a government unit or files the charges for service, delayed payment, or any discount for prompt payment with a government unit.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">3(c) Incidental credit.</E>
              <PRTPAGE P="63"/>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Examples.</E> If a service provider (such as a hospital, doctor, lawyer, or merchant) allows the client or customer to defer the payment of a bill, this deferral of debt is credit for purposes of the regulation, even though there is no finance charge and no agreement for payment in installments. Because of the exceptions provided by this section, however, these particular credit extensions are excepted from compliance with certain procedural requirements as specified in § 1002.3(c).</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">3(d) Government credit.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Credit to governments.</E> The exception relates to credit extended to (not by) governmental entities. For example, credit extended to a local government is covered by this exception, but credit extended to consumers by a Federal or state housing agency does not qualify for special treatment under this category.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 1002.4—General Rules</HD>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Paragraph 4(a).</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Scope of rule.</E> The general rule stated in § 1002.4(a) covers all dealings, without exception, between an applicant and a creditor, whether or not addressed by other provisions of the regulation. Other provisions of the regulation identify specific practices that the Bureau has decided are impermissible because they could result in credit discrimination on a basis prohibited by the Act. The general rule covers, for example, application procedures, criteria used to evaluate creditworthiness, administration of accounts, and treatment of delinquent or slow accounts. Thus, whether or not specifically prohibited elsewhere in the regulation, a credit practice that treats applicants differently on a prohibited basis violates the law because it violates the general rule. Disparate treatment on a prohibited basis is illegal whether or not it results from a conscious intent to discriminate.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Examples.</E>
            </P>
            <P>i. Disparate treatment would exist, for example, in the following situations:</P>
            <P>A. A creditor provides information only on “subprime” and similar products to minority applicants who request information about the creditor's mortgage products, but provides information on a wider variety of mortgage products to similarly situated nonminority applicants.</P>
            <P>B. A creditor provides more comprehensive information to men than to similarly situated women.</P>
            <P>C. A creditor requires a minority applicant to provide greater documentation to obtain a loan than a similarly situated nonminority applicant.</P>
            <P>D. A creditor waives or relaxes credit standards for a nonminority applicant but not for a similarly situated minority applicant.</P>
            <P>ii. Treating applicants differently on a prohibited basis is unlawful if the creditor lacks a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its action, or if the asserted reason is found to be a pretext for discrimination.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Paragraph 4(b).</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Prospective applicants.</E> Generally, the regulation's protections apply only to persons who have requested or received an extension of credit. In keeping with the purpose of the Act—to promote the availability of credit on a nondiscriminatory basis—§ 1002.4(b) covers acts or practices directed at prospective applicants that could discourage a reasonable person, on a prohibited basis, from applying for credit. Practices prohibited by this section include:</P>
            <P>i. A statement that the applicant should not bother to apply, after the applicant states that he is retired.</P>
            <P>ii. The use of words, symbols, models or other forms of communication in advertising that express, imply, or suggest a discriminatory preference or a policy of exclusion in violation of the Act.</P>
            <P>iii. The use of interview scripts that discourage applications on a prohibited basis.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Affirmative advertising.</E> A creditor may affirmatively solicit or encourage members of traditionally disadvantaged groups to apply for credit, especially groups that might not normally seek credit from that creditor.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Paragraph 4(c).</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Requirement for written applications.</E> Model application forms are provided in appendix B to the regulation, although use of a printed form is not required. A creditor will satisfy the requirement by writing down the information that it normally considers in making a credit decision. The creditor may complete an application on behalf of an applicant and need not require the applicant to sign the application.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Telephone applications.</E> A creditor that accepts applications by telephone for dwelling-related credit covered by § 1002.13 can meet the requirement for written applications by writing down pertinent information that is provided by the applicant.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Computerized entry.</E> Information entered directly into and retained by a computerized system qualifies as a written application under this paragraph. (See the commentary to § 1002.13(b), <E T="03">Applications through electronic media and Applications through video.</E>)</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Paragraph 4(d).</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Clear and conspicuous.</E> This standard requires that disclosures be presented in a reasonably understandable format in a way that does not obscure the required information. No minimum type size is mandated, but the disclosures must be legible, whether typewritten, handwritten, or printed by computer.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Form of disclosures.</E> Whether the disclosures required to be on or with an application must be in electronic form depends upon the following:<PRTPAGE P="64"/>
            </P>
            <P>i. If an applicant accesses a credit application electronically (other than as described under ii below), such as online at a home computer, the creditor must provide the disclosures in electronic form (such as with the application form on its Web site) in order to meet the requirement to provide disclosures in a timely manner on or with the application. If the creditor instead mailed paper disclosures to the applicant, this requirement would not be met.</P>
            <P>ii. In contrast, if an applicant is physically present in the creditor's office, and accesses a credit application electronically, such as via a terminal or kiosk (or if the applicant uses a terminal or kiosk located on the premises of an affiliate or third party that has arranged with the creditor to provide applications to consumers), the creditor may provide disclosures in either electronic or paper form, provided the creditor complies with the timing, delivery, and retainability requirements of the regulation.</P>

            <P>3. <E T="03">Collecting information on behalf of creditors.</E> Persons such as loan brokers and correspondents do not violate the ECOA or Regulation B if they collect information that they are otherwise prohibited from collecting, where the purpose of collecting the information is to provide it to a creditor that is subject to the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act or another Federal or state statute or regulation requiring data collection.</P>

            <P>1. <E T="03">Indirect disclosure of prohibited information.</E> The fact that certain credit-related information may indirectly disclose marital status does not bar a creditor from seeking such information. For example, the creditor may ask about:</P>
            <P>i. The applicant's obligation to pay alimony, child support, or separate maintenance income.</P>
            <P>ii. The source of income to be used as the basis for repaying the credit requested, which could disclose that it is the income of a spouse.</P>
            <P>iii. Whether any obligation disclosed by the applicant has a co-obligor, which could disclose that the co-obligor is a spouse or former spouse.</P>

            <P>3. <E T="03">Specific inquiry about sources of income.</E> A creditor need not give the disclosure if the inquiry about income is specific and worded in a way that is unlikely to lead the applicant to disclose the fact that income is derived from alimony, child support, or separate maintenance payments. For example, an application form that asks about specific types of income such as salary, wages, or investment income need not include the disclosure.</P>

            <P>
              <E T="03">6(a) General rule concerning use of information.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">General.</E> When evaluating an application for credit, a creditor generally may consider any information obtained. However, a creditor may not consider in its evaluation of creditworthiness any information that it is barred by § 1002.5 from obtaining or from using for any purpose other than to conduct a self-test under § 1002.15.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Effects test.</E> The effects test is a judicial doctrine that was developed in a series of employment cases decided by the U.S. Supreme Court under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e <E T="03">et seq.,</E>) and the burdens of proof for such employment cases were codified by Congress in the Civil <PRTPAGE P="65"/>Rights Act of 1991 (42 U.S.C. 2000e-2). Congressional intent that this doctrine apply to the credit area is documented in the Senate Report that accompanied H.R. 6516, No. 94-589, pp. 4-5; and in the House Report that accompanied H.R. 6516, No. 94-210, p.5. The Act and regulation may prohibit a creditor practice that is discriminatory in effect because it has a disproportionately negative impact on a prohibited basis, even though the creditor has no intent to discriminate and the practice appears neutral on its face, unless the creditor practice meets a legitimate business need that cannot reasonably be achieved as well by means that are less disparate in their impact. For example, requiring that applicants have income in excess of a certain amount to qualify for an overdraft line of credit could mean that women and minority applicants will be rejected at a higher rate than men and nonminority applicants. If there is a demonstrable relationship between the income requirement and creditworthiness for the level of credit involved, however, use of the income standard would likely be permissible.</P>

            </P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Paragraph 6(b)(1).</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Prohibited basis</E>—special purpose credit. In a special purpose credit program, a creditor may consider a prohibited basis to determine whether the applicant possesses a characteristic needed for eligibility. (See § 1002.8.)</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Paragraph 6(b)(2).</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Favoring the elderly.</E> Any system of evaluating creditworthiness may favor a credit applicant who is age 62 or older. A credit program that offers more favorable credit terms to applicants age 62 or older is also permissible; a program that offers more favorable credit terms to applicants at an age lower than 62 is permissible only if it meets the special-purpose credit requirements of § 1002.8.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Consideration of age in a credit scoring system.</E> Age may be taken directly into account in a credit scoring system that is “demonstrably and statistically sound,” as defined in § 1002.2(p), with one limitation: Applicants age 62 years or older must be treated at least as favorably as applicants who are under age 62. If age is scored by assigning points to an applicant's age category, elderly applicants must receive the same or a greater number of points as the most favored class of nonelderly applicants.</P>
            <P>i. <E T="03">Age-split scorecards.</E> Some credit systems segment the population and use different scorecards based on the age of an applicant. In such a system, one card may cover a narrow age range (for example, applicants in their twenties or younger) who are evaluated under attributes predictive for that age group. A second card may cover all other applicants, who are evaluated under the attributes predictive for that broader class. When a system uses a card covering a wide age range that encompasses elderly applicants, the credit scoring system is not deemed to score age. Thus, the system does not raise the issue of assigning a negative factor or value to the age of elderly applicants. But if a system segments the population by age into multiple scorecards, and includes elderly applicants in a narrower age range, the credit scoring system does score age. To comply with the Act and regulation in such a case, the creditor must ensure that the system does not assign a negative factor or value to the age of elderly applicants as a class.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Consideration of age in a judgmental system.</E> In a judgmental system, defined in § 1002.2(t), a creditor may not decide whether to extend credit or set the terms and conditions of credit based on age or information related exclusively to age. Age or age-related information may be considered only in evaluating other “pertinent elements of creditworthiness” that are drawn from the particular facts and circumstances concerning the applicant. For example, a creditor may not reject an application or terminate an account because the applicant is 60 years old. But a creditor that uses a judgmental system may relate the applicant's age to other information about the applicant that the creditor considers in evaluating creditworthiness. As the following examples illustrate, the evaluation must be made in an individualized, case-by-case manner:</P>
            <P>i. A creditor may consider the applicant's occupation and length of time to retirement to ascertain whether the applicant's income (including retirement income) will support the extension of credit to its maturity.</P>
            <P>ii. A creditor may consider the adequacy of any security offered when the term of the credit extension exceeds the life expectancy of the applicant and the cost of realizing on the collateral could exceed the applicant's equity. An elderly applicant might not qualify for a 5 percent down, 30-year mortgage loan but might qualify with a larger downpayment or a shorter loan maturity.</P>
            <P>iii. A creditor may consider the applicant's age to assess the significance of length of employment (a young applicant may have just entered the job market) or length of time at an address (an elderly applicant may recently have retired and moved from a long-term residence).</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Consideration of age in a reverse mortgage.</E> A reverse mortgage is a home-secured loan in which the borrower receives payments from the creditor, and does not become obligated to repay these amounts (other than in the case of default) until the borrower dies, moves permanently from the home, or transfers title to the home, or upon a specified maturity date. Disbursements to the borrower under a reverse mortgage typically are determined by considering the value of the <PRTPAGE P="66"/>borrower's home, the current interest rate, and the borrower's life expectancy. A reverse mortgage program that requires borrowers to be age 62 or older is permissible under § 1002.6(b)(2)(iv). In addition, under § 1002.6(b)(2)(iii), a creditor may consider a borrower's age to evaluate a pertinent element of creditworthiness, such as the amount of the credit or monthly payments that the borrower will receive, or the estimated repayment date.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Consideration of age in a combined system.</E> A creditor using a credit scoring system that qualifies as “empirically derived” under § 1002.2(p) may consider other factors (such as a credit report or the applicant's cash flow) on a judgmental basis. Doing so will not negate the classification of the credit scoring component of the combined system as “demonstrably and statistically sound.” While age could be used in the credit scoring portion, however, in the judgmental portion age may not be considered directly. It may be used only for the purpose of determining a “pertinent element of creditworthiness.” (See comment 6(b)(2)-3.)</P>
            <P>6. <E T="03">Consideration of public assistance.</E> When considering income derived from a public assistance program, a creditor may take into account, for example:</P>
            <P>i. The length of time an applicant will likely remain eligible to receive such income.</P>
            <P>ii. Whether the applicant will continue to qualify for benefits based on the status of the applicant's dependents (as in the case of Temporary Aid to Needy Families, or social security payments to a minor).</P>
            <P>iii. Whether the creditor can attach or garnish the income to assure payment of the debt in the event of default.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Paragraph 6(b)(5).</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Consideration of an individual applicant.</E> A creditor must evaluate income derived from part-time employment, alimony, child support, separate maintenance payments, retirement benefits, or public assistance on an individual basis, not on the basis of aggregate statistics; and must assess its reliability or unreliability by analyzing the applicant's actual circumstances, not by analyzing statistical measures derived from a group.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Payments consistently made.</E> In determining the likelihood of consistent payments of alimony, child support, or separate maintenance, a creditor may consider factors such as whether payments are received pursuant to a written agreement or court decree; the length of time that the payments have been received; whether the payments are regularly received by the applicant; the availability of court or other procedures to compel payment; and the creditworthiness of the payor, including the credit history of the payor when it is available to the creditor.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Consideration of income.</E>
            </P>
            <P>i. A creditor need not consider income at all in evaluating creditworthiness. If a creditor does consider income, there are several acceptable methods, whether in a credit scoring or a judgmental system:</P>
            <P>A. A creditor may score or take into account the total sum of all income stated by the applicant without taking steps to evaluate the income for reliability.</P>
            <P>B. A creditor may evaluate each component of the applicant's income, and then score or take into account income determined to be reliable separately from other income; or the creditor may disregard that portion of income that is not reliable when it aggregates reliable income.</P>
            <P>C. A creditor that does not evaluate all income components for reliability must treat as reliable any component of protected income that is not evaluated.</P>
            <P>ii. In considering the separate components of an applicant's income, the creditor may not automatically discount or exclude from consideration any protected income. Any discounting or exclusion must be based on the applicant's actual circumstances.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Part-time employment, sources of income.</E> A creditor may score or take into account the fact that an applicant has more than one source of earned income—a full-time and a part-time job or two part-time jobs. A creditor may also score or treat earned income from a secondary source differently than earned income from a primary source. The creditor may not, however, score or otherwise take into account the number of sources for income such as retirement income, social security, supplemental security income, and alimony. Nor may the creditor treat negatively the fact that an applicant's only earned income is derived from, for example, a part-time job.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Paragraph 6(b)(6).</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Types of credit references.</E> A creditor may restrict the types of credit history and credit references that it will consider, provided that the restrictions are applied to all credit applicants without regard to sex, marital status, or any other prohibited basis. On the applicant's request, however, a creditor must consider credit information not reported through a credit bureau when the information relates to the same types of credit references and history that the creditor would consider if reported through a credit bureau.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Paragraph 6(b)(7).</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">National origin—immigration status.</E> The applicant's immigration status and ties to the community (such as employment and continued residence in the area) could have a bearing on a creditor's ability to obtain repayment. Accordingly, the creditor may consider immigration status and differentiate, for example, between a noncitizen who is a long-time resident with permanent resident status and a noncitizen who is temporarily in this country on a student visa.<PRTPAGE P="67"/>
            </P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">National origin—citizenship.</E> A denial of credit on the ground that an applicant is not a United States citizen is not per se discrimination based on national origin.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Paragraph 6(b)(8).</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Prohibited basis—marital status.</E> A creditor may consider the marital status of an applicant or joint applicant for the purpose of ascertaining the creditor's rights and remedies applicable to the particular extension of credit. For example, in a secured transaction involving real property, a creditor could take into account whether state law gives the applicant's spouse an interest in the property being offered as collateral.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 1002.7—Rules Concerning Extensions of Credit</HD>
            <P>7(a) Individual accounts.</P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Open-end credit—authorized user.</E> A creditor may not require a creditworthy applicant seeking an individual credit account to provide additional signatures. But the creditor may condition the designation of an authorized user by the account holder on the authorized user's becoming contractually liable for the account, as long as the creditor does not differentiate on any prohibited basis in imposing this requirement.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Open-end credit—choice of authorized user.</E> A creditor that permits an account holder to designate an authorized user may not restrict this designation on a prohibited basis. For example, if the creditor allows the designation of spouses as authorized users, the creditor may not refuse to accept a non-spouse as an authorized user.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Overdraft authority on transaction accounts.</E> If a transaction account (such as a checking account or NOW account) includes an overdraft line of credit, the creditor may require that all persons authorized to draw on the transaction account assume liability for any overdraft.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">7(b) Designation of name.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Single name on account.</E> A creditor may require that joint applicants on an account designate a single name for purposes of administering the account and that a single name be embossed on any credit cards issued on the account. But the creditor may not require that the name be the husband's name. (See § 1002.10 for rules governing the furnishing of credit history on accounts held by spouses.)</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">7(c) Action concerning existing open-end accounts.</E>

            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Termination coincidental with marital status change.</E> When an account holder's marital status changes, a creditor generally may not terminate the account unless it has evidence that the account holder is now unable or unwilling to repay. But the creditor may terminate an account on which both spouses are jointly liable, even if the action coincides with a change in marital status, when one or both spouses:</P>
            <P>i. Repudiate responsibility for future charges on the joint account.</P>
            <P>ii. Request separate accounts in their own names.</P>
            <P>iii. Request that the joint account be closed.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Updating information.</E> A creditor may periodically request updated information from applicants but may not use events related to a prohibited basis—such as an applicant's retirement or reaching a particular age, or a change in name or marital status—to trigger such a request.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Paragraph 7(c)(2).</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Procedure pending reapplication.</E> A creditor may require a reapplication from an account holder, even when there is no evidence of unwillingness or inability to repay, if (1) the credit was based on the qualifications of a person who is no longer available to support the credit and (2) the creditor has information indicating that the account holder's income may be insufficient to support the credit. While a reapplication is pending, the creditor must allow the account holder full access to the account under the existing contract terms. The creditor may specify a reasonable time period within which the account holder must submit the required information.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">7(d) Signature of spouse or other person.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Qualified applicant.</E> The signature rules ensure that qualified applicants are able to obtain credit in their own names. Thus, when an applicant requests individual credit, a creditor generally may not require the signature of another person unless the creditor has first determined that the applicant alone does not qualify for the credit requested.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Unqualified applicant.</E> When an applicant requests individual credit but does not meet a creditor's standards, the creditor may require a cosigner, guarantor, endorser, or similar party—but cannot require that it be the spouse. (See commentary to §§ 1002.7(d)(5) and (6).)</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Paragraph 7(d)(1).</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Signature of another person.</E> It is impermissible for a creditor to require an applicant who is individually creditworthy to provide a cosigner—even if the creditor applies the requirement without regard to sex, marital status, or any other prohibited basis. (But see comment 7(d)(6)-1 concerning guarantors of closely held corporations.)</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Joint applicant.</E> The term “joint applicant” refers to someone who applies contemporaneously with the applicant for shared or joint credit. It does not refer to someone whose signature is required by the creditor as a condition for granting the credit requested.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Evidence of joint application.</E> A person's intent to be a joint applicant must be evidenced at the time of application. Signatures <PRTPAGE P="68"/>on a promissory note may not be used to show intent to apply for joint credit. On the other hand, signatures or initials on a credit application affirming applicants' intent to apply for joint credit may be used to establish intent to apply for joint credit. (See appendix B.) The method used to establish intent must be distinct from the means used by individuals to affirm the accuracy of information. For example, signatures on a joint financial statement affirming the veracity of information are not sufficient to establish intent to apply for joint credit.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Paragraph 7(d)(2).</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Jointly owned property.</E> If an applicant requests unsecured credit, does not own sufficient separate property, and relies on joint property to establish creditworthiness, the creditor must value the applicant's interest in the jointly owned property. A creditor may not request that a nonapplicant joint owner sign any instrument as a condition of the credit extension unless the applicant's interest does not support the amount and terms of the credit sought.</P>
            <P>i. <E T="03">Valuation of applicant's interest.</E> In determining the value of an applicant's interest in jointly owned property, a creditor may consider factors such as the form of ownership and the property's susceptibility to attachment, execution, severance, or partition; the value of the applicant's interest after such action; and the cost associated with the action. This determination must be based on the existing form of ownership, and not on the possibility of a subsequent change. For example, in determining whether a married applicant's interest in jointly owned property is sufficient to satisfy the creditor's standards of creditworthiness for individual credit, a creditor may not consider that the applicant's separate property could be transferred into tenancy by the entirety after consummation. Similarly, a creditor may not consider the possibility that the couple may divorce. Accordingly, a creditor may not require the signature of the non-applicant spouse in these or similar circumstances.</P>
            <P>ii. <E T="03">Other options to support credit.</E> If the applicant's interest in jointly owned property does not support the amount and terms of credit sought, the creditor may offer the applicant other options to qualify for the extension of credit. For example:</P>
            <P>A. Providing a co-signer or other party (§ 1002.7(d)(5));</P>
            <P>B. Requesting that the credit be granted on a secured basis (§ 1002.7(d)(4)); or</P>
            <P>C. Providing the signature of the joint owner on an instrument that ensures access to the property in the event of the applicant's death or default, but does not impose personal liability unless necessary under state law (such as a limited guarantee). A creditor may not routinely require, however, that a joint owner sign an instrument (such as a quitclaim deed) that would result in the forfeiture of the joint owner's interest in the property.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Need for signature—reasonable belief.</E> A creditor's reasonable belief as to what instruments need to be signed by a person other than the applicant should be supported by a thorough review of pertinent statutory and decisional law or an opinion of the state attorney general.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Paragraph 7(d)(3).</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Residency.</E> In assessing the creditworthiness of a person who applies for credit in a community property state, a creditor may assume that the applicant is a resident of the state unless the applicant indicates otherwise.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Paragraph 7(d)(4).</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Creation of enforceable lien.</E> Some state laws require that both spouses join in executing any instrument by which real property is encumbered. If an applicant offers such property as security for credit, a creditor may require the applicant's spouse to sign the instruments necessary to create a valid security interest in the property. The creditor may not require the spouse to sign the note evidencing the credit obligation if signing only the mortgage or other security agreement is sufficient to make the property available to satisfy the debt in the event of default. However, if under state law both spouses must sign the note to create an enforceable lien, the creditor may require the signatures.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Need for signature—reasonable belief.</E> Generally, a signature to make the secured property available will only be needed on a security agreement. A creditor's reasonable belief that, to ensure access to the property, the spouse's signature is needed on an instrument that imposes personal liability should be supported by a thorough review of pertinent statutory and decisional law or an opinion of the state attorney general.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Integrated instruments.</E> When a creditor uses an integrated instrument that combines the note and the security agreement, the spouse cannot be asked to sign the integrated instrument if the signature is only needed to grant a security interest. But the spouse could be asked to sign an integrated instrument that makes clear—for example, by a legend placed next to the spouse's signature—that the spouse's signature is only to grant a security interest and that signing the instrument does not impose personal liability.</P>

            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Qualifications of additional parties.</E> In establishing guidelines for eligibility of guarantors, cosigners, or similar additional parties, a creditor may restrict the applicant's choice of additional parties but may not discriminate on the basis of sex, marital status, or any other prohibited basis. For example, <PRTPAGE P="69"/>the creditor could require that the additional party live in the creditor's market area.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Reliance on income of another person</E>—<E T="03">individual credit.</E> An applicant who requests individual credit relying on the income of another person (including a spouse in a non-community property state) may be required to provide the signature of the other person to make the income available to pay the debt. In community property states, the signature of a spouse may be required if the applicant relies on the spouse's separate income. If the applicant relies on the spouse's future earnings that as a matter of state law cannot be characterized as community property until earned, the creditor may require the spouse's signature, but need not do so—even if it is the creditor's practice to require the signature when an applicant relies on the future earnings of a person other than a spouse. (See § 1002.6(c) on consideration of state property laws.)</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Renewals.</E> If the borrower's creditworthiness is reevaluated when a credit obligation is renewed, the creditor must determine whether an additional party is still warranted and, if not warranted, release the additional party.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Paragraph 7(d)(6).</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Guarantees.</E> A guarantee on an extension of credit is part of a credit transaction and therefore subject to the regulation. A creditor may require the personal guarantee of the partners, directors, or officers of a business, and the shareholders of a closely held corporation, even if the business or corporation is creditworthy. The requirement must be based on the guarantor's relationship with the business or corporation, however, and not on a prohibited basis. For example, a creditor may not require guarantees only for women-owned or minority-owned businesses. Similarly, a creditor may not require guarantees only of the married officers of a business or the married shareholders of a closely held corporation.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Spousal guarantees.</E> The rules in § 1002.7(d) bar a creditor from requiring the signature of a guarantor's spouse just as they bar the creditor from requiring the signature of an applicant's spouse. For example, although a creditor may require all officers of a closely held corporation to personally guarantee a corporate loan, the creditor may not automatically require that spouses of married officers also sign the guarantee. If an evaluation of the financial circumstances of an officer indicates that an additional signature is necessary, however, the creditor may require the signature of another person in appropriate circumstances in accordance with § 1002.7(d)(2).</P>

            <P>2. <E T="03">Insurance information.</E> A creditor may obtain information about an applicant's age, sex, or marital status for insurance purposes. The information may only be used for determining eligibility and premium rates for insurance, however, and not in making the credit decision.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 1002.8—Special Purpose Credit Programs</HD>
            <P>
              <E T="03">8(a) Standards for programs.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Determining qualified programs.</E> The Bureau does not determine whether individual programs qualify for special purpose credit status, or whether a particular program benefits an “economically disadvantaged class of persons.” The agency or creditor administering or offering the loan program must make these decisions regarding the status of its program.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Compliance with a program authorized by Federal or state law.</E> A creditor does not violate Regulation B when it complies in good faith with a regulation promulgated by a government agency implementing a special purpose credit program under § 1002.8(a)(1). It is the agency's responsibility to promulgate a regulation that is consistent with Federal and state law.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Expressly authorized.</E> Credit programs authorized by Federal or state law include programs offered pursuant to Federal, state, or local statute, regulation or ordinance, or pursuant to judicial or administrative order.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Creditor liability.</E> A refusal to grant credit to an applicant is not a violation of the Act or regulation if the applicant does not meet the eligibility requirements under a special purpose credit program.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Determining need.</E> In designing a special purpose credit program under § 1002.8(a), a for-profit organization must determine that the program will benefit a class of people who would otherwise be denied credit or would receive it on less favorable terms. This determination can be based on a broad analysis using the organization's own research or data from outside sources, including governmental reports and studies. For example, a creditor might design new products to reach consumers who would not meet, or have not met, its traditional standards of creditworthiness due to such factors as credit inexperience or the use of credit sources that may not report to consumer reporting agencies. Or, a bank could review Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data along with demographic data for its assessment area and conclude that there is a need for a special purpose credit program for low-income minority borrowers.</P>
            <P>6. <E T="03">Elements of the program.</E> The written plan must contain information that supports the need for the particular program. The plan also must either state a specific period of <PRTPAGE P="70"/>time for which the program will last, or contain a statement regarding when the program will be reevaluated to determine if there is a continuing need for it.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">8(b) Rules in other sections.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Applicability of rules.</E> A creditor that rejects an application because the applicant does not meet the eligibility requirements (common characteristic or financial need, for example) must nevertheless notify the applicant of action taken as required by § 1002.9.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">8(c) Special rule concerning requests and use of information.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Request of prohibited basis information.</E> This section permits a creditor to request and consider certain information that would otherwise be prohibited by §§ 1002.5 and 1002.6 to determine an applicant's eligibility for a particular program.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Examples.</E> Examples of programs under which the creditor can ask for and consider information about a prohibited basis are:</P>
            <P>i. Energy conservation programs to assist the elderly, for which the creditor must consider the applicant's age.</P>
            <P>ii. Programs under a Minority Enterprise Small Business Investment Corporation, for which a creditor must consider the applicant's minority status.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">8(d) Special rule in the case of financial need.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Request of prohibited basis information.</E> This section permits a creditor to request and consider certain information that would otherwise be prohibited by §§ 1002.5 and 1002.6, and to require signatures that would otherwise be prohibited by § 1002.7(d).</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Examples.</E> Examples of programs in which financial need is a criterion are:</P>
            <P>i. Subsidized housing programs for low-to moderate-income households, for which a creditor may have to consider the applicant's receipt of alimony or child support, the spouse's or parents' income, etc.</P>
            <P>ii. Student loan programs based on the family's financial need, for which a creditor may have to consider the spouse's or parents' financial resources.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Student loans.</E> In a guaranteed student loan program, a creditor may obtain the signature of a parent as a guarantor when required by Federal or state law or agency regulation, or when the student does not meet the creditor's standards of creditworthiness. (See §§ 1002.7(d)(1) and (5).) The creditor may not require an additional signature when a student has a work or credit history that satisfies the creditor's standards.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 1002.9—Notifications</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Use of the term adverse action.</E> The regulation does not require that a creditor use the term adverse action in communicating to an applicant that a request for an extension of credit has not been approved. In notifying an applicant of adverse action as defined by § 1002.2(c)(1), a creditor may use any words or phrases that describe the action taken on the application.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Expressly withdrawn applications.</E> When an applicant expressly withdraws a credit application, the creditor is not required to comply with the notification requirements under § 1002.9. (The creditor must comply, however, with the record retention requirements of the regulation. See § 1002.12(b)(3).)</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">When notification occurs.</E> Notification occurs when a creditor delivers or mails a notice to the applicant's last known address or, in the case of an oral notification, when the creditor communicates the credit decision to the applicant.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Location of notice.</E> The notifications required under § 1002.9 may appear on either or both sides of a form or letter.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Prequalification requests.</E> Whether a creditor must provide a notice of action taken for a prequalification request depends on the creditor's response to the request, as discussed in comment 2(f)-3. For instance, a creditor may treat the request as an inquiry if the creditor evaluates specific information about the consumer and tells the consumer the loan amount, rate, and other terms of credit the consumer could qualify for under various loan programs, explaining the process the consumer must follow to submit a mortgage application and the information the creditor will analyze in reaching a credit decision. On the other hand, a creditor has treated a request as an application, and is subject to the adverse action notice requirements of § 1002.9 if, after evaluating information, the creditor decides that it will not approve the request and communicates that decision to the consumer. For example, if the creditor tells the consumer that it would not approve an application for a mortgage because of a bankruptcy in the consumer's record, the creditor has denied an application for credit.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">9(a) Notification of action taken, ECOA notice, and statement of specific reasons.</E>
            </P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Paragraph 9(a)(1).</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Timing of notice—when an application is complete.</E> Once a creditor has obtained all the information it normally considers in making a credit decision, the application is complete and the creditor has 30 days in which to notify the applicant of the credit decision. (See also comment 2(f)-6.)</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Notification of approval.</E> Notification of approval may be express or by implication. For example, the creditor will satisfy the notification requirement when it gives the applicant the credit card, money, property, or services requested.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Incomplete application—denial for incompleteness.</E> When an application is incomplete regarding information that the applicant can provide and the creditor lacks sufficient data for a credit decision, the creditor may deny the application giving as the reason for denial that the application is incomplete. The <PRTPAGE P="71"/>creditor has the option, alternatively, of providing a notice of incompleteness under § 1002.9(c).</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Incomplete application—denial for reasons other than incompleteness.</E> When an application is missing information but provides sufficient data for a credit decision, the creditor may evaluate the application, make its credit decision, and notify the applicant accordingly. If credit is denied, the applicant must be given the specific reasons for the credit denial (or notice of the right to receive the reasons); in this instance missing information or “incomplete application” cannot be given as the reason for the denial.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Length of counteroffer.</E> Section 1002.9(a)(1)(iv) does not require a creditor to hold a counteroffer open for 90 days or any other particular length of time.</P>
            <P>6. <E T="03">Counteroffer combined with adverse action notice.</E> A creditor that gives the applicant a combined counteroffer and adverse action notice that complies with § 1002.9(a)(2) need not send a second adverse action notice if the applicant does not accept the counteroffer. A sample of a combined notice is contained in form C-4 of appendix C to the regulation.</P>
            <P>7. <E T="03">Denial of a telephone application.</E> When an application is made by telephone and adverse action is taken, the creditor must request the applicant's name and address in order to provide written notification under this section. If the applicant declines to provide that information, then the creditor has no further notification responsibility.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Paragraph 9(a)(3).</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Coverage.</E> In determining which rules in this paragraph apply to a given business credit application, a creditor may rely on the applicant's assertion about the revenue size of the business. (Applications to start a business are governed by the rules in § 1002.9(a)(3)(i).) If an applicant applies for credit as a sole proprietor, the revenues of the sole proprietorship will determine which rules govern the application. However, if an applicant applies for business credit as an individual, the rules in § 1002.9(a)(3)(i) apply unless the application is for trade or similar credit.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Trade credit.</E> The term trade credit generally is limited to a financing arrangement that involves a buyer and a seller—such as a supplier who finances the sale of equipment, supplies, or inventory; it does not apply to an extension of credit by a bank or other financial institution for the financing of such items.</P>
            <P>3<E T="03">. Factoring.</E> Factoring refers to a purchase of accounts receivable, and thus is not subject to the Act or regulation. If there is a credit extension incident to the factoring arrangement, the notification rules in § 1002.9(a)(3)(ii) apply, as do other relevant sections of the Act and regulation.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Manner of compliance.</E> In complying with the notice provisions of the Act and regulation, creditors offering business credit may follow the rules governing consumer credit. Similarly, creditors may elect to treat all business credit the same (irrespective of revenue size) by providing notice in accordance with § 1002.9(a)(3)(i).</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Timing of notification.</E> A creditor subject to § 1002.9(a)(3)(ii)(A) is required to notify a business credit applicant, orally or in writing, of action taken on an application within a reasonable time of receiving a completed application. Notice provided in accordance with the timing requirements of § 1002.9(a)(1) is deemed reasonable in all instances.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">9(b) Form of ECOA notice and statement of specific reasons.</E>
            </P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Paragraph 9(b)(1).</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Substantially similar notice.</E> The ECOA notice sent with a notification of a credit denial or other adverse action will comply with the regulation if it is “substantially similar” to the notice contained in § 1002.9(b)(1). For example, a creditor may add a reference to the fact that the ECOA permits age to be considered in certain credit scoring systems, or add a reference to a similar state statute or regulation and to a state enforcement agency.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Paragraph 9(b)(2).</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Number of specific reasons.</E> A creditor must disclose the principal reasons for denying an application or taking other adverse action. The regulation does not mandate that a specific number of reasons be disclosed, but disclosure of more than four reasons is not likely to be helpful to the applicant.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Source of specific reasons.</E> The specific reasons disclosed under §§ 1002.9(a)(2) and (b)(2) must relate to and accurately describe the factors actually considered or scored by a creditor.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Description of reasons.</E> A creditor need not describe how or why a factor adversely affected an applicant. For example, the notice may say “length of residence” rather than “too short a period of residence.”</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Credit scoring system.</E> If a creditor bases the denial or other adverse action on a credit scoring system, the reasons disclosed must relate only to those factors actually scored in the system. Moreover, no factor that was a principal reason for adverse action may be excluded from disclosure. The creditor must disclose the actual reasons for denial (for example, “age of automobile”) even if the relationship of that factor to predicting creditworthiness may not be clear to the applicant.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Credit scoring</E>—<E T="03">method for selecting reasons.</E> The regulation does not require that any one method be used for selecting reasons for a credit denial or other adverse action that is based on a credit scoring system. Various methods will meet the requirements <PRTPAGE P="72"/>of the regulation. One method is to identify the factors for which the applicant's score fell furthest below the average score for each of those factors achieved by applicants whose total score was at or slightly above the minimum passing score. Another method is to identify the factors for which the applicant's score fell furthest below the average score for each of those factors achieved by all applicants. These average scores could be calculated during the development or use of the system. Any other method that produces results substantially similar to either of these methods is also acceptable under the regulation.</P>
            <P>6. <E T="03">Judgmental system.</E> If a creditor uses a judgmental system, the reasons for the denial or other adverse action must relate to those factors in the applicant's record actually reviewed by the person making the decision.</P>
            <P>7. <E T="03">Combined credit scoring and judgmental system.</E> If a creditor denies an application based on a credit evaluation system that employs both credit scoring and judgmental components, the reasons for the denial must come from the component of the system that the applicant failed. For example, if a creditor initially credit scores an application and denies the credit request as a result of that scoring, the reasons disclosed to the applicant must relate to the factors scored in the system. If the application passes the credit scoring stage but the creditor then denies the credit request based on a judgmental assessment of the applicant's record, the reasons disclosed must relate to the factors reviewed judgmentally, even if the factors were also considered in the credit scoring component. If the application is not approved or denied as a result of the credit scoring, but falls into a gray band, and the creditor performs a judgmental assessment and denies the credit after that assessment, the reasons disclosed must come from both components of the system. The same result applies where a judgmental assessment is the first component of the combined system. As provided in comment 9(b)(2)-1, disclosure of more than a combined total of four reasons is not likely to be helpful to the applicant.</P>
            <P>8. <E T="03">Automatic denial.</E> Some credit decision methods contain features that call for automatic denial because of one or more negative factors in the applicant's record (such as the applicant's previous bad credit history with that creditor, the applicant's declaration of bankruptcy, or the fact that the applicant is a minor). When a creditor denies the credit request because of an automatic-denial factor, the creditor must disclose that specific factor.</P>
            <P>9. <E T="03">Combined ECOA-FCRA disclosures.</E> The ECOA requires disclosure of the principal reasons for denying or taking other adverse action on an application for an extension of credit. The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) requires a creditor to disclose when it has based its decision in whole or in part on information from a source other than the applicant or its own files. Disclosing that a credit report was obtained and used in the denial of the application, as the FCRA requires, does not satisfy the ECOA requirement to disclose specific reasons. For example, if the applicant's credit history reveals delinquent credit obligations and the application is denied for that reason, to satisfy § 1002.9(b)(2) the creditor must disclose that the application was denied because of the applicant's delinquent credit obligations. The FCRA also requires a creditor to disclose, as applicable, a credit score it used in taking adverse action along with related information, including up to four key factors that adversely affected the consumer's credit score (or up to five factors if the number of inquiries made with respect to that consumer report is a key factor). Disclosing the key factors that adversely affected the consumer's credit score does not satisfy the ECOA requirement to disclose specific reasons for denying or taking other adverse action on an application or extension of credit. Sample forms C-1 through C-5 of appendix C of the regulation provide for both the ECOA and FCRA disclosures. See also comment 9(b)(2)-1.</P>

            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Oral inquiries for additional information.</E> If an applicant fails to provide the information in response to an oral request, a creditor must send a written notice to the applicant within the 30-day period specified in §§ 1002.9(c)(1) and (2). If the applicant provides the information, the creditor must take action on the application and notify the applicant in accordance with § 1002.9(a).</P>

              <E T="03">9(g) Applications submitted through a third party.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Third parties.</E> The notification of adverse action may be given by one of the creditors to whom an application was submitted, or by a noncreditor third party. If one notification is provided on behalf of multiple creditors, the notice must contain the name and address of each creditor. The notice must either disclose the applicant's right to a statement of specific reasons within 30 days, or give the primary reasons each creditor relied upon in taking the adverse action—clearly <PRTPAGE P="73"/>indicating which reasons relate to which creditor.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Third party notice—enforcement agency.</E> If a single adverse action notice is being provided to an applicant on behalf of several creditors and they are under the jurisdiction of different Federal enforcement agencies, the notice need not name each agency; disclosure of any one of them will suffice.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Third-party notice—liability.</E> When a notice is to be provided through a third party, a creditor is not liable for an act or omission of the third party that constitutes a violation of the regulation if the creditor accurately and in a timely manner provided the third party with the information necessary for the notification and maintains reasonable procedures adapted to prevent such violations.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 1002.10—Furnishing of Credit Information</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Scope.</E> The requirements of § 1002.10 for designating and reporting credit information apply only to consumer credit transactions. Moreover, they apply only to creditors that opt to furnish credit information to credit bureaus or to other creditors; there is no requirement that a creditor furnish credit information on its accounts.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Reporting on all accounts.</E> The requirements of § 1002.10 apply only to accounts held or used by spouses. However, a creditor has the option to designate all joint accounts (or all accounts with an authorized user) to reflect the participation of both parties, whether or not the accounts are held by persons married to each other.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Designating accounts.</E> In designating accounts and reporting credit information, a creditor need not distinguish between accounts on which the spouse is an authorized user and accounts on which the spouse is a contractually liable party.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">File and index systems.</E> The regulation does not require the creation or maintenance of separate files in the name of each participant on a joint or user account, or require any other particular system of recordkeeping or indexing. It requires only that a creditor be able to report information in the name of each spouse on accounts covered by § 1002.10. Thus, if a creditor receives a credit inquiry about the wife, it should be able to locate her credit file without asking the husband's name.</P>

            <P>2. <E T="03">Request to change designation of account.</E> A request to change the manner in which information concerning an account is furnished does not alter the legal liability of either spouse on the account and does not require a creditor to change the name in which the account is maintained.</P>

            <P>1. <E T="03">Preemption determination—New York.</E> The Bureau recognizes state law preemption determinations made by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System prior to July 21, 2011, until and unless the Bureau makes and publishes any contrary determination. The Board of Governors determined that the following provisions in the state law of New York are preempted by the Federal law, effective November 11, 1988:</P>
            <P>i. Article 15, section 296a(1)(b). Unlawful discriminatory practices in relation to credit on the basis of race, creed, color, national origin, age, sex, marital status, or disability. This provision is preempted to the extent that it bars taking a prohibited basis into account when establishing eligibility for certain special-purpose credit programs.</P>
            <P>ii. Article 15, section 296a(1)(c). Unlawful discriminatory practice to make any record or inquiry based on race, creed, color, national origin, age, sex, marital status, or disability. This provision is preempted to the extent that it bars a creditor from requesting and considering information regarding the particular characteristics (for example, race, national origin, or sex) required for eligibility for special-purpose credit programs.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Preemption determination—Ohio.</E> The Bureau recognizes state law preemption determinations made by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System prior to July 21, 2011, until and unless the Bureau makes and publishes any contrary determination. The Board of Governors determined that the following provision in the state law of Ohio is preempted by the Federal law, effective July 23, 1990:</P>
            <P>i. Section 4112.021(B)(1)—Unlawful discriminatory practices in credit transactions. This provision is preempted to the extent that it bars asking or favorably considering the age of an elderly applicant; prohibits the consideration of age in a credit scoring system; permits without limitation the consideration of age in real estate transactions; and limits the consideration of age in special-purpose credit programs to certain government-sponsored programs identified in the state law.</P>

            <P>
              <E T="03">12(a) Retention of prohibited information.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Receipt of prohibited information.</E> Unless the creditor specifically requested such information, a creditor does not violate this section when it receives prohibited information from a consumer reporting agency.<PRTPAGE P="74"/>
            </P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Use of retained information.</E> Although a creditor may keep in its files prohibited information as provided in § 1002.12(a), the creditor may use the information in evaluating credit applications only if permitted to do so by § 1002.6.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">12(b) Preservation of records.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Copies.</E> Copies of the original record include carbon copies, photocopies, microfilm or microfiche copies, or copies produced by any other accurate retrieval system, such as documents stored and reproduced by computer. A creditor that uses a computerized or mechanized system need not keep a paper copy of a document (for example, of an adverse action notice) if it can regenerate all pertinent information in a timely manner for examination or other purposes.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Computerized decisions.</E> A creditor that enters information items from a written application into a computerized or mechanized system and makes the credit decision mechanically, based only on the items of information entered into the system, may comply with § 1002.12(b) by retaining the information actually entered. It is not required to store the complete written application, nor is it required to enter the remaining items of information into the system. If the transaction is subject to § 1002.13 or the creditor is collecting information pursuant to § 1002.5(a)(4), however, the creditor is required to enter and retain the data on personal characteristics in order to comply with the requirements of that section.</P>

            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Withdrawn and brokered applications.</E> In most cases, the 25-month retention period for applications runs from the date a notification is sent to the applicant granting or denying the credit requested. In certain transactions, a creditor is not obligated to provide a notice of the action taken. (See, for example, comment 9-2.) In such cases, the 25-month requirement runs from the date of application, as when:</P>
            <P>i. An application is withdrawn by the applicant.</P>
            <P>ii. An application is submitted to more than one creditor on behalf of the applicant, and the application is approved by one of the other creditors.</P>

              <E T="03">12(b)(6) Self-tests.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. The rule requires all written or recorded information about a self-test to be retained for 25 months after a self-test has been completed. For this purpose, a self-test is completed after the creditor has obtained the results and made a determination about what corrective action, if any, is appropriate. Creditors are required to retain information about the scope of the self-test, the methodology used and time period covered by the self-test, the report or results of the self-test including any analysis or conclusions, and any corrective action taken in response to the self-test.</P>

            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Prescreened credit solicitations.</E> The rule requires creditors to retain copies of prescreened credit solicitations. For purposes of this part, a prescreened solicitation is an “offer of credit” as described in 15 U.S.C. 1681a(1) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. A creditor complies with this rule if it retains a copy of each solicitation mailing that contains different terms, such as the amount of credit offered, annual percentage rate, or annual fee.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">List of criteria.</E> A creditor must retain the list of criteria used to select potential recipients. This includes the criteria used by the creditor both to determine the potential recipients of the particular solicitation and to determine who will actually be offered credit.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Correspondence.</E> A creditor may retain correspondence relating to consumers' complaints about prescreened solicitations in any manner that is reasonably accessible and is understandable to examiners. There is no requirement to establish a separate database or set of files for such correspondence, or to match consumer complaints with specific solicitation programs.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 1002.13—Information for Monitoring Purposes</HD>
            <P>
              <E T="03">13(a) Information to be requested.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Natural person.</E> Section 1002.13 applies only to applications from natural persons.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Principal residence.</E> The requirements of § 1002.13 apply only if an application relates to a dwelling that is or will be occupied by the applicant as the principal residence. A credit application related to a vacation home or a rental unit is not covered. In the case of a two-to four-unit dwelling, the application is covered if the applicant intends to occupy one of the units as a principal residence.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Temporary financing.</E> An application for temporary financing to construct a dwelling is not subject to § 1002.13. But an application for both a temporary loan to finance construction of a dwelling and a permanent mortgage loan to take effect upon the completion of construction is subject to § 1002.13.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">New principal residence.</E> A person can have only one principal residence at a time. However, if a person buys or builds a new dwelling that will become that person's principal residence within a year or upon completion of construction, the new dwelling is considered the principal residence for purposes of § 1002.13.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Transactions not covered.</E> The information-collection requirements of this section apply to applications for credit primarily for the purchase or refinancing of a dwelling that is or will become the applicant's principal residence. Therefore, applications for credit secured by the applicant's principal <PRTPAGE P="75"/>residence but made primarily for a purpose other than the purchase or refinancing of the principal residence (such as loans for home improvement and debt consolidation) are not subject to the information-collection requirements. An application for an open-end home equity line of credit is not subject to this section unless it is readily apparent to the creditor when the application is taken that the primary purpose of the line is for the purchase or refinancing of a principal dwelling.</P>
            <P>6. <E T="03">Refinancings.</E> A refinancing occurs when an existing obligation is satisfied and replaced by a new obligation undertaken by the same borrower. A creditor that receives an application to refinance an existing extension of credit made by that creditor for the purchase of the applicant's dwelling may request the monitoring information again but is not required to do so if it was obtained in the earlier transaction.</P>
            <P>7. <E T="03">Data collection under Regulation C.</E> For applications subject to § 1002.13(a)(1), a creditor that collects information about the ethnicity, race, and sex of an applicant in compliance with the requirements of appendix B to 12 CFR part 1003 is acting in compliance with § 1002.13 concerning the collection of an applicant's ethnicity, race, and sex information. <E T="03">See also</E> comment 5(a)(2)-2.</P>
            <P>8. <E T="03">Application-by-application basis.</E> For applications subject to § 1002.13(a)(1), a creditor may choose on an application-by-application basis whether to collect aggregate information pursuant to § 1002.13(a)(1)(i)(A) or disaggregated information pursuant to § 1002.13(a)(1)(i)(B) about the ethnicity and race of the applicant.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">13(b) Obtaining of information.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Forms for collecting data.</E> A creditor may collect the information specified in § 1002.13(a) either on an application form or on a separate form referring to the application. Appendix B to this part provides for two alternative data collection model forms for use in complying with the requirements of § 1002.13(a)(1)(i) and (ii) to collect information concerning an applicant's ethnicity, race, and sex. When a creditor collects ethnicity and race information pursuant to § 1002.13(a)(1)(i)(A), the applicant must be offered the option to select more than one racial designation. When a creditor collects ethnicity and race information pursuant to § 1002.13(a)(1)(i)(B), the applicant must be offered the option to select more than one ethnicity designation and more than one racial designation.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Written applications.</E> The regulation requires written applications for the types of credit covered by § 1002.13. A creditor can satisfy this requirement by recording on paper or by means of computer the information that the applicant provides orally and that the creditor normally considers in a credit decision.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Telephone, mail applications.</E>
            </P>
            <P>i. A creditor that accepts an application by telephone or mail must request the monitoring information.</P>
            <P>ii. A creditor that accepts an application by mail need not make a special request for the monitoring information if the applicant has failed to provide it on the application form returned to the creditor.</P>
            <P>iii. If it is not evident on the face of an application that it was received by mail, telephone, or via an electronic medium, the creditor should indicate on the form or other application record how the application was received.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Video and other electronic-application processes.</E>
            </P>
            <P>i. If a creditor takes an application through an electronic medium that allows the creditor to see the applicant, the creditor must treat the application as taken in person. The creditor must note the monitoring information on the basis of visual observation or surname, if the applicant chooses not to provide the information.</P>
            <P>ii. If an applicant applies through an electronic medium without video capability, the creditor treats the application as if it were received by mail.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Applications through loan-shopping services.</E> When a creditor receives an application through an unaffiliated loan-shopping service, it does not have to request the monitoring information for purposes of the ECOA or Regulation B. Creditors subject to the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act should be aware, however, that data collection may be called for under Regulation C (12 CFR part 1003), which generally requires creditors to report, among other things, the sex and race of an applicant on brokered applications or applications received through a correspondent.</P>
            <P>6. <E T="03">Inadvertent notation.</E> If a creditor inadvertently obtains the monitoring information in a dwelling-related transaction not covered by § 1002.13, the creditor may process and retain the application without violating the regulation.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">13(c) Disclosure to applicants.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Procedures for providing disclosures.</E> The disclosure to an applicant regarding the monitoring information may be provided in writing. Appendix B provides data collection model forms for use in complying with § 1002.13 and that comply with § 1002.13(c). A creditor may devise its own disclosure so long as it is substantially similar. The creditor need not orally request the monitoring information if it is requested in writing.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">13(d) Substitute monitoring program.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Substitute program.</E> An enforcement agency may adopt, under its established rulemaking or enforcement procedures, a program requiring creditors under its jurisdiction to collect information in addition to information required by this section.<PRTPAGE P="76"/>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 1002.14—Rules on Providing Appraisals and Valuations</HD>
            <P>
              <E T="03">14(a) Providing appraisals and other valuations.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Multiple applicants.</E> If there is more than one applicant, the written disclosure about written appraisals, and the copies of appraisals and other written valuations, need only be given to one applicant. However, these materials must be given to the primary applicant where one is readily apparent. Similarly, if there is more than one applicant for credit in the transaction, one applicant may provide a waiver under § 1002.14(a)(1), but it must be the primary applicant where one is readily apparent.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">14(a)(1) In general.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Coverage.</E> Section 1002.14 covers applications for credit to be secured by a first lien on a dwelling, as that term is defined in § 1002.14(b)(2), whether the credit is for a business purpose (for example, a loan to start a business) or a consumer purpose (for example, a loan to purchase a home).</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Renewals.</E> Section 1002.14(a)(1) applies when an applicant requests the renewal of an existing extension of credit and the creditor develops a new appraisal or other written valuation. Section 1002.14(a)(1) does not apply to the extent a creditor uses the appraisals and other written valuations that were previously developed in connection with the prior extension of credit to evaluate the renewal request.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Written.</E> For purposes of § 1002.14, an “appraisal or other written valuation” includes, without limitation, an appraisal or other valuation received or developed by the creditor in paper form (hard copy); electronically, such as CD or email; or by any other similar media. See § 1002.14(a)(5) regarding the provision of copies of appraisals and other written valuations to applicants via electronic means.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Timing.</E> Section 1002.14(a)(1) requires that the creditor “provide” copies of appraisals and other written valuations to the applicant “promptly upon completion,” or no later than three business days before consummation (for closed-end credit) or account opening (for open-end credit), whichever is earlier.</P>
            <P>i. For purposes of this timing requirement, “provide” means “deliver.” Delivery occurs three business days after mailing or delivering the copies to the last-known address of the applicant, or when evidence indicates actual receipt by the applicant, whichever is earlier. Delivery to or actual receipt by the applicant by electronic means must comply with the E-Sign Act, as provided for in § 1002.14(a)(5).</P>
            <P>ii. The application and meaning of the “promptly upon completion” standard depends upon the facts and circumstances, including but not limited to when the creditor receives the appraisal or other written valuation, and the extent of any review or revision after the creditor receives it.</P>

            <P>iii. “Completion” occurs when the last version is received by the creditor, or when the creditor has reviewed and accepted the appraisal or other written valuation to include any changes or corrections required, whichever is later. <E T="03">See also</E> comment 14(a)(1)-7.</P>
            <P>iv. In a transaction that is being consummated (for closed-end credit) or in which the account is being opened (for open-end credit), if an appraisal or other written valuation has been developed but is not yet complete, the deadline for providing a copy of three business days before consummation or account opening still applies, unless the applicant waived that deadline as provided under § 1002.14(a)(1), in which case the copy must be provided at or before consummation or account opening.</P>
            <P>v. Even if the transaction will not be consummated (for closed-end credit) or the account will not be opened (for open-end credit), the copy must be provided “promptly upon completion” as provided for in § 1002.14(a)(1), unless the applicant has waived that deadline as provided under § 1002.14(a)(1), in which case as provided for in § 1002.14(a)(1) the copy must be provided to the applicant no later than 30 days after the creditor determines the transaction will not be consummated or the account will not be opened.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Promptly upon completion-examples.</E> Examples in which the “promptly upon completion” standard would be satisfied include, but are not limited to, those in subparagraphs i, ii, and iii below. Examples in which the “promptly upon completion” standard would not be satisfied include, but are not limited to, those in subparagraphs iv and v below.</P>
            <P>i. <E T="03">Sending a copy of an appraisal within a week of completion with sufficient time before consummation (or account opening for open-end credit).</E> On day 15 after receipt of the application, the creditor's underwriting department reviews an appraisal and determines it is acceptable. One week later, the creditor sends a copy of the appraisal to the applicant. The applicant actually receives the copy more than three business days before the date of consummation (or account opening). The creditor has provided the copy of the appraisal promptly upon completion.</P>
            <P>ii. <E T="03">Sending a copy of a revised appraisal within a week after completion and with sufficient time before consummation (or account opening for open-end credit).</E> An appraisal is being revised, and the creditor does not receive the revised appraisal until day 45 after the application, when the creditor immediately determines the revised appraisal is acceptable. A week later, the creditor sends a copy of the revised appraisal to the applicant, and does <PRTPAGE P="77"/>not send a copy of the initial appraisal to the applicant. The applicant actually receives the copy of the revised appraisal three business days before the date of consummation (or account opening). The creditor has provided the appraisal copy promptly upon completion.</P>
            <P>iii. <E T="03">Sending a copy of an AVM report within a week after its receipt and with sufficient time before consummation (or account opening for open-end credit).</E> The creditor receives an automated valuation model (AVM) report on day 5 after receipt of the application and treats the AVM report as complete when it is received. On day 12 after receipt of the application, the creditor sends the applicant a copy of the valuation. The applicant actually receives the valuation more than three business days before the date of consummation (or account opening). The creditor has provided the copy of the AVM report promptly upon completion.</P>
            <P>iv. <E T="03">Delay in sending an appraisal.</E> On day 12 after receipt of the application, the creditor's underwriting department reviews an appraisal and determines it is acceptable. Although the creditor has determined the appraisal is complete, the creditor waits to provide a copy to the applicant until day 42, when the creditor schedules the consummation (or account opening) to occur on day 50. The creditor has not provided the copy of the appraisal promptly upon completion.</P>
            <P>v. <E T="03">Delay in sending an AVM report while waiting for completion of a second valuation.</E> The creditor receives an AVM report on day 5 after application and completes its review of the AVM report the day it is received. The creditor also has ordered an appraisal, but the initial version of the appraisal received by the creditor is found to be deficient and is sent for review. The creditor waits 30 days to provide a copy of the completed AVM report, until the appraisal is completed on day 35. The creditor then provides the applicant with copies of the AVM report and the revised appraisal. While the appraisal report was provided promptly upon completion, the AVM report was not.</P>
            <P>6. <E T="03">Waiver.</E> Section 1002.14(a)(1) permits the applicant to waive the timing requirement if the creditor provides the copies at or before consummation or account opening, except where otherwise prohibited by law. Except where otherwise prohibited by law, an applicant's waiver is effective under § 1002.14(a)(1) in either of the following two situations:</P>
            <P>i. If, no later than three business days prior to consummation or account opening, the applicant provides the creditor an affirmative oral or written statement waiving the timing requirement under this rule; or</P>
            <P>ii. If, within three business days of consummation or account opening, the applicant provides the creditor an affirmative oral or written statement waiving the timing requirement under this rule and the waiver pertains solely to the applicant's receipt of a copy of an appraisal or other written valuation that contains only clerical changes from a previous version of the appraisal or other written valuation provided to the applicant three or more business days prior to consummation or account opening. For purpose of this second type of waiver, revisions will only be considered to be clerical in nature if they have no impact on the estimated value, and have no impact on the calculation or methodology used to derive the estimate. In addition, under § 1002.14(a)(1) the applicant still must receive the copy of the revision at or prior to consummation or account opening.</P>
            <P>7. <E T="03">Multiple versions of appraisals or valuations.</E> For purposes of § 1002.14(a)(1), the reference to “all” appraisals and other written valuations does not refer to all versions of the same appraisal or other valuation. If a creditor has received multiple versions of an appraisal or other written valuation, the creditor is required to provide only a copy of the latest version received. If, however, a creditor already has provided a copy of one version of an appraisal or other written valuation to an applicant, and the creditor later receives a revision of that appraisal or other written valuation, then the creditor also must provide the applicant with a copy of the revision to comply with § 1002.14(a)(1). If a creditor receives only one version of an appraisal or other valuation that is developed in connection with the applicant's application, then that version must be provided to the applicant to comply with § 1002.14(a)(1). <E T="03">See also</E> comment 14(a)(1)-4 above.</P>

            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Appraisal independence requirements not affected.</E> Nothing in the text of the disclosure required by § 1002.14(a)(2) should be construed to affect, modify, limit, or supersede the operation of any legal, regulatory, or other requirements or standards relating to independence in the conduct of appraisers or the use of applicant-ordered appraisals by creditors.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">14(a)(3) Reimbursement.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Photocopy, postage, or other costs.</E> Creditors may not charge for photocopy, postage, or other costs incurred in providing a copy of an appraisal or other written valuation in accordance with section 14(a)(1).</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Reasonable fee for reimbursement.</E> Section 1002.14(a)(3) does not prohibit a creditor from imposing a reasonable fee to reimburse the creditor's costs of the appraisal or other written valuation, so long as the fee is not increased to cover the costs of providing copies of such appraisals or other written valuations under § 1002.14(a)(1). A creditor's cost may include an administration fee charged to the creditor by an appraisal management company as defined in 12 U.S.C. 3350(11). Section 1002.14(a)(3) does not, however, legally <PRTPAGE P="78"/>obligate the applicant to pay such fees. Further, creditors may not impose fees for reimbursement of the costs of an appraisal or other valuation where otherwise prohibited by law. For instance, a creditor may not charge a consumer a fee for the performance of a second appraisal if the second appraisal is required under 15 U.S.C. 1639h(b)(2) and 12 CFR 1026.35(c).</P>

            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">State law governs.</E> When a contractual obligation on the consumer's part is created is a matter to be determined under applicable law; § 1002.14 does not make this determination. A contractual commitment agreement, for example, that under applicable law binds the consumer to the credit terms would be consummation. Consummation, however, does not occur merely because the consumer has made some financial investment in the transaction (for example, by paying a nonrefundable fee) unless, of course, applicable law holds otherwise.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Credit vs. sale.</E> Consummation does not occur when the consumer becomes contractually committed to a sale transaction, unless the consumer also becomes legally obligated to accept a particular credit arrangement.</P>

            <P>
              <E T="03">15(a) General rules.</E>
            </P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">15(a)(1) Voluntary self-testing and correction.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. Activities required by any governmental authority are not voluntary self-tests. A governmental authority includes both administrative and judicial authorities for Federal, State, and local governments.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">15(a)(2) Corrective action required.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. To qualify for the privilege, appropriate corrective action is required when the results of a self-test show that it is more likely than not that there has been a violation of the ECOA or this part. A self-test is also privileged when it identifies no violations.</P>
            <P>2. In some cases, the issue of whether certain information is privileged may arise before the self-test is complete or corrective actions are fully under way. This would not necessarily prevent a creditor from asserting the privilege. In situations where the self-test is not complete, for the privilege to apply the lender must satisfy the regulation's requirements within a reasonable period of time. To assert the privilege where the self-test shows a likely violation, the rule requires, at a minimum, that the creditor establish a plan for corrective action and a method to demonstrate progress in implementing the plan. Creditors must take appropriate corrective action on a timely basis after the results of the self-test are known.</P>

            <P>3. A creditor's determination about the type of corrective action needed, or a finding that no corrective action is required, is not conclusive in determining whether the requirements of this paragraph have been satisfied. If a creditor's claim of privilege is challenged, an assessment of the need for corrective action or the type of corrective action that is appropriate must be based on a review of the self-testing results, which may require an <E T="03">in camera</E> inspection of the privileged documents.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">15(a)(3) Other privileges.</E>
              <PRTPAGE P="79"/>
            </P>
            <P>1. A creditor may assert the privilege established under this section in addition to asserting any other privilege that may apply, such as the attorney-client privilege or the work-product privilege. Self-testing data may be privileged under this section whether or not the creditor's assertion of another privilege is upheld.</P>

            <P>
              <E T="03">Paragraph 15(b)(1)(i).</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. To qualify for the privilege, a self-test must be sufficient to constitute a determination of the extent or effectiveness of the creditor's compliance with the Act and Regulation B. Accordingly, a self-test is only privileged if it was designed and used for that purpose. A self-test that is designed or used to determine compliance with other laws or regulations or for other purposes is not privileged under this rule. For example, a self-test designed to evaluate employee efficiency or customers' satisfaction with the level of service provided by the creditor is not privileged even if evidence of discrimination is uncovered incidentally. If a self-test is designed for multiple purposes, only the portion designed to determine compliance with the ECOA is eligible for the privilege.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Paragraph 15(b)(1)(ii).</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. The principal attribute of self-testing is that it constitutes a voluntary undertaking by the creditor to produce new data or factual information that otherwise would not be available and could not be derived from loan or application files or other records related to credit transactions. Self-testing includes, but is not limited to, the practice of using fictitious applicants for credit (testers), either with or without the use of matched pairs. A creditor may elect to test a defined segment of its business, for example, loan applications processed by a specific branch or loan officer, or applications made for a particular type of credit or loan program. A creditor also may use other methods of generating information that is not available in loan and application files, such as surveying mortgage loan applicants. To the extent permitted by law, creditors might also develop new methods that go beyond traditional pre-application testing, such as hiring testers to submit fictitious loan applications for processing.</P>
            <P>2. The privilege does not protect a creditor's analysis performed as part of processing or underwriting a credit application. A creditor's evaluation or analysis of its loan files, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data, or similar types of records (such as broker or loan officer compensation records) does not produce new information about a creditor's compliance and is not a self-test for purposes of this section. Similarly, a statistical analysis of data derived from existing loan files is not privileged.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">15(b)(3) Types of information not privileged.</E>
            </P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Paragraph 15(b)(3)(i).</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. The information listed in this paragraph is not privileged and may be used to determine whether the prerequisites for the privilege have been satisfied. Accordingly, a creditor might be asked to identify the self-testing method, for example, whether preapplication testers were used or data were compiled by surveying loan applicants. Information about the scope of the self-test (such as the types of credit transactions examined, or the geographic area covered by the test) also is not privileged.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Paragraph 15(b)(3)(ii).</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. Property appraisal reports, minutes of loan committee meetings or other documents reflecting the basis for a decision to approve or deny an application, loan policies or procedures, underwriting standards, and broker compensation records are examples of the types of records that are not privileged. If a creditor arranges for testers to submit loan applications for processing, the records are not related to actual credit transactions for purposes of this paragraph and may be privileged self-testing records.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">15(c) Appropriate corrective action.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. The rule only addresses the corrective actions required for a creditor to take advantage of the privilege in this section. A creditor may be required to take other actions or provide additional relief if a formal finding of discrimination is made.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">15(c)(1) General requirement.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. Appropriate corrective action is required even though no violation has been formally adjudicated or admitted by the creditor. In determining whether it is more likely than not that a violation occurred, a creditor must treat testers as if they are actual applicants for credit. A creditor may not refuse to take appropriate corrective action under this section because the self-test used fictitious loan applicants. The fact that a tester's agreement with the creditor waives the tester's legal right to assert a violation does not eliminate the requirement for the creditor to take corrective action, although no remedial relief for the tester is required under paragraph 15(c)(3).</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">15(c)(2) Determining the scope of appropriate corrective action.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. Whether a creditor has taken or is taking corrective action that is appropriate will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Generally, the scope of the corrective action that is needed to preserve the privilege is governed by the scope of the self-test. For example, a creditor that self-tests mortgage loans and discovers evidence of discrimination may focus its corrective actions on mortgage loans, and is not required to expand its testing to other types of loans.</P>

            <P>2. In identifying the policies or practices that are a likely cause of the violation, a creditor might identify inadequate or improper lending policies, failure to implement <PRTPAGE P="80"/>established policies, employee conduct, or other causes. The extent and scope of a likely violation may be assessed by determining which areas of operations are likely to be affected by those policies and practices, for example, by determining the types of loans and stages of the application process involved and the branches or offices where the violations may have occurred.</P>
            <P>3. Depending on the method and scope of the self-test and the results of the test, appropriate corrective action may include one or more of the following:</P>
            <P>i. If the self-test identifies individuals whose applications were inappropriately processed, offering to extend credit if the application was improperly denied and compensating such persons for out-of-pocket costs and other compensatory damages;</P>
            <P>ii. Correcting institutional policies or procedures that may have contributed to the likely violation, and adopting new policies as appropriate;</P>
            <P>iii. Identifying and then training and/or disciplining the employees involved;</P>
            <P>iv. Developing outreach programs, marketing strategies, or loan products to serve more effectively segments of the lender's markets that may have been affected by the likely discrimination; and</P>
            <P>v. Improving audit and oversight systems to avoid a recurrence of the likely violations.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">15(c)(3) Types of relief.</E>
            </P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Paragraph 15(c)(3)(ii).</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. The use of pre-application testers to identify policies and practices that illegally discriminate does not require creditors to review existing loan files for the purpose of identifying and compensating applicants who might have been adversely affected.</P>
            <P>2. If a self-test identifies a specific applicant who was discriminated against on a prohibited basis, to qualify for the privilege in this section the creditor must provide appropriate remedial relief to that applicant; the creditor is not required to identify other applicants who might also have been adversely affected.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Paragraph 15(c)(3)(iii).</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. A creditor is not required to provide remedial relief to an applicant that would not be available by law. An applicant might also be ineligible for certain types of relief due to changed circumstances. For example, a creditor is not required to offer credit to a denied applicant if the applicant no longer qualifies for the credit due to a change in financial circumstances, although some other type of relief might be appropriate.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">15(d)(1) Scope of privilege.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. The privilege applies with respect to any examination, investigation or proceeding by Federal, State, or local government agencies relating to compliance with the Act or this part. Accordingly, in a case brought under the ECOA, the privilege established under this section preempts any inconsistent laws or court rules to the extent they might require disclosure of privileged self-testing data. The privilege does not apply in other cases (such as in litigation filed solely under a State's fair lending statute). In such cases, if a court orders a creditor to disclose self-test results, the disclosure is not a voluntary disclosure or waiver of the privilege for purposes of paragraph 15(d)(2); a creditor may protect the information by seeking a protective order to limit availability and use of the self-testing data and prevent dissemination beyond what is necessary in that case. Paragraph 15(d)(1) precludes a party who has obtained privileged information from using it in a case brought under the ECOA, provided the creditor has not lost the privilege through voluntary disclosure under paragraph 15(d)(2).</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">15(d)(2) Loss of privilege.</E>
            </P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Paragraph 15(d)(2)(i).</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. A creditor's corrective action, by itself, is not considered a voluntary disclosure of the self-test report or results. For example, a creditor does not disclose the results of a self-test merely by offering to extend credit to a denied applicant or by inviting the applicant to reapply for credit. Voluntary disclosure could occur under this paragraph, however, if the creditor disclosed the self-test results in connection with a new offer of credit.</P>
            <P>2. The disclosure of self-testing results to an independent contractor acting as an auditor or consultant for the creditor on compliance matters does not result in loss of the privilege.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Paragraph 15(d)(2)(ii).</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. The privilege is lost if the creditor discloses privileged information, such as the results of the self-test. The privilege is not lost if the creditor merely reveals or refers to the existence of the self-test.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Paragraph 15(d)(2)(iii).</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. A creditor's claim of privilege may be challenged in a court or administrative law proceeding with appropriate jurisdiction. In resolving the issue, the presiding officer may require the creditor to produce privileged information about the self-test.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Paragraph 15(d)(3) Limited use of privileged information.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. A creditor may be required to produce privileged documents for the purpose of determining a penalty or remedy after a violation of the ECOA or Regulation B has been formally adjudicated or admitted. A creditor's compliance with such a requirement does not evidence the creditor's intent to forfeit the privilege.</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">Authority.</E> This part, known as Regulation C, is issued by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) pursuant to the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) (12 U.S.C. 2801 <E T="03">et seq.,</E>) as amended. The information-collection requirements have been approved by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under 44 U.S.C. 3501 <E T="03">et seq.</E> and have been assigned OMB numbers for institutions reporting data to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (1557-0159), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (3064-0046), the Federal Reserve System (7100-0247), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) (2502-0529), the National Credit Union Administration (3133-0166), and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (3170-0008).</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> (1) This part implements the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, which is intended to provide the public with loan data that can be used:</P>
          <P>(i) To help determine whether financial institutions are serving the housing needs of their communities;</P>
          <P>(ii) To assist public officials in distributing public-sector investment so as to attract private investment to areas where it is needed; and</P>
          <P>(iii) To assist in identifying possible discriminatory lending patterns and enforcing antidiscrimination statutes.</P>
          <P>(2) Neither the act nor this part is intended to encourage unsound lending practices or the allocation of credit.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Scope.</E> This part applies to financial institutions as defined in § 1003.2(g). This part requires a financial institution to submit data to the appropriate Federal agency for the financial institution as defined in § 1003.5(a)(4), and to disclose certain data to the public, about covered loans for which the financial institution receives applications, or that it originates or purchases, and that are secured by a dwelling located in a State of the United States of America, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</P>

          <P>(b) <E T="03">Application</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Application means an oral or written request for a covered loan that is made in accordance with procedures used by a financial institution for the type of credit requested.<PRTPAGE P="82"/>
          </P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Preapproval programs.</E> A request for preapproval for a home purchase loan, other than a home purchase loan that will be an open-end line of credit, a reverse mortgage, or secured by a multifamily dwelling, is an application under this section if the request is reviewed under a program in which the financial institution, after a comprehensive analysis of the creditworthiness of the applicant, issues a written commitment to the applicant valid for a designated period of time to extend a home purchase loan up to a specified amount. The written commitment may not be subject to conditions other than:</P>
          <P>(i) Conditions that require the identification of a suitable property;</P>
          <P>(ii) Conditions that require that no material change has occurred in the applicant's financial condition or creditworthiness prior to closing; and</P>
          <P>(iii) Limited conditions that are not related to the financial condition or creditworthiness of the applicant that the financial institution ordinarily attaches to a traditional home mortgage application.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Branch office</E> means:</P>
          <P>(1) Any office of a bank, savings association, or credit union that is considered a branch by the Federal or State supervisory agency applicable to that institution, excluding automated teller machines and other free-standing electronic terminals; and</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix B to Part 1003—Form and Instructions for Data Collection on Ethnicity, Race, and Sex</HD>
          <P>You may list questions regarding the ethnicity, race, and sex of the applicant on your loan application form, or on a separate form that refers to the application. (See the sample data collection form below for model language.)</P>
          <P>1. You must ask the applicant for this information (but you cannot require the applicant to provide it) whether the application is taken in person, by mail or telephone, or on the internet. For applications taken by telephone, you must state the information in the collection form orally, except for that information which pertains uniquely to applications taken in writing, for example, the italicized language in the sample data collection form.</P>
          <P>2. Inform the applicant that Federal law requires this information to be collected in order to protect consumers and to monitor compliance with Federal statutes that prohibit discrimination against applicants on these bases. Inform the applicant that if the information is not provided where the application is taken in person, you are required to note the information on the basis of visual observation or surname.</P>
          <P>3. If you accept an application through electronic media with a video component, you must treat the application as taken in person. If you accept an application through electronic media without a video component (for example, facsimile), you must treat the application as accepted by mail.</P>
          <P>4. For purposes of § 1003.4(a)(10)(i), if a covered loan or application includes a guarantor, you do not report the guarantor's ethnicity, race, and sex.</P>
          <P>5. If there are no co-applicants, you must report that there is no co-applicant. If there is more than one co-applicant, you must provide the ethnicity, race, and sex only for the first co-applicant listed on the collection form. A co-applicant may provide an absent co-applicant's ethnicity, race, and sex on behalf of the absent co-applicant. If the information is not provided for an absent co-applicant, you must report “information not provided by applicant in mail, internet, or telephone application” for the absent co-applicant.</P>
          <P>6. When you purchase a covered loan and you choose not to report the applicant's or co-applicant's ethnicity, race, and sex, you must report that the requirement is not applicable.</P>

          <P>7. You must report that the requirement to report the applicant's or co-applicant's ethnicity, race, and sex is not applicable when the applicant or co-applicant is not a natural person (for example, a corporation, partnership, or trust). For example, for a transaction involving a trust, you must report that the requirement to report the applicant's ethnicity, race, and sex is not applicable if the trust is the applicant. On the other hand, if the applicant is a natural person, and is the beneficiary of a trust, you must report the applicant's ethnicity, race, and sex.<PRTPAGE P="92"/>
          </P>
          <P>8. You must report the ethnicity, race, and sex of an applicant as provided by the applicant. For example, if an applicant selects the “Asian” box the institution reports “Asian” for the race of the applicant. Only an applicant may self-identify as being of a particular Hispanic or Latino subcategory (Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Other Hispanic or Latino) or of a particular Asian subcategory (Asian Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Other Asian) or of a particular Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander subcategory (Native Hawaiian, Guamanian or Chamorro, Samoan, Other Pacific Islander) or of a particular American Indian or Alaska Native enrolled or principal tribe. An applicant may select an ethnicity or race subcategory even if the applicant does not select an aggregate ethnicity or aggregate race category. For example, if an applicant selects only the “Mexican” box, the institution reports “Mexican” for the ethnicity of the applicant but does not also report “Hispanic or Latino.”</P>
          <P>9. You must offer the applicant the option of selecting more than one ethnicity or race. If an applicant selects more than one ethnicity or race, you must report each selected designation, subject to the limits described below.</P>
          <P>i. <E T="03">Ethnicity—Aggregate categories and subcategories.</E> There are two aggregate ethnicity categories: Hispanic or Latino; and Not Hispanic or Latino. The Hispanic or Latino category has four subcategories: Mexican; Puerto Rican; Cuban; and Other Hispanic or Latino. You must report every aggregate ethnicity category selected by the applicant. If the applicant also selects one or more ethnicity subcategories, you must report each ethnicity subcategory selected by the applicant, except that you must not report more than a total of five aggregate ethnicity categories and ethnicity subcategories combined. For example, if the applicant selects both aggregate ethnicity categories and also selects all four ethnicity subcategories, you must report Hispanic or Latino, Not Hispanic or Latino, and any three, at your option, of the four ethnicity subcategories selected by the applicant. To determine how to report the Other Hispanic or Latino ethnicity subcategory for purposes of the five-ethnicity maximum, see paragraph 9.ii below.</P>
          <P>ii. <E T="03">Ethnicity—Other subcategories.</E> An applicant may select the Other Hispanic or Latino ethnicity subcategory, an applicant may provide a particular Hispanic or Latino ethnicity not listed in the standard subcategories, or an applicant may do both. If the applicant provides only a particular Hispanic or Latino ethnicity in the space provided, you are permitted, but are not required, to report Other Hispanic or Latino in addition to reporting the particular Hispanic or Latino ethnicity provided by the applicant. For example, if an applicant provides only “Dominican,” you should report “Dominican.” You are permitted, but not required, to report Other Hispanic or Latino as well. If an applicant selects the Other Hispanic or Latino ethnicity subcategory and also provides a particular Hispanic or Latino ethnicity not listed in the standard subcategories, you must report both the selection of Other Hispanic or Latino and the additional information provided by the applicant, subject to the five-ethnicity maximum. For purposes of the maximum of five reportable ethnicity categories and ethnicity subcategories combined, as set forth in paragraph 9.i, the Other Hispanic or Latino subcategory and additional information provided by the applicant together constitute only one selection. For example, if the applicant selects Other Hispanic or Latino and enters “Dominican” in the space provided, Other Hispanic or Latino and “Dominican” are considered one selection. Similarly, if the applicant only enters “Dominican” in the space provided and you report both “Dominican” and Other Hispanic or Latino as permitted by this paragraph 9.ii, the reported items together are considered one selection.</P>
          <P>iii. <E T="03">Race—Aggregate categories and subcategories.</E> There are five aggregate race categories: American Indian or Alaska Native; Asian; Black or African American; Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander; and White. The Asian and the Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander aggregate categories have seven and four subcategories, respectively. The Asian race subcategories are: Asian Indian; Chinese; Filipino; Japanese; Korean; Vietnamese; and Other Asian. The Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander race subcategories are: Native Hawaiian; Guamanian or Chamorro; Samoan; and Other Pacific Islander. You must report every aggregate race category selected by the applicant. If the applicant also selects one or more race subcategories, you must report each race subcategory selected by the applicant, except that you must not report more than a total of five aggregate race categories and race subcategories combined. For example, if the applicant selects all five aggregate race categories and also selects some race subcategories, you report only the five aggregate race categories. On the other hand, if the applicant selects the White, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander aggregate race categories, and the applicant also selects the Korean, Vietnamese, and Samoan race subcategories, you must report White, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and any two, at your option, of the three race subcategories selected by the applicant. In this example, you must report White, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and in <PRTPAGE P="93"/>addition you must report (at your option) either Korean and Vietnamese, Korean and Samoan, or Vietnamese and Samoan. To determine how to report an Other race subcategory and the American Indian or Alaska Native category for purposes of the five-race maximum, see paragraphs 9.iv and 9.v below.</P>
          <P>iv. <E T="03">Race—Other subcategories.</E> An applicant may select the Other Asian race subcategory or the Other Pacific Islander race subcategory, an applicant may provide a particular Asian race or Pacific Islander race not listed in the standard subcategories, or an applicant may do both. If the applicant provides only a particular Asian race or Pacific Islander race in the space provided, you are permitted, but are not required, to report Other Asian or Other Pacific Islander, as applicable, in addition to reporting the particular Asian race or Pacific Islander race provided by the applicant. For example, if an applicant provides only “Hmong,” you should report “Hmong.” You are permitted, but not required, to report Other Asian as well. If an applicant selects the Other Asian race or the Other Pacific Islander race subcategory and provides a particular Asian race or Pacific Islander race not listed in the standard subcategories, you must report both the selection of Other Asian or Other Pacific Islander, as applicable, and the additional information provided by the applicant, subject to the five-race maximum. For purposes of the maximum of five reportable race categories and race subcategories combined, as set forth in paragraph 9.iii, the Other race subcategory and additional information provided by the applicant together constitute only one selection. Thus, using the same facts in the example offered in paragraph 9.iii above, if the applicant also selects Other Asian and enters “Thai” in the space provided, Other Asian and Thai are considered one selection. Similarly, if the applicant enters only “Thai” in the space provided and you report both “Thai” and Other Asian as permitted by this paragraph 9.iv, the reported items together are considered one selection. In the same example, you must report any two (at your option) of the four race subcategories selected by the applicant, Korean, Vietnamese, Other Asian-Thai, and Samoan, in addition to the three aggregate race categories selected by the applicant.</P>
          <P>v. <E T="03">Race—American Indian or Alaska Native category.</E> An applicant may select the American Indian or Alaska Native race category, an applicant may provide a particular American Indian or Alaska Native enrolled or principal tribe, or an applicant may do both. If the applicant provides only a particular American Indian or Alaska Native enrolled or principal tribe in the space provided, you are permitted, but are not required, to report American Indian or Alaska Native in addition to reporting the particular American Indian or Alaska Native enrolled or principal tribe provided by the applicant. For example, if an applicant provides only “Navajo,” you should report “Navajo.” You are permitted, but not required, to report American Indian or Alaska Native as well. If an applicant selects the American Indian or Alaska Native race category and also provides a particular American Indian or Alaska Native enrolled or principal tribe, you must report both the selection of American Indian or Alaska Native and the additional information provided by the applicant. For purposes of the maximum of five reportable race categories and race subcategories combined, as set forth in paragraph 9.iii, the American Indian or Alaska Native category and additional information provided by the applicant together constitute only one selection.</P>
          <P>10. If the applicant chooses not to provide the information for an application taken in person, note this fact on the collection form and then collect the applicant's ethnicity, race, and sex on the basis of visual observation or surname. You must report whether the applicant's ethnicity, race, and sex was collected on the basis of visual observation or surname. When you collect an applicant's ethnicity, race, and sex on the basis of visual observation or surname, you must select from the following aggregate categories: Ethnicity (Hispanic or Latino; not Hispanic or Latino); race (American Indian or Alaska Native; Asian; Black or African American; Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander; White); sex (male; female).</P>
          <P>11. If the applicant declines to answer these questions by checking the “I do not wish to provide this information” box on an application that is taken by mail or on the internet, or declines to provide this information by stating orally that he or she does not wish to provide this information on an application that is taken by telephone, you must report “information not provided by applicant in mail, internet, or telephone application.”</P>
          <P>12. If the applicant begins an application by mail, internet, or telephone, and does not provide the requested information on the application but does not check or select the “I do not wish to provide this information” box on the application, and the applicant meets in person with you to complete the application, you must request the applicant's ethnicity, race, and sex. If the applicant does not provide the requested information during the in-person meeting, you must collect the information on the basis of visual observation or surname. If the meeting occurs after the application process is complete, for example, at closing or account opening, you are not required to obtain the applicant's ethnicity, race, and sex.</P>

          <P>13. When an applicant provides the requested information for some but not all fields, you report the information that was <PRTPAGE P="94"/>provided by the applicant, whether partial or complete. If an applicant provides partial or complete information on ethnicity, race, and sex and also checks the “I do not wish to provide this information” box on an application that is taken by mail or on the internet, or makes that selection when applying by telephone, you must report the information on ethnicity, race, and sex that was provided by the applicant.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Introduction</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Status.</E> The commentary in this supplement is the vehicle by which the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection issues formal interpretations of Regulation C (12 CFR part 1003).</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 1003.2—Definitions</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">2(b) Application</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Consistency with Regulation B.</E> Bureau interpretations that appear in the official commentary to Regulation B (Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 12 CFR part 1002, Supplement I) are generally applicable to the definition of application under Regulation C. However, under Regulation C the definition of an application does not include prequalification requests.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Prequalification.</E> A prequalification request is a request by a prospective loan applicant (other than a request for preapproval) for a preliminary determination on whether the prospective loan applicant would likely qualify for credit under an institution's standards, or for a determination on the amount of credit for which the prospective applicant would likely qualify. Some institutions evaluate prequalification requests through a procedure that is separate from the institution's normal loan application process; others use the same process. In either case, Regulation C does not require an institution to report prequalification requests on the loan/application register, even though these requests may constitute applications under Regulation B for purposes of adverse action notices.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Requests for preapproval.</E> To be a preapproval program as defined in § 1003.2(b)(2), the written commitment issued under the program must result from a comprehensive review of the creditworthiness of the applicant, including such verification of income, resources, and other matters as is typically done by the institution as part of its normal credit evaluation program. In addition to conditions involving the identification of a suitable property and verification that no material change has occurred in the applicant's financial condition or creditworthiness, the written commitment may be subject only to other conditions (unrelated to the financial condition or creditworthiness of the applicant) that the lender ordinarily attaches to a traditional home mortgage application approval. These conditions are limited to conditions such as requiring an acceptable title insurance binder or a certificate indicating clear termite inspection, and, in the case where the applicant plans to use the proceeds from the sale of the applicant's present home to purchase a new home, a settlement statement showing adequate proceeds from the sale of the present home. Regardless of its name, a program that satisfies the definition of a preapproval program in § 1003.2(b)(2) is a preapproval program for purposes of Regulation C. Conversely, a program that a financial institution describes as a “preapproval program” that does not satisfy the requirements of § 1003.2(b)(2) is not a preapproval program for purposes of Regulation C. If a financial institution does not regularly use the procedures specified in § 1003.2(b)(2), but instead considers requests for preapprovals on an ad hoc basis, the financial institution need not treat ad hoc requests as part of a preapproval program for purposes of Regulation C. A financial institution should, however, be generally consistent in following uniform procedures for considering such ad hoc requests.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">2(c) Branch Office</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 2(c)(1)</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Credit unions.</E> For purposes of Regulation C, a “branch” of a credit union is any office where member accounts are established or loans are made, whether or not the office has been approved as a branch by a Federal or State agency. (See 12 U.S.C. 1752.)</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Bank, savings association, or credit unions.</E> A branch office of a bank, savings association, or credit union does not include a loan-production office if the loan-production office is not considered a branch by the Federal or State supervisory authority applicable to that institution. A branch office also does not include the office of an affiliate or <PRTPAGE P="98"/>of a third party, such as a third-party broker.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 2(c)(2)</HD>
          <P>
            <E T="03">1. General.</E> A branch office of a for-profit mortgage lending institution, other than a bank savings association or credit union, does not include the office of an affiliate or of a third party, such as a third-party broker.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">2(d) Closed-end Mortgage Loan</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Dwelling-secured.</E> Section 1003.2(d) defines a closed-end mortgage loan as an extension of credit that is secured by a lien on a dwelling and that is not an open-end line of credit under § 1003.2(o). Thus, for example, a loan to purchase a dwelling and secured only by a personal guarantee is not a closed-end mortgage loan because it is not dwelling-secured.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Extension of credit.</E> Under § 1003.2(d), a dwelling-secured loan is not a closed-end mortgage loan unless it involves an extension of credit. For example, some transactions completed pursuant to installment sales contracts, such as some land contracts, depending on the facts and circumstances, may or may not involve extensions of credit rendering the transactions closed-end mortgage loans. In general, extension of credit under § 1003.2(d) refers to the granting of credit only pursuant to a new debt obligation. Thus, except as described in comments 2(d)-2.i and .ii, if a transaction modifies, renews, extends, or amends the terms of an existing debt obligation, but the existing debt obligation is not satisfied and replaced, the transaction is not a closed-end mortgage loan under § 1003.2(d) because there has been no new extension of credit. The phrase extension of credit thus is defined differently under Regulation C than under Regulation B, 12 CFR part 1002.</P>
          <P>i. <E T="03">Assumptions.</E> For purposes of Regulation C, an assumption is a transaction in which an institution enters into a written agreement accepting a new borrower in place of an existing borrower as the obligor on an existing debt obligation. For purposes of Regulation C, assumptions include successor-in-interest transactions, in which an individual succeeds the prior owner as the property owner and then assumes the existing debt secured by the property. Under § 1003.2(d), assumptions are extensions of credit even if the new borrower merely assumes the existing debt obligation and no new debt obligation is created. <E T="03">See also</E> comment 2(j)-5.</P>
          <P>ii. <E T="03">New York State consolidation, extension, and modification agreements.</E> A transaction completed pursuant to a New York State consolidation, extension, and modification agreement and classified as a supplemental mortgage under New York Tax Law section 255, such that the borrower owes reduced or no mortgage recording taxes, is an extension of credit under § 1003.2(d). Comments 2(i)-1, 2(j)-5, and 2(p)-2 clarify whether such transactions are home improvement loans, home purchase loans, or refinancings, respectively. Section 1003.3(c)(13) provides an exclusion from the reporting requirement for a preliminary transaction providing or, in the case of an application, proposing to provide new funds to the borrower in advance of being consolidated within the same calendar year into a supplemental mortgage under New York Tax Law section 255. See comment 3(c)(13)-1 concerning how to report a supplemental mortgage under New York Tax Law section 255 in this situation.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">2(f) Dwelling</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">General.</E> The definition of a dwelling is not limited to the principal or other residence of the applicant or borrower, and thus includes vacation or second homes and investment properties.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Multifamily residential structures and communities.</E> A dwelling also includes a multifamily residential structure or community such as an apartment, condominium, cooperative building or housing complex, or a manufactured home community. A loan related to a manufactured home community is secured by a dwelling for purposes of § 1003.2(f) even if it is not secured by any individual manufactured homes, but only by the land that constitutes the manufactured home community including sites for manufactured homes. However, a loan related to a multifamily residential structure or community that is not a manufactured home community is not secured by a dwelling for purposes of § 1003.2(f) if it is not secured by any individual dwelling units and is, for example, instead secured only by property that only includes common areas, or is secured only by an assignment of rents or dues.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Exclusions.</E> Recreational vehicles, including boats, campers, travel trailers, and park model recreational vehicles, are not considered dwellings for purposes of § 1003.2(f), regardless of whether they are used as residences. Houseboats, floating homes, and mobile homes constructed before June 15, 1976, are also excluded, regardless of whether they are used as residences. Also excluded are transitory residences such as hotels, hospitals, college dormitories, and recreational vehicle parks, and structures originally designed as dwellings but used exclusively for commercial purposes, such as homes converted to daycare facilities or professional offices.</P>
          <P>4. <E T="03">Mixed-use properties.</E> A property used for both residential and commercial purposes, such as a building containing apartment units and retail space, is a dwelling if the property's primary use is residential. An institution may use any reasonable standard <PRTPAGE P="99"/>to determine the primary use of the property, such as by square footage or by the income generated. An institution may select the standard to apply on a case-by-case basis.</P>
          <P>5. <E T="03">Properties with service and medical components.</E> For purposes of § 1003.2(f), a property used for both long-term housing and to provide related services, such as assisted living for senior citizens or supportive housing for persons with disabilities, is a dwelling and does not have a non-residential purpose merely because the property is used for both housing and to provide services. However, transitory residences that are used to provide such services are not dwellings. <E T="03">See</E> comment 2(f)-3. Properties that are used to provide medical care, such as skilled nursing, rehabilitation, or long-term medical care, also are not dwellings. <E T="03">See</E> comment 2(f)-3. If a property that is used for both long-term housing and to provide related services also is used to provide medical care, the property is a dwelling if its primary use is residential. An institution may use any reasonable standard to determine the property's primary use, such as by square footage, income generated, or number of beds or units allocated for each use. An institution may select the standard to apply on a case-by-case basis.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">2(g) Financial Institution</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Preceding calendar year and preceding December 31.</E> The definition of financial institution refers both to the preceding calendar year and the preceding December 31. These terms refer to the calendar year and the December 31 preceding the current calendar year. For example, in 2019, the preceding calendar year is 2018 and the preceding December 31 is December 31, 2018. Accordingly, in 2019, Financial Institution A satisfies the asset-size threshold described in § 1003.2(g)(1)(i) if its assets exceeded the threshold specified in comment 2(g)-2 on December 31, 2018. Likewise, in 2020, Financial Institution A does not meet the loan-volume test described in § 1003.2(g)(1)(v)(A) if it originated fewer than 25 closed-end mortgage loans during either 2018 or 2019.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Adjustment of exemption threshold for banks, savings associations, and credit unions.</E> For data collection in 2018, the asset-size exemption threshold is $45 million. Banks, savings associations, and credit unions with assets at or below $45 million as of December 31, 2017, are exempt from collecting data for 2018.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Merger or acquisition—coverage of surviving or newly formed institution.</E> After a merger or acquisition, the surviving or newly formed institution is a financial institution under § 1003.2(g) if it, considering the combined assets, location, and lending activity of the surviving or newly formed institution and the merged or acquired institutions or acquired branches, satisfies the criteria included in § 1003.2(g). For example, A and B merge. The surviving or newly formed institution meets the loan threshold described in § 1003.2(g)(1)(v)(B) if the surviving or newly formed institution, A, and B originated a combined total of at least 500 open-end lines of credit in each of the two preceding calendar years. Likewise, the surviving or newly formed institution meets the asset-size threshold in § 1003.2(g)(1)(i) if its assets and the combined assets of A and B on December 31 of the preceding calendar year exceeded the threshold described in § 1003.2(g)(1)(i). Comment 2(g)-4 discusses a financial institution's responsibilities during the calendar year of a merger.</P>
          <P>4. <E T="03">Merger or acquisition—coverage for calendar year of merger or acquisition.</E> The scenarios described below illustrate a financial institution's responsibilities for the calendar year of a merger or acquisition. For purposes of these illustrations, a “covered institution” means a financial institution, as defined in § 1003.2(g), that is not exempt from reporting under § 1003.3(a), and “an institution that is not covered” means either an institution that is not a financial institution, as defined in § 1003.2(g), or an institution that is exempt from reporting under § 1003.3(a).</P>
          <P>i. Two institutions that are not covered merge. The surviving or newly formed institution meets all of the requirements necessary to be a covered institution. No data collection is required for the calendar year of the merger (even though the merger creates an institution that meets all of the requirements necessary to be a covered institution). When a branch office of an institution that is not covered is acquired by another institution that is not covered, and the acquisition results in a covered institution, no data collection is required for the calendar year of the acquisition.</P>
          <P>ii. A covered institution and an institution that is not covered merge. The covered institution is the surviving institution, or a new covered institution is formed. For the calendar year of the merger, data collection is required for covered loans and applications handled in the offices of the merged institution that was previously covered and is optional for covered loans and applications handled in offices of the merged institution that was previously not covered. When a covered institution acquires a branch office of an institution that is not covered, data collection is optional for covered loans and applications handled by the acquired branch office for the calendar year of the acquisition.</P>

          <P>iii. A covered institution and an institution that is not covered merge. The institution that is not covered is the surviving institution, or a new institution that is not covered is formed. For the calendar year of the merger, data collection is required for <PRTPAGE P="100"/>covered loans and applications handled in offices of the previously covered institution that took place prior to the merger. After the merger date, data collection is optional for covered loans and applications handled in the offices of the institution that was previously covered. When an institution remains not covered after acquiring a branch office of a covered institution, data collection is required for transactions of the acquired branch office that take place prior to the acquisition. Data collection by the acquired branch office is optional for transactions taking place in the remainder of the calendar year after the acquisition.</P>
          <P>iv. Two covered institutions merge. The surviving or newly formed institution is a covered institution. Data collection is required for the entire calendar year of the merger. The surviving or newly formed institution files either a consolidated submission or separate submissions for that calendar year. When a covered institution acquires a branch office of a covered institution, data collection is required for the entire calendar year of the merger. Data for the acquired branch office may be submitted by either institution.</P>
          <P>5. <E T="03">Originations.</E> Whether an institution is a financial institution depends in part on whether the institution originated at least 25 closed-end mortgage loans in each of the two preceding calendar years or at least 500 open-end lines of credit in each of the two preceding calendar years. Comments 4(a)-2 through -4 discuss whether activities with respect to a particular closed-end mortgage loan or open-end line of credit constitute an origination for purposes of § 1003.2(g).</P>
          <P>6. <E T="03">Branches of foreign banks—treated as banks.</E> A Federal branch or a State-licensed or insured branch of a foreign bank that meets the definition of a “bank” under section 3(a)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813(a)) is a bank for the purposes of § 1003.2(g).</P>
          <P>7. <E T="03">Branches and offices of foreign banks and other entities—treated as nondepository financial institutions.</E> A Federal agency, State-licensed agency, State-licensed uninsured branch of a foreign bank, commercial lending company owned or controlled by a foreign bank, or entity operating under section 25 or 25A of the Federal Reserve Act, 12 U.S.C. 601 and 611 (Edge Act and agreement corporations) may not meet the definition of “bank” under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and may thereby fail to satisfy the definition of a depository financial institution under § 1003.2(g)(1). An entity is nonetheless a financial institution if it meets the definition of nondepository financial institution under § 1003.2(g)(2).</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">2(i) Home Improvement Loan</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">General.</E> Section 1003.2(i) defines a home improvement loan as a closed-end mortgage loan or an open-end line of credit that is for the purpose, in whole or in part, of repairing, rehabilitating, remodeling, or improving a dwelling or the real property on which the dwelling is located. For example, a closed-end mortgage loan obtained to repair a dwelling by replacing a roof is a home improvement loan under § 1003.2(i). A loan or line of credit is a home improvement loan even if only a part of the purpose is for repairing, rehabilitating, remodeling, or improving a dwelling. For example, an open-end line of credit obtained in part to remodel a kitchen and in part to pay college tuition is a home improvement loan under § 1003.2(i). Similarly, for example, a loan that is completed pursuant to a New York State consolidation, extension, and modification agreement and that is classified as a supplemental mortgage under New York Tax Law section 255, such that the borrower owes reduced or no mortgage recording taxes, is a home improvement loan if any of the loan's funds are for home improvement purposes. <E T="03">See also</E> comment 2(d)-2.ii.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Improvements to real property.</E> Home improvements include improvements both to a dwelling and to the real property on which the dwelling is located (for example, installation of a swimming pool, construction of a garage, or landscaping).</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Commercial and other loans.</E> A home improvement loan may include a closed-end mortgage loan or an open-end line of credit originated outside an institution's residential mortgage lending division, such as a loan or line of credit to improve an apartment building originated in the commercial loan department.</P>
          <P>4. <E T="03">Mixed-use property.</E> A closed-end mortgage loan or an open-end line of credit to improve a multifamily dwelling used for residential and commercial purposes (for example, a building containing apartment units and retail space), or the real property on which such a dwelling is located, is a home improvement loan if the loan's proceeds are used either to improve the entire property (for example, to replace the heating system), or if the proceeds are used primarily to improve the residential portion of the property. An institution may use any reasonable standard to determine the primary use of the loan proceeds. An institution may select the standard to apply on a case-by-case basis. See comment 3(c)(10)-3.ii for guidance on loans to improve primarily the commercial portion of a dwelling other than a multifamily dwelling.</P>
          <P>5. <E T="03">Multiple-purpose loans.</E> A closed-end mortgage loan or an open-end line of credit may be used for multiple purposes. For example, a closed-end mortgage loan that is a home improvement loan under § 1003.2(i) may also be a refinancing under § 1003.2(p) if the transaction is a cash-out refinancing and the funds will be used to improve a home. Such <PRTPAGE P="101"/>a transaction is a multiple-purpose loan. Comment 4(a)(3)-3 provides details about how to report multiple-purpose covered loans.</P>
          <P>6. <E T="03">Statement of borrower.</E> In determining whether a closed-end mortgage loan or an open-end line of credit, or an application for a closed-end mortgage loan or an open-end line of credit, is for home improvement purposes, an institution may rely on the applicant's or borrower's stated purpose(s) for the loan or line of credit at the time the application is received or the credit decision is made. An institution need not confirm that the borrower actually uses any of the funds for the stated purpose(s).</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">2(j) Home Purchase Loan</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Multiple properties.</E> A home purchase loan includes a closed-end mortgage loan or an open-end line of credit secured by one dwelling and used to purchase another dwelling. For example, if a person obtains a home-equity loan or a reverse mortgage secured by dwelling A to purchase dwelling B, the home-equity loan or the reverse mortgage is a home purchase loan under § 1003.2(j).</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Commercial and other loans.</E> A home purchase loan may include a closed-end mortgage loan or an open-end line of credit originated outside an institution's residential mortgage lending division, such as a loan or line of credit to purchase an apartment building originated in the commercial loan department.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Construction and permanent financing.</E> A home purchase loan includes both a combined construction/permanent loan or line of credit, and the separate permanent financing that replaces a construction-only loan or line of credit for the same borrower at a later time. A home purchase loan does not include a construction-only loan or line of credit that is designed to be replaced by separate permanent financing extended by any financial institution to the same borrower at a later time or that is extended to a person exclusively to construct a dwelling for sale, which are excluded from Regulation C as temporary financing under § 1003.3(c)(3). Comments 3(c)(3)-1 and -2 provide additional details about transactions that are excluded as temporary financing.</P>
          <P>4. <E T="03">Second mortgages that finance the downpayments on first mortgages.</E> If an institution making a first mortgage loan to a home purchaser also makes a second mortgage loan or line of credit to the same purchaser to finance part or all of the home purchaser's downpayment, both the first mortgage loan and the second mortgage loan or line of credit are home purchase loans.</P>
          <P>5. <E T="03">Assumptions.</E> Under § 1003.2(j), an assumption is a home purchase loan when an institution enters into a written agreement accepting a new borrower as the obligor on an existing obligation to finance the new borrower's purchase of the dwelling securing the existing obligation, if the resulting obligation is a closed-end mortgage loan or an open-end line of credit. A transaction in which borrower B finances the purchase of borrower A's dwelling by assuming borrower A's existing debt obligation and that is completed pursuant to a New York State consolidation, extension, and modification agreement and is classified as a supplemental mortgage under New York Tax Law section 255, such that the borrower owes reduced or no mortgage recording taxes, is an assumption and a home purchase loan. <E T="03">See</E> comment 2(d)-2.ii. On the other hand, a transaction in which borrower B, a successor-in-interest, assumes borrower A's existing debt obligation only after acquiring title to borrower A's dwelling is not a home purchase loan because borrower B did not assume the debt obligation for the purpose of purchasing a dwelling. <E T="03">See</E> § 1003.4(a)(3) and comment 4(a)(3)-4 for guidance about how to report covered loans that are not home improvement loans, home purchase loans, or refinancings.</P>
          <P>6. <E T="03">Multiple-purpose loans.</E> A closed-end mortgage loan or an open-end line of credit may be used for multiple purposes. For example, a closed-end mortgage loan that is a home purchase loan under § 1003.2(j) may also be a home improvement loan under § 1003.2(i) and a refinancing under § 1003.2(p) if the transaction is a cash-out refinancing and the funds will be used to purchase and improve a dwelling. Such a transaction is a multiple-purpose loan. Comment 4(a)(3)-3 provides details about how to report multiple-purpose covered loans.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">2(l) Manufactured Home</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Definition of a manufactured home.</E> The definition in § 1003.2(l) refers to the Federal building code for manufactured housing established by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) (24 CFR part 3280.2). Modular or other factory-built homes that do not meet the HUD code standards are not manufactured homes for purposes of § 1003.2(l). Recreational vehicles are excluded from the HUD code standards pursuant to 24 CFR 3282.8(g) and are also excluded from the definition of dwelling for purposes of § 1003.2(f). <E T="03">See</E> comment 2(f)-3.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Identification.</E> A manufactured home will generally bear a data plate affixed in a permanent manner near the main electrical panel or other readily accessible and visible location noting its compliance with the Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards in force at the time of manufacture and providing other information about its manufacture pursuant to 24 CFR 3280.5. A manufactured home will generally also bear a HUD Certification Label pursuant to 24 CFR 3280.11.<PRTPAGE P="102"/>

          <HD SOURCE="HD3">2(m) Metropolitan Statistical Area (MD) or Metropolitan Division (MD).</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Use of terms “Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)” and “Metropolitan Division (MD).”</E> The U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) defines Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) and Metropolitan Divisions (MDs) to provide nationally consistent definitions for collecting, tabulating, and publishing Federal statistics for a set of geographic areas. For all purposes under Regulation C, if an MSA is divided by OMB into MDs, the appropriate geographic unit to be used is the MD; if an MSA is not so divided by OMB into MDs, the appropriate geographic unit to be used is the MSA.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">2(n) Multifamily Dwelling</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Multifamily residential structures.</E> The definition of dwelling in § 1003.2(f) includes multifamily residential structures and the corresponding commentary provides guidance on when such residential structures are included in that definition. <E T="03">See</E> comments 2(f)-2 through -5.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Special reporting requirements for multifamily dwellings.</E> The definition of multifamily dwelling in § 1003.2(n) includes a dwelling, regardless of construction method, that contains five or more individual dwelling units. Covered loans secured by a multifamily dwelling are subject to additional reporting requirements under § 1003.4(a)(32), but are not subject to reporting requirements under § 1003.4(a)(4), (10)(iii), (23), (29), or (30).</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Separate dwellings.</E> A covered loan secured by five or more separate dwellings, which are not multifamily dwellings, in more than one location is not a loan secured by a multifamily dwelling. For example, assume a landlord uses a covered loan to improve five or more dwellings, each with one individual dwelling unit, located in different parts of a town, and the loan is secured by those properties. The covered loan is not secured by a multifamily dwelling as defined by § 1003.2(n). Likewise, a covered loan secured by five or more separate dwellings that are located within a multifamily dwelling, but which is not secured by the entire multifamily dwelling (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> an entire apartment building or housing complex), is not secured by a multifamily dwelling as defined by § 1003.2(n). For example, assume that an investor purchases 10 individual unit condominiums in a 100-unit condominium complex using a covered loan. The covered loan would not be secured by a multifamily dwelling as defined by § 1003.2(n). In both of these situations, a financial institution reporting a covered loan or application secured by these separate dwellings would not be subject to the additional reporting requirements for covered loans secured by or applications proposed to be secured by multifamily dwellings under § 1003.4(a)(32). However, a financial institution would report the information required by § 1003.4(a)(4), (a)(10)(iii), and (a)(23), (29), and (30), which is not applicable to covered loans secured by and applications proposed to be secured by multifamily dwellings. See comment 2(n)-2. In addition, in both of these situations, the financial institution reports the number of individual dwelling units securing the covered loan or proposed to secure a covered loan as required by § 1003.4(a)(31). See comment 4(a)(31)-3.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">2(o) Open-End Line of Credit</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">General.</E> Section 1003.2(o) defines an open-end line of credit as an extension of credit that is secured by a lien on a dwelling and that is an open-end credit plan as defined in Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.2(a)(20), but without regard to whether the credit is consumer credit, as defined in § 1026.2(a)(12), is extended by a creditor, as defined in § 1026.2(a)(17), or is extended to a consumer, as defined in § 1026.2(a)(11). Aside from these distinctions, institutions may rely on 12 CFR 1026.2(a)(20) and its related commentary in determining whether a transaction is an open-end line of credit under § 1003.2(o). For example, assume a business-purpose transaction that is exempt from Regulation Z pursuant to § 1026.3(a)(1) but that otherwise is open-end credit under Regulation Z § 1026.2(a)(20). The business-purpose transaction is an open-end line of credit under Regulation C, provided the other requirements of § 1003.2(o) are met. Similarly, assume a transaction in which the person extending open-end credit is a financial institution under § 1003.2(g) but is not a creditor under Regulation Z, § 1026.2(a)(17). In this example, the transaction is an open-end line of credit under Regulation C, provided the other requirements of § 1003.2(o) are met.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Extension of credit.</E> Extension of credit has the same meaning under § 1003.2(o) as under § 1003.2(d) and comment 2(d)-2. Thus, for example, a renewal of an open-end line of credit is not an extension of credit under § 1003.2(o) and is not covered by Regulation C unless the existing debt obligation is satisfied and replaced. Likewise, under § 1003.2(o), each draw on an open-end line of credit is not an extension of credit.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">2(p) Refinancing</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">General.</E> Section 1003.2(p) defines a refinancing as a closed-end mortgage loan or an open-end line of credit in which a new, dwelling-secured debt obligation satisfies and replaces an existing, dwelling-secured debt obligation by the same borrower. Except as described in comment 2(p)-2, whether a refinancing has occurred is determined by reference to whether, based on the parties' contract and applicable law, the original debt obligation has been satisfied or replaced by a <PRTPAGE P="103"/>new debt obligation. Whether the original lien is satisfied is irrelevant. For example:</P>
          <P>i. A new closed-end mortgage loan that satisfies and replaces one or more existing closed-end mortgage loans is a refinancing under § 1003.2(p).</P>
          <P>ii. A new open-end line of credit that satisfies and replaces an existing closed-end mortgage loan is a refinancing under § 1003.2(p).</P>
          <P>iii. Except as described in comment 2(p)-2, a new debt obligation that renews or modifies the terms of, but that does not satisfy and replace, an existing debt obligation, is not a refinancing under § 1003.2(p).</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">New York State consolidation, extension, and modification agreements.</E> Where a transaction is completed pursuant to a New York State consolidation, extension, and modification agreement and is classified as a supplemental mortgage under New York Tax Law section§ 255, such that the borrower owes reduced or no mortgage recording taxes, and where, but for the agreement, the transaction would have met the definition of a refinancing under § 1003.2(p), the transaction is considered a refinancing under § 1003.2(p). <E T="03">See also</E> comment 2(d)-2.ii.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Existing debt obligation.</E> A closed-end mortgage loan or an open-end line of credit that satisfies and replaces one or more existing debt obligations is not a refinancing under § 1003.2(p) unless the existing debt obligation (or obligations) also was secured by a dwelling. For example, assume that a borrower has an existing $30,000 closed-end mortgage loan and obtains a new $50,000 closed-end mortgage loan that satisfies and replaces the existing $30,000 loan. The new $50,000 loan is a refinancing under § 1003.2(p). However, if the borrower obtains a new $50,000 closed-end mortgage loan that satisfies and replaces an existing $30,000 loan secured only by a personal guarantee, the new $50,000 loan is not a refinancing under § 1003.2(p). <E T="03">See</E> § 1003.4(a)(3) and related commentary for guidance about how to report the loan purpose of such transactions, if they are not otherwise excluded under § 1003.3(c).</P>
          <P>4. <E T="03">Same borrower.</E> Section 1003.2(p) provides that, even if all of the other requirements of § 1003.2(p) are met, a closed-end mortgage loan or an open-end line of credit is not a refinancing unless the same borrower undertakes both the existing and the new obligation(s). Under § 1003.2(p), the “same borrower” undertakes both the existing and the new obligation(s) even if only one borrower is the same on both obligations. For example, assume that an existing closed-end mortgage loan (obligation X) is satisfied and replaced by a new closed-end mortgage loan (obligation Y). If borrowers A and B both are obligated on obligation X, and only borrower B is obligated on obligation Y, then obligation Y is a refinancing under § 1003.2(p), assuming the other requirements of § 1003.2(p) are met, because borrower B is obligated on both transactions. On the other hand, if only borrower A is obligated on obligation X, and only borrower B is obligated on obligation Y, then obligation Y is not a refinancing under § 1003.2(p). For example, assume that two spouses are divorcing. If both spouses are obligated on obligation X, but only one spouse is obligated on obligation Y, then obligation Y is a refinancing under § 1003.2(p), assuming the other requirements of § 1003.2(p) are met. On the other hand, if only spouse A is obligated on obligation X, and only spouse B is obligated on obligation Y, then obligation Y is not a refinancing under § 1003.2(p). <E T="03">See</E> § 1003.4(a)(3) and related commentary for guidance about how to report the loan purpose of such transactions, if they are not otherwise excluded under § 1003.3(c).</P>
          <P>5. <E T="03">Two or more debt obligations.</E> Section 1003.2(p) provides that, to be a refinancing, a new debt obligation must satisfy and replace an existing debt obligation. Where two or more new obligations replace an existing obligation, each new obligation is a refinancing if, taken together, the new obligations satisfy the existing obligation. Similarly, where one new obligation replaces two or more existing obligations, the new obligation is a refinancing if it satisfies each of the existing obligations.</P>
          <P>6. <E T="03">Multiple-purpose loans.</E> A closed-end mortgage loan or an open-end line of credit may be used for multiple purposes. For example, a closed-end mortgage loan that is a refinancing under § 1003.2(p) may also be a home improvement loan under § 1003.2(i) and be used for other purposes if the refinancing is a cash-out refinancing and the funds will be used both for home improvement and to pay college tuition. Such a transaction is a multiple-purpose loan. Comment 4(a)(3)-3 provides details about how to report multiple-purpose covered loans.</P>

A <PRTPAGE P="104"/>loan or line of credit is secured by a lien on unimproved land if the loan or line of credit is secured by vacant or unimproved property, unless the institution knows, based on information that it receives from the applicant or borrower at the time the application is received or the credit decision is made, that the proceeds of that loan or credit line will be used within two years after closing or account opening to construct a dwelling on, or to purchase a dwelling to be placed on, the land. A loan or line of credit that is not excludable under § 1003.3(c)(2) nevertheless may be excluded, for example, as temporary financing under § 1003.3(c)(3).</P>

          <P>
            <E T="03">1. Temporary financing.</E> Section 1003.3(c)(3) provides that closed-end mortgage loans or open-end lines of credit obtained for temporary financing are excluded transactions. A loan or line of credit is considered temporary financing and excluded under § 1003.3(c)(3) if the loan or line of credit is designed to be replaced by separate permanent financing extended by any financial institution to the same borrower at a later time. For example:</P>
          <P>i. Lender A extends credit in the form of a bridge or swing loan to finance a borrower's down payment on a home purchase. The borrower pays off the bridge or swing loan with funds from the sale of his or her existing home and obtains permanent financing for his or her new home from Lender A or from another lender. The bridge or swing loan is excluded as temporary financing under § 1003.3(c)(3).</P>
          <P>ii. Lender A extends credit to a borrower to finance construction of a dwelling. The borrower will obtain a new extension of credit for permanent financing for the dwelling, either from Lender A or from another lender, and either through a refinancing of the initial construction loan or a separate loan. The initial construction loan is excluded as temporary financing under § 1003.3(c)(3).</P>
          <P>iii. Assume the same scenario as in comment 3(c)(3)-1.ii, except that the initial construction loan is, or may be, renewed one or more times before the separate permanent financing is obtained. The initial construction loan, including any renewal thereof, is excluded as temporary financing under § 1003.3(c)(3).</P>

          <P>iv. Lender A extends credit to finance construction of a dwelling. The loan automatically will convert to permanent financing extended to the same borrower with Lender A once the construction phase is complete. Under § 1003.3(c)(3), the loan is not designed to be replaced by separate permanent financing extended to the same borrower, and therefore the temporary financing exclusion does not apply. <E T="03">See also</E> comment 2(j)-3.</P>
          <P>v. Lender A originates a loan with a nine-month term to enable an investor to purchase a home, renovate it, and re-sell it before the term expires. Under § 1003.3(c)(3), the loan is not designed to be replaced by separate permanent financing extended to the same borrower, and therefore the temporary financing exclusion does not apply. Such a transaction is not temporary financing under § 1003.3(c)(3) merely because its term is short.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Loan or line of credit to construct a dwelling for sale.</E> A construction-only loan or line of credit is considered temporary financing and excluded under § 1003.3(c)(3) if the loan or line of credit is extended to a person exclusively to construct a dwelling for sale. See comment 3(c)(3)-1.ii through .iv for examples of the reporting requirement for construction loans that are not extended to a person exclusively to construct a dwelling for sale.</P>

          <P>1. <E T="03">Purchase of an interest in a pool of loans.</E> Section 1003.3(c)(4) provides that the purchase of an interest in a pool of closed-end mortgage loans or open-end lines of credit is an excluded transaction.

If a financial institution acquires loans or lines of credit in bulk from another institution (for example, from the receiver for a failed institution), but no merger or acquisition of an institution, or acquisition of a branch office, is involved and no other exclusion applies, the acquired loans or lines of credit are covered loans and are reported as described in comment 4(a)-1.iii.</P>

If an institution acquires only a partial interest in a loan or line of credit, the institution does not report the transaction even if the institution participated in the underwriting and origination of the loan or line of credit. If an institution acquires a 100 percent interest in a loan or line of credit, the transaction is not excluded under § 1003.3(c)(8).<PRTPAGE P="105"/>

          <P>1. <E T="03">Loan or line of credit used primarily for agricultural purposes.</E> Section 1003.3(c)(9) provides that an institution does not report a closed-end mortgage loan or an open-end line of credit used primarily for agricultural purposes. A loan or line of credit is used primarily for agricultural purposes if its funds will be used primarily for agricultural purposes, or if the loan or line of credit is secured by a dwelling that is located on real property that is used primarily for agricultural purposes (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> a farm). An institution may refer to comment 3(a)-8 in the official interpretations of Regulation Z, 12 CFR part 1026, supplement I, for guidance on what is an agricultural purpose. An institution may use any reasonable standard to determine the primary use of the property. An institution may select the standard to apply on a case-by-case basis.</P>

          <P>1. <E T="03">General.</E> Section 1003.3(c)(10) provides a special rule for reporting a closed-end mortgage loan or an open-end line of credit that is or will be made primarily for a business or commercial purpose. If an institution determines that a closed-end mortgage loan or an open-end line of credit primarily is for a business or commercial purpose, then the loan or line of credit is a covered loan only if it is a home improvement loan under § 1003.2(i), a home purchase loan under § 1003.2(j), or a refinancing under § 1003.2(p) and no other exclusion applies. Section 1003.3(c)(10) does not categorically exclude all business- or commercial-purpose loans and lines of credit from coverage.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Primary purpose.</E> An institution must determine in each case if a closed-end mortgage loan or an open-end line of credit primarily is for a business or commercial purpose. If a closed-end mortgage loan or an open-end line of credit is deemed to be primarily for a business, commercial, or organizational purpose under Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.3(a) and its related commentary, then the loan or line of credit also is deemed to be primarily for a business or commercial purpose under § 1003.3(c)(10).</P>

          <P>i.

          <P>ii. A closed-end mortgage loan or an open-end line of credit to improve a doctor's office or a daycare center that is located in a dwelling other than a multifamily dwelling; and</P>
          <P>iii. A closed-end mortgage loan or an open-end line of credit to a corporation, if the funds from the loan or line of credit will be used to purchase or to improve a dwelling, or if the transaction is a refinancing.</P>

          <P>i. A closed-end mortgage loan or an open-end line of credit whose funds will be used primarily to improve or expand a business, for example to renovate a family restaurant that is not located in a dwelling, or to purchase a warehouse, business equipment, or inventory;</P>
          <P>ii. A closed-end mortgage loan or an open-end line of credit to a corporation whose funds will be used primarily for business purposes, such as to purchase inventory; and</P>
          <P>iii. A closed-end mortgage loan or an open-end line of credit whose funds will be used primarily for business or commercial purposes other than home purchase, home improvement, or refinancing, even if the loan or line of credit is cross-collateralized by a covered loan.</P>

          <P>1. <E T="03">New funds extended before consolidation.</E> Section 1003.3(c)(13) provides an exclusion for a transaction that provided or, in the case of an application, proposed to provide new funds to the borrower in advance of being consolidated in a New York State consolidation, extension, and modification agreement classified as a supplemental mortgage under New York Tax Law section 255 (New York CEMA) and for which final action is taken on both transactions within the same calendar year. The excluded transaction provides or proposes to provide funds that are not part of any existing debt obligation of the borrower and that are then consolidated or proposed to be consolidated with an existing debt obligation or obligations as part of the supplemental mortgage. The new funds are reported only insofar as they form part of the total amount of the reported New York CEMA, and not as a separate amount. This exclusion applies only if, at the time the transaction that provided new funds was originated, the financial institution intended to consolidate the loan into a New York CEMA. If a New York CEMA that consolidates an excluded preliminary transaction is carried out in a transaction involving an assumption, the financial institution reports the New York CEMA and does not report the preliminary transaction separately. The § 1003.3(c)(13) exclusion does not apply to similar preliminary transactions that provide or propose to provide new funds to be consolidated not pursuant to New York Tax Law section 255 but under some other law in a transaction that is not an extension of credit. For example, assume a financial institution extends new funds to a consumer in a preliminary transaction that is then consolidated as part of a consolidation, extension and modification agreement pursuant to the law of a State other than New York. If the preliminary extension of new funds is a covered loan, it must be reported. If the consolidation, extension and modification agreement pursuant to the law of a State other than New York is not an extension of credit pursuant to Regulation C, it may not be reported.

          <P>1. <E T="03">General.</E> Section 1003.4(a) describes a financial institution's obligation to collect data on applications it received, on covered loans that it originated, and on covered loans that it purchased during the calendar year covered by the loan/application register.<PRTPAGE P="107"/>
          </P>
          <P>i. A financial institution reports these data even if the covered loans were subsequently sold by the institution.</P>
          <P>ii. A financial institution reports data for applications that did not result in an origination but on which actions were taken-for example, an application that the institution denied, that it approved but that was not accepted, that it closed for incompleteness, or that the applicant withdrew during the calendar year covered by the loan/application register. A financial institution is required to report data regarding requests under a preapproval program (as defined in § 1003.2(b)(2)) only if the preapproval request is denied, results in the origination of a home purchase loan, or was approved but not accepted.</P>
          <P>iii. If a financial institution acquires covered loans in bulk from another institution (for example, from the receiver for a failed institution), but no merger or acquisition of an institution, or acquisition of a branch office, is involved, the acquiring financial institution reports the covered loans as purchased loans.</P>
          <P>iv. A financial institution reports the data for an application on the loan/application register for the calendar year during which the application was acted upon even if the institution received the application in a previous calendar year.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Originations and applications involving more than one institution.</E> Section 1003.4(a) requires a financial institution to collect certain information regarding applications for covered loans that it receives and regarding covered loans that it originates. The following provides guidance on how to report originations and applications involving more than one institution. The discussion below assumes that all of the parties are financial institutions as defined by § 1003.2(g). The same principles apply if any of the parties is not a financial institution. Comment 4(a)-3 provides examples of transactions involving more than one institution, and comment 4(a)-4 discusses how to report actions taken by agents.</P>
          <P>i. Only one financial institution reports each originated covered loan as an origination. If more than one institution was involved in the origination of a covered loan, the financial institution that made the credit decision approving the application before closing or account opening reports the loan as an origination. It is not relevant whether the loan closed or, in the case of an application, would have closed in the institution's name. If more than one institution approved an application prior to closing or account opening and one of those institutions purchased the loan after closing, the institution that purchased the loan after closing reports the loan as an origination. If a financial institution reports a transaction as an origination, it reports all of the information required for originations, even if the covered loan was not initially payable to the financial institution that is reporting the covered loan as an origination.</P>
          <P>ii. In the case of an application for a covered loan that did not result in an origination, a financial institution reports the action it took on that application if it made a credit decision on the application or was reviewing the application when the application was withdrawn or closed for incompleteness. It is not relevant whether the financial institution received the application from the applicant or from another institution, such as a broker, or whether another financial institution also reviewed and reported an action taken on the same application.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Examples—originations and applications involving more than one institution.</E> The following scenarios illustrate how an institution reports a particular application or covered loan. The illustrations assume that all of the parties are financial institutions as defined by § 1003.2(g). However, the same principles apply if any of the parties is not a financial institution.</P>
          <P>i. Financial Institution A received an application for a covered loan from an applicant and forwarded that application to Financial Institution B. Financial Institution B reviewed the application and approved the loan prior to closing. The loan closed in Financial Institution A's name. Financial Institution B purchased the loan from Financial Institution A after closing. Financial Institution B was not acting as Financial Institution A's agent. Since Financial Institution B made the credit decision prior to closing, Financial Institution B reports the transaction as an origination, not as a purchase. Financial Institution A does not report the transaction.</P>
          <P>ii. Financial Institution A received an application for a covered loan from an applicant and forwarded that application to Financial Institution B. Financial Institution B reviewed the application before the loan would have closed, but the application did not result in an origination because Financial Institution B denied the application. Financial Institution B was not acting as Financial Institution A's agent. Since Financial Institution B made the credit decision, Financial Institution B reports the application as a denial. Financial Institution A does not report the application. If, under the same facts, the application was withdrawn before Financial Institution B made a credit decision, Financial Institution B would report the application as withdrawn and Financial Institution A would not report the application.</P>

          <P>iii. Financial Institution A received an application for a covered loan from an applicant and approved the application before <PRTPAGE P="108"/>closing the loan in its name. Financial Institution A was not acting as Financial Institution B's agent. Financial Institution B purchased the covered loan from Financial Institution A. Financial Institution B did not review the application before closing. Financial Institution A reports the loan as an origination. Financial Institution B reports the loan as a purchase.</P>
          <P>iv. Financial Institution A received an application for a covered loan from an applicant. If approved, the loan would have closed in Financial Institution B's name. Financial Institution A denied the application without sending it to Financial Institution B for approval. Financial Institution A was not acting as Financial Institution B's agent. Since Financial Institution A made the credit decision before the loan would have closed, Financial Institution A reports the application. Financial Institution B does not report the application.</P>

          <P>v. Financial Institution A reviewed an application and made the credit decision to approve a covered loan using the underwriting criteria provided by a third party (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> another financial institution, Fannie Mae, or Freddie Mac). The third party did not review the application and did not make a credit decision prior to closing. Financial Institution A was not acting as the third party's agent. Financial Institution A reports the application or origination. If the third party purchased the loan and is subject to Regulation C, the third party reports the loan as a purchase whether or not the third party reviewed the loan after closing. Assume the same facts, except that Financial Institution A approved the application, and the applicant chose not to accept the loan from Financial Institution A. Financial Institution A reports the application as approved but not accepted and the third party, assuming the third party is subject to Regulation C, does not report the application.</P>
          <P>vi. Financial Institution A reviewed and made the credit decision on an application based on the criteria of a third-party insurer or guarantor (for example, a government or private insurer or guarantor). Financial Institution A reports the action taken on the application.</P>
          <P>vii. Financial Institution A received an application for a covered loan and forwarded it to Financial Institutions B and C. Financial Institution A made a credit decision, acting as Financial Institution D's agent, and approved the application. The applicant did not accept the loan from Financial Institution D. Financial Institution D reports the application as approved but not accepted. Financial Institution A does not report the application. Financial Institution B made a credit decision, approving the application, the applicant accepted the offer of credit from Financial Institution B, and credit was extended. Financial Institution B reports the origination. Financial Institution C made a credit decision and denied the application. Financial Institution C reports the application as denied.</P>
          <P>4. <E T="03">Agents.</E> If a financial institution made the credit decision on a covered loan or application through the actions of an agent, the institution reports the application or origination. State law determines whether one party is the agent of another. For example, acting as Financial Institution A's agent, Financial Institution B approved an application prior to closing and a covered loan was originated. Financial Institution A reports the loan as an origination.</P>
          <P>5. <E T="03">Purchased loans.</E> i. A financial institution is required to collect data regarding covered loans it purchases. For purposes of § 1003.4(a), a purchase includes a repurchase of a covered loan, regardless of whether the institution chose to repurchase the covered loan or was required to repurchase the covered loan because of a contractual obligation and regardless of whether the repurchase occurs within the same calendar year that the covered loan was originated or in a different calendar year. For example, assume that Financial Institution A originates or purchases a covered loan and then sells it to Financial Institution B, who later requires Financial Institution A to repurchase the covered loan pursuant to the relevant contractual obligations. Financial Institution B reports the purchase from Financial Institution A, assuming it is a financial institution as defined under § 1003.2(g). Financial Institution A reports the repurchase from Financial Institution B as a purchase.</P>

          <P>ii. In contrast, for purposes of § 1003.4(a), a purchase does not include a temporary transfer of a covered loan to an interim funder or warehouse creditor as part of an interim funding agreement under which the originating financial institution is obligated to repurchase the covered loan for sale to a subsequent investor. Such agreements, often referred to as “repurchase agreements,” are sometimes employed as functional equivalents of warehouse lines of credit. Under these agreements, the interim funder or warehouse creditor acquires legal title to the covered loan, subject to an obligation of the originating institution to repurchase at a future date, rather than taking a security interest in the covered loan as under the terms of a more conventional warehouse line of credit. To illustrate, assume Financial Institution A has an interim funding agreement with Financial Institution B to enable Financial Institution B to originate loans. Assume further that Financial Institution B originates a covered loan and that, pursuant to this agreement, Financial Institution A takes a temporary transfer of the covered loan until Financial Institution B arranges <PRTPAGE P="109"/>for the sale of the covered loan to a subsequent investor and that Financial Institution B repurchases the covered loan to enable it to complete the sale to the subsequent investor (alternatively, Financial Institution A may transfer the covered loan directly to the subsequent investor at Financial Institution B's direction, pursuant to the interim funding agreement). The subsequent investor could be, for example, a financial institution or other entity that intends to hold the loan in portfolio, a GSE or other securitizer, or a financial institution or other entity that intends to package and sell multiple loans to a GSE or other securitizer. In this example, the temporary transfer of the covered loan from Financial Institution B to Financial Institution A is not a purchase, and any subsequent transfer back to Financial Institution B for delivery to the subsequent investor is not a purchase, for purposes of § 1003.4(a). Financial Institution B reports the origination of the covered loan as well as its sale to the subsequent investor. If the subsequent investor is a financial institution under § 1003.2(g), it reports a purchase of the covered loan pursuant to § 1003.4(a), regardless of whether it acquired the covered loan from Financial Institution B or directly from Financial Institution A.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 4(a)(1)(i)</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">ULI—uniqueness.</E> Section 1003.4(a)(1)(i)(B)(<E T="03">2</E>) requires a financial institution that assigns a universal loan identifier (ULI) to each covered loan or application (except as provided in § 1003.4(a)(1)(i)(D) and (E)) to ensure that the character sequence it assigns is unique within the institution and used only for the covered loan or application. A financial institution should assign only one ULI to any particular covered loan or application, and each ULI should correspond to a single application and ensuing loan in the case that the application is approved and a loan is originated. A financial institution may use a ULI that was reported previously to refer only to the same loan or application for which the ULI was used previously or a loan that ensues from an application for which the ULI was used previously. A financial institution may not report an application for a covered loan in 2030 using the same ULI that was reported for a covered loan that was originated in 2020. Similarly, refinancings or applications for refinancing should be assigned a different ULI than the loan that is being refinanced. A financial institution with multiple branches must ensure that its branches do not use the same ULI to refer to multiple covered loans or applications.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">ULI—privacy.</E> Section 1003.4(a)(1)(i)(B)(<E T="03">3</E>) prohibits a financial institution from including information that could be used to directly identify the applicant or borrower in the identifier that it assigns for the application or covered loan of the applicant or borrower. Information that could be used to directly identify the applicant or borrower includes, but is not limited to, the applicant's or borrower's name, date of birth, Social Security number, official government-issued driver's license or identification number, alien registration number, government passport number, or employer or taxpayer identification number.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">ULI—purchased covered loan.</E> If a financial institution has previously assigned a covered loan with a ULI or reported a covered loan with a ULI under this part, a financial institution that purchases that covered loan must report the same ULI that was previously assigned or reported. For example, if a loan origination previously was reported under this part with a ULI, the financial institution that purchases the covered loan would report the purchase of the covered loan using the same ULI. A financial institution that purchases a covered loan must use the ULI that was assigned by the financial institution that originated the covered loan. A financial institution that purchases a covered loan assigns a ULI and records and submits it in its loan/application register pursuant to § 1003.5(a)(1) if the covered loan was not assigned a ULI by the financial institution that originated the loan because, for example, the loan was originated prior to January 1, 2018, or the loan was originated by an institution not required to report under this part.</P>
          <P>4. <E T="03">ULI—reinstated or reconsidered application.</E> A financial institution may not use a ULI previously reported if it reinstates or reconsiders an application that was reported in a prior calendar year. For example, if a financial institution reports a denied application in its annual 2020 data submission, pursuant to § 1003.5(a)(1), but then reconsiders the application, resulting in an origination in 2021, the financial institution reports a denied application under the original ULI in its annual 2020 data submission and an origination with a different ULI in its annual 2021 data submission, pursuant to § 1003.5(a)(1).</P>
          <P>5. <E T="03">ULI—check digit.</E> Section 1003.(4)(a)(1)(i)(C) requires that the two right-most characters in the ULI represent the check digit. Appendix C prescribes the requirements for generating a check digit and validating a ULI.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 4(a)(1)(ii)</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Application date—consistency.</E> Section 1003.4(a)(1)(ii) requires that, in reporting the date of application, a financial institution report the date it received the application, as defined under § 1003.2(b), or the date shown on the application form. Although a financial institution need not choose the same approach for its entire HMDA submission, it should be generally consistent (such as by <PRTPAGE P="110"/>routinely using one approach within a particular division of the institution or for a category of loans). If the financial institution chooses to report the date shown on the application form and the institution retains multiple versions of the application form, the institution reports the date shown on the first application form satisfying the application definition provided under § 1003.2(b).</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Application date—indirect application.</E> For an application that was not submitted directly to the financial institution, the institution may report the date the application was received by the party that initially received the application, the date the application was received by the institution, or the date shown on the application form. Although an institution need not choose the same approach for its entire HMDA submission, it should be generally consistent (such as by routinely using one approach within a particular division of the institution or for a category of loans).</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Application date—reinstated application.</E> If, within the same calendar year, an applicant asks a financial institution to reinstate a counteroffer that the applicant previously did not accept (or asks the institution to reconsider an application that was denied, withdrawn, or closed for incompleteness), the institution may treat that request as the continuation of the earlier transaction using the same ULI or as a new transaction with a new ULI. If the institution treats the request for reinstatement or reconsideration as a new transaction, it reports the date of the request as the application date. If the institution does not treat the request for reinstatement or reconsideration as a new transaction, it reports the original application date.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 4(a)(2)</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Loan type—general.</E> If a covered loan is not, or in the case of an application would not have been, insured by the Federal Housing Administration, guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs, or guaranteed by the Rural Housing Service or the Farm Service Agency, an institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(2) by reporting the covered loan as not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, Rural Housing Service, or Farm Service Agency.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 4(a)(3)</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Purpose—statement of applicant.</E> A financial institution may rely on the oral or written statement of an applicant regarding the proposed use of covered loan proceeds. For example, a lender could use a check-box or a purpose line on a loan application to determine whether the applicant intends to use covered loan proceeds for home improvement purposes. If an applicant provides no statement as to the proposed use of covered loan proceeds and the covered loan is not a home purchase loan, cash-out refinancing, or refinancing, a financial institution reports the covered loan as for a purpose other than home purchase, home improvement, refinancing, or cash-out refinancing for purposes of § 1003.4(a)(3).</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Purpose—refinancing and cash-out refinancing.</E> Section 1003.4(a)(3) requires a financial institution to report whether a covered loan is, or an application is for, a refinancing or a cash-out refinancing. A financial institution reports a covered loan or an application as a cash-out refinancing if it is a refinancing as defined by § 1003.2(p) and the institution considered it to be a cash-out refinancing in processing the application or setting the terms (such as the interest rate or origination charges) under its guidelines or an investor's guidelines. For example:</P>
          <P>i. Assume a financial institution considers an application for a loan product to be a cash-out refinancing under an investor's guidelines because of the amount of cash received by the borrower at closing or account opening. Assume also that under the investor's guidelines, the applicant qualifies for the loan product and the financial institution approves the application, originates the covered loan, and sets the terms of the covered loan consistent with the loan product. In this example, the financial institution would report the covered loan as a cash-out refinancing for purposes of § 1003.4(a)(3).</P>
          <P>ii. Assume a financial institution does not consider an application for a covered loan to be a cash-out refinancing under its own guidelines because the amount of cash received by the borrower does not exceed a certain threshold. Assume also that the institution approves the application, originates the covered loan, and sets the terms of the covered loan consistent with its own guidelines applicable to refinancings other than cash-out refinancings. In this example, the financial institution would report the covered loan as a refinancing for purposes of § 1003.4(a)(3).</P>
          <P>iii. Assume a financial institution does not distinguish between a cash-out refinancing and a refinancing under its own guidelines, and sets the terms of all refinancings without regard to the amount of cash received by the borrower at closing or account opening, and does not offer loan products under investor guidelines. In this example, the financial institution reports all covered loans and applications for covered loans that are defined by § 1003.2(p) as refinancings for purposes of § 1003.4(a)(3).</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Purpose—multiple-purpose loan.</E> Section 1003.4(a)(3) requires a financial institution to report the purpose of a covered loan or application. If a covered loan is a home purchase loan as well as a home improvement loan, a <PRTPAGE P="111"/>refinancing, or a cash-out refinancing, an institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(3) by reporting the loan as a home purchase loan. If a covered loan is a home improvement loan as well as a refinancing or cash-out refinancing, but the covered loan is not a home purchase loan, an institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(3) by reporting the covered loan as a refinancing or a cash-out refinancing, as appropriate. If a covered loan is a refinancing or cash-out refinancing as well as for another purpose, such as for the purpose of paying educational expenses, but the covered loan is not a home purchase loan, an institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(3) by reporting the covered loan as a refinancing or a cash-out refinancing, as appropriate. <E T="03">See</E> comment 4(a)(3)-2. If a covered loan is a home improvement loan as well as for another purpose, but the covered loan is not a home purchase loan, a refinancing, or cash-out refinancing, an institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(3) by reporting the covered loan as a home improvement loan. <E T="03">See</E> comment 2(i)-1.</P>
          <P>4. <E T="03">Purpose—other.</E> If a covered loan is not, or an application is not for, a home purchase loan, a home improvement loan, a refinancing, or a cash-out refinancing, a financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(3) by reporting the covered loan or application as for a purpose other than home purchase, home improvement, refinancing, or cash-out refinancing. For example, if a covered loan is for the purpose of paying educational expenses, the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(3) by reporting the covered loan as for a purpose other than home purchase, home improvement, refinancing, or cash-out refinancing. Section 1003.4(a)(3) also requires an institution to report a covered loan or application as for a purpose other than home purchase, home improvement, refinancing, or cash-out refinancing if it is a refinancing but, under the terms of the agreement, the financial institution was unconditionally obligated to refinance the obligation subject to conditions within the borrower's control.</P>
          <P>5. <E T="03">Purpose—business or commercial purpose loans.</E> If a covered loan primarily is for a business or commercial purpose as described in § 1003.3(c)(10) and comment 3(c)(10)-2 and is a home purchase loan, home improvement loan, or a refinancing, § 1003.4(a)(3) requires the financial institution to report the applicable loan purpose. If a loan primarily is for a business or commercial purpose but is not a home purchase loan, home improvement loan, or a refinancing, the loan is an excluded transaction under § 1003.3(c)(10).</P>
          <P>6. <E T="03">Purpose—purchased loans.</E> For purchased covered loans where origination took place prior to January 1, 2018, a financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(3) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 4(a)(4)</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Request under a preapproval program.</E> Section 1003.4(a)(4) requires a financial institution to report whether an application or covered loan involved a request for a preapproval of a home purchase loan under a preapproval program as defined by § 1003.2(b)(2). If an application or covered loan did not involve a request for a preapproval of a home purchase loan under a preapproval program as defined by § 1003.2(b)(2), a financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(4) by reporting that the application or covered loan did not involve such a request, regardless of whether the institution has such a program and the applicant did not apply through that program or the institution does not have a preapproval program as defined by § 1003.2(b)(2).</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Scope of requirement.</E> A financial institution reports that the application or covered loan did not involve a preapproval request for a purchased covered loan; an application or covered loan for any purpose other than a home purchase loan; an application for a home purchase loan or a covered loan that is a home purchase loan secured by a multifamily dwelling; an application or covered loan that is an open-end line of credit or a reverse mortgage; or an application that is denied, withdrawn by the applicant, or closed for incompleteness.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 4(a)(5)</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Modular homes and prefabricated components.</E> Covered loans or applications related to modular homes should be reported with a construction method of site-built, regardless of whether they are on-frame or off-frame modular homes. Modular homes comply with local or other recognized buildings codes rather than standards established by the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act, 42 U.S.C. 5401 <E T="03">et seq.</E> Modular homes are not required to have HUD Certification Labels under 24 CFR 3280.11 or data plates under 24 CFR 3280.5. Modular homes may have a certification from a State licensing agency that documents compliance with State or other applicable building codes. On-frame modular homes are constructed on permanent metal chassis similar to those used in manufactured homes. The chassis are not removed on site and are secured to the foundation. Off-frame modular homes typically have floor construction similar to the construction of other site-built homes, and the construction typically includes wooden floor joists and does not include permanent metal chassis. Dwellings built using prefabricated components assembled at the dwelling's permanent site should also be reported with a construction method of site-built.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Multifamily dwelling.</E> For a covered loan or an application for a covered loan related <PRTPAGE P="112"/>to a multifamily dwelling, the financial institution should report the construction method as site-built unless the multifamily dwelling is a manufactured home community, in which case the financial institution should report the construction method as manufactured home.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Multiple properties.</E> See comment 4(a)(9)-2 regarding transactions involving multiple properties with more than one property taken as security.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 4(a)(6)</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Multiple properties.</E> See comment 4(a)(9)-2 regarding transactions involving multiple properties with more than one property taken as security.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Principal residence.</E> Section 1003.4(a)(6) requires a financial institution to identify whether the property to which the covered loan or application relates is or will be used as a residence that the applicant or borrower physically occupies and uses, or will occupy and use, as his or her principal residence. For purposes of § 1003.4(a)(6), an applicant or borrower can have only one principal residence at a time. Thus, a vacation or other second home would not be a principal residence. However, if an applicant or borrower buys or builds a new dwelling that will become the applicant's or borrower's principal residence within a year or upon the completion of construction, the new dwelling is considered the principal residence for purposes of applying this definition to a particular transaction.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Second residences.</E> Section 1003.4(a)(6) requires a financial institution to identify whether the property to which the loan or application relates is or will be used as a second residence. For purposes of § 1003.4(a)(6), a property is a second residence of an applicant or borrower if the property is or will be occupied by the applicant or borrower for a portion of the year and is not the applicant's or borrower's principal residence. For example, if a person purchases a property, occupies the property for a portion of the year, and rents the property for the remainder of the year, the property is a second residence for purposes of § 1003.4(a)(6). Similarly, if a couple occupies a property near their place of employment on weekdays, but the couple returns to their principal residence on weekends, the property near the couple's place of employment is a second residence for purposes of § 1003.4(a)(6).</P>
          <P>4. <E T="03">Investment properties.</E> Section 1003.4(a)(6) requires a financial institution to identify whether the property to which the covered loan or application relates is or will be used as an investment property. For purposes of § 1003.4(a)(6), a property is an investment property if the borrower does not, or the applicant will not, occupy the property. For example, if a person purchases a property, does not occupy the property, and generates income by renting the property, the property is an investment property for purposes of § 1003.4(a)(6). Similarly, if a person purchases a property, does not occupy the property, and does not generate income by renting the property, but intends to generate income by selling the property, the property is an investment property for purposes of § 1003.4(a)(6). Section 1003.4(a)(6) requires a financial institution to identify a property as an investment property if the borrower or applicant does not or will not occupy the property, even if the borrower or applicant does not consider the property as owned for investment purposes. For example, if a corporation purchases a property that is a dwelling under § 1003.2(f), that it does not occupy, but that is for the long-term residential use of its employees, the property is an investment property for purposes of § 1003.4(a)(6), even if the corporation considers the property as owned for business purposes rather than investment purposes, does not generate income by renting the property, and does not intend to generate income by selling the property at some point in time. If the property is for transitory use by employees, the property would not be considered a dwelling under § 1003.2(f). <E T="03">See</E> comment 2(f)-3.</P>
          <P>5. <E T="03">Purchased covered loans.</E> For purchased covered loans, a financial institution may report principal residence unless the loan documents or application indicate that the property will not be occupied as a principal residence.</P>

          <P>1. <E T="03">Covered loan amount—counteroffer.</E> If an applicant accepts a counteroffer for an amount different from the amount for which the applicant applied, the financial institution reports the covered loan amount granted. If an applicant does not accept a counteroffer or fails to respond, the institution reports the amount initially requested.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Covered loan amount—application approved but not accepted or preapproval request approved but not accepted.</E> A financial institution reports the covered loan amount that was approved.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Covered loan amount—preapproval request denied, application denied, closed for incompleteness or withdrawn.</E> For a preapproval request that was denied, and for an application that was denied, closed for incompleteness, or withdrawn, a financial institution reports the amount for which the applicant applied.</P>
          <P>4. <E T="03">Covered loan amount—multiple-purpose loan.</E> A financial institution reports the entire amount of the covered loan, even if only a part of the proceeds is intended for home purchase, home improvement, or refinancing.</P>
          <P>5. <E T="03">Covered loan amount—closed-end mortgage loan.</E> For a closed-end mortgage loan, other than a purchased loan, an assumption, or a <PRTPAGE P="113"/>reverse mortgage, a financial institution reports the amount to be repaid as disclosed on the legal obligation. For a purchased closed-end mortgage loan or an assumption of a closed-end mortgage loan, a financial institution reports the unpaid principal balance at the time of purchase or assumption.</P>
          <P>6. <E T="03">Covered loan amount—open-end line of credit.</E> For an open-end line of credit, a financial institution reports the entire amount of credit available to the borrower under the terms of the open-end plan, including a purchased open-end line of credit and an assumption of an open-end line of credit, but not for a reverse mortgage open-end line of credit.</P>
          <P>7. <E T="03">Covered loan amount—refinancing.</E> For a refinancing, a financial institution reports the amount of credit extended under the terms of the new debt obligation.</P>
          <P>8. <E T="03">Covered loan amount—home improvement loan.</E> A financial institution reports the entire amount of a home improvement loan, even if only a part of the proceeds is intended for home improvement.</P>
          <P>9. <E T="03">Covered loan amount—non-federally insured reverse mortgage.</E> A financial institution reports the initial principal limit of a non-federally insured reverse mortgage as set forth in § 1003.4(a)(7)(iii).</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 4(a)(8)(i)</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Action taken—covered loan originated.</E> A financial institution reports that the covered loan was originated if the financial institution made a credit decision approving the application before closing or account opening and that credit decision results in an extension of credit. The same is true for an application that began as a request for a preapproval that subsequently results in a covered loan being originated. <E T="03">See</E> comments 4(a)-2 through -4 for guidance on transactions in which more than one institution is involved.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Action taken—covered loan purchased.</E> A financial institution reports that the covered loan was purchased if the covered loan was purchased by the financial institution after closing or account opening and the financial institution did not make a credit decision on the application prior to closing or account opening, or if the financial institution did make a credit decision on the application prior to closing or account opening, but is repurchasing the loan from another entity that the loan was sold to. <E T="03">See</E> comment 4(a)-5. <E T="03">See</E> comments 4(a)-2 through -4 for guidance on transactions in which more than one financial institution is involved.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Action taken—application approved but not accepted.</E> A financial institution reports application approved but not accepted if the financial institution made a credit decision approving the application before closing or account opening, subject solely to outstanding conditions that are customary commitment or closing conditions, but the applicant or the party that initially received the application fails to respond to the financial institution's approval within the specified time, or the closed-end mortgage loan was not otherwise consummated or the account was not otherwise opened. <E T="03">See</E> comment 4(a)(8)(i)-13.</P>
          <P>4. <E T="03">Action taken—application denied.</E> A financial institution reports that the application was denied if it made a credit decision denying the application before an applicant withdraws the application or the file is closed for incompleteness. <E T="03">See</E> comments 4(a)-2 through -4 for guidance on transactions in which more than one institution is involved.</P>
          <P>5. <E T="03">Action taken—application withdrawn.</E> A financial institution reports that the application was withdrawn when the application is expressly withdrawn by the applicant before the financial institution makes a credit decision denying the application, before the financial institution makes a credit decision approving the application, or before the file is closed for incompleteness. A financial institution also reports application withdrawn if the financial institution provides a conditional approval specifying underwriting or creditworthiness conditions, pursuant to comment 4(a)(8)(i)-13, and the application is expressly withdrawn by the applicant before the applicant satisfies all specified underwriting or creditworthiness conditions. A preapproval request that is withdrawn is not reportable under HMDA. <E T="03">See</E> § 1003.4(a).</P>
          <P>6. <E T="03">Action taken—file closed for incompleteness.</E> A financial institution reports that the file was closed for incompleteness if the financial institution sent a written notice of incompleteness under Regulation B, 12 CFR 1002.9(c)(2), and the applicant did not respond to the request for additional information within the period of time specified in the notice before the applicant satisfies all underwriting or creditworthiness conditions. <E T="03">See</E> comment 4(a)(8)(i)-13. If a financial institution then provides a notification of adverse action on the basis of incompleteness under Regulation B, 12 CFR 1002.9(c)(1)(i), the financial institution may report the action taken as either file closed for incompleteness or application denied. A preapproval request that is closed for incompleteness is not reportable under HMDA. <E T="03">See</E> § 1003.4(a) and comment 4(a)-1.ii.</P>
          <P>7. <E T="03">Action taken—preapproval request denied.</E> A financial institution reports that the preapproval request was denied if the application was a request for a preapproval under a preapproval program as defined in § 1003.2(b)(2) and the institution made a credit decision denying the preapproval request.</P>
          <P>8. <E T="03">Action taken—preapproval request approved but not accepted.</E> A financial institution reports that the preapproval request was approved but not accepted if the application was a request for a preapproval under a <PRTPAGE P="114"/>preapproval program as defined in § 1003.2(b)(2) and the institution made a credit decision approving the preapproval request but the application did not result in a covered loan originated by the financial institution.</P>
          <P>9. <E T="03">Action taken—counteroffers.</E> If a financial institution makes a counteroffer to lend on terms different from the applicant's initial request (for example, for a shorter loan maturity, with a different interest rate, or in a different amount) and the applicant declines to proceed with the counteroffer or fails to respond, the institution reports the action taken as a denial on the original terms requested by the applicant. If the applicant agrees to proceed with consideration of the financial institution's counteroffer, the financial institution reports the action taken as the disposition of the application based on the terms of the counteroffer. For example, assume a financial institution makes a counteroffer, the applicant agrees to proceed with the terms of the counteroffer, and the financial institution then makes a credit decision approving the application conditional on satisfying underwriting or creditworthiness conditions, and the applicant expressly withdraws before satisfying all underwriting or creditworthiness conditions and before the institution denies the application or closes the file for incompleteness. The financial institution reports that the action taken as application withdrawn in accordance with comment 4(a)(8)(i)-13.i. Similarly, assume a financial institution makes a counteroffer, the applicant agrees to proceed with consideration of the counteroffer, and the financial institution provides a conditional approval stating the conditions to be met to originate the counteroffer. The financial institution reports the action taken on the application in accordance with comment 4(a)(8)(i)-13 regarding conditional approvals.</P>
          <P>10. <E T="03">Action taken—rescinded transactions.</E> If a borrower rescinds a transaction after closing and before a financial institution is required to submit its loan/application register containing the information for the transaction under § 1003.5(a), the institution reports the transaction as an application that was approved but not accepted.</P>
          <P>11. <E T="03">Action taken—purchased covered loans.</E> An institution reports the covered loans that it purchased during the calendar year. An institution does not report the covered loans that it declined to purchase, unless, as discussed in comments 4(a)-2 through -4, the institution reviewed the application prior to closing, in which case it reports the application or covered loan according to comments 4(a)-2 through -4.</P>
          <P>12. <E T="03">Action taken—repurchased covered loans.</E> See comment 4(a)-5 regarding reporting requirements when a covered loan is repurchased by the originating financial institution.</P>
          <P>13. <E T="03">Action taken—conditional approvals.</E> If an institution issues an approval other than a commitment pursuant to a preapproval program as defined under § 1003.2(b)(2), and that approval is subject to the applicant meeting certain conditions, the institution reports the action taken as provided below dependent on whether the conditions are solely customary commitment or closing conditions or if the conditions include any underwriting or creditworthiness conditions.</P>
          <P>i. <E T="03">Action taken examples.</E> If the approval is conditioned on satisfying underwriting or creditworthiness conditions and they are not met, the institution reports the action taken as a denial. If, however, the conditions involve submitting additional information about underwriting or creditworthiness that the institution needs to make the credit decision, and the institution has sent a written notice of incompleteness under Regulation B, 12 CFR 1002.9(c)(2), and the applicant did not respond within the period of time specified in the notice, the institution reports the action taken as file closed for incompleteness. <E T="03">See</E> comment 4(a)(8)(i)-6. If the conditions are solely customary commitment or closing conditions and the conditions are not met, the institution reports the action taken as approved but not accepted. If all the conditions (underwriting, creditworthiness, or customary commitment or closing conditions) are satisfied and the institution agrees to extend credit but the covered loan is not originated, the institution reports the action taken as application approved but not accepted. If the applicant expressly withdraws before satisfying all underwriting or creditworthiness conditions and before the institution denies the application or closes the file for incompleteness, the institution reports the action taken as application withdrawn. If all underwriting and creditworthiness conditions have been met, and the outstanding conditions are solely customary commitment or closing conditions and the applicant expressly withdraws before the covered loan is originated, the institution reports the action taken as application approved but not accepted.</P>
          <P>ii. <E T="03">Customary commitment or closing conditions.</E> Customary commitment or closing conditions include, for example: a clear-title requirement, an acceptable property survey, acceptable title insurance binder, clear termite inspection, a subordination agreement from another lienholder, and, where the applicant plans to use the proceeds from the sale of one home to purchase another, a settlement statement showing adequate proceeds from the sale.</P>
          <P>iii. <E T="03">Underwriting or creditworthiness conditions.</E> Underwriting or creditworthiness conditions include, for example: conditions that constitute a counter-offer, such as a demand for a higher down-payment; satisfactory <PRTPAGE P="115"/>debt-to-income or loan-to-value ratios, a determination of need for private mortgage insurance, or a satisfactory appraisal requirement; or verification or confirmation, in whatever form the institution requires, that the applicant meets underwriting conditions concerning applicant creditworthiness, including documentation or verification of income or assets.</P>
          <P>14. <E T="03">Action taken—pending applications.</E> An institution does not report any covered loan application still pending at the end of the calendar year; it reports that application on its loan/application register for the year in which final action is taken.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 4(a)(8)(ii)</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Action taken date—general.</E> A financial institution reports the date of the action taken.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Action taken date—applications denied and files closed for incompleteness.</E> For applications, including requests for a preapproval, that are denied or for files closed for incompleteness, the financial institution reports either the date the action was taken or the date the notice was sent to the applicant.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Action taken date—application withdrawn.</E> For applications withdrawn, the financial institution may report the date the express withdrawal was received or the date shown on the notification form in the case of a written withdrawal.</P>
          <P>4. <E T="03">Action taken date—approved but not accepted.</E> For a covered loan approved by an institution but not accepted by the applicant, the institution reports any reasonable date, such as the approval date, the deadline for accepting the offer, or the date the file was closed. Although an institution need not choose the same approach for its entire HMDA submission, it should be generally consistent (such as by routinely using one approach within a particular division of the institution or for a category of covered loans).</P>
          <P>5. <E T="03">Action taken date—originations.</E> For covered loan originations, including a preapproval request that leads to an origination by the financial institution, an institution generally reports the closing or account opening date. For covered loan originations that an institution acquires from a party that initially received the application, the institution reports either the closing or account opening date, or the date the institution acquired the covered loan from the party that initially received the application. If the disbursement of funds takes place on a date later than the closing or account opening date, the institution may use the date of initial disbursement. For a construction/permanent covered loan, the institution reports either the closing or account opening date, or the date the covered loan converts to the permanent financing. Although an institution need not choose the same approach for its entire HMDA submission, it should be generally consistent (such as by routinely using one approach within a particular division of the institution or for a category of covered loans). Notwithstanding this flexibility regarding the use of the closing or account opening date in connection with reporting the date action was taken, the institution must report the origination as occurring in the year in which the origination goes to closing or the account is opened.</P>
          <P>6. <E T="03">Action taken date—loan purchased.</E> For covered loans purchased, a financial institution reports the date of purchase.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 4(a)(9)</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Multiple properties with one property taken as security.</E> If a covered loan is related to more than one property, but only one property is taken as security (or, in the case of an application, proposed to be taken as security), a financial institution reports the information required by § 1003.4(a)(9) for the property taken as or proposed to be taken as security. A financial institution does not report the information required by § 1003.4(a)(9) for the property or properties related to the loan that are not taken as or proposed to be taken as security. For example, if a covered loan is secured by property A, and the proceeds are used to purchase or rehabilitate (or to refinance home purchase or home improvement loans related to) property B, the institution reports the information required by § 1003.4(a)(9) for property A and does not report the information required by § 1003.4(a)(9) for property B.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Multiple properties with more than one property taken as security.</E> If more than one property is taken or, in the case of an application, proposed to be taken as security for a single covered loan, a financial institution reports the covered loan or application in a single entry on its loan/application register and provides the information required by § 1003.4(a)(9) for one of the properties taken as security that contains a dwelling. A financial institution does not report information about the other properties taken as security. If an institution is required to report specific information about the property identified in § 1003.4(a)(9), the institution reports the information that relates to the property identified in § 1003.4(a)(9). For example, Financial Institution A originated a covered loan that is secured by both property A and property B, each of which contains a dwelling. Financial Institution A reports the loan as one entry on its loan/application register, reporting the information required by § 1003.4(a)(9) for either property A or property B. If Financial Institution A elects to report the information required by § 1003.4(a)(9) about property A, Financial Institution A also reports the information required by § 1003.4(a)(5), (6), (14), (29), and (30) related to property A. For <PRTPAGE P="116"/>aspects of the entries that do not refer to the property identified in § 1003.4(a)(9) (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> § 1003.4(a)(1) through (4), (7), (8), (10) through (13), (15) through (28), (31) through (38)), Financial Institution A reports the information applicable to the covered loan or application and not information that relates only to the property identified in § 1003.4(a)(9).</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Multifamily dwellings.</E> A single multifamily dwelling may have more than one postal address. For example, three apartment buildings, each with a different street address, comprise a single multifamily dwelling that secures a covered loan. For the purposes of § 1003.4(a)(9), a financial institution reports the information required by § 1003.4(a)(9) in the same manner described in comment 4(a)(9)-2.</P>
          <P>4. <E T="03">Loans purchased from another institution.</E> The requirement to report the property location information required by § 1003.4(a)(9) applies not only to applications and originations but also to purchased covered loans.</P>
          <P>5. <E T="03">Manufactured home.</E> If the site of a manufactured home has not been identified, a financial institution complies by reporting that the information required by § 1003.4(a)(9) is not applicable.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 4(a)(9)(i)</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">General.</E> Section 1003.4(a)(9)(i) requires a financial institution to report the property address of the location of the property securing a covered loan or, in the case of an application, proposed to secure a covered loan. The address should correspond to the property identified on the legal obligation related to the covered loan. For applications that did not result in an origination, the address should correspond to the location of the property proposed to secure the loan as identified by the applicant. For example, assume a loan is secured by a property located at 123 Main Street, and the applicant's or borrower's mailing address is a post office box. The financial institution should not report the post office box, and should report 123 Main Street.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Property address—format.</E> A financial institution complies with the requirements in § 1003.4(a)(9)(i) by reporting the following information about the physical location of the property securing the loan.</P>
          <P>i. <E T="03">Street address.</E> When reporting the street address of the property, a financial institution complies by including, as applicable, the primary address number, the predirectional, the street name, street prefixes and/or suffixes, the postdirectional, the secondary address identifier, and the secondary address, as applicable. For example, 100 N Main ST Apt 1.</P>
          <P>ii. <E T="03">City name.</E> A financial institution complies by reporting the name of the city in which the property is located.</P>
          <P>iii. <E T="03">State name.</E> A financial institution complies by reporting the two letter State code for the State in which the property is located, using the U.S. Postal Service official State abbreviations.</P>
          <P>iv. <E T="03">Zip Code.</E> A financial institution complies by reporting the five or nine digit Zip Code in which the property is located.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Property address—not applicable.</E> A financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(9)(i) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable if the property address of the property securing the covered loan is not known. For example, if the property did not have a property address at closing or if the applicant did not provide the property address of the property to the financial institution before the application was denied, withdrawn, or closed for incompleteness, the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(9)(i) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 4(a)(9)(ii)</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Optional reporting.</E> Section 1003.4(a)(9)(ii) requires a financial institution to report the State, county, and census tract of the property securing the covered loan or, in the case of an application, proposed to secure the covered loan if the property is located in an MSA or MD in which the financial institution has a home or branch office or if the institution is subject to § 1003.4(e). Section 1003.4(a)(9)(ii)(C) further limits the requirement to report census tract to covered loans secured by or applications proposed to be secured by properties located in counties with a population of more than 30,000 according to the most recent decennial census conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. For transactions for which State, county, or census tract reporting is not required under § 1003.4(a)(9)(ii) or (e), financial institutions may report that the requirement is not applicable, or they may voluntarily report the State, county, or census tract information.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 4(a)(9)(ii)(A)</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Applications—State not provided.</E> When reporting an application, a financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(9)(ii)(A) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable if the State in which the property is located was not known before the application was denied, withdrawn, or closed for incompleteness.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 4(a)(9)(ii)(B)</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">General.</E> A financial institution complies by reporting the five-digit Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) numerical county code.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Applications—county not provided.</E> When reporting an application, a financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(9)(ii)(B) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable if the county in which the property is located was not known before the application <PRTPAGE P="117"/>was denied, withdrawn, or closed for incompleteness.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 4(a)(9)(ii)(C)</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">General.</E> Census tract numbers are defined by the U.S. Census Bureau. A financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(9)(ii)(C) if it uses the boundaries and codes in effect on January 1 of the calendar year covered by the loan/application register that it is reporting.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Applications—census tract not provided.</E> When reporting an application, a financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(9)(ii)(C) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable if the census tract in which the property is located was not known before the application was denied, withdrawn, or closed for incompleteness.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 4(a)(10)(i)</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Applicant data—general.</E> Refer to appendix B to this part for instructions on collection of an applicant's ethnicity, race, and sex.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Transition rule for applicant data collected prior to January 1, 2018.</E> If a financial institution receives an application prior to January 1, 2018, but final action is taken on or after January 1, 2018, the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(10)(i) and (b) if it collects the information in accordance with the requirements in effect at the time the information was collected. For example, if a financial institution receives an application on November 15, 2017, collects the applicant's ethnicity, race, and sex in accordance with the instructions in effect on that date, and takes final action on the application on January 5, 2018, the financial institution has complied with the requirements of § 1003.4(a)(10)(i) and (b), even though those instructions changed after the information was collected but before the date of final action. However, if, in this example, the financial institution collected the applicant's ethnicity, race, and sex on or after January 1, 2018, § 1003.4(a)(10)(i) and (b) requires the financial institution to collect the information in accordance with the amended instructions.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 4(a)(10)(ii)</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Applicant data—completion by financial institution.</E> A financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(10)(ii) by reporting the applicant's age, as of the application date under § 1003.4(a)(1)(ii), as the number of whole years derived from the date of birth as shown on the application form. For example, if an applicant provides a date of birth of 01/15/1970 on the application form that the financial institution receives on 01/14/2015, the institution reports 44 as the applicant's age.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Applicant data—co-applicant.</E> If there are no co-applicants, the financial institution reports that there is no co-applicant. If there is more than one co-applicant, the financial institution reports the age only for the first co-applicant listed on the application form. A co-applicant may provide an absent co-applicant's age on behalf of the absent co-applicant.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Applicant data—purchased loan.</E> A financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(10)(ii) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable when reporting a purchased loan for which the institution chooses not to report the age.</P>
          <P>4. <E T="03">Applicant data—non-natural person.</E> A financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(10)(ii) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable if the applicant or co-applicant is not a natural person (for example, a corporation, partnership, or trust). For example, for a transaction involving a trust, a financial institution reports that the requirement to report the applicant's age is not applicable if the trust is the applicant. On the other hand, if the applicant is a natural person, and is the beneficiary of a trust, a financial institution reports the applicant's age.</P>
          <P>5. <E T="03">Applicant data—guarantor.</E> For purposes of § 1003.4(a)(10)(ii), if a covered loan or application includes a guarantor, a financial institution does not report the guarantor's age.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 4(a)(10)(iii)</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Income data—income relied on.</E> When a financial institution evaluates income as part of a credit decision, it reports the gross annual income relied on in making the credit decision. For example, if an institution relies on an applicant's salary to compute a debt-to-income ratio but also relies on the applicant's annual bonus to evaluate creditworthiness, the institution reports the salary and the bonus to the extent relied upon. If an institution relies on only a portion of an applicant's income in its determination, it does not report that portion of income not relied on. For example, if an institution, pursuant to lender and investor guidelines, does not rely on an applicant's commission income because it has been earned for less than 12 months, the institution does not include the applicant's commission income in the income reported. Likewise, if an institution relies on the verified gross income of the applicant in making the credit decision, then the institution reports the verified gross income. Similarly, if an institution relies on the income of a cosigner to evaluate creditworthiness, the institution includes the cosigner's income to the extent relied upon. An institution, however, does not include the income of a guarantor who is only secondarily liable.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Income data—co-applicant.</E> If two persons jointly apply for a covered loan and both list income on the application, but the financial institution relies on the income of only one <PRTPAGE P="118"/>applicant in evaluating creditworthiness, the institution reports only the income relied on.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Income data—loan to employee.</E> A financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(10)(iii) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable for a covered loan to, or an application from, its employee to protect the employee's privacy, even though the institution relied on the employee's income in making the credit decision.</P>
          <P>4. <E T="03">Income data—assets.</E> A financial institution does not include as income amounts considered in making a credit decision based on factors that an institution relies on in addition to income, such as amounts derived from underwriting calculations of the potential annuitization or depletion of an applicant's remaining assets. Actual distributions from retirement accounts or other assets that are relied on by the financial institution as income should be reported as income. The interpretation of income in this paragraph does not affect § 1003.4(a)(23), which requires, except for purchased covered loans, the collection of the ratio of the applicant's or borrower's total monthly debt to the total monthly income relied on in making the credit decision.</P>
          <P>5. <E T="03">Income data—credit decision not made.</E> Section 1003.4(a)(10)(iii) requires a financial institution to report the gross annual income relied on in processing the application if a credit decision was not made. For example, assume an institution received an application that included an applicant's self-reported income, but the application was withdrawn before a credit decision that would have considered income was made. The financial institution reports the income information relied on in processing the application at the time that the application was withdrawn or the file was closed for incompleteness.</P>
          <P>6. <E T="03">Income data—credit decision not requiring consideration of income.</E> A financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(10)(iii) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable if the application did not or would not have required a credit decision that considered income under the financial institution's policies and procedures. For example, if the financial institution's policies and procedures do not consider income for a streamlined refinance program, the institution reports that the requirement is not applicable, even if the institution received income information from the applicant.</P>
          <P>7. <E T="03">Income data—non-natural person.</E> A financial institution reports that the requirement is not applicable when the applicant or co-applicant is not a natural person (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> a corporation, partnership, or trust). For example, for a transaction involving a trust, a financial institution reports that the requirement to report income data is not applicable if the trust is the applicant. On the other hand, if the applicant is a natural person, and is the beneficiary of a trust, a financial institution is required to report the information described in § 1003.4(a)(10)(iii).</P>
          <P>8. <E T="03">Income data—multifamily properties.</E> A financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(10)(iii) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable when the covered loan is secured by, or application is proposed to be secured by, a multifamily dwelling.</P>
          <P>9. <E T="03">Income data—purchased loans.</E> A financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(10)(iii) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable when reporting a purchased covered loan for which the institution chooses not to report the income.</P>
          <P>10. <E T="03">Income data—rounding.</E> A financial institution complies by reporting the dollar amount of the income in thousands, rounded to the nearest thousand ($500 rounds up to the next $1,000). For example, $35,500 is reported as 36.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 4(a)(11)</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Type of purchaser—loan-participation interests sold to more than one entity.</E> A financial institution that originates a covered loan, and then sells it to more than one entity, reports the “type of purchaser” based on the entity purchasing the greatest interest, if any. For purposes of § 1003.4(a)(11), if a financial institution sells some interest or interests in a covered loan but retains a majority interest in that loan, it does not report the sale.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Type of purchaser—swapped covered loans.</E> Covered loans “swapped” for mortgage-backed securities are to be treated as sales; the purchaser is the entity receiving the covered loans that are swapped.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Type of purchaser—affiliate institution.</E> For purposes of complying with § 1003.4(a)(11), the term “affiliate” means any company that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, another company, as set forth in the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 1841 <E T="03">et seq.</E>).</P>
          <P>4. <E T="03">Type of purchaser—private securitizations.</E> A financial institution that knows or reasonably believes that the covered loan it is selling will be securitized by the entity purchasing the covered loan, other than by one of the government-sponsored enterprises, reports the purchasing entity type as a private securitizer regardless of the type or affiliation of the purchasing entity. Knowledge or reasonable belief could, for example, be based on the purchase agreement or other related documents, the financial institution's previous transactions with the purchaser, or the purchaser's role as a securitizer (such as an investment bank). If a financial institution selling a covered loan does not know or reasonably believe that the purchaser will securitize the loan, and the seller knows that the purchaser frequently holds or disposes of <PRTPAGE P="119"/>loans by means other than securitization, then the financial institution should report the covered loan as purchased by, as appropriate, a commercial bank, savings bank, savings association, life insurance company, credit union, mortgage company, finance company, affiliate institution, or other type of purchaser.</P>
          <P>5. <E T="03">Type of purchaser—mortgage company.</E> For purposes of complying with § 1003.4(a)(11), a mortgage company means a nondepository institution that purchases covered loans and typically originates such loans. A mortgage company might be an affiliate or a subsidiary of a bank holding company or thrift holding company, or it might be an independent mortgage company. Regardless, a financial institution reports the purchasing entity type as a mortgage company, unless the mortgage company is an affiliate of the seller institution, in which case the seller institution should report the loan as purchased by an affiliate institution.</P>
          <P>6. <E T="03">Purchases by subsidiaries.</E> A financial institution that sells a covered loan to its subsidiary that is a commercial bank, savings bank, or savings association, should report the covered loan as purchased by a commercial bank, savings bank, or savings association. A financial institution that sells a covered loan to its subsidiary that is a life insurance company, should report the covered loan as purchased by a life insurance company. A financial institution that sells a covered loan to its subsidiary that is a credit union, mortgage company, or finance company, should report the covered loan as purchased by a credit union, mortgage company, or finance company. If the subsidiary that purchases the covered loan is not a commercial bank, savings bank, savings association, life insurance company, credit union, mortgage company, or finance company, the seller institution should report the loan as purchased by other type of purchaser. The financial institution should report the covered loan as purchased by an affiliate institution when the subsidiary is an affiliate of the seller institution.</P>
          <P>7. <E T="03">Type of purchaser—bank holding company or thrift holding company.</E> When a financial institution sells a covered loan to a bank holding company or thrift holding company (rather than to one of its subsidiaries), it should report the loan as purchased by other type of purchaser, unless the bank holding company or thrift holding company is an affiliate of the seller institution, in which case the seller institution should report the loan as purchased by an affiliate institution.</P>
          <P>8. <E T="03">Repurchased covered loans.</E> See comment 4(a)-5 regarding reporting requirements when a covered loan is repurchased by the originating financial institution.</P>
          <P>9. <E T="03">Type of purchaser—quarterly recording.</E> For purposes of recording the type of purchaser within 30 calendar days after the end of the calendar quarter pursuant to § 1003.4(f), a financial institution records that the requirement is not applicable if the institution originated or purchased a covered loan and did not sell it during the calendar quarter for which the institution is recording the data. If the financial institution sells the covered loan in a subsequent quarter of the same calendar year, the financial institution records the type of purchaser on its loan/application register for the quarter in which the covered loan was sold. If a financial institution sells the covered loan in a succeeding year, the financial institution should not record the sale.</P>
          <P>10. <E T="03">Type of purchaser—not applicable.</E> A financial institution reports that the requirement is not applicable for applications that were denied, withdrawn, closed for incompleteness or approved but not accepted by the applicant; and for preapproval requests that were denied or approved but not accepted by the applicant. A financial institution also reports that the requirement is not applicable if the institution originated or purchased a covered loan and did not sell it during that same calendar year.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 4(a)(12)</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Average prime offer rate.</E> Average prime offer rates are annual percentage rates derived from average interest rates and other loan pricing terms offered to borrowers by a set of creditors for mortgage loans that have low-risk pricing characteristics. Other loan pricing terms may include commonly used indices, margins, and initial fixed-rate periods for variable-rate transactions. Relevant pricing characteristics may include a consumer's credit history and transaction characteristics such as the loan-to-value ratio, owner-occupant status, and purpose of the transaction. To obtain average prime offer rates, the Bureau uses creditor data by transaction type.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Bureau tables.</E> The Bureau publishes tables of current and historic average prime offer rates by transaction type on the FFIEC's Web site (<E T="03">http://www.ffiec.gov/hmda</E>) and the Bureau's Web site (<E T="03">https://www.consumerfinance.gov</E>). The Bureau calculates an annual percentage rate, consistent with Regulation Z (<E T="03">see</E> 12 CFR 1026.22 and 12 CFR part 1026, appendix J), for each transaction type for which pricing terms are available from the creditor data described in comment 4(a)(12)-1. The Bureau uses loan pricing terms available in the creditor data and other information to estimate annual percentage rates for other types of transactions for which the creditor data are limited or not available. The Bureau publishes on the FFIEC's Web site and the Bureau's Web site the methodology it uses to arrive at these estimates. A financial institution may <PRTPAGE P="120"/>either use the average prime offer rates published by the Bureau or determine average prime offer rates itself by employing the methodology published on the FFIEC's Web site and the Bureau's Web site. A financial institution that determines average prime offer rates itself, however, is responsible for correctly determining the rates in accordance with the published methodology.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Rate spread calculation—annual percentage rate.</E> The requirements of § 1003.4(a)(12)(i) refer to the covered loan's annual percentage rate. For closed-end mortgage loans, a financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(12)(i) by relying on the annual percentage rate for the covered loan, as calculated and disclosed pursuant to Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.18 or 1026.38. For open-end lines of credit, a financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(12)(i) by relying on the annual percentage rate for the covered loan, as calculated and disclosed pursuant to Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.6. If multiple annual percentage rates are calculated and disclosed pursuant to Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.6, a financial institution relies on the annual percentage rate in effect at the time of account opening. If an open-end line of credit has a variable-rate feature and a fixed-rate and -term payment option during the draw period, a financial institution relies on the annual percentage rate in effect at the time of account opening under the variable-rate feature, which would be a discounted initial rate if one is offered under the variable-rate feature. See comment 4(a)(12)-8 for guidance regarding the annual percentage rate a financial institution relies on in the case of an application or preapproval request that was approved but not accepted.</P>
          <P>4. <E T="03">Rate spread calculation—comparable transaction.</E> The rate spread calculation in § 1003.4(a)(12)(i) is defined by reference to a comparable transaction, which is determined according to the covered loan's amortization type (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> fixed- or variable-rate) and loan term. For covered loans that are open-end lines of credit, § 1003.4(a)(12)(i) requires a financial institution to identify the most closely comparable closed-end transaction. The tables of average prime offer rates published by the Bureau (see comment 4(a)(12)-2) provide additional detail about how to identify the comparable transaction.</P>
          <P>i. <E T="03">Fixed-rate transactions.</E> For fixed-rate covered loans, the term for identifying the comparable transaction is the transaction's maturity (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the period until the last payment will be due under the closed-end mortgage loan contract or open-end line of credit agreement). If an open-end credit plan has a fixed rate but no definite plan length, a financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(12)(i) by using a 30-year fixed-rate loan as the most closely comparable closed-end transaction. Financial institutions may refer to the table on the FFIEC Web site entitled “Average Prime Offer Rates-Fixed” when identifying a comparable fixed-rate transaction.</P>
          <P>ii. <E T="03">Variable-rate transactions.</E> For variable-rate covered loans, the term for identifying the comparable transaction is the initial, fixed-rate period (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the period until the first scheduled rate adjustment). For example, five years is the relevant term for a variable-rate transaction with a five-year, fixed-rate introductory period that is amortized over thirty years. Financial institutions may refer to the table on the FFIEC Web site entitled “Average Prime Offer Rates-Variable” when identifying a comparable variable-rate transaction. If an open-end line of credit has a variable rate and an optional, fixed-rate feature, a financial institution uses the rate table for variable-rate transactions.</P>
          <P>iii. <E T="03">Term not in whole years.</E> When a covered loan's term to maturity (or, for a variable-rate transaction, the initial fixed-rate period) is not in whole years, the financial institution uses the number of whole years closest to the actual loan term or, if the actual loan term is exactly halfway between two whole years, by using the shorter loan term. For example, for a loan term of ten years and three months, the relevant term is ten years; for a loan term of ten years and nine months, the relevant term is 11 years; for a loan term of ten years and six months, the relevant term is ten years. If a loan term includes an odd number of days, in addition to an odd number of months, the financial institution rounds to the nearest whole month, or rounds down if the number of odd days is exactly halfway between two months. The financial institution rounds to one year any covered loan with a term shorter than six months, including variable-rate covered loans with no initial, fixed-rate periods. For example, if an open-end covered loan has a rate that varies according to an index plus a margin, with no introductory, fixed-rate period, the transaction term is one year.</P>
          <P>iv. <E T="03">Amortization period longer than loan term.</E> If the amortization period of a covered loan is longer than the term of the transaction to maturity, § 1003.4(a)(12)(i) requires a financial institution to use the loan term to determine the applicable average prime offer rate. For example, assume a financial institution originates a closed-end, fixed-rate loan that has a term to maturity of five years and a thirty-year amortization period that results in a balloon payment. The financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(12)(i) by using the five-year loan term.</P>
          <P>5. <E T="03">Rate-set date.</E> The relevant date to use to determine the average prime offer rate for a comparable transaction is the date on which <PRTPAGE P="121"/>the interest rate was set by the financial institution for the final time before final action is taken (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the application was approved but not accepted or the covered loan was originated).</P>
          <P>i. <E T="03">Rate-lock agreement.</E> If an interest rate is set pursuant to a “lock-in” agreement between the financial institution and the borrower, then the date on which the agreement fixes the interest rate is the date the rate was set. Except as provided in comment 4(a)(12)-5.ii, if a rate is reset after a lock-in agreement is executed (for example, because the borrower exercises a float-down option or the agreement expires), then the relevant date is the date the financial institution exercises discretion in setting the rate for the final time before final action is taken. The same rule applies when a rate-lock agreement is extended and the rate is reset at the same rate, regardless of whether market rates have increased, decreased, or remained the same since the initial rate was set. If no lock-in agreement is executed, then the relevant date is the date on which the institution sets the rate for the final time before final action is taken.</P>
          <P>ii. <E T="03">Change in loan program.</E> If a financial institution issues a rate-lock commitment under one loan program, the borrower subsequently changes to another program that is subject to different pricing terms, and the financial institution changes the rate promised to the borrower under the rate-lock commitment accordingly, the rate-set date is the date of the program change. However, if the financial institution changes the promised rate to the rate that would have been available to the borrower under the new program on the date of the original rate-lock commitment, then that is the date the rate is set, provided the financial institution consistently follows that practice in all such cases or the original rate-lock agreement so provided. For example, assume that a borrower locks a rate of 2.5 percent on June 1 for a 30-year, variable-rate loan with a five-year, fixed-rate introductory period. On June 15, the borrower decides to switch to a 30-year, fixed-rate loan, and the rate available to the borrower for that product on June 15 is 4.0 percent. On June 1, the 30-year, fixed-rate loan would have been available to the borrower at a rate of 3.5 percent. If the financial institution offers the borrower the 3.5 percent rate (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the rate that would have been available to the borrower for the fixed-rate product on June 1, the date of the original rate-lock) because the original agreement so provided or because the financial institution consistently follows that practice for borrowers who change loan programs, then the financial institution should use June 1 as the rate-set date. In all other cases, the financial institution should use June 15 as the rate-set date.</P>
          <P>iii. <E T="03">Brokered loans.</E> When a financial institution has reporting responsibility for an application for a covered loan that it received from a broker, as discussed in comment 4(a)-2 (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> because the financial institution makes a credit decision prior to closing or account opening), the rate-set date is the last date the financial institution set the rate with the broker, not the date the broker set the borrower's rate.</P>
          <P>6. <E T="03">Compare the annual percentage rate to the average prime offer rate.</E> Section 1003.4(a)(12)(i) requires a financial institution to compare the covered loan's annual percentage rate to the most recently available average prime offer rate that was in effect for the comparable transaction as of the rate-set date. For purposes of § 1003.4(a)(12)(i), the most recently available rate means the average prime offer rate set forth in the applicable table with the most recent effective date as of the date the interest rate was set. However, § 1003.4(a)(12)(i) does not permit a financial institution to use an average prime offer rate before its effective date.</P>
          <P>7. <E T="03">Rate spread—not applicable.</E> If the covered loan is an assumption, reverse mortgage, a purchased loan, or is not subject to Regulation Z, 12 CFR part 1026, a financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(12) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable. If the application did not result in an origination for a reason other than the application was approved but not accepted by the applicant, a financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(12) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable.</P>
          <P>8. <E T="03">Application or preapproval request approved but not accepted.</E> In the case of an application or preapproval request that was approved but not accepted, § 1003.4(a)(12) requires a financial institution to report the applicable rate spread. In such cases, the financial institution would provide early disclosures under Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.18 or 1026.37 (for closed-end mortgage loans), or 1026.40 (for open-end lines of credit), but might never provide any subsequent disclosures. In such cases where no subsequent disclosures are provided, a financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(12)(i) by relying on the annual percentage rate for the application or preapproval request, as calculated and disclosed pursuant to Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.18 or 1026.37 (for closed-end mortgage loans), or 1026.40 (for open-end lines of credit), as applicable. For transactions subject to Regulation C for which no disclosures under Regulation Z are required, a financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(12)(i) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable.<PRTPAGE P="122"/>
          </P>
          <P>9. <E T="03">Corrected disclosures.</E> In the case of a covered loan or an application that was approved but not accepted, if the annual percentage rate changes because a financial institution provides a corrected version of the disclosures required under Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.19(a), pursuant to 12 CFR 1026.19(a)(2), under 12 CFR 1026.19(f), pursuant to 12 CFR 1026.19(f)(2), or under 12 CFR 1026.6(a), the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(12)(i) by comparing the corrected and disclosed annual percentage rate to the most recently available average prime offer rate that was in effect for a comparable transaction as of the rate-set date, provided that the corrected disclosure was provided to the borrower prior to the end of the reporting period in which final action is taken. For purposes of § 1003.4(a)(12), the date the corrected disclosure was provided to the borrower is the date the disclosure was mailed or delivered to the borrower in person; the financial institution's method of delivery does not affect the date provided. For example, where a financial institution provides a corrected version of the disclosures required under 12 CFR 1026.19(f), pursuant to 12 CFR 1026.19(f)(2), the date provided is the date disclosed pursuant to Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.38(a)(3)(i). The provision of a corrected disclosure does not affect how a financial institution determines the rate-set date. <E T="03">See</E> comment 4(a)(12)-5. For example, in the case of a financial institution's annual loan/application register submission made pursuant to § 1003.5(a)(1), if the financial institution provides a corrected disclosure to the borrower pursuant to Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.19(f)(2)(v), that reflects a corrected annual percentage rate, the financial institution reports the difference between the corrected annual percentage rate and the most recently available average prime offer rate that was in effect for a comparable transaction as of the rate-set date if the corrected disclosure was provided to the borrower prior to the end of the calendar year in which final action is taken.</P>

          <P>1. <E T="03">HOEPA status—not applicable.</E> If the covered loan is not subject to the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994, as implemented in Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.32, a financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(13) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable. If an application did not result in an origination, a financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(13) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable.</P>

          <P>1. <E T="03">Determining lien status for applications and covered loans originated and purchased.</E> i. Financial institutions are required to report lien status for covered loans they originate and purchase and applications that do not result in originations (preapproval requests that are approved but not accepted, preapproval requests that are denied, applications that are approved but not accepted, denied, withdrawn, or closed for incompleteness). For covered loans purchased by a financial institution, lien status is determined by reference to the best information readily available to the financial institution at the time of purchase. For covered loans that a financial institution originates and applications that do not result in originations, lien status is determined by reference to the best information readily available to the financial institution at the time final action is taken and to the financial institution's own procedures. Thus, financial institutions may rely on the title search they routinely perform as part of their underwriting procedures—for example, for home purchase loans. Regulation C does not require financial institutions to perform title searches solely to comply with HMDA reporting requirements. Financial institutions may rely on other information that is readily available to them at the time final action is taken and that they reasonably believe is accurate, such as the applicant's statement on the application or the applicant's credit report. For example, where the applicant indicates on the application that there is a mortgage on the property or where the applicant's credit report shows that the applicant has a mortgage—and that mortgage will not be paid off as part of the transaction—the financial institution may assume that the loan it originates is secured by a subordinate lien. If the same application did not result in an origination—for example, because the application was denied or withdrawn—the financial institution would report the application as an application for a subordinate-lien loan.</P>
          <P>ii. Financial institutions may also consider their established procedures when determining lien status for applications that do not result in originations. For example, assume an applicant applies to a financial institution to refinance a $100,000 first mortgage; the applicant also has an open-end line of credit for $20,000. If the financial institution's practice in such a case is to ensure that it will have first-lien position—through a subordination agreement with the holder of the lien securing the open-end line of credit—then the financial institution should report the application as an application for a first-lien covered loan.</P>

          <P>1. <E T="03">Credit score—relied on.</E> Except for purchased covered loans, § 1003.4(a)(15) requires a financial institution to report the credit score or scores relied on in making the credit decision and information about the scoring model used to generate each score. A financial institution relies on a credit score in making the credit decision if the credit score was a factor in the credit decision even if it was not a dispositive factor. For example, if a credit score is one of multiple factors in a financial institution's credit decision, the financial institution has relied on the credit score even if the financial institution denies the application because one or more underwriting requirements other than the credit score are not satisfied.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Credit score—multiple credit scores.</E> When a financial institution obtains or creates two or more credit scores for a single applicant or borrower but relies on only one score in making the credit decision (for example, by relying on the lowest, highest, most recent, or average of all of the scores), the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(15) by reporting that credit score and information about the scoring model used. When a financial institution uses more than one credit scoring model and combines the scores into a composite credit score that it relies on, the financial institution reports that score and reports that more than one credit scoring model was used. When a financial institution obtains or creates two or more credit scores for an applicant or borrower and relies on multiple scores for the applicant or borrower in making the credit decision (for example, by relying on a scoring grid that considers each of the scores obtained or created for the applicant or borrower without combining the scores into a composite score), § 1003.4(a)(15) requires the financial institution to report one of the credit scores for the applicant or borrower that was relied on in making the credit decision. In choosing which credit score to report in this circumstance, a financial institution need not use the same approach for its entire HMDA submission, but it should be generally consistent (such as by routinely using one approach within a particular division of the institution or for a category of covered loans). In instances such as these, the financial institution should report the name and version of the credit scoring model for the score reported.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Credit score—multiple applicants or borrowers.</E> In a transaction involving two or more applicants or borrowers for whom the financial institution obtains or creates a single credit score and relies on that credit score in making the credit decision for the transaction, the institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(15) by reporting that credit score for the applicant and reporting that the requirement is not applicable for the first co-applicant or, at the financial institution's discretion, by reporting that credit score for the first co-applicant and reporting that the requirement is not applicable for the applicant. Otherwise, a financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(15) by reporting a credit score for the applicant that it relied on in making the credit decision, if any, and a credit score for the first co-applicant that it relied on in making the credit decision, if any. To illustrate, assume a transaction involves one applicant and one co-applicant and that the financial institution obtains or creates two credit scores for the applicant and two credit scores for the co-applicant. Assume further that the financial institution relies on a single credit score that is the lowest, highest, most recent, or average of all of the credit scores obtained or created to make the credit decision for the transaction. The financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(15) by reporting that credit score and information about the scoring model used for the applicant and reporting that the requirement is not applicable for the first co-applicant or, at the financial institution's discretion, by reporting the data for the first co-applicant and reporting that the requirement is not applicable for the applicant. Alternatively, assume a transaction involves one applicant and one co-applicant and that the financial institution obtains or creates three credit scores for the applicant and three credit scores for the co-applicant. Assume further that the financial institution relies on the middle credit score for the applicant and the middle credit score for the co-applicant to make the credit decision for the transaction. The financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(15) by reporting both the middle score for the applicant and the middle score for the co-applicant.</P>
          <P>4. <E T="03">Transactions for which no credit decision was made.</E> If a file was closed for incompleteness or the application was withdrawn before a credit decision was made, the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(15) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable, even if the financial institution had obtained or created a credit score for the applicant or co-applicant. For example, if a file is closed for incompleteness and is so reported in accordance with § 1003.4(a)(8), the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(15) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable, even if the financial institution had obtained or created a credit score for the applicant or co-applicant. Similarly, if an application was withdrawn by the applicant before a credit decision was made and is so reported in accordance with § 1003.4(a)(8), the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(15) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable, even if the financial institution had obtained or created a credit score for the applicant or co-applicant.<PRTPAGE P="124"/>

          <P>1. <E T="03">Reason for denial—general.</E> A financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(16) by reporting the principal reason or reasons it denied the application, indicating up to four reasons. The financial institution should report only the principal reason or reasons it denied the application, even if there are fewer than four reasons. For example, if a financial institution denies the application because of the applicant's credit history and debt-to-income ratio, the financial institution need only report these two principal reasons. The reasons reported must be specific and accurately describe the principal reason or reasons the financial institution denied the application.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Reason for denial—preapproval request denied.</E> Section 1003.4(a)(16) requires a financial institution to report the principal reason or reasons it denied the application. A request for a preapproval under a preapproval program as defined by § 1003.2(b)(2) is an application. If a financial institution denies a preapproval request, the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(16) by reporting the reason or reasons it denied the preapproval request.</P>

If a financial institution chooses to provide a disclosure of the applicant's right to a statement of specific reasons using the model form contained in appendix C to Regulation B (Form C-5, Sample Disclosure of Right to Request Specific Reasons for Credit Denial) or a similar form, or chooses to provide the denial reason or reasons orally under Regulation B, 12 CFR 1002.9(a)(2)(ii), the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(16) by entering the principal reason or reasons it denied the application.</P>
          <P>4. <E T="03">Reason for denial—not applicable.</E> A financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(16) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable if the action taken on the application, pursuant to § 1003.4(a)(8), is not a denial. For example, a financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(16) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable if the loan is originated or purchased by the financial institution, or the application or preapproval request was approved but not accepted, or the application was withdrawn before a credit decision was made, or the file was closed for incompleteness.</P>

For purposes of § 1003.4(a)(17)(i), the date the corrected disclosure was provided to the borrower is the date disclosed pursuant to Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.38(a)(3)(i). For example, in the case of a financial institution's annual loan/application register submission made pursuant to § 1003.5(a)(1), if the financial institution provides a corrected disclosure to the borrower to reflect a refund made pursuant to Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.19(f)(2)(v), the financial institution reports the corrected amount of total loan costs only if the corrected disclosure was provided to the borrower prior to <PRTPAGE P="125"/>the end of the calendar year in which closing occurs.</P>

For example, in the case of a financial institution's quarterly submission, the financial institution reports the revised amount of total points and fees only if it cured the overage prior to the end of the quarter in which closing occurred. The financial institution does not report the revised amount of total points and fees in its quarterly submission if it cured the overage after the end of the quarter, even if the cure was effected prior to the deadline for timely submission of the financial institution's quarterly data. However, the financial institution reports the revised amount of total points and fees on its annual loan/application register.</P>

If a financial institution provides a revised or corrected version of the disclosures required under Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.19(e) or (f), pursuant to 12 CFR 1026.19(e)(3)(iv) or (f)(2), as applicable, the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(21) by reporting the interest rate on the revised or corrected disclosure, provided that the revised or corrected disclosure was provided to the borrower prior to the end of the reporting period in which final action is taken. For purposes of § 1003.4(a)(21), the date the revised or corrected disclosure was provided to the borrower is the date disclosed pursuant to Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.37(a)(4) or 1026.38(a)(3)(i), as applicable.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Applications.</E> In the case of an application, § 1003.4(a)(21) requires a financial institution to report the applicable interest rate only if the application has been approved by the financial institution but not accepted by the borrower. In such cases, a financial institution reports the interest rate applicable at the time that the application was approved by the financial institution. A financial institution may report the interest rate appearing on the disclosure provided pursuant to 12 CFR 1026.19(e) or (f) if such disclosure accurately reflects the interest rate at the time the application was approved. For applications that have been denied or withdrawn, or files closed for incompleteness, a financial institution reports that no interest rate was applicable to the application.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Adjustable rate—interest rate unknown.</E> Except as provided in comment 4(a)(21)-1, for adjustable-rate covered loans or applications, if the interest rate is unknown at the time that the application was approved, or at closing or account opening, a financial institution reports the fully-indexed rate based on the index applicable to the covered loan or application. For purposes of § 1003.4(a)(21), the fully-indexed rate is the index value and margin at the time that the application was approved, or, for covered loans, at closing or account opening.<PRTPAGE P="127"/>

          <P>1. <E T="03">Prepayment penalty term—not applicable.</E> Section 1003.4(a)(22) does not require financial institutions to report the term of any prepayment penalty for transactions not subject to Regulation Z, 12 CFR part 1026, such as loans or lines of credit made primarily for business or commercial purposes, or for reverse mortgages or purchased covered loans. In these cases, a financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(22) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable to the transaction.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Transactions for which no prepayment penalty exists.</E> For covered loans or applications that have no prepayment penalty, a financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(22) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable to the transaction. A financial institution may rely on the definitions and commentary to Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.32(b)(6)(i) or (ii) in determining whether the terms of a transaction contain a prepayment penalty.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 4(a)(23)</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">General.</E> For covered loans that are not purchased covered loans, § 1003.4(a)(23) requires a financial institution to report the ratio of the applicant's or borrower's total monthly debt to total monthly income (debt-to-income ratio) relied on in making the credit decision. For example, if a financial institution calculated the applicant's or borrower's debt-to-income ratio twice—once according to the financial institution's own requirements and once according to the requirements of a secondary market investor—and the financial institution relied on the debt-to-income ratio calculated according to the secondary market investor's requirements in making the credit decision, § 1003.4(a)(23) requires the financial institution to report the debt-to-income ratio calculated according to the requirements of the secondary market investor.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Transactions for which a debt-to-income ratio was one of multiple factors.</E> A financial institution relies on the ratio of the applicant's or borrower's total monthly debt to total monthly income (debt-to-income ratio) in making the credit decision if the debt-to-income ratio was a factor in the credit decision even if it was not a dispositive factor. For example, if the debt-to-income ratio was one of multiple factors in a financial institution's credit decision, the financial institution has relied on the debt-to-income ratio and complies with § 1003.4(a)(23) by reporting the debt-to-income ratio, even if the financial institution denied the application because one or more underwriting requirements other than the debt-to-income ratio were not satisfied.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Transactions for which no credit decision was made.</E> If a file was closed for incompleteness, or if an application was withdrawn before a credit decision was made, a financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(23) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable, even if the financial institution had calculated the ratio of the applicant's total monthly debt to total monthly income (debt-to-income ratio). For example, if a file was closed for incompleteness and was so reported in accordance with § 1003.4(a)(8), the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(23) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable, even if the financial institution had calculated the applicant's debt-to-income ratio. Similarly, if an application was withdrawn by the applicant before a credit decision was made, the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(23) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable, even if the financial institution had calculated the applicant's debt-to-income ratio.</P>
          <P>4. <E T="03">Transactions for which no debt-to-income ratio was relied on.</E> Section 1003.4(a)(23) does not require a financial institution to calculate the ratio of an applicant's or borrower's total monthly debt to total monthly income (debt-to-income ratio), nor does it require a financial institution to rely on an applicant's or borrower's debt-to-income ratio in making a credit decision. If a financial institution made a credit decision without relying on the applicant's or borrower's debt-to-income ratio, the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(23) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable since no debt-to-income ratio was relied on in connection with the credit decision.</P>
          <P>5. <E T="03">Non-natural person.</E> A financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(23) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable when the applicant and co-applicant, if applicable, are not natural persons.</P>
          <P>6. <E T="03">Multifamily dwellings.</E> A financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(23) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable for a covered loan secured by, or an application proposed to be secured by, a multifamily dwelling.</P>
          <P>7. <E T="03">Purchased covered loans.</E> A financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(23) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable when reporting a purchased covered loan.</P>

          <P>1. <E T="03">General.</E> Section 1003.4(a)(24) requires a financial institution to report, except for purchased covered loans, the ratio of the total amount of debt secured by the property to the value of the property (combined loan-to-value ratio) relied on in making the credit decision. For example, if a financial institution calculated a combined loan-to-value ratio twice—once according to the financial institution's own requirements and once according to the requirements of a secondary market investor—and the financial institution relied on the combined loan-to-value <PRTPAGE P="128"/>ratio calculated according to the secondary market investor's requirements in making the credit decision, § 1003.4(a)(24) requires the financial institution to report the combined loan-to-value ratio calculated according to the requirements of the secondary market investor.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Transactions for which a combined loan-to-value ratio was one of multiple factors.</E> A financial institution relies on the ratio of the total amount of debt secured by the property to the value of the property (combined loan-to-value ratio) in making the credit decision if the combined loan-to-value ratio was a factor in the credit decision, even if it was not a dispositive factor. For example, if the combined loan-to-value ratio is one of multiple factors in a financial institution's credit decision, the financial institution has relied on the combined loan-to-value ratio and complies with § 1003.4(a)(24) by reporting the combined loan-to-value ratio, even if the financial institution denies the application because one or more underwriting requirements other than the combined loan-to-value ratio are not satisfied.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Transactions for which no credit decision was made.</E> If a file was closed for incompleteness, or if an application was withdrawn before a credit decision was made, a financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(24) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable, even if the financial institution had calculated the ratio of the total amount of debt secured by the property to the value of the property (combined loan-to-value ratio). For example, if a file is closed for incompleteness and is so reported in accordance with § 1003.4(a)(8), the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(24) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable, even if the financial institution had calculated a combined loan-to-value ratio. Similarly, if an application was withdrawn by the applicant before a credit decision was made and is so reported in accordance with § 1003.4(a)(8), the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(24) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable, even if the financial institution had calculated a combined loan-to-value ratio.</P>
          <P>4. <E T="03">Transactions for which no combined loan-to-value ratio was relied on.</E> Section 1003.4(a)(24) does not require a financial institution to calculate the ratio of the total amount of debt secured by the property to the value of the property (combined loan-to-value ratio), nor does it require a financial institution to rely on a combined loan-to-value ratio in making a credit decision. If a financial institution makes a credit decision without relying on a combined loan-to-value ratio, the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(24) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable since no combined loan-to-value ratio was relied on in making the credit decision.</P>
          <P>5. <E T="03">Purchased covered loan.</E> A financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(24) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable when the covered loan is a purchased covered loan.</P>
          <P>6. <E T="03">Property.</E> A financial institution reports the combined loan-to-value ratio relied on in making the credit decision, regardless of which property or properties it used in the combined loan-to-value ratio calculation. The property used in the combined loan-to-value ratio calculation does not need to be the property identified in § 1003.4(a)(9) and may include more than one property and non-real property. For example, if a financial institution originated a covered loan for the purchase of a multifamily dwelling, the loan was secured by the multifamily dwelling and by non-real property, such as securities, and the financial institution used the multifamily dwelling and the non-real property to calculate the combined loan-to-value ratio that it relied on in making the credit decision, § 1003.4(a)(24) requires the financial institution to report the relied upon ratio. Section 1003.4(a)(24) does not require a financial institution to use a particular combined loan-to-value ratio calculation method but instead requires financial institutions to report the combined loan-to-value ratio relied on in making the credit decision.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 4(a)(25)</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Amortization and maturity.</E> For a fully amortizing covered loan, the number of months after which the legal obligation matures is the number of months in the amortization schedule, ending with the final payment. Some covered loans do not fully amortize during the maturity term, such as covered loans with a balloon payment; such loans should still be reported using the maturity term rather than the amortization term, even in the case of covered loans that mature before fully amortizing but have reset options. For example, a 30-year fully amortizing covered loan would be reported with a term of “360,” while a five year balloon covered loan would be reported with a loan term of “60.”</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Non-monthly repayment periods.</E> If a covered loan or application includes a schedule with repayment periods measured in a unit of time other than months, the financial institution should report the covered loan or application term using an equivalent number of whole months without regard for any remainder.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Purchased loans.</E> For a covered loan that was purchased, a financial institution reports the number of months after which the legal obligation matures as measured from the covered loan's origination.</P>
          <P>4. <E T="03">Open-end line of credit.</E> For an open-end line of credit with a definite term, a financial institution reports the number of months from origination until the account <PRTPAGE P="129"/>termination date, including both the draw and repayment period.</P>
          <P>5. <E T="03">Loan or application without a definite term.</E> For a covered loan or application without a definite term, such as a reverse mortgage, a financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(25) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 4(a)(26)</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Types of introductory rates.</E> Section 1003.4(a)(26) requires a financial institution to report the number of months, or proposed number of months in the case of an application, from closing or account opening until the first date the interest rate may change. For example, assume an open-end line of credit contains an introductory or “teaser” interest rate for two months after the date of account opening, after which the interest rate may adjust. In this example, the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(26) by reporting the number of months as “2.” Section 1003.4(a)(26) requires a financial institution to report the number of months based on when the first interest rate adjustment may occur, even if an interest rate adjustment is not required to occur at that time and even if the rates that will apply, or the periods for which they will apply, are not known at closing or account opening. For example, if a closed-end mortgage loan with a 30-year term has an adjustable-rate product with an introductory interest rate for the first 60 months, after which the interest rate is permitted, but not required to vary, according to the terms of an index rate, the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(26) by reporting the number of months as “60.” Similarly, if a closed-end mortgage loan with a 30-year term is a step-rate product with an introductory interest rate for the first 24 months, after which the interest rate will increase to a different known interest rate for the next 36 months, the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(26) by reporting the number of months as “24.”</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Preferred rates.</E> Section 1003.4(a)(26) does not require reporting of introductory interest rate periods based on preferred rates unless the terms of the legal obligation provide that the preferred rate will expire at a certain defined date. Preferred rates include terms of the legal obligation that provide that the initial underlying rate is fixed but that it may increase or decrease upon the occurrence of some future event, such as an employee leaving the employ of the financial institution, the borrower closing an existing deposit account with the financial institution, or the borrower revoking an election to make automated payments. In these cases, because it is not known at the time of closing or account opening whether the future event will occur, and if so, when it will occur, § 1003.4(a)(26) does not require reporting of an introductory interest rate period.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Loan or application with a fixed rate.</E> A financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(26) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable for a covered loan with a fixed rate or an application for a covered loan with a fixed rate.</P>
          <P>4. <E T="03">Purchased loan.</E> A financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(26) by reporting that requirement is not applicable when the covered loan is a purchased covered loan with a fixed rate.</P>
          <P>5. <E T="03">Non-monthly introductory periods.</E> If a covered loan or application includes an introductory interest rate period measured in a unit of time other than months, the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(26) by reporting the introductory interest rate period for the covered loan or application using an equivalent number of whole months without regard for any remainder. For example, assume an open-end line of credit contains an introductory interest rate for 50 days after the date of account opening, after which the interest rate may adjust. In this example, the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(26) by reporting the number of months as “1.” The financial institution must report one month for any introductory interest rate period that totals less than one whole month.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 4(a)(27)</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">General.</E> Section 1003.4(a)(27) requires reporting of contractual features that would allow payments other than fully amortizing payments. Section 1003.4(a)(27) defines the contractual features by reference to Regulation Z, 12 CFR part 1026, but without regard to whether the covered loan is consumer credit, as defined in § 1026.2(a)(12), is extended by a creditor, as defined in § 1026.2(a)(17), or is extended to a consumer, as defined in § 1026.2(a)(11), and without regard to whether the property is a dwelling as defined in § 1026.2(a)(19). For example, assume that a financial institution originates a business-purpose transaction that is exempt from Regulation Z pursuant to 12 CFR 1026.3(a)(1), to finance the purchase of a multifamily dwelling, and that there is a balloon payment, as defined by Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.18(s)(5)(i), at the end of the loan term. The multifamily dwelling is a dwelling under § 1003.2(f), but not under Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.2(a)(19). In this example, the financial institution should report the business-purpose transaction as having a balloon payment under § 1003.4(a)(27)(i), assuming the other requirements of this part are met. Aside from these distinctions, financial institutions may rely on the definitions and related commentary provided in the appropriate sections of Regulation Z referenced in § 1003.4(a)(27) of this part in determining <PRTPAGE P="130"/>whether the contractual feature should be reported.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 4(a)(28).</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">General.</E> A financial institution reports the property value relied on in making the credit decision. For example, if the institution relies on an appraisal or other valuation for the property in calculating the loan-to-value ratio, it reports that value; if the institution relies on the purchase price of the property in calculating the loan-to-value ratio, it reports that value.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Multiple property values.</E> When a financial institution obtains two or more valuations of the property securing or proposed to secure the covered loan, the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(28) by reporting the value relied on in making the credit decision. For example, when a financial institution obtains an appraisal, an automated valuation model report, and a broker price opinion with different values for the property, it reports the value relied on in making the credit decision. Section § 1003.4(a)(28) does not require a financial institution to use a particular property valuation method, but instead requires a financial institution to report the valuation relied on in making the credit decision.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Transactions for which no credit decision was made.</E> If a file was closed for incompleteness or the application was withdrawn before a credit decision was made, the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(28) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable, even if the financial institution had obtained a property value. For example, if a file is closed for incompleteness and is so reported in accordance with § 1003.4(a)(8), the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(28) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable, even if the financial institution had obtained a property value. Similarly, if an application was withdrawn by the applicant before a credit decision was made and is so reported in accordance with § 1003.4(a)(8), the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(28) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable, even if the financial institution had obtained a property value.</P>
          <P>4. <E T="03">Transactions for which no property value was relied on.</E> Section 1003.4(a)(28) does not require a financial institution to obtain a property valuation, nor does it require a financial institution to rely on a property value in making a credit decision. If a financial institution makes a credit decision without relying on a property value, the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(28) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable since no property value was relied on in making the credit decision.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 4(a)(29)</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Classification under State law.</E> A financial institution should report a covered loan that is or would have been secured only by a manufactured home but not the land on which it is sited as secured by a manufactured home and not land, even if the manufactured home is considered real property under applicable State law.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Manufactured home community.</E> A manufactured home community that is a multifamily dwelling is not considered a manufactured home for purposes of § 1003.4(a)(29).</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 4(a)(30)</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Indirect land ownership.</E> Indirect land ownership can occur when the applicant or borrower is or will be a member of a resident-owned community structured as a housing cooperative in which the occupants own an entity that holds the underlying land of the manufactured home community. In such communities, the applicant or borrower may still have a lease and pay rent for the lot on which his or her manufactured home is or will be located, but the property interest type for such an arrangement should be reported as indirect ownership if the applicant is or will be a member of the cooperative that owns the underlying land of the manufactured home community. If an applicant resides or will reside in such a community but is not a member, the property interest type should be reported as a paid leasehold.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Leasehold interest.</E> A leasehold interest could be formalized in a lease with a defined term and specified rent payments, or could arise as a tenancy at will through permission of a land owner without any written, formal arrangement. For example, assume a borrower will locate the manufactured home in a manufactured home community, has a written lease for a lot in that park, and the lease specifies rent payments. In this example, a financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(30) by reporting a paid leasehold. However, if instead the borrower will locate the manufactured home on land owned by a family member without a written lease and with no agreement as to rent payments, a financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(30) by reporting an unpaid leasehold.</P>

          <P>2. <E T="03">Manufactured home community.</E> For an application or covered loan secured by a manufactured home community, the financial institution should include in the number of individual dwelling units the total number of manufactured home sites that secure the loan and are available for occupancy, regardless of whether the sites are currently occupied or have manufactured homes currently attached. A financial institution may include in the number of individual dwelling units other units such as recreational vehicle pads, manager apartments, rental apartments, site-built homes or other rentable space that are ancillary to the operation of the secured property if it considers such units under its underwriting guidelines or the guidelines of an investor, or if it tracks the number of such units for its own internal purposes. For a loan secured by a single manufactured home that is or will be located in a manufactured home community, the financial institution should report one individual dwelling unit.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Condominium and cooperative projects.</E> For a covered loan secured by a condominium or cooperative property, the financial institution reports the total number of individual dwelling units securing the covered loan or proposed to secure the covered loan in the case of an application. For example:</P>
          <P>i. Assume that a loan is secured by the entirety of a cooperative property. The financial institution would report the number of individual dwelling units in the cooperative property.</P>
          <P>ii. Assume that a covered loan is secured by 30 individual dwelling units in a condominium property that contains 100 individual dwelling units and that the loan is not exempt from Regulation C under § 1003.3(c)(3). The financial institution reports 30 individual dwelling units.</P>
          <P>4. <E T="03">Best information available.</E> A financial institution may rely on the best information readily available to the financial institution at the time final action is taken and on the financial institution's own procedures in reporting the information required by § 1003.4(a)(31). Information readily available could include, for example, information provided by an applicant that the financial institution reasonably believes, information contained in a property valuation or inspection, or information obtained from public records.</P>

          <P>1. <E T="03">Affordable housing income restrictions.</E> For purposes of § 1003.4(a)(32), affordable housing income-restricted units are individual dwelling units that have restrictions based on the income level of occupants pursuant to restrictive covenants encumbering the property. Such income levels are frequently expressed as a percentage of area median income by household size as established by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development or another agency responsible for implementing the applicable affordable housing program. Such restrictions are frequently part of compliance with programs that provide public funds, special tax treatment, or density bonuses to encourage development or preservation of affordable housing. Such restrictions are frequently evidenced by a use agreement, regulatory agreement, land use restriction agreement, housing assistance payments contract, or similar agreement. Rent control or rent stabilization laws, and the acceptance by the owner or manager of a multifamily dwelling of Housing Choice Vouchers (24 CFR part 982) or other similar forms of portable housing assistance that are tied to an occupant and not an individual dwelling unit, are not affordable housing income-restricted dwelling units for purposes of § 1003.4(a)(32).</P>

          <P>1. <E T="03">Agents.</E> If a financial institution is reporting actions taken by its agent consistent with comment 4(a)-4, the agent is not considered the financial institution for the purposes of § 1003.4(a)(33). For example, assume that an applicant submitted an application to Financial Institution A, and Financial Institution A made the credit decision acting as Financial Institution B's agent under State law. A covered loan was originated and the obligation arising from a covered loan was initially payable to Financial Institution A. Financial Institution B purchased the loan. Financial Institution B reports the origination and not the purchase, and indicates that the application was not submitted directly to the financial institution and that the transaction was not initially payable to the financial institution.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 4(a)(33)(i)</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">General.</E> Section 4(a)(33)(i) requires a financial institution to indicate whether the applicant or borrower submitted the application directly to the financial institution that is reporting the covered loan or application. The following scenarios demonstrate whether an application was submitted directly to the financial institution that is reporting the covered loan or application.</P>
          <P>i. The application was submitted directly to the financial institution if the mortgage loan originator identified pursuant to § 1003.4(a)(34) was an employee of the reporting financial institution when the originator performed the origination activities for the covered loan or application that is being reported.</P>

          <P>ii. The application was also submitted directly to the financial institution reporting the covered loan or application if the reporting financial institution directed the applicant to a third-party agent (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> a credit union service organization) that performed loan origination activities on behalf of the financial institution and did not assist the applicant with applying for covered loans with other institutions.</P>
          <P>iii. If an applicant contacted and completed an application with a broker or correspondent that forwarded the application to a financial institution for approval, an application was not submitted to the financial institution.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 4(a)(33)(ii)</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">General.</E> Section 1003.4(a)(33)(ii) requires financial institutions to report whether the obligation arising from a covered loan was or, in the case of an application, would have been initially payable to the institution. An obligation is initially payable to the institution if the obligation is initially payable either on the face of the note or contract to the financial institution that is reporting the covered loan or application. For example, if a financial institution reported an origination of a covered loan that it approved prior to closing, that closed in the name of a third-party, such as a correspondent lender, and that the financial institution purchased after closing, the covered loan was not initially payable to the financial institution.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Applications.</E> A financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(33)(ii) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable if the institution had not determined whether the covered loan would have been initially payable to the institution reporting the application when the application was withdrawn, denied, or closed for incompleteness.</P>

          <P>1. <E T="03">NMLSR ID.</E> Section 1003.4(a)(34) requires a financial institution to report the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry unique identifier (NMLSR ID) for the mortgage loan originator, as defined in Regulation G, 12 CFR 1007.102, or Regulation H, 12 CFR 1008.23, as applicable. The NMLSR ID is a unique number or other identifier generally assigned to individuals registered or licensed through NMLSR to provide loan originating services. For more information, see the Secure and Fair Enforcement for <PRTPAGE P="133"/>Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008, title V of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (S.A.F.E. Act), 12 U.S.C. 5101 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> and its implementing regulations (12 CFR part 1007 and 12 CFR part 1008).</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Mortgage loan originator without NMLSR ID.</E> An NMLSR ID for the mortgage loan originator is not required by § 1003.4(a)(34) to be reported by a financial institution if the mortgage loan originator is not required to obtain and has not been assigned an NMLSR ID. For example, certain individual mortgage loan originators may not be required to obtain an NMLSR ID for the particular transaction being reported by the financial institution, such as a commercial loan. However, some mortgage loan originators may have obtained an NMLSR ID even if they are not required to obtain one for that particular transaction. If a mortgage loan originator has been assigned an NMLSR ID, a financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(34) by reporting the mortgage loan originator's NMLSR ID regardless of whether the mortgage loan originator is required to obtain an NMLSR ID for the particular transaction being reported by the financial institution. In the event that the mortgage loan originator is not required to obtain and has not been assigned an NMLSR ID, a financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(34) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Multiple mortgage loan originators.</E> If more than one individual associated with a covered loan or application meets the definition of a mortgage loan originator, as defined in Regulation G, 12 CFR 1007.102, or Regulation H, 12 CFR 1008.23, a financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(34) by reporting the NMLSR ID of the individual mortgage loan originator with primary responsibility for the transaction as of the date of action taken pursuant to § 1003.4(a)(8)(ii). A financial institution that establishes and follows a reasonable, written policy for determining which individual mortgage loan originator has primary responsibility for the reported transaction as of the date of action taken complies with § 1003.4(a)(34).</P>
          <P>4. <E T="03">Purchased loans.</E> If a financial institution purchases a covered loan that satisfies the coverage criteria of Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.36(g), and that was originated prior to January 10, 2014, the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(34) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable. In addition, if a financial institution purchases a covered loan that does not satisfy the coverage criteria of Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.36(g), and that was originated prior to January 1, 2018, the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(34) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable. Purchasers of both such types of covered loans may report the NMLSR ID.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 4(a)(35)</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Automated underwriting system data—general.</E> A financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(35) by reporting, except for purchased covered loans, the name of the automated underwriting system (AUS) used by the financial institution to evaluate the application and the result generated by that AUS. The following scenarios illustrate when a financial institution reports the name of the AUS used by the financial institution to evaluate the application and the result generated by that AUS.</P>
          <P>i. A financial institution that uses an AUS, as defined in § 1003.4(a)(35)(ii), to evaluate an application, must report the name of the AUS used by the financial institution to evaluate the application and the result generated by that system, regardless of whether the AUS was used in its underwriting process. For example, if a financial institution uses an AUS to evaluate an application prior to submitting the application through its underwriting process, the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(35) by reporting the name of the AUS it used to evaluate the application and the result generated by that system.</P>
          <P>ii. A financial institution that uses an AUS, as defined in § 1003.4(a)(35)(ii), to evaluate an application, must report the name of the AUS it used to evaluate the application and the result generated by that system, regardless of whether the financial institution intends to hold the covered loan in its portfolio or sell the covered loan. For example, if a financial institution uses an AUS developed by a securitizer to evaluate an application and intends to sell the covered loan to that securitizer but ultimately does not sell the covered loan and instead holds the covered loan in its portfolio, the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(35) by reporting the name of the securitizer's AUS that the institution used to evaluate the application and the result generated by that system. Similarly, if a financial institution uses an AUS developed by a securitizer to evaluate an application to determine whether to originate the covered loan but does not intend to sell the covered loan to that securitizer and instead holds the covered loan in its portfolio, the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(35) by reporting the name of the securitizer's AUS that the institution used to evaluate the application and the result generated by that system.</P>

          <P>iii. A financial institution that uses an AUS, as defined in § 1003.4(a)(35)(ii), that is developed by a securitizer to evaluate an application, must report the name of the AUS it used to evaluate the application and the result generated by that system, regardless of whether the securitizer intends to hold the covered loan it purchased from the financial institution in its portfolio or securitize <PRTPAGE P="134"/>the covered loan. For example, if a financial institution uses an AUS developed by a securitizer to evaluate an application and the financial institution sells the covered loan to that securitizer but the securitizer holds the covered loan it purchased in its portfolio, the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(35) by reporting the name of the securitizer's AUS that the institution used to evaluate the application and the result generated by that system.</P>
          <P>iv. A financial institution, which is also a securitizer, that uses its own AUS, as defined in § 1003.4(a)(35)(ii), to evaluate an application, must report the name of the AUS it used to evaluate the application and the result generated by that system, regardless of whether the financial institution intends to hold the covered loan it originates in its portfolio, purchase the covered loan, or securitize the covered loan. For example, if a financial institution, which is also a securitizer, has developed its own AUS and uses that AUS to evaluate an application that it intends to originate and hold in its portfolio and not purchase or securitize the covered loan, the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(35) by reporting the name of its AUS that it used to evaluate the application and the result generated by that system.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Definition of automated underwriting system.</E> A financial institution must report the information required by § 1003.4(a)(35)(i) if the financial institution uses an automated underwriting system (AUS), as defined in § 1003.4(a)(35)(ii), to evaluate an application. To be covered by the definition in § 1003.4(a)(35)(ii), a system must be an electronic tool that has been developed by a securitizer, Federal government insurer, or a Federal government guarantor of closed-end mortgage loans or open-end lines of credit. A person is a securitizer, Federal government insurer, or Federal government guarantor of closed-end mortgage loans or open-end lines of credit, respectively, if it has securitized, provided Federal government insurance, or provided a Federal government guarantee for a closed-end mortgage loan or open-end line of credit at any point in time. A person may be a securitizer, Federal government insurer, or Federal government guarantor of closed-end mortgage loans or open-end lines of credit, respectively, for purposes of § 1003.4(a)(35) even if it is not actively securitizing, insuring, or guaranteeing closed-end mortgage loans or open-end lines of credit at the time a financial institution uses the AUS to evaluate an application. Where the person that developed the electronic tool has never been a securitizer, Federal government insurer, or Federal government guarantor of closed-end mortgage loans or open-end lines of credit, respectively, at the time a financial institution uses the tool to evaluate an application, the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(35) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable because an AUS was not used to evaluate the application. If a financial institution has developed its own proprietary system that it uses to evaluate an application and the financial institution is also a securitizer, then the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(35) by reporting the name of that system and the result generated by that system. On the other hand, if a financial institution has developed its own proprietary system that it uses to evaluate an application and the financial institution is not a securitizer, then the financial institution is not required by § 1003.4(a)(35) to report the use of that system and the result generated by that system. In addition, for an AUS to be covered by the definition in § 1003.4(a)(35)(ii), the system must provide a result regarding both the credit risk of the applicant and the eligibility of the covered loan to be originated, purchased, insured, or guaranteed by the securitizer, Federal government insurer, or Federal government guarantor that developed the system being used to evaluate the application. For example, if a system is an electronic tool that provides a determination of the eligibility of the covered loan to be originated, purchased, insured, or guaranteed by the securitizer, Federal government insurer, or Federal government guarantor that developed the system being used by a financial institution to evaluate the application, but the system does not also provide an assessment of the creditworthiness of the applicant—such as an evaluation of the applicant's income, debt, and credit history—then that system does not qualify as an AUS, as defined in § 1003.4(a)(35)(ii). A financial institution that uses a system that is not an AUS, as defined in § 1003.4(a)(35)(ii), to evaluate an application does not report the information required by § 1003.4(a)(35)(i).</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Reporting automated underwriting system data—multiple results.</E> When a financial institution uses one or more automated underwriting systems (AUS) to evaluate the application and the system or systems generate two or more results, the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(35) by reporting, except for purchased covered loans, the name of the AUS used by the financial institution to evaluate the application and the result generated by that AUS as determined by the following principles. To determine what AUS (or AUSs) and result (or results) to report under § 1003.4(a)(35), a financial institution follows each of the principles that is applicable to the application in question, in the order in which they are set forth below.</P>

          <P>i. If a financial institution obtains two or more AUS results and the AUS generating one of those results corresponds to the loan type reported pursuant to § 1003.4(a)(2), the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(35) by reporting that AUS name <PRTPAGE P="135"/>and result. For example, if a financial institution evaluates an application using the Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) Technology Open to Approved Lenders (TOTAL) Scorecard and subsequently evaluates the application with an AUS used to determine eligibility for a non-FHA loan, but ultimately originates an FHA loan, the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(35) by reporting TOTAL Scorecard and the result generated by that system. If a financial institution obtains two or more AUS results and more than one of those AUS results is generated by a system that corresponds to the loan type reported pursuant to § 1003.4(a)(2), the financial institution identifies which AUS result should be reported by following the principle set forth below in comment 4(a)(35)-3.ii.</P>
          <P>ii. If a financial institution obtains two or more AUS results and the AUS generating one of those results corresponds to the purchaser, insurer, or guarantor, if any, the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(35) by reporting that AUS name and result. For example, if a financial institution evaluates an application with the AUS of Securitizer A and subsequently evaluates the application with the AUS of Securitizer B, but the financial institution ultimately originates a covered loan that it sells within the same calendar year to Securitizer A, the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(35) by reporting the name of Securitizer A's AUS and the result generated by that system. If a financial institution obtains two or more AUS results and more than one of those AUS results is generated by a system that corresponds to the purchaser, insurer, or guarantor, if any, the financial institution identifies which AUS result should be reported by following the principle set forth below in comment 4(a)(35)-3.iii.</P>
          <P>iii. If a financial institution obtains two or more AUS results and none of the systems generating those results correspond to the purchaser, insurer, or guarantor, if any, or the financial institution is following this principle because more than one AUS result is generated by a system that corresponds to either the loan type or the purchaser, insurer, or guarantor, the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(35) by reporting the AUS result generated closest in time to the credit decision and the name of the AUS that generated that result. For example, if a financial institution evaluates an application with the AUS of Securitizer A, subsequently again evaluates the application with Securitizer A's AUS, the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(35) by reporting the name of Securitizer A's AUS and the second AUS result. Similarly, if a financial institution obtains a result from an AUS that requires the financial institution to underwrite the loan manually, but the financial institution subsequently processes the application through a different AUS that also generates a result, the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(35) by reporting the name of the second AUS that it used to evaluate the application and the AUS result generated by that system.</P>
          <P>iv. If a financial institution obtains two or more AUS results at the same time and the principles in comment 4(a)(35)-3.i through .iii do not apply, the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(35) by reporting the name of all of the AUSs used by the financial institution to evaluate the application and the results generated by each of those systems. For example, if a financial institution simultaneously evaluates an application with the AUS of Securitizer A and the AUS of Securitizer B, the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(35) by reporting the name of both Securitizer A's AUS and Securitizer B's AUS and the results generated by each of those systems. In any event, however, the financial institution does not report more than five AUSs and five results. If more than five AUSs and five results meet the criteria in this principle, the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(35) by choosing any five among them to report.</P>
          <P>4. <E T="03">Transactions for which an automated underwriting system was not used to evaluate the application.</E> Section 1003.4(a)(35) does not require a financial institution to evaluate an application using an automated underwriting system (AUS), as defined in § 1003.4(a)(35)(ii). For example, if a financial institution only manually underwrites an application and does not use an AUS to evaluate the application, the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(35) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable since an AUS was not used to evaluate the application.</P>
          <P>5. <E T="03">Purchased covered loan.</E> A financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(35) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable when the covered loan is a purchased covered loan.</P>
          <P>6. <E T="03">Non-natural person.</E> When the applicant and co-applicant, if applicable, are not natural persons, a financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(35) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable.</P>
          <P>7. <E T="03">Determination of securitizer, Federal government insurer, or Federal government guarantor.</E> Section 1003.4(a)(35)(ii) provides that an “automated underwriting system” means an electronic tool developed by a securitizer, Federal government insurer, or Federal government guarantor of closed-end mortgage loans or open-end lines of credit that provides a result regarding the credit risk of the applicant and whether the covered loan is eligible to be originated, purchased, insured, or guaranteed by that securitizer, Federal government insurer, or Federal government <PRTPAGE P="136"/>guarantor. A person is a securitizer, Federal government insurer, or Federal government guarantor of closed-end mortgage loans or open-end lines of credit, respectively, if it has ever securitized, insured, or guaranteed a closed-end mortgage loan or open-end line of credit. If a financial institution knows or reasonably believes that the system it is using to evaluate an application is an electronic tool that has been developed by a securitizer, Federal government insurer, or Federal government guarantor of closed-end mortgage loans or open-end lines of credit, then the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(35) by reporting the name of that system and the result generated by that system. Knowledge or reasonable belief could, for example, be based on a sales agreement or other related documents, the financial institution's previous transactions or relationship with the developer of the electronic tool, or representations made by the developer of the electronic tool demonstrating that the developer of the electronic tool is a securitizer, Federal government insurer, or Federal government guarantor of closed-end mortgage loans or open-end lines of credit. If a financial institution does not know or reasonably believe that the system it is using to evaluate an application is an electronic tool that has been developed by a securitizer, Federal government insurer, or Federal government guarantor of closed-end mortgage loans or open-end lines of credit, the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(35) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable, provided that the financial institution maintains procedures reasonably adapted to determine whether the electronic tool it is using to evaluate an application meets the definition in § 1003.4(a)(35)(ii). Reasonably adapted procedures include attempting to determine with reasonable frequency, such as annually, whether the developer of the electronic tool is a securitizer, Federal government insurer, or Federal government guarantor of closed-end mortgage loans or open-end lines of credit. For example:</P>
          <P>i. In the course of renewing an annual sales agreement the developer of the electronic tool represents to the financial institution that it has never been a securitizer, Federal government insurer, or Federal government guarantor of closed-end mortgage loans or open-end lines of credit. On this basis, the financial institution does not know or reasonably believe that the system it is using to evaluate an application is an electronic tool that has been developed by a securitizer, Federal government insurer, or Federal government guarantor of closed-end mortgage loans or open-end lines of credit and complies with § 1003.4(a)(35) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable.</P>
          <P>ii. Based on their previous transactions a financial institution is aware that the developer of the electronic tool it is using to evaluate an application has securitized a closed-end mortgage loan or open-end line of credit in the past. On this basis, the financial institution knows or reasonably believes that the developer of the electronic tool is a securitizer and complies with § 1003.4(a)(35) by reporting the name of that system and the result generated by that system.</P>

          <P>1. <E T="03">Open-end line of credit.</E> Section 1003.4(a)(37) requires a financial institution to identify whether the covered loan or the application is for an open-end line of credit. See comments 2(o)-1 and -2 for a discussion of open-end line of credit and extension of credit.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD3">4(f) Quarterly Recording of Data</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">General.</E> Section 1003.4(f) requires a financial institution to record the data collected pursuant to § 1003.4 on a loan/application register within 30 calendar days after the end of the calendar quarter in which final action is taken. Section 1003.4(f) does not require a financial institution to record data on a single loan/application register on a quarterly basis. Rather, for purposes of § 1003.4(f), a financial institution may record data on a single loan/application register or separately for different branches or different loan types (such as home purchase or home improvement loans, or loans on multifamily dwellings).</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Agency requirements.</E> Certain State or Federal regulations may require a financial institution to record its data more frequently than is required under Regulation C.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Form of quarterly records.</E> A financial institution may maintain the records required by § 1003.4(f) in electronic or any other format, provided the institution can make the information available to its regulatory agency in a timely manner upon request.</P>

          <P>1. <E T="03">Quarterly reporting—coverage.</E> i. Section 1003.5(a)(1)(ii) requires that, within 60 calendar days after the end of each calendar <PRTPAGE P="137"/>quarter except the fourth quarter, a financial institution that reported for the preceding calendar year at least 60,000 covered loans and applications, combined, excluding purchased covered loans, must submit its loan/application register containing all data required to be recorded for that quarter pursuant to § 1003.4(f). For example, if for calendar year 2019 Financial Institution A reports 60,000 covered loans, excluding purchased covered loans, it must comply with § 1003.5(a)(1)(ii) in calendar year 2020. Similarly, if for calendar year 2019 Financial Institution A reports 20,000 applications and 40,000 covered loans, combined, excluding purchased covered loans, it must comply with § 1003.5(a)(1)(ii) in calendar year 2020. If for calendar year 2020 Financial Institution A reports fewer than 60,000 covered loans and applications, combined, excluding purchased covered loans, it is not required to comply with § 1003.5(a)(1)(ii) in calendar year 2021.</P>
          <P>ii. In the calendar year of a merger or acquisition, the surviving or newly formed financial institution is required to comply with § 1003.5(a)(1)(ii), effective the date of the merger or acquisition, if a combined total of at least 60,000 covered loans and applications, combined, excluding purchased covered loans, is reported for the preceding calendar year by or for the surviving or newly formed financial institution and each financial institution or branch office merged or acquired. For example, Financial Institution A and Financial Institution B merge to form Financial Institution C in 2020. Financial Institution A reports 40,000 covered loans and applications, combined, excluding purchased covered loans, for 2019. Financial Institution B reports 21,000 covered loans and applications, combined, excluding purchased covered loans, for 2019. Financial Institution C is required to comply with § 1003.5(a)(1)(ii) effective the date of the merger. Similarly, for example, Financial Institution A acquires a branch office of Financial Institution B in 2020. Financial Institution A reports 58,000 covered loans and applications, combined, excluding purchased covered loans, for 2019. Financial Institution B reports 3,000 covered loans and applications, combined, excluding purchased covered loans, for 2019 for the branch office acquired by Financial Institution A. Financial Institution A is required to comply with § 1003.5(a)(1)(ii) in 2020 effective the date of the branch acquisition.</P>
          <P>iii. In the calendar year following a merger or acquisition, the surviving or newly formed financial institution is required to comply with § 1003.5(a)(1)(ii) if a combined total of at least 60,000 covered loans and applications, combined, excluding purchased covered loans, is reported for the preceding calendar year by or for the surviving or newly formed financial institution and each financial institution or branch office merged or acquired. For example, Financial Institution A and Financial Institution B merge to form Financial Institution C in 2019. Financial Institution C reports 21,000 covered loans and applications, combined, excluding purchased covered loans, each for Financial Institution A, B, and C for 2019, for a combined total of 63,000 covered loans and applications reported, excluding purchased covered loans. Financial Institution C is required to comply with § 1003.5(a)(1)(ii) in 2020. Similarly, for example, Financial Institution A acquires a branch office of Financial Institution B in 2019. Financial Institution A reports 58,000 covered loans and applications, combined, excluding purchased covered loans, for 2019. Financial Institution A or B reports 3,000 covered loans and applications, combined, excluding purchased covered loans, for 2019 for the branch office acquired by Financial Institution A. Financial Institution A is required to comply with § 1003.5(a)(1)(ii) in 2020.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Change in appropriate Federal agency.</E> If the appropriate Federal agency for a financial institution changes (as a consequence of a merger or a change in the institution's charter, for example), the institution must identify its new appropriate Federal agency in its annual submission of data pursuant to § 1003.5(a)(1)(i) for the year of the change. For example, if an institution's appropriate Federal agency changes in February 2018, it must identify its new appropriate Federal agency beginning with the annual submission of its 2018 data by March 1, 2019 pursuant to § 1003.5(a)(1)(i). For an institution required to comply with § 1003.5(a)(1)(ii), the institution also must identify its new appropriate Federal agency in its quarterly submission of data pursuant to § 1003.5(a)(1)(ii) beginning with its submission for the quarter of the change, unless the change occurs during the fourth quarter. For example, if the appropriate Federal agency for an institution required to comply with § 1003.5(a)(1)(ii) changes during February 2020, the institution must identify its new appropriate Federal agency beginning with its quarterly submission pursuant to § 1003.5(a)(1)(ii) for the first quarter of 2020. If the appropriate Federal agency for an institution required to comply with § 1003.5(a)(1)(ii) changes during December 2020, the institution must identify its new appropriate Federal agency beginning with the annual submission of its 2020 data by March 1, 2021 pursuant to § 1003.5(a)(1)(i).</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Subsidiaries.</E> A financial institution is a subsidiary of a bank or savings association (for purposes of reporting HMDA data to the same agency as the parent) if the bank or savings association holds or controls an ownership interest in the institution that is greater than 50 percent.</P>
          <P>4. <E T="03">Retention.</E> A financial institution may satisfy the requirement under § 1003.5(a)(1)(i) that it retain a copy of its submitted annual loan/application register for three years by <PRTPAGE P="138"/>retaining a copy of the annual loan/application register in either electronic or paper form.</P>
          <P>5. <E T="03">Federal Taxpayer Identification Number.</E> Section 1003.5(a)(3) requires a financial institution to provide its Federal Taxpayer Identification Number with its data submission. If a financial institution obtains a new Federal Taxpayer Identification Number, it should provide the new number in its subsequent data submission. For example, if two financial institutions that previously reported HMDA data under this part merge and the surviving institution retained its Legal Entity Identifier but obtained a new Federal Taxpayer Identification Number, then the surviving institution should report the new Federal Taxpayer Identification Number with its HMDA data submission.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD3">6(b) Bona Fide Errors</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Information from third parties.</E> Section 1003.6(b) provides that an error in compiling or recording data for a covered loan or application is not a violation of the Act or this part if the error was unintentional and occurred despite the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid such an error. A financial institution that obtains the required data, such as property-location information, from third parties is responsible for ensuring that the information reported pursuant to § 1003.5 is correct. See comment 6(b)-2 concerning obtaining census tract information from a geocoding tool that the Bureau makes available on its Web site.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Information from the Bureau.</E> Section 1003.6(b)(2) provides that an incorrect entry for census tract number is deemed a bona fide error, and is not a violation of the Act or this part, provided that the financial institution maintains procedures reasonably adapted to avoid an error. Obtaining the census tract numbers for covered loans and applications from a geocoding tool available on the Bureau's Web site that identifies the census tract of a property using property addresses entered by users is an example of a <PRTPAGE P="139"/>procedure reasonably adapted to avoid errors under § 1003.6(b)(2). Accordingly, a census tract error is not a violation of the Act or this part if the financial institution obtained the census tract number from the geocoding tool on the Bureau's Web site. However, a financial institution's failure to provide the correct census tract number for a covered loan or application on its loan/application register, as required by § 1003.4(a)(9)(ii)(C) or (e), because the geocoding tool on the Bureau's Web site did not provide a census tract number for the property address entered by the financial institution is not excused as a bona fide error. In addition, a census tract error caused by a financial institution entering an inaccurate property address into the geocoding tool on the Bureau's Web site is not excused as a bona fide error.</P>

For example, A and B merge. The surviving or newly formed institution meets the loan threshold described in § 1003.2(g)(1)(v)(B) if the surviving or newly formed institution, A, and B originated a combined total of at least 100 open-end lines of credit in each of the two preceding calendar years. Likewise, the surviving or newly formed institution meets the asset-size threshold in § 1003.2(g)(1)(i) if its assets and the combined assets of A and B on December 31 of the preceding calendar year exceeded the threshold described in § 1003.2(g)(1)(i).

                  <E T="03">5. Originations.</E> Whether an institution is a financial institution depends in part on whether the institution originated at least 25 closed-end mortgage loans in each of the two preceding calendar years or at least 100 open-end lines of credit in each of the two preceding calendar years. Comments 4(a)-2 through -4 discuss whether activities with respect to a particular closed-end mortgage loan or open-end line of credit constitute an origination for purposes of § 1003.2(g).<STARS/>

                <P>1. <E T="03">General.</E> Section 1003.3(c)(12) provides that an open-end line of credit is an excluded transaction if a financial institution originated fewer than 100 open-end lines of credit in either of the two preceding calendar years. For example, assume that a bank is a financial institution in 2018 under § 1003.2(g) because it originated 50 closed-end mortgage loans in 2016, 75 closed-end mortgage loans in 2017, and met all of the other requirements under § 1003.2(g)(1). Also assume that the bank originated 75 and 85 open-end lines of credit in 2016 and 2017, respectively. The closed-end mortgage loans that the bank originated or purchased, or for which it received applications, during 2018 are covered loans and must be reported, unless they otherwise are excluded transactions under <PRTPAGE P="140"/>§ 1003.3(c). However, the open-end lines of credit that the bank originated or purchased, or for which it received applications, during 2018 are excluded transactions under § 1003.3(c)(12) and need not be reported. See comments 4(a)-2 through -4 for guidance about the activities that constitute an origination.</P>
                <P>2. <E T="03">Optional reporting.</E> A financial institution may report applications for, originations of, or purchases of open-end lines of credit that are excluded transactions because the financial institution originated fewer than 100 open-end lines of credit in either of the two preceding calendar years. However, a financial institution that chooses to report such excluded applications for, originations of, or purchases of open-end lines of credit must report all such applications for open-end lines of credit which it receives, open-end lines of credit that it originates, and open-end lines of credit that it purchases that otherwise would be covered loans for a given calendar year. Note that applications which remain pending at the end of a calendar year are not reported, as described in comment 4(a)(8)(i)-14.<STARS/>

                <P>3. <E T="03">ULI—purchased covered loan.</E> If a financial institution has previously assigned a covered loan with a ULI or reported a covered loan with a ULI under this part, a financial institution that purchases that covered loan must report the same ULI that was previously assigned or reported. For example, if a financial institution that submits an annual loan/application register pursuant to § 1003.5(a)(1)(i) originates a covered loan that is purchased by a financial institution that also submits an annual loan/application register pursuant to § 1003.5(a)(1)(i), the financial institution that purchases the covered loan must report the purchase of the covered loan using the same ULI that was reported by the originating financial institution. If a financial institution that originates a covered loan has previously assigned the covered loan with a ULI under this part but has not yet reported the covered loan, a financial institution that purchases that covered loan must report the same ULI that was previously assigned. For example, if a financial institution that submits an annual loan/application register pursuant to § 1003.5(a)(1)(i) (Institution A) originates a covered loan that is purchased by a financial institution that submits a quarterly loan/application register pursuant to § 1003.5(a)(1)(ii) (Institution B), then Institution B must report the ULI that was assigned by Institution A on Institution B's quarterly loan/application register pursuant to § 1003.5(a)(1)(ii), even though Institution A has not yet submitted its annual loan/application register pursuant to § 1003.5(a)(1)(i). A financial institution that purchases a covered loan must assign it a ULI pursuant to § 1003.4(a)(1)(i) and report it pursuant to § 1003.5(a)(1)(i) or (ii), whichever is applicable, if the covered loan was not assigned a ULI by the financial institution that originated the loan because, for example, the loan was originated prior to January 1, 2018, or the loan was originated by an institution not required to report under this part.</P>
                <P>4. <E T="03">ULI—reinstated or reconsidered application.</E> A financial institution may, at its option, report a ULI previously reported under this part if, during the same calendar year, an applicant asks the institution to reinstate a counteroffer that the applicant previously did not accept or asks the financial institution to reconsider an application that was previously denied, withdrawn, or closed for incompleteness. For example, if a financial institution reports a denied application in its second-quarter 2020 data submission, pursuant to § 1003.5(a)(1)(ii), but then reconsiders the application, resulting in an origination in the third quarter of 2020, the financial institution may report the origination in its third-quarter 2020 data submission using the same ULI that was reported for the denied application in its second-quarter 2020 data submission, so long as the financial institution treats the origination as the same transaction for reporting. However, a financial institution may not use a ULI previously reported if it reinstates or reconsiders an application that was reported in a prior calendar year. For example, if a financial institution reports a denied application in its fourth-quarter 2020 data submission, pursuant to § 1003.5(a)(1)(ii), but then reconsiders the application, resulting in an origination in the first quarter of 2021, the financial institution reports a denied application under the original ULI in its fourth-quarter 2020 data submission and an origination with a different ULI in its first-quarter 2021 data submission, pursuant to § 1003.5(a)(1)(ii).<STARS/>

                <P>9. <E T="03">Corrected disclosures.</E> In the case of a covered loan or an application that was approved but not accepted, if the annual percentage rate changes because a financial institution provides a corrected version of the disclosures required under Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.19(a), pursuant to 12 CFR 1026.19(a)(2), under 12 CFR 1026.19(f), pursuant to 12 CFR 1026.19(f)(2), or under 12 CFR 1026.6(a), the financial institution complies with § 1003.4(a)(12)(i) by comparing the corrected and disclosed annual percentage rate to the most recently available average prime offer rate that was in effect for a comparable transaction as of the rate-set date, provided that the corrected disclosure was provided to the borrower prior to the end of the reporting period in which final action is taken. For purposes of § 1003.4(a)(12), the date the corrected disclosure was provided to the borrower is the date the disclosure was mailed or delivered to the borrower in person; the financial institution's method of delivery does not affect the date provided. For example, where a financial institution provides a corrected version of the disclosures required under 12 CFR 1026.19(f), pursuant to 12 CFR 1026.19(f)(2), the date provided is the date disclosed pursuant to Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.38(a)(3)(i). The provision of a corrected disclosure does not affect how a financial institution determines the rate-set date. <E T="03">See</E> comment 4(a)(12)-5. For example:</P>
                <P>i. In the case of a financial institution's annual loan/application register submission made pursuant to § 1003.5(a)(1)(i), if the financial institution provides a corrected disclosure pursuant to Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.19(f)(2)(v), that reflects a corrected annual percentage rate, the financial institution reports the difference between the corrected annual percentage rate and the most recently available average prime offer rate that was in effect for a comparable transaction as of the rate-set date only if the corrected disclosure was provided to the borrower prior to the end of the calendar year in which final action is taken.</P>
                <P>ii. In the case of a financial institution's quarterly submission made pursuant to § 1003.5(a)(1)(ii), if the financial institution provides a corrected disclosure pursuant to Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.19(f)(2)(v), that reflects a corrected annual percentage rate, the financial institution reports the difference between the corrected annual percentage rate and the most recently available average prime offer rate that was in effect for a comparable transaction as of the rate-set date only if the corrected disclosure was provided to the borrower prior to the end of the quarter in which final action is taken. The financial institution does not report the difference between the corrected annual percentage rate and the most recently available average prime offer rate that was in effect for a comparable transaction as of the rate-set date if the corrected disclosure was provided to the borrower after the end of the quarter in which final action is taken, even if the corrected disclosure was provided to the borrower prior to the deadline for timely submission of the financial institution's quarterly data. However, the financial institution reports the difference between the corrected annual percentage rate and the most recently available average prime offer rate that was in effect for a comparable transaction as of the rate-set date on its annual loan/application register, provided that the corrected disclosure was provided to the borrower prior to the end of the calendar year in which final action is taken.<STARS/>

For purposes of § 1003.4(a)(17)(i), the date the corrected disclosure was provided to the borrower is the date disclosed pursuant to Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.38(a)(3)(i). For example:</P>
                <P>i.

The financial institution does not report the corrected amount of total loan costs in its quarterly submission if the corrected disclosure was provided to the borrower after the end of the quarter in which closing occurs, even if the corrected disclosure was provided to the borrower prior <PRTPAGE P="142"/>to the deadline for timely submission of the financial institution's quarterly data.

          <P>(a) <E T="03">Authority.</E> This regulation, known as Regulation D, is issued by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection to implement the Alternative Mortgage Transaction Parity Act, 12 U.S.C. 3801 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> as amended by title X, Section 1083 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Pub.

          <SUBJECT>Preemption of State law.</SUBJECT>
          <P>Pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 3803, a State-chartered or -licensed housing creditor may make, purchase, and enforce alternative mortgage transactions in accordance with § 1004.4(a) through (c) of this part (as applicable), notwithstanding any provision of State law that restricts the ability of the housing creditor to adjust or renegotiate an interest rate or finance charge with respect to the transaction or to change the amount of interest or finance charges included in a regular periodic payment as a result of such an adjustment or renegotiation.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Requirements for alternative mortgage transactions.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Mortgages with adjustable rates or finance charges and home equity lines of credit.</E> A creditor that makes an alternative mortgage transaction with an adjustable rate or finance charge may only increase the interest rate or finance charge as follows:</P>
          <P>(1) If the transaction is subject to 12 CFR 226.5b, the creditor must comply with 12 CFR 226.5b(f)(1).</P>
          <P>(2) For all other transactions, the creditor must use either:</P>
          <P>(i) An index to which changes in the interest rate are tied that is readily available to and verifiable by the borrower and beyond the control of the creditor; or</P>
          <P>(ii) A formula or schedule identifying the amount that the interest rate or finance charge may increase and the times at which, or circumstances under which, a change may be made.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Renegotiable rates for renewable balloon-payment mortgages.</E> A creditor that makes an alternative mortgage transaction with payments based on an amortization period and a large final payment due after a shorter term may negotiate an increase or decrease in the interest rate when the transaction is renewed only if the creditor makes a written commitment to renew the transaction at specified intervals throughout the amortization period. However, the creditor is not required to renew the transaction if:</P>
          <P>(1) Any action or inaction by the consumer materially and adversely affects the creditor's security for the transaction or any right of the creditor in such security;</P>
          <P>(2) There is a material failure by the consumer to meet the repayment terms of the transaction;</P>
          <P>(3) There is fraud or a willful or knowing material misrepresentation by the consumer in connection with the transaction; or</P>
          <P>(4) Federal law dealing with credit extended by a depository institution to its executive officers specifically requires that as a condition of the extension the credit shall become due and payable on demand, provided that the creditor includes such a provision in the initial agreement.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Requirements for high-cost and higher-priced mortgage loans.</E> (1) If an alternative mortgage transaction is subject to 12 CFR 226.32, the creditor must <PRTPAGE P="145"/>comply with 12 CFR 226.32 and 12 CFR 226.34.</P>
          <P>(2) If an alternative mortgage transaction is subject to 12 CFR 226.35, the creditor must comply with 12 CFR 226.35.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Other applicable law.</E> Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, a housing creditor that is not making an alternative mortgage transaction pursuant to § 1004.3 of this part may make that transaction consistent with applicable State or Federal law other than this section.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Reductions in interest rate or finance charge.</E> Nothing in this section prohibits a creditor from decreasing the interest rate or finance charge on an alternative mortgage transaction.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD2">§ 1004.1 Authority, Purpose, and Scope</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">1(c) Scope.</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Application received before July 22, 2011.</E> This part does not apply to a transaction if the creditor received the application for that transaction before July 22, 2011, even if the transaction was consummated or completed on or after July 22, 2011. Whether 12 U.S.C. 3803(c) preempts State law with respect to such a transaction depends on whether: (1) The transaction was an alternative mortgage transaction as defined by the version of 12 U.S.C. 3802(1) in effect at the time of application; and (2) the State housing creditor complied with applicable federal regulations issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the National Credit Union Administration, the Office of Thrift Supervision, or the Federal Home Loan Bank Board in effect at the time of application.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Subsequent modifications and other actions.</E> If applicable regulations under 12 U.S.C. 3803(c) (including this Part) preempted State law with respect to an alternative mortgage transaction at the time the application was received, the following actions with respect to that transaction are entitled to the same degree of preemption under such regulations:</P>
          <P>i. The subsequent consummation, completion, purchase, or enforcement of the transaction by a housing creditor.</P>
          <P>ii. The subsequent modification, renewal, or extension of the transaction. However, if such a transaction is satisfied and replaced by another transaction, the second transaction must independently meet the requirements for preemption in effect at the time the application for the second transaction was received.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">§ 1004.2 Definitions</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">2(a) Alternative Mortgage Transaction</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Alternative mortgage transaction.</E> For purposes of this Part, an alternative mortgage transaction that meets the definition in § 1004.2(a) includes any consumer credit transaction that is secured by a mortgage, deed of trust, or other equivalent consensual security interest in a dwelling or in residential real property that includes a dwelling. The dwelling need not be the primary dwelling of the consumer. Home equity lines of credit and subordinate lien mortgages are alternative mortgage transactions for purposes of this part to the extent they meet the definition in § 1004.2(a).</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Examples of alternative mortgage transactions.</E> Examples of alternative mortgage transactions include:</P>
          <P>i. Transactions in which the interest rate changes in accordance with fluctuations in an index.</P>
          <P>ii. Transactions in which the interest rate or finance charge may be increased or decreased after a specified period of time or under specified circumstances.</P>
          <P>iii. Balloon transactions in which payments are based on an amortization schedule and a large final payment is due after a shorter term, where the creditor makes a commitment to renew the transaction at specified intervals throughout the amortization period, but the interest rate may be renegotiated at renewal. For example, a fixed-rate mortgage loan with a 30-year amortization period but a balloon payment due five years after consummation is an alternative mortgage transaction under § 1004.2(a) if the creditor commits to renew the mortgage at five-year intervals for the entire 30-year amortization period.</P>
          <P>iv. Transactions in which the creditor and the consumer agree to share some or all of the appreciation in the value of the property (shared equity/shared appreciation).</P>
          <P>However, this part preempts State law only to the extent provided in § 1004.3 and only to the extent that the requirements of § 1004.4(a) through (c) (as applicable) are met.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Examples of transactions that are not alternative mortgage transactions.</E> The following are examples of transactions that are not alternative mortgage transactions:</P>
          <P>i. Transactions with a fixed interest rate where one or more of the regular periodic payments may be applied solely to accrued interest and not to loan principal (an interest-only feature).</P>

          <P>ii. Balloon transactions with a fixed interest rate where payments are based on an amortization schedule and a large final payment is due after a shorter term, where the creditor does not make a commitment to renew the transaction at specified intervals throughout the amortization period.<PRTPAGE P="146"/>
          </P>
          <P>iii. Transactions with a fixed interest rate where one or more of the regular periodic payments may result in an increase in the principal balance (a negative amortization feature).</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">2(b) Creditor</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Creditor.</E> As defined in 12 CFR 226.2, “creditor” includes federally and State-chartered banks, thrifts, and credit unions, as well as non-depository institutions, such as State-licensed lenders. The Official Staff Commentary to 12 CFR 226.2 contains additional guidance on the definition of the term “creditor.” <E T="03">See</E> 12 CFR 226.2, Supp. I.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">§ 1004.3 Preemption of State Law</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Scope of State laws.</E> Regardless of whether a State law applies solely to alternative mortgage transactions or applies to both alternative mortgage transactions and other mortgage or consumer credit transactions, that law is preempted by § 1004.3 only to the extent that it restricts the ability of a State-chartered or -licensed housing creditor to adjust or renegotiate an interest rate or finance charge with respect to an alternative mortgage transaction or to change the amount of interest or finance charges included in a regular periodic payment as a result of such an adjustment or renegotiation.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Examples of State laws that are preempted.</E> The following are examples of State laws that are preempted by § 1004.3:</P>
          <P>i. Restrictions on the adjustment or renegotiation of an interest rate or finance charge, including restrictions on the circumstances under which a rate or charge may be adjusted, the method by which a rate or charge may be adjusted, and the amount of the adjustment to the rate or charge. For example, if a provision of State law prohibits creditors from increasing an adjustable rate more than two percentage points or from increasing an adjustable rate more than once during a year, that provision is preempted by § 1004.3 with respect to alternative mortgage transactions that comply with § 1004.4(a) through (c), as applicable. Similarly, if a provision of State law prohibits housing creditors from renewing balloon transactions that meet the definition of an alternative mortgage transaction in § 1004.2(a) on different terms, that provision is preempted by § 1004.3 only to the extent that it restricts a state housing creditor's ability to adjust or renegotiate the interest rate or finance charge at renewal. See also comment 1004.3-3.i.</P>
          <P>ii. Restrictions on the ability of a housing creditor to change the amount of interest or finance charges included in regular periodic payments as a result of the adjustment or renegotiation of an interest rate or finance charge. For example, if a provision of State law prohibits housing creditors from increasing payments or limits the amount of such increases with respect to both alternative mortgage transactions and other mortgage or consumer credit transactions, that provision is preempted by § 1004.3 to the extent that it restricts a housing creditor's ability to adjust payments as a result of the adjustment or renegotiation of an interest rate on an alternative mortgage transaction. Other restrictions on changes to payments are not preempted, including restrictions on transactions in which one or more of the regular periodic payments may result in an increase in the principal balance (a negative amortization feature) or may be applied solely to accrued interest and not to loan principal (an interest-only feature).</P>
          <P>iii. Restrictions on the creditor and the consumer sharing some or all of the appreciation in the value of the property (shared equity/shared appreciation).</P>
          <P>iv. Underwriting requirements that address the adjustment or renegotiation of interest rates or finance charges. For example, if a provision of State law requires housing creditors to underwrite based on the maximum contractual rate, that provision is preempted by § 1004.3 with respect to alternative mortgage transactions, regardless of whether the provision applies solely to alternative mortgage transactions or to both alternative mortgage transactions and other mortgage or consumer credit transactions.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Examples of State laws that are not preempted.</E> The following are examples of State laws that are not preempted by § 1004.3 regardless of whether the provision applies solely to alternative mortgage transactions or to both alternative mortgage transactions and other mortgage or consumer credit transactions:</P>
          <P>i. Restrictions on prepayment penalties or late charges (including an increase in an interest rate or finance charge as a result of a late payment).</P>
          <P>ii. Restrictions on transactions in which one or more of the regular periodic payments may result in an increase in the principal balance (a negative amortization feature) or may be applied solely to accrued interest and not to loan principal (an interest-only feature).</P>
          <P>iii. Requirements that disclosures be provided.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">§ 1004.4 Requirements for Alternative Mortgage Transactions</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">4(a) Mortgages With Adjustable or Renegotiable Rates or Finance Charges and Home Equity Lines of Credit</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Index values.</E> A creditor may use any measure of index values that meets the requirements in § 1004.4(a)(2)(i). For example, the index may be either single values as of a specific date or an average of values calculated over a specified period.<PRTPAGE P="147"/>
          </P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Index beyond creditor's control.</E> A creditor may increase an adjustable interest rate pursuant to § 1004.4(a)(2)(i) only if the increase is based on an index that is beyond the creditor's control. For purposes of § 1004.4(a)(2)(i), an index is not beyond the creditor's control if the index is the creditor's own prime rate or cost of funds. A creditor is permitted, however, to use a published prime rate, such as the prime rate published in the <E T="03">Wall Street Journal,</E> even if the creditor's own prime rate is one of several rates used to establish the published rate.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Publicly available.</E> For purposes of § 1004.4(a)(2)(i), the index must be available to the public. A publicly available index need not be published in a newspaper, but it must be one the consumer can independently obtain (by telephone, for example) and use to verify the annual percentage rate applied to the alternative mortgage transaction.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">4(c) Requirements for High-Cost and Higher-Priced Mortgage Loans</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Prepayment penalties.</E> If applicable, creditors must comply with 12 CFR 226.32, including 12 CFR 226.32(d)(6) and (d)(7) which provide limitations on prepayment penalties. Similarly, if applicable, creditors must comply with 12 CFR 226.35, including 12 CFR 226.35(b)(2), which also provides limitations on prepayment penalties. However, under § 1004.3, State laws regarding prepayment penalties are not preempted. <E T="03">See</E> comment 1004.3-3.i. Accordingly, creditors must also comply with any State laws regarding prepayment penalties unless an independent basis for preemption exists, such as because the State law is inconsistent with the requirements of Regulation Z, 12 CFR part 226. <E T="03">See</E> 12 CFR 226.28.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">4(d) Other Applicable Law</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Other applicable law.</E> Section 1004.4(d) permits state housing creditors that do not seek preemption under § 1004.3 and federal housing creditors to make alternative mortgage transactions consistent with applicable State or federal law other than § 1004.4(a) through (c). However, § 1004.4(d) does not exempt those housing creditors from complying with the provisions of federal law that are incorporated by reference in § 1004.4 and are otherwise applicable to the creditor. Specifically, nothing in § 1004.4(d) exempts a housing creditor from complying with 12 CFR 226.5b, 226.32, 226.34, or 226.35.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> This part applies to any electronic fund transfer that authorizes a financial institution to debit or credit a consumer's account. Generally, this part applies to financial institutions. For purposes of §§ 1005.3(b)(2) and (3), 1005.10(b), (d), and (e), 1005.13, and 1005.20, this part applies to any person, other than a person excluded from coverage of this part by section 1029 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010, Title X of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Pub. L. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376. The requirements of subpart B apply to remittance transfer providers.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Electronic fund transfer</E>—(1) <E T="03">Definition.</E> The term “electronic fund transfer” means any transfer of funds that is initiated through an electronic terminal, telephone, computer, or magnetic tape for the purpose of ordering, instructing, or authorizing a financial institution to debit or credit a consumer's account. The term includes, but is not limited to:</P>
            <P>(i) Point-of-sale transfers;</P>
            <P>(ii) Automated teller machine transfers;</P>
            <P>(iii) Direct deposits or withdrawals of funds;</P>
            <P>(iv) Transfers initiated by telephone; and</P>
            <P>(v) Transfers resulting from debit card transactions, whether or not initiated through an electronic terminal.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Electronic fund transfer using information from a check.</E> (i) This part applies where a check, draft, or similar paper instrument is used as a source of information to initiate a one-time electronic fund transfer from a consumer's account. The consumer must authorize the transfer.</P>
            <P>(ii) The person initiating an electronic fund transfer using the consumer's check as a source of information for the transfer must provide a notice that the transaction will or may be processed as an electronic fund transfer, and obtain a consumer's authorization for each transfer. A consumer authorizes a one-time electronic fund transfer (in providing a check to a merchant or other payee for the MICR encoding, that is, the routing number of the financial institution, the consumer's account number and the serial number) when the consumer receives notice and goes forward with the underlying transaction. For point-of-sale transfers, the notice must be posted in a prominent and conspicuous location, and a copy thereof, or a substantially similar notice, must be provided to the consumer at the time of the transaction.</P>
            <P>(iii) A person may provide notices that are substantially similar to those set forth in appendix A-6 to comply with the requirements of this paragraph (b)(2).</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Collection of returned item fees via electronic fund transfer</E>—(i) <E T="03">General.</E> The person initiating an electronic fund transfer to collect a fee for the return of an electronic fund transfer or a check that is unpaid, including due to insufficient or uncollected funds in the consumer's account, must obtain the consumer's authorization for each transfer. A consumer authorizes a one-time electronic fund transfer from his or her account to pay the fee for the returned item or transfer if the person collecting the fee provides notice to the consumer stating that the person may electronically collect the fee, and the consumer goes forward with the underlying transaction. The notice must state that the fee will be collected by means of an electronic fund transfer from the consumer's account if the payment is returned unpaid and must disclose the dollar amount of the fee. If the fee may vary due to the amount of the transaction or due to other factors, then, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, the person collecting the fee may disclose, in place of the dollar amount of the fee, an explanation of how the fee will be determined.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Point-of-sale transactions.</E> If a fee for an electronic fund transfer or check <PRTPAGE P="151"/>returned unpaid may be collected electronically in connection with a point-of-sale transaction, the person initiating an electronic fund transfer to collect the fee must post the notice described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section in a prominent and conspicuous location. The person also must either provide the consumer with a copy of the posted notice (or a substantially similar notice) at the time of the transaction, or mail the copy (or a substantially similar notice) to the consumer's address as soon as reasonably practicable after the person initiates the electronic fund transfer to collect the fee. If the amount of the fee may vary due to the amount of the transaction or due to other factors, the posted notice may explain how the fee will be determined, but the notice provided to the consumer must state the dollar amount of the fee if the amount can be calculated at the time the notice is provided or mailed to the consumer.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Conditions for liability.</E> A consumer may be held liable, within the limitations described in paragraph (b) of this section, for an unauthorized electronic fund transfer involving the consumer's account only if the financial institution has provided the disclosures required by § 1005.7(b)(1), (2), and (3).

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Limitations on amount of liability.</E> A consumer's liability for an unauthorized electronic fund transfer or a series of related unauthorized transfers shall be determined as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Timely notice given.</E> If the consumer notifies the financial institution within two business days after learning of the loss or theft of the access device, the consumer's liability shall not exceed the lesser of $50 or the amount of <PRTPAGE P="153"/>unauthorized transfers that occur before notice to the financial institution.</P>

If the consumer fails to do so, the consumer's liability shall not exceed the amount of the unauthorized transfers that occur after the close of the 60 days and before notice to the institution, and that the institution establishes would not have occurred had the consumer notified the institution within the 60-day period. When an access device is involved in the unauthorized transfer, the consumer may be liable for other amounts set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, as applicable.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Extension of time limits.</E> If the consumer's delay in notifying the financial institution was due to extenuating circumstances, the institution shall extend the times specified above to a reasonable period.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Notice to financial institution.</E> (i) Notice to a financial institution is given when a consumer takes steps reasonably necessary to provide the institution with the pertinent information, whether or not a particular employee or agent of the institution actually receives the information.</P>
            <P>(ii) The consumer may notify the institution in person, by telephone, or in writing.</P>
            <P>(iii) Written notice is considered given at the time the consumer mails the notice or delivers it for transmission to the institution by any other usual means. Notice may be considered constructively given when the institution becomes aware of circumstances leading to the reasonable belief that an unauthorized transfer to or from the consumer's account has been or may be made.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Liability under state law or agreement.</E> If state law or an agreement between the consumer and the financial institution imposes less liability than is provided by this section, the consumer's liability shall not exceed the amount imposed under the state law or agreement.</P>

            <P>(2) <E T="03">Types of inquiries not covered.</E> The term “error” does not include:</P>
            <P>(i) A routine inquiry about the consumer's account balance;</P>
            <P>(ii) A request for information for tax or other recordkeeping purposes; or</P>
            <P>(iii) A request for duplicate copies of documentation.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Notice of error from consumer</E>—(1) <E T="03">Timing; contents.</E> A financial institution shall comply with the requirements of this section with respect to any oral or written notice of error from the consumer that:</P>
            <P>(i) Is received by the institution no later than 60 days after the institution sends the periodic statement or provides the passbook documentation, required by § 1005.9, on which the alleged error is first reflected;</P>
            <P>(ii) Enables the institution to identify the consumer's name and account number; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Indicates why the consumer believes an error exists and includes to the extent possible the type, date, and amount of the error, except for requests described in paragraph (a)(1)(vii) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Written confirmation.</E> A financial institution may require the consumer to give written confirmation of an error within 10 business days of an oral notice.

            <P>(c) <E T="03">Time limits and extent of investigation</E>—(1) <E T="03">Ten-day period.</E> A financial institution shall investigate promptly and, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c), shall determine whether an error occurred within 10 <PRTPAGE P="158"/>business days of receiving a notice of error. The institution shall report the results to the consumer within three business days after completing its investigation. The institution shall correct the error within one business day after determining that an error occurred.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Forty-five day period.</E> If the financial institution is unable to complete its investigation within 10 business days, the institution may take up to 45 days from receipt of a notice of error to investigate and determine whether an error occurred, provided the institution does the following:</P>
            <P>(i) Provisionally credits the consumer's account in the amount of the alleged error (including interest where applicable) within 10 business days of receiving the error notice. If the financial institution has a reasonable basis for believing that an unauthorized electronic fund transfer has occurred and the institution has satisfied the requirements of § 1005.6(a), the institution may withhold a maximum of $50 from the amount credited. An institution need not provisionally credit the consumer's account if:</P>
            <P>(A) The institution requires but does not receive written confirmation within 10 business days of an oral notice of error; or</P>
            <P>(B) The alleged error involves an account that is subject to Regulation T of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Securities Credit by Brokers and Dealers, 12 CFR part 220);</P>

            <P>(iii) Corrects the error, if any, within one business day after determining that an error occurred; and</P>
            <P>(iv) Reports the results to the consumer within three business days after completing its investigation (including, if applicable, notice that a provisional credit has been made final).</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Extension of time periods.</E> The time periods in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section are extended as follows:</P>
            <P>(i) The applicable time is 20 business days in place of 10 business days under paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section if the notice of error involves an electronic fund transfer to or from the account within 30 days after the first deposit to the account was made.</P>
            <P>(ii) The applicable time is 90 days in place of 45 days under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, for completing an investigation, if a notice of error involves an electronic fund transfer that:</P>
            <P>(A) Was not initiated within a state;</P>
            <P>(B) Resulted from a point-of-sale debit card transaction; or</P>
            <P>(C) Occurred within 30 days after the first deposit to the account was made.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Investigation.</E> With the exception of transfers covered by § 1005.14 of this part, a financial institution's review of its own records regarding an alleged error satisfies the requirements of this section if:</P>
            <P>(i) The alleged error concerns a transfer to or from a third party; and</P>
            <P>(ii) There is no agreement between the institution and the third party for the type of electronic fund transfer involved.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Procedures if financial institution determines no error or different error occurred.</E> In addition to following the procedures specified in paragraph (c) of this section, the financial institution shall follow the procedures set forth in this paragraph (d) if it determines that no error occurred or that an error occurred in a manner or amount different from that described by the consumer:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Written explanation.</E> The institution's report of the results of its investigation shall include a written explanation of the institution's findings and shall note the consumer's right to request the documents that the institution relied on in making its determination. Upon request, the institution shall promptly provide copies of the documents.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Debiting provisional credit.</E> Upon debiting a provisionally credited amount, the financial institution shall:</P>
            <P>(i) Notify the consumer of the date and amount of the debiting;</P>

            <P>(ii) Notify the consumer that the institution will honor checks, drafts, or similar instruments payable to third parties and preauthorized transfers from the consumer's account (without charge to the consumer as a result of an overdraft) for five business days <PRTPAGE P="159"/>after the notification. The institution shall honor items as specified in the notice, but need honor only items that it would have paid if the provisionally credited funds had not been debited.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Reassertion of error.</E> A financial institution that has fully complied with the error resolution requirements has no further responsibilities under this section should the consumer later reassert the same error, except in the case of an error asserted by the consumer following receipt of information provided under paragraph (a)(1)(vii) of this section.</P>

If a financial institution does not provide the long form disclosure inside the prepaid account packaging material, and it is not otherwise already mailing or delivering to the consumer written account-related communications within 30 days of obtaining the consumer's contact information, it may provide the long form disclosure pursuant to this paragraph in electronic form without regard to the consumer notice and consent requirements of section 101(c) of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act) (15 U.S.C. 7001 <E T="03">et seq.</E>).</P>

The long form disclosure must be provided electronically through a website when a financial institution is offering prepaid accounts at a retail location pursuant to the retail location exception in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. Electronic disclosures must be provided in a manner which is reasonably expected to be accessible in light of how a consumer is acquiring the prepaid account, in a responsive form, and using machine-readable text that is accessible via Web browsers or mobile applications, as applicable, and via screen readers. Electronic disclosures provided pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section need not meet the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act) (15 U.S.C. 7001 <E T="03">et seq.</E>).</P>

Text describing the conditions under which a fee may be imposed must appear in the table required by paragraph (b)(6)(iii)(A) of this section in close proximity to the fee amount. The statements in the long form disclosure required by paragraphs (b)(4)(iii) through (vi) of this section must be generally grouped together, provided in that order, and appear below the information required by paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section. If, pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(vii) of this section, the financial institution includes the disclosures described in Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.60(e)(1), such disclosures must appear below the statements required by paragraph (b)(4)(vi) of this section.<STARS/>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Agreement.</E> For purposes of this section, “agreement” or “prepaid account agreement” means the written document or documents evidencing the terms of the legal obligation, or the prospective legal obligation, between a prepaid account issuer and a consumer for a prepaid account. “Agreement” or “prepaid account agreement” also includes fee information, as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Amends.</E> For purposes of this section, an issuer “amends” an agreement if it makes a substantive change (an “amendment”) to the agreement. A change is substantive if it alters the rights or obligations of the issuer or the consumer under the agreement. Any change in the fee information, as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, is deemed to be substantive.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Fee information.</E> For purposes of this section, “fee information” means the short form disclosure for the prepaid account pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2) and the fee information and statements required to be disclosed in the pre-acquisition long form disclosure for the prepaid account pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(4).</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Issuer.</E> For purposes of this section, “issuer” or “prepaid account issuer” means the entity to which a consumer is legally obligated, or would be legally obligated, under the terms of a prepaid account agreement.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Offers.</E> For purposes of this section, an issuer “offers” an agreement if the issuer markets, solicits applications for, or otherwise makes available a prepaid account that would be subject to that agreement, regardless of whether the issuer offers the prepaid account to the general public.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Offers to the general public.</E> For purposes of this section, an issuer “offers to the general public” an agreement if the issuer markets, solicits applications for, or otherwise makes available to the general public a prepaid account that would be subject to that agreement.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Open account.</E> For purposes of this section, a prepaid account is an “open account” or “open prepaid account” if: There is an outstanding balance in the account; the consumer can load funds to the account even if the account does not currently hold a balance; or the consumer can access credit from a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.61, in connection with the account. A prepaid account that has been suspended temporarily (for example, due to a report by the consumer of unauthorized use of the card) is considered an “open account” or “open prepaid account.”</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Prepaid account.</E> For purposes of this section, “prepaid account” means a prepaid account as defined in § 1005.2(b)(3).</P>

            <P>(ii) If an issuer that did not previously qualify for the de minimis exception newly qualifies for the de minimis exception, the issuer must continue to make submissions to the Bureau on a rolling basis until the issuer notifies the Bureau that the issuer is withdrawing all agreements it previously submitted to the Bureau.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Product testing exception.</E> (i) An issuer is not required to submit a prepaid account agreement to the Bureau if the agreement meets the criteria set forth in paragraphs (b)(5)(i)(A) through (C) of this section.

            <P>(iv) A change in the amount or type of currency received by the designated recipient from the amount or type of currency stated in the disclosure provided to the sender under § 1005.31(b)(2) or (3) if the remittance transfer provider relied on information provided by the sender as permitted under § 1005.31 in making such disclosure.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Notice of error from sender</E>—(1) <E T="03">Timing; contents.</E> A remittance transfer provider shall comply with the requirements of this section with respect to any oral or written notice of error from a sender that:</P>
            <P>(i) Is received by the remittance transfer provider no later than 180 days after the disclosed date of availability of the remittance transfer;</P>
            <P>(ii) Enables the provider to identify:</P>
            <P>(A) The sender's name and telephone number or address;</P>
            <P>(B) The recipient's name, and if known, the telephone number or address of the recipient; and</P>
            <P>(C) The remittance transfer to which the notice of error applies; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Indicates why the sender believes an error exists and includes to the extent possible the type, date, and amount of the error, except for requests for documentation, additional information, or clarification described in paragraph (a)(1)(v) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Request for documentation or clarification.</E> When a notice of error is based on documentation, additional information, or clarification that the sender previously requested under paragraph (a)(1)(v) of this section, the sender's notice of error is timely if received by the remittance transfer provider the later of 180 days after the disclosed date of availability of the remittance transfer or 60 days after the provider sent the documentation, information, or clarification that had been requested.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Time limits and extent of investigation</E>—(1) <E T="03">Time limits for investigation and report to consumer of error.</E> A remittance transfer provider shall investigate promptly and determine whether an error occurred within 90 days of receiving a notice of error. The remittance transfer provider shall report the results to the sender, including notice of any remedies available for correcting any error that the provider determines has occurred, within three business days after completing its investigation.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Remedies.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section, if, following an assertion of an error by a sender, the remittance transfer provider determines an error occurred, the provider shall, within one business day of, or as soon as reasonably practicable after, receiving the sender's instructions regarding the appropriate remedy, correct the error as designated by the sender by:<PRTPAGE P="198"/>
            </P>
            <P>(i) In the case of any error under paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section, as applicable, either:</P>
            <P>(A) Refunding to the sender the amount of funds provided by the sender in connection with a remittance transfer which was not properly transmitted, or the amount appropriate to resolve the error; or</P>
            <P>(B) Making available to the designated recipient, without additional cost to the sender or to the designated recipient, the amount appropriate to resolve the error;</P>
            <P>(ii) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section, in the case of an error under paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section</P>

            <P>(B) Refunding to the sender any fees imposed and, to the extent not prohibited by law, taxes collected on the remittance transfer;</P>

            <P>(iii) In the case of an error under paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section that occurred because the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information in connection with the remittance transfer, the remittance transfer provider shall provide the remedies required by paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(A)(<E T="03">1</E>) and (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section within three business days of providing the report required by paragraph (c)(1) or (d)(1) of this section except that the provider may agree to the sender's request, upon receiving the results of the error investigation, that the funds be applied towards a new remittance transfer, rather than be refunded, if the provider has not yet processed a refund. The provider may deduct from the amount refunded or applied towards a new transfer any fees actually imposed on or, to the extent not prohibited by law, taxes actually collected on the remittance transfer as part of the first unsuccessful remittance transfer attempt except that the provider shall not deduct its own fee.</P>
            <P>(iv) In the case of a request under paragraph (a)(1)(v) of this section, providing the requested documentation, information, or clarification.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Procedures if remittance transfer provider determines no error or different error occurred.</E> In addition to following the procedures specified in paragraph (c) of this section, the remittance transfer provider shall follow the procedures set forth in this paragraph (d) if it determines that no error occurred or that an error occurred in a manner or amount different from that described by the sender.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Explanation of results of investigation.</E> The remittance transfer provider's report of the results of the investigation shall include a written explanation of the provider's findings and shall note the sender's right to request the documents on which the provider relied in making its determination. The explanation shall also address the specific complaint of the sender.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Copies of documentation.</E> Upon the sender's request, the remittance transfer provider shall promptly provide copies of the documents on which the provider relied in making its error determination.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Reassertion of error.</E> A remittance transfer provider that has fully complied with the error resolution requirements of this section has no further responsibilities under this section should the sender later reassert the same error, except in the case of an error asserted by the sender following receipt of information provided under paragraph (a)(1)(v) of this section.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Relation to other laws</E>—(1) <E T="03">Relation to Regulation E § 1005.11 for incorrect EFTs from a sender's account.</E> If an alleged error involves an incorrect electronic fund transfer from a sender's account in connection with a remittance transfer, and the sender provides a notice of error to the account-holding institution, the account-holding institution shall comply with the requirements of § 1005.11 governing error resolution rather than the requirements of this section, provided that the account-<PRTPAGE P="199"/>holding institution is not also the remittance transfer provider. If the remittance transfer provider is also the financial institution that holds the consumer's account, then the error-resolution provisions of this section apply when the sender provides such notice of error.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Relation to Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z.</E> If an alleged error involves an incorrect extension of credit in connection with a remittance transfer, an incorrect amount received by the designated recipient under paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section that is an extension of credit for property or services not delivered as agreed, or the failure to make funds available by the disclosed date of availability under paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section that is an extension of credit for property or services not delivered as agreed, and the sender provides a notice of error to the creditor extending the credit, the provisions of Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.13, governing error resolution apply to the creditor, rather than the requirements of this section, even if the creditor is the remittance transfer provider. However, if the creditor is the remittance transfer provider, paragraph (b) of this section will apply instead of 12 CFR 1026.13(b). If the sender instead provides a notice of error to the remittance transfer provider that is not also the creditor, then the error-resolution provisions of this section apply to the remittance transfer provider.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Unauthorized remittance transfers.</E> If an alleged error involves an unauthorized electronic fund transfer for payment in connection with a remittance transfer, §§ 1005.6 and 1005.11 apply with respect to the account-holding institution. If an alleged error involves an unauthorized use of a credit account for payment in connection with a remittance transfer, the provisions of Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.12(b), if applicable, and § 1026.13, apply with respect to the creditor.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Error resolution standards and recordkeeping requirements</E>—(1) <E T="03">Compliance program.</E> A remittance transfer provider shall develop and maintain written policies and procedures that are designed to ensure compliance with the error resolution requirements applicable to remittance transfers under this section.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Retention of error-related documentation.</E> The remittance transfer provider's policies and procedures required under paragraph (g)(1) of this section shall include policies and procedures regarding the retention of documentation related to error investigations. Such policies and procedures must ensure, at a minimum, the retention of any notices of error submitted by a sender, documentation provided by the sender to the provider with respect to the alleged error, and the findings of the remittance transfer provider regarding the investigation of the alleged error. Remittance transfer providers are subject to the record retention requirements under § 1005.13.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Incorrect account number or recipient institution identifier provided by the sender.</E> The exception in paragraph (a)(1)(iv)(D) of this section applies if:</P>
            <P>(1) The remittance transfer provider can demonstrate that the sender provided an incorrect account number or recipient institution identifier to the provider in connection with the remittance transfer;</P>
            <P>(2) For any instance in which the sender provided the incorrect recipient institution identifier, prior to or when sending the transfer, the provider used reasonably available means to verify that the recipient institution identifier provided by the sender corresponded to the recipient institution name provided by the sender;</P>
            <P>(3) The provider provided notice to the sender before the sender made payment for the remittance transfer that, in the event the sender provided an incorrect account number or recipient institution identifier, the sender could lose the transfer amount. For purposes of providing this disclosure, § 1005.31(a)(2) applies to this notice unless the notice is given at the same time as other disclosures required by this subpart for which information is permitted to be disclosed orally or via mobile application or text message, in which case this disclosure may be given in the same medium as those other disclosures;</P>

            <P>(4) The incorrect account number or recipient institution identifier resulted <PRTPAGE P="200"/>in the deposit of the remittance transfer into a customer's account that is not the designated recipient's account; and</P>
            <P>(5) The provider promptly used reasonable efforts to recover the amount that was to be received by the designated recipient.</P>

            <P>(1) The request to cancel enables the provider to identify the sender's name and address or telephone number and the particular transfer to be cancelled; and</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Timing.</E> (1) For a one-time transfer scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer or for the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, the remittance transfer provider must:</P>
            <P>(i) Provide either the pre-payment disclosure described in § 1005.31(b)(1) and the receipt described in § 1005.31(b)(2) or the combined disclosure described in § 1005.31(b)(3), in accordance with the timing requirements set forth in § 1005.31(e); and</P>
            <P>(ii) If any of the disclosures provided pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section contain estimates as permitted by § 1005.32(b)(2), mail or deliver to the sender an additional receipt meeting the requirements described in § 1005.31(b)(2) no later than one business day after the date of the transfer. If the transfer involves the transfer of funds from the sender's account held by the provider, the receipt required by this paragraph may be provided on or with the next periodic statement for that account, or within 30 days after the date of the transfer if a periodic statement is not provided.</P>
            <P>(2) For each subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer:</P>
            <P>(i) If any of the information on the most recent receipt provided pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, or by this paragraph (a)(2)(i), other than the temporal disclosures required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) and (b)(2)(vii), is no longer accurate with respect to a subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer for reasons other than as permitted by § 1005.32, then the remittance transfer provider must provide an updated receipt meeting the requirements described in § 1005.31(b)(2) to the sender. The provider must mail or deliver this receipt to the sender within a reasonable time prior to the scheduled date of the next subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer. Such receipt must clearly and conspicuously indicate that it contains updated disclosures.</P>

            <P>(ii) Unless a receipt was provided in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section that contained no estimates pursuant to § 1005.32, the remittance transfer provider must mail or deliver to the sender a receipt meeting the requirements described in § 1005.31(b)(2) no later than one business day after the date of the transfer. If the remittance transfer involves the <PRTPAGE P="201"/>transfer of funds from the sender's account held by the provider, the receipt required by this paragraph may be provided on or with the next periodic statement for that account, or within 30 days after the date of the transfer if a periodic statement is not provided.</P>
            <P>(iii) A remittance transfer provider must provide the disclosures required by paragraph (d) of this section in accordance with the timing requirements of that section.</P>

            <P>(2) For each subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer, the most recent receipt provided pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (a)(2)(i) of this section must be accurate as of when such transfer is made, except:</P>
            <P>(i) The temporal elements required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) and (b)(2)(vii) must be accurate only if the transfer is the first transfer to occur after the disclosure was provided; and</P>
            <P>(ii) To the extent estimates are permitted by § 1005.32.</P>
            <P>(3) Disclosures provided pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(ii) or (a)(2)(ii) of this section must be accurate as of when the remittance transfer to which it pertains is made, except to the extent estimates are permitted by § 1005.32(a) or (b)(1).</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Cancellation.</E> For any remittance transfer scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer, a remittance transfer provider shall comply with any oral or written request to cancel the remittance transfer from the sender if the request to cancel:</P>
            <P>(1) Enables the provider to identify the sender's name and address or telephone number and the particular transfer to be cancelled; and</P>
            <P>(2) Is received by the provider at least three business days before the scheduled date of the remittance transfer.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Additional requirements for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers</E>—(1) <E T="03">Disclosure requirement.</E> (i) For any subsequent transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, the remittance transfer provider must disclose to the sender:</P>
            <P>(A) The date the provider will make the subsequent transfer, using the term “Future Transfer Date,” or a substantially similar term;</P>
            <P>(B) A statement about the rights of the sender regarding cancellation as described in § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv); and</P>
            <P>(C) The name, telephone number(s), and Web site of the remittance transfer provider.</P>

            <P>(ii) If the future date or dates of transfer are described as occurring in regular periodic intervals, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> the 15th of every month, rather than as a specific calendar date or dates, the remittance transfer provider must disclose any future date or dates of transfer that do not conform to the described interval.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Notice requirements.</E> (i) Except as described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, the disclosures required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section must be received by the sender no more than 12 months, and no less than five business days prior to the date of any subsequent transfer to which it pertains. The disclosures required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section may be provided in a separate disclosure or may be provided on one or more disclosures required by this subpart related to the same series of preauthorized transfers, so long as the consumer receives the required information for each subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer in accordance with the timing requirements of this paragraph (d)(2)(i).</P>
            <P>(ii) For any subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer for which the date of transfer is four or fewer business days after the date payment is made for that transfer, the information required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section must be provided on or with the receipt described in § 1005.31(b)(2), or disclosed as permitted by § 1005.31(a)(3) or (a)(5), for the initial transfer in that series in accordance with paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Specific format requirement.</E> The information required by paragraph <PRTPAGE P="202"/>(d)(1)(i)(A) of this section generally must be disclosed in close proximity to the other information required by paragraph (d)(1)(i)(B) of this section.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Accuracy.</E> Any disclosure required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section must be accurate as of the date the preauthorized remittance transfer to which it pertains is made.</P>

            <P>(Tell us AT ONCE if you believe your [card] [code] has been lost or stolen, or if you believe that an electronic fund transfer has been made without your permission using information from your check. Telephoning is the best way of keeping your possible losses down. You could lose all the money in your account (plus your maximum overdraft line of credit). If you tell us within 2 business days after you learn of the loss or theft of your [card] [code], you can lose no more than $50 if someone used your [card][code] without your permission.)</P>

            <P>Also, if your statement shows transfers that you did not make, including those made <PRTPAGE P="203"/>by card, code or other means, tell us at once.

            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Section 1005.2 Definitions</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2(a) Access Device</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Examples.</E> The term “access device” includes debit cards, personal identification numbers (PINs), telephone transfer and telephone bill payment codes, and other means that may be used by a consumer to initiate an electronic fund transfer (EFT) to or from a consumer account. The term does not include magnetic tape or other devices used internally by a financial institution to initiate electronic transfers.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Checks used to capture information.</E> The term “access device” does not include a check or draft used to capture the Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) encoding to initiate a one-time automated clearinghouse (ACH) debit. For example, if a consumer authorizes a one-time ACH debit from the consumer's account using a blank, partially completed, or fully completed and signed check for the merchant to capture the routing, account, and serial numbers to initiate the debit, the check is not an access device. (Although the check is not an access device under Regulation E, the transaction is nonetheless covered by the regulation. <E T="03">See</E> comment 3(b)(1)-1.v.)</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2(b) Account</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Consumer asset account.</E> The term “consumer asset account” includes:</P>
            <P>i. Club accounts, such as vacation clubs. In many cases, however, these accounts are exempt from the regulation under § 1005.3(c)(5) because all electronic transfers to or from the account have been preauthorized by the consumer and involve another account of the consumer at the same institution.</P>
            <P>ii. A retail repurchase agreement (repo), which is a loan made to a financial institution by a consumer that is collateralized by government or government-insured securities.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Certain employment-related cards not covered.</E> The term “payroll card account” does not include a card used solely to disburse incentive-based payments (other than commissions which can represent the primary means through which a consumer is paid), such as bonuses, which are unlikely to be a consumer's primary source of salary or other compensation. The term also does not include a card used solely to make disbursements unrelated to compensation, such as petty cash reimbursements or travel per diem payments. Similarly, a payroll card account does not include a card that is used in isolated instances to which an employer typically does not make recurring payments, such as when providing final payments or in emergency situations when other payment methods are unavailable. However, all transactions involving the transfer of funds to or from a payroll card account are covered by the regulation, even if a particular transaction involves payment of a bonus, other incentive-based payment, or reimbursement, or the transaction does not represent a transfer of wages, salary, or other employee compensation.</P>
            <P>3. Examples of accounts not covered by Regulation E (12 CFR part 1005) include:</P>
            <P>i. Profit-sharing and pension accounts established under a trust agreement, which are exempt under § 1005.2(b)(2).</P>
            <P>ii. Escrow accounts, such as those established to ensure payment of items such as real estate taxes, insurance premiums, or completion of repairs or improvements.</P>
            <P>iii. Accounts for accumulating funds to purchase U.S. savings bonds.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Paragraph 2(b)(2)</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Bona fide trust agreements.</E> The term “bona fide trust agreement” is not defined by the Act or regulation; therefore, financial institutions must look to state or other applicable law for interpretation.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Custodial agreements.</E> An account held under a custodial agreement that qualifies as a trust under the Internal Revenue Code, such as an individual retirement account, is considered to be held under a trust agreement for purposes of Regulation E.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2(d) Business Day</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Duration.</E> A business day includes the entire 24-hour period ending at midnight, and a notice required by the regulation is effective even if given outside normal business hours. The regulation does not require, however, that a financial institution make telephone lines available on a 24-hour basis.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Substantially all business functions.</E> Substantially all business functions include both the public and the back-office operations of the institution. For example, if the offices of an institution are open on Saturdays for handling some consumer transactions (such as deposits, withdrawals, and other teller transactions), but not for performing internal functions (such as investigating account errors), then Saturday is not a business day for that institution. In this case, Saturday does not count toward the business-day standard set by the regulation for reporting lost or stolen access devices, resolving errors, <E T="03">etc.</E>
              <PRTPAGE P="230"/>
            </P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Short hours.</E> A financial institution may determine, at its election, whether an abbreviated day is a business day. For example, if an institution engages in substantially all business functions until noon on Saturdays instead of its usual 3 p.m. closing, it may consider Saturday a business day.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Telephone line.</E> If a financial institution makes a telephone line available on Sundays for reporting the loss or theft of an access device, but performs no other business functions, Sunday is not a business day under the substantially all business functions standard.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2(h) Electronic Terminal</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Point-of-sale (POS) payments initiated by telephone.</E> Because the term “electronic terminal” excludes a telephone operated by a consumer, a financial institution need not provide a terminal receipt when:</P>
            <P>i. A consumer uses a debit card at a public telephone to pay for the call.</P>
            <P>ii. A consumer initiates a transfer by a means analogous in function to a telephone, such as by home banking equipment or a facsimile machine.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">POS terminals.</E> A POS terminal that captures data electronically, for debiting or crediting to a consumer's asset account, is an electronic terminal for purposes of Regulation E even if no access device is used to initiate the transaction. <E T="03">See</E> § 1005.9 for receipt requirements.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Teller-operated terminals.</E> A terminal or other computer equipment operated by an employee of a financial institution is not an electronic terminal for purposes of the regulation. However, transfers initiated at such terminals by means of a consumer's access device (using the consumer's PIN, for example) are EFTs and are subject to other requirements of the regulation. If an access device is used only for identification purposes or for determining the account balance, the transfers are not EFTs for purposes of the regulation.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2(k) Preauthorized Electronic Fund Transfer</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Advance authorization.</E> A preauthorized electronic fund transfer under Regulation E is one authorized by the consumer in advance of a transfer that will take place on a recurring basis, at substantially regular intervals, and will require no further action by the consumer to initiate the transfer. In a bill-payment system, for example, if the consumer authorizes a financial institution to make monthly payments to a payee by means of EFTs, and the payments take place without further action by the consumer, the payments are preauthorized EFTs. In contrast, if the consumer must take action each month to initiate a payment (such as by entering instructions on a touch-tone telephone or home computer), the payments are not preauthorized EFTs.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">2(m) Unauthorized Electronic Fund Transfer</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Transfer by institution's employee.</E> A consumer has no liability for erroneous or fraudulent transfers initiated by an employee of a financial institution.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Authority.</E> If a consumer furnishes an access device and grants authority to make transfers to a person (such as a family member or co-worker) who exceeds the authority given, the consumer is fully liable for the transfers unless the consumer has notified the financial institution that transfers by that person are no longer authorized.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Access device obtained through robbery or fraud.</E> An unauthorized EFT includes a transfer initiated by a person who obtained the access device from the consumer through fraud or robbery.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Forced initiation.</E> An EFT at an ATM is an unauthorized transfer if the consumer has been induced by force to initiate the transfer.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Reversal of direct deposits.</E> The reversal of a direct deposit made in error is not an unauthorized EFT when it involves:</P>
            <P>i. A credit made to the wrong consumer's account;</P>
            <P>ii. A duplicate credit made to a consumer's account; or</P>
            <P>iii. A credit in the wrong amount (for example, when the amount credited to the consumer's account differs from the amount in the transmittal instructions).</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Section 1005.3 Coverage</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">3(a) General</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Accounts covered.</E> The requirements of the regulation apply only to an account for which an agreement for EFT services to or from the account has been entered into between:</P>
            <P>i. The consumer and the financial institution (including an account for which an access device has been issued to the consumer, for example);</P>
            <P>ii. The consumer and a third party (for preauthorized debits or credits, for example), when the account-holding institution has received notice of the agreement and the fund transfers have begun.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Automated clearing house (ACH) membership.</E> The fact that membership in an ACH requires a financial institution to accept EFTs to accounts at the institution does not make every account of that institution subject to the regulation.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Foreign applicability.</E> Regulation E applies to all persons (including branches and other offices of foreign banks located in the United States) that offer EFT services to residents of any state, including resident aliens. It covers any account located in the <PRTPAGE P="231"/>United States through which EFTs are offered to a resident of a state. This is the case whether or not a particular transfer takes place in the United States and whether or not the financial institution is chartered in the United States or a foreign country. The regulation does not apply to a foreign branch of a U.S. bank unless the EFT services are offered in connection with an account in a state as defined in § 1005.2(l).</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">3(b) Electronic Fund Transfer</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">3(b)(1) Definition</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Fund transfers covered.</E> The term “electronic fund transfer” includes:</P>
            <P>i. A deposit made at an ATM or other electronic terminal (including a deposit in cash or by check) provided a specific agreement exists between the financial institution and the consumer for EFTs to or from the account to which the deposit is made.</P>
            <P>ii. A transfer sent via ACH. For example, social security benefits under the U.S. Treasury's direct-deposit program are covered, even if the listing of payees and payment amounts reaches the account-holding institution by means of a computer printout from a correspondent bank.</P>
            <P>iii. A preauthorized transfer credited or debited to an account in accordance with instructions contained on magnetic tape, even if the financial institution holding the account sends or receives a composite check.</P>
            <P>iv. A transfer from the consumer's account resulting from a debit-card transaction at a merchant location, even if no electronic terminal is involved at the time of the transaction, if the consumer's asset account is subsequently debited for the amount of the transfer.</P>
            <P>v. A transfer via ACH where a consumer has provided a check to enable the merchant or other payee to capture the routing, account, and serial numbers to initiate the transfer, whether the check is blank, partially completed, or fully completed and signed; whether the check is presented at POS or is mailed to a merchant or other payee or lockbox and later converted to an EFT; or whether the check is retained by the consumer, the merchant or other payee, or the payee's financial institution.</P>
            <P>vi. A payment made by a bill payer under a bill-payment service available to a consumer via computer or other electronic means, unless the terms of the bill-payment service explicitly state that all payments, or all payments to a particular payee or payees, will be solely by check, draft, or similar paper instrument drawn on the consumer's account, and the payee or payees that will be paid in this manner are identified to the consumer.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Fund transfers not covered.</E> The term “electronic fund transfer” does not include:</P>
            <P>i. A payment that does not debit or credit a consumer asset account, such as a payroll allotment to a creditor to repay a credit extension (which is deducted from salary).</P>
            <P>ii. A payment made in currency by a consumer to another person at an electronic terminal.</P>
            <P>iii. A preauthorized check drawn by the financial institution on the consumer's account (such as an interest or other recurring payment to the consumer or another party), even if the check is computer-generated.</P>
            <P>iv. Transactions arising from the electronic collection, presentment, or return of checks through the check collection system, such as through transmission of electronic check images.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">3(b)(2) Electronic Fund Transfer Using Information From a Check</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Notice at POS not furnished due to inadvertent error.</E> If the copy of the notice under section 1005.3(b)(2)(ii) for electronic check conversion (ECK) transactions is not provided to the consumer at POS because of a bona fide unintentional error, such as when a terminal printing mechanism jams, no violation results if the payee maintains procedures reasonably adapted to avoid such occurrences.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Authorization to process a transaction as an EFT or as a check.</E> In order to process a transaction as an EFT, or alternatively as a check, the payee must obtain the consumer's authorization to do so. A payee may, at its option, specify the circumstances under which a check may not be converted to an EFT. <E T="03">See</E> model clauses in appendix A-6.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Notice for each transfer.</E> Generally, a notice to authorize an electronic check conversion transaction must be provided for each transaction. For example, a consumer must receive a notice that the transaction will be processed as an EFT for each transaction at POS or each time a consumer mails a check in an accounts receivable (ARC) transaction to pay a bill, such as a utility bill, if the payee intends to convert a check received as payment. Similarly, the consumer must receive notice if the payee intends to collect a service fee for insufficient or uncollected funds via an EFT for each transaction whether at POS or if the consumer mails a check to pay a bill. The notice about when funds may be debited from a consumer's account and the non-return of consumer checks by the consumer's financial institution must also be provided for each transaction. However, if in an ARC transaction, a payee provides a coupon book to a consumer, for example, for mortgage loan payments, and the payment dates and amounts are set out in the coupon book, the payee may provide a single notice on the coupon book stating all of the required disclosures under paragraph (b)(2) of this section in order to obtain authorization for each conversion of a <PRTPAGE P="232"/>check and any debits via EFT to the consumer's account to collect any service fees imposed by the payee for insufficient or uncollected funds in the consumer's account. The notice must be placed on a conspicuous location of the coupon book that a consumer can retain—for example, on the first page, or inside the front cover.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Multiple payments/multiple consumers.</E> If a merchant or other payee will use information from a consumer's check to initiate an EFT from the consumer's account, notice to a consumer listed on the billing account that a check provided as payment during a single billing cycle or after receiving an invoice or statement will be processed as a one-time EFT or as a check transaction constitutes notice for all checks provided in payment for the billing cycle or the invoice for which notice has been provided, whether the check(s) is submitted by the consumer or someone else. The notice applies to all checks provided in payment for the billing cycle or invoice until the provision of notice on or with the next invoice or statement. Thus, if a merchant or other payee receives a check as payment for the consumer listed on the billing account after providing notice that the check will be processed as a one-time EFT, the authorization from that consumer constitutes authorization to convert any other checks provided for that invoice or statement. Other notices required under this paragraph (b)(2) (for example, to collect a service fee for insufficient or uncollected funds via an EFT) provided to the consumer listed on the billing account also constitutes notice to any other consumer who may provide a check for the billing cycle or invoice.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Additional disclosures about ECK transactions at POS.</E> When a payee initiates an EFT at POS using information from the consumer's check, and returns the check to the consumer at POS, the payee need not provide a notice to the consumer that the check will not be returned by the consumer's financial institution.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">3(b)(3) Collection of Returned Item Fees via Electronic Fund Transfer</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Fees imposed by account-holding institution.</E> The requirement to obtain a consumer's authorization to collect a fee via EFT for the return of an EFT or check unpaid applies only to the person that intends to initiate an EFT to collect the returned item fee from the consumer's account. The authorization requirement does not apply to any fees assessed by the consumer's account-holding financial institution when it returns the unpaid underlying EFT or check or pays the amount of an overdraft.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Accounts receivable transactions.</E> In an ARC transaction where a consumer sends in a payment for amounts owed (or makes an in-person payment at a biller's physical location, such as when a consumer makes a loan payment at a bank branch or places a payment in a drop box), a person seeking to electronically collect a fee for items returned unpaid must obtain the consumer's authorization to collect the fee in this manner. A consumer authorizes a person to electronically collect a returned item fee when the consumer receives notice, typically on an invoice or statement, that the person may collect the fee through an EFT to the consumer's account, and the consumer goes forward with the underlying transaction by providing payment. The notice must also state the dollar amount of the fee. However, an explanation of how that fee will be determined may be provided in place of the dollar amount of the fee if the fee may vary due to the amount of the transaction or due to other factors, such as the number of days the underlying transaction is left outstanding. For example, if a state law permits a maximum fee of $30 or 10% of the underlying transaction, whichever is greater, the person collecting the fee may explain how the fee is determined, rather than state a specific dollar amount for the fee.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Disclosure of dollar amount of fee for POS transactions.</E> The notice provided to the consumer in connection with a POS transaction under § 1005.3(b)(3)(ii) must state the amount of the fee for a returned item if the dollar amount of the fee can be calculated at the time the notice is provided or mailed. For example, if notice is provided to the consumer at the time of the transaction, if the applicable state law sets a maximum fee that may be collected for a returned item based on the amount of the underlying transaction (such as where the amount of the fee is expressed as a percentage of the underlying transaction), the person collecting the fee must state the actual dollar amount of the fee on the notice provided to the consumer. Alternatively, if the amount of the fee to be collected cannot be calculated at the time of the transaction (for example, where the amount of the fee will depend on the number of days a debt continues to be owed), the person collecting the fee may provide a description of how the fee will be determined on both the posted notice as well as on the notice provided at the time of the transaction. However, if the person collecting the fee elects to send the consumer notice after the person has initiated an EFT to collect the fee, that notice must state the amount of the fee to be collected.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Third party providing notice.</E> The person initiating an EFT to a consumer's account to electronically collect a fee for an item returned unpaid may obtain the authorization and provide the notices required under § 1005.3(b)(3) through third parties, such as merchants.<PRTPAGE P="233"/>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">3(c)(1) Checks</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Re-presented checks.</E> The electronic re-presentment of a returned check is not covered by Regulation E because the transaction originated by check. Regulation E does apply, however, to any fee debited via an EFT from a consumer's account by the payee because the check was returned for insufficient or uncollected funds. The person debiting the fee electronically must obtain the consumer's authorization.</P>

            <P>1. <E T="03">Memo posting.</E> Under a check guarantee or check authorization service, debiting of the consumer's account occurs when the check or draft is presented for payment. These services are exempt from coverage, even when a temporary hold on the account is memo-posted electronically at the time of authorization.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">3(c)(3) Wire or Other Similar Transfers</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Fedwire and ACH.</E> If a financial institution makes a fund transfer to a consumer's account after receiving funds through Fedwire or a similar network, the transfer by ACH is covered by the regulation even though the Fedwire or network transfer is exempt.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Article 4A.</E> Financial institutions that offer telephone-initiated Fedwire payments are subject to the requirements of UCC section 4A-202, which encourages verification of Fedwire payment orders pursuant to a security procedure established by agreement between the consumer and the receiving bank. These transfers are not subject to Regulation E and the agreement is not considered a telephone plan if the service is offered separately from a telephone bill-payment or other prearranged plan subject to Regulation E. Regulation J of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (12 CFR part 210) specifies the rules applicable to funds handled by Federal Reserve Banks. To ensure that the rules for all fund transfers through Fedwire are consistent, the Board of Governors used its preemptive authority under UCC section 4A-107 to determine that subpart B of the Board's Regulation J, including the provisions of Article 4A, applies to all fund transfers through Fedwire, even if a portion of the fund transfer is governed by the EFTA. The portion of the fund transfer that is governed by the EFTA is not governed by subpart B of the Board's Regulation J.</P>

            <P>1. <E T="03">Coverage.</E> The securities exemption applies to securities and commodities that may be sold by a registered broker-dealer or futures commission merchant, even when the security or commodity itself is not regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Example of exempt transfer.</E> The exemption applies to a transfer involving a transfer initiated by a telephone order to a stockbroker to buy or sell securities or to exercise a margin call.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Examples of nonexempt transfers.</E> The exemption does not apply to a transfer involving:</P>
            <P>i. A debit card or other access device that accesses a securities or commodities account such as a money market mutual fund and that the consumer uses for purchasing goods or services or for obtaining cash.</P>

            <P>2. <E T="03">Automatic transfers not exempted.</E> Transfers between accounts of the consumer at affiliated institutions (such as between a bank and its subsidiary or within a holding company) are not intra-institutional transfers, and thus do not qualify for the exemption.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">3(c)(6) Telephone-Initiated Transfers</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Written plan or agreement.</E> A transfer that the consumer initiates by telephone is covered by Regulation E if the transfer is made <PRTPAGE P="234"/>under a written plan or agreement between the consumer and the financial institution making the transfer. A written statement available to the public or to account holders that describes a service allowing a consumer to initiate transfers by telephone constitutes a plan; for example, a brochure, or material included with periodic statements. The following, however, do not by themselves constitute a written plan or agreement:</P>
            <P>i. A hold-harmless agreement on a signature card that protects the institution if the consumer requests a transfer.</P>
            <P>ii. A legend on a signature card, periodic statement, or passbook that limits the number of telephone-initiated transfers the consumer can make from a savings account because of reserve requirements under Regulation D of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (12 CFR part 204).</P>
            <P>iii. An agreement permitting the consumer to approve by telephone the rollover of funds at the maturity of an instrument.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Examples of covered transfers.</E> When a written plan or agreement has been entered into, a transfer initiated by a telephone call from a consumer is covered even though:</P>
            <P>i. An employee of the financial institution completes the transfer manually (for example, by means of a debit memo or deposit slip).</P>
            <P>ii. The consumer is required to make a separate request for each transfer.</P>
            <P>iii. The consumer uses the plan infrequently.</P>

            <P>1. <E T="03">Coverage.</E> The provisions of this section limit the circumstances under which a financial institution may issue an access device to a consumer. Making an additional account accessible through an existing access device is equivalent to issuing an access device and is subject to the limitations of this section.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">5(a) Solicited Issuance</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Paragraph 5(a)(1)</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Joint account.</E> For a joint account, a financial institution may issue an access device to each account holder if the requesting holder specifically authorizes the issuance.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Permissible forms of request.</E> The request for an access device may be written or oral (for example, in response to a telephone solicitation by a card issuer).</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Paragraph 5(a)(2)</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">One-for-one rule.</E> In issuing a renewal or substitute access device, only one renewal or substitute device may replace a previously issued device. For example, only one new card and PIN may replace a card and PIN previously issued. A financial institution may provide additional devices at the time it issues the renewal or substitute access device, however, provided the institution complies with § 1005.5(b). <E T="03">See</E> comment 5(b)-5. If the replacement device or the additional device permits either fewer or additional types of electronic fund transfer services, a change-in-terms notice or new disclosures are required.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Renewal or substitution by a successor institution.</E> A successor institution is an entity that replaces the original financial institution (for example, following a corporate merger or acquisition) or that acquires accounts or assumes the operation of an EFT system.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">5(b) Unsolicited Issuance</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Compliance.</E> A financial institution may issue an unsolicited access device (such as the combination of a debit card and PIN) if the institution's ATM system has been programmed not to accept the access device until after the consumer requests and the institution validates the device. Merely instructing a consumer not to use an unsolicited debit card and PIN until after the institution verifies the consumer's identity does not comply with the regulation.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">PINs.</E> A financial institution may impose no liability on a consumer for unauthorized transfers involving an unsolicited access device until the device becomes an “accepted access device” under the regulation. A card and PIN combination may be treated as an accepted access device once the consumer has used it to make a transfer.<PRTPAGE P="235"/>
            </P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Functions of PIN.</E> If an institution issues a PIN at the consumer's request, the issuance may constitute both a way of validating the debit card and the means to identify the consumer (required as a condition of imposing liability for unauthorized transfers).</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Verification of identity.</E> To verify the consumer's identity, a financial institution may use any reasonable means, such as a photograph, fingerprint, personal visit, signature comparison, or personal information about the consumer. However, even if reasonable means were used, if an institution fails to verify correctly the consumer's identity and an imposter succeeds in having the device validated, the consumer is not liable for any unauthorized transfers from the account.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Additional access devices in a renewal or substitution.</E> A financial institution may issue more than one access device in connection with the renewal or substitution of a previously issued accepted access device, provided that any additional access device (beyond the device replacing the accepted access device) is not validated at the time it is issued, and the institution complies with the other requirements of § 1005.5(b). The institution may, if it chooses, set up the validation procedure such that both the device replacing the previously issued device and the additional device are not validated at the time they are issued, and validation will apply to both devices. If the institution sets up the validation procedure in this way, the institution should provide a clear and readily understandable disclosure to the consumer that both devices are unvalidated and that validation will apply to both devices.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Section 1005.6 Liability of Consumer for Unauthorized Transfers</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">6(a) Conditions for Liability</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Means of identification.</E> A financial institution may use various means for identifying the consumer to whom the access device is issued, including but not limited to:</P>
            <P>i. Electronic or mechanical confirmation (such as a PIN).</P>
            <P>ii. Comparison of the consumer's signature, fingerprint, or photograph.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Multiple users.</E> When more than one access device is issued for an account, the financial institution may, but need not, provide a separate means to identify each user of the account.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">6(b) Limitations on Amount of Liability</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Application of liability provisions.</E> There are three possible tiers of consumer liability for unauthorized EFTs depending on the situation. A consumer may be liable for: (1) up to $50; (2) up to $500; or (3) an unlimited amount depending on when the unauthorized EFT occurs. More than one tier may apply to a given situation because each corresponds to a different (sometimes overlapping) time period or set of conditions.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Consumer negligence.</E> Negligence by the consumer cannot be used as the basis for imposing greater liability than is permissible under Regulation E. Thus, consumer behavior that may constitute negligence under state law, such as writing the PIN on a debit card or on a piece of paper kept with the card, does not affect the consumer's liability for unauthorized transfers. (However, refer to comment 2(m)-2 regarding termination of the authority of given by the consumer to another person.)</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Limits on liability.</E> The extent of the consumer's liability is determined solely by the consumer's promptness in reporting the loss or theft of an access device. Similarly, no agreement between the consumer and an institution may impose greater liability on the consumer for an unauthorized transfer than the limits provided in Regulation E.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">6(b)(1) Timely Notice Given</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">$50 limit applies.</E> The basic liability limit is $50. For example, the consumer's card is lost or stolen on Monday and the consumer learns of the loss or theft on Wednesday. If the consumer notifies the financial institution within two business days of learning of the loss or theft (by midnight Friday), the consumer's liability is limited to $50 or the amount of the unauthorized transfers that occurred before notification, whichever is less.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Knowledge of loss or theft of access device.</E> The fact that a consumer has received a periodic statement that reflects unauthorized transfers may be a factor in determining whether the consumer had knowledge of the loss or theft, but cannot be deemed to represent conclusive evidence that the consumer had such knowledge.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Two business day rule.</E> The two business day period does not include the day the consumer learns of the loss or theft or any day that is not a business day. The rule is calculated based on two 24-hour periods, without regard to the financial institution's business hours or the time of day that the consumer learns of the loss or theft. For example, a consumer learns of the loss or theft at 6 p.m. on Friday. Assuming that Saturday is a business day and Sunday is not, the two business day period begins on Saturday and expires at 11:59 p.m. on Monday, not at the end of the financial institution's business day on Monday.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">6(b)(2) Timely Notice Not Given</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">$500 limit applies.</E> The second tier of liability is $500. For example, the consumer's card is stolen on Monday and the consumer learns of the theft that same day. The consumer reports the theft on Friday. The $500 limit applies because the consumer failed to <PRTPAGE P="236"/>notify the financial institution within two business days of learning of the theft (which would have been by midnight Wednesday). How much the consumer is actually liable for, however, depends on when the unauthorized transfers take place. In this example, assume a $100 unauthorized transfer was made on Tuesday and a $600 unauthorized transfer on Thursday. Because the consumer is liable for the amount of the loss that occurs within the first two business days (but no more than $50), plus the amount of the unauthorized transfers that occurs after the first two business days and before the consumer gives notice, the consumer's total liability is $500 ($50 of the $100 transfer plus $450 of the $600 transfer, in this example). But if $600 was taken on Tuesday and $100 on Thursday, the consumer's maximum liability would be $150 ($50 of the $600 plus $100).</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">6(b)(3) Periodic Statement; Timely Notice Not Given</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Unlimited liability applies.</E> The standard of unlimited liability applies if unauthorized transfers appear on a periodic statement, and may apply in conjunction with the first two tiers of liability. If a periodic statement shows an unauthorized transfer made with a lost or stolen debit card, the consumer must notify the financial institution within 60 calendar days after the periodic statement was sent; otherwise, the consumer faces unlimited liability for all unauthorized transfers made after the 60-day period. The consumer's liability for unauthorized transfers before the statement is sent, and up to 60 days following, is determined based on the first two tiers of liability: up to $50 if the consumer notifies the financial institution within two business days of learning of the loss or theft of the card and up to $500 if the consumer notifies the institution after two business days of learning of the loss or theft.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Transfers not involving access device.</E> The first two tiers of liability do not apply to unauthorized transfers from a consumer's account made without an access device. If, however, the consumer fails to report such unauthorized transfers within 60 calendar days of the financial institution's transmittal of the periodic statement, the consumer may be liable for any transfers occurring after the close of the 60 days and before notice is given to the institution. For example, a consumer's account is electronically debited for $200 without the consumer's authorization and by means other than the consumer's access device. If the consumer notifies the institution within 60 days of the transmittal of the periodic statement that shows the unauthorized transfer, the consumer has no liability. However, if in addition to the $200, the consumer's account is debited for a $400 unauthorized transfer on the 61st day and the consumer fails to notify the institution of the first unauthorized transfer until the 62nd day, the consumer may be liable for the full $400.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">6(b)(4) Extension of Time Limits</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Extenuating circumstances.</E> Examples of circumstances that require extension of the notification periods under this section include the consumer's extended travel or hospitalization.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">6(b)(5) Notice to Financial Institution</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Receipt of notice.</E> A financial institution is considered to have received notice for purposes of limiting the consumer's liability if notice is given in a reasonable manner, even if the consumer notifies the institution but uses an address or telephone number other than the one specified by the institution.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Notice by third party.</E> Notice to a financial institution by a person acting on the consumer's behalf is considered valid under this section. For example, if a consumer is hospitalized and unable to report the loss or theft of an access device, notice is considered given when someone acting on the consumer's behalf notifies the bank of the loss or theft. A financial institution may require appropriate documentation from the person representing the consumer to establish that the person is acting on the consumer's behalf.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Content of notice.</E> Notice to a financial institution is considered given when a consumer takes reasonable steps to provide the institution with the pertinent account information. Even when the consumer is unable to provide the account number or the card number in reporting a lost or stolen access device or an unauthorized transfer, the notice effectively limits the consumer's liability if the consumer otherwise identifies sufficiently the account in question. For example, the consumer may identify the account by the name on the account and the type of account in question.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Section 1005.7 Initial Disclosures</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">7(a) Timing of Disclosures</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Early disclosures.</E> Disclosures given by a financial institution earlier than the regulation requires (for example, when the consumer opens a checking account) need not be repeated when the consumer later enters into an agreement with a third party to initiate preauthorized transfers to or from the consumer's account, unless the terms and conditions differ from those that the institution previously disclosed. This interpretation also applies to any notice provided about one-time EFTs from a consumer's account initiated using information from the consumer's check. On the other hand, if an agreement for EFT services to be provided by an account-holding institution is directly <PRTPAGE P="237"/>between the consumer and the account-holding institution, disclosures must be given in close proximity to the event requiring disclosure, for example, when the consumer contracts for a new service.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Lack of advance notice of a transfer.</E> Where a consumer authorizes a third party to debit or credit the consumer's account, an account-holding institution that has not received advance notice of the transfer or transfers must provide the required disclosures as soon as reasonably possible after the first debit or credit is made, unless the institution has previously given the disclosures.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Addition of new accounts.</E> If a consumer opens a new account permitting EFTs at a financial institution, and the consumer already has received Regulation E disclosures for another account at that institution, the institution need only disclose terms and conditions that differ from those previously given.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Addition of service in interchange systems.</E> If a financial institution joins an interchange or shared network system (which provides access to terminals operated by other institutions), disclosures are required for additional EFT services not previously available to consumers if the terms and conditions differ from those previously disclosed.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Disclosures covering all EFT services offered.</E> An institution may provide disclosures covering all EFT services that it offers, even if some consumers have not arranged to use all services.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">7(b) Content of Disclosures</HD>

            <P>1. <E T="03">No liability imposed by financial institution.</E> If a financial institution chooses to impose zero liability for unauthorized EFTs, it need not provide the liability disclosures. If the institution later decides to impose liability, however, it must first provide the disclosures.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Preauthorized transfers.</E> If the only EFTs from an account are preauthorized transfers, liability could arise if the consumer fails to report unauthorized transfers reflected on a periodic statement. To impose such liability on the consumer, the institution must have disclosed the potential liability and the telephone number and address for reporting unauthorized transfers.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Additional information.</E> At the institution's option, the summary of the consumer's liability may include advice on promptly reporting unauthorized transfers or the loss or theft of the access device.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">7(b)(2) Telephone Number and Address</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Disclosure of telephone numbers.</E> An institution may use the same or different telephone numbers in the disclosures for the purpose of:</P>
            <P>i. Reporting the loss or theft of an access device or possible unauthorized transfers;</P>
            <P>ii. Inquiring about the receipt of a preauthorized credit;</P>
            <P>iii. Stopping payment of a preauthorized debit;</P>
            <P>iv. Giving notice of an error.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Location of telephone number.</E> The telephone number need not be incorporated into the text of the disclosure; for example, the institution may instead insert a reference to a telephone number that is readily available to the consumer, such as “Call your branch office. The number is shown on your periodic statement.” However, an institution must provide a specific telephone number and address, on or with the disclosure statement, for reporting a lost or stolen access device or a possible unauthorized transfer.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">7(b)(4) Types of Transfers; Limitations</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Security limitations.</E> Information about limitations on the frequency and dollar amount of transfers generally must be disclosed in detail, even if related to security aspects of the system. If the confidentiality of certain details is essential to the security of an account or system, these details may be withheld (but the fact that limitations exist must still be disclosed). For example, an institution limits cash ATM withdrawals to $100 per day. The institution may disclose that daily withdrawal limitations apply and need not disclose that the limitations may not always be in force (such as during periods when its ATMs are off-line).</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Restrictions on certain deposit accounts.</E> A limitation on account activity that restricts the consumer's ability to make EFTs must be disclosed even if the restriction also applies to transfers made by non-electronic means. For example, Regulation D of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (12 CFR part 204) restricts the number of payments to third parties that may be made from a money market deposit account; an institution that does not execute fund transfers in excess of those limits must disclose the restriction as a limitation on the frequency of EFTs.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Preauthorized transfers.</E> Financial institutions are not required to list preauthorized transfers among the types of transfers that a consumer can make.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">One-time EFTs initiated using information from a check.</E> Financial institutions must disclose the fact that one-time EFTs initiated using information from a consumer's check are among the types of transfers that a consumer can make. <E T="03">See</E> appendix A-2.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">7(b)(5) Fees</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Disclosure of EFT fees.</E> An institution is required to disclose all fees for EFTs or the right to make them. Others fees (for example, minimum-balance fees, stop-payment <PRTPAGE P="238"/>fees, or account overdrafts) may, but need not, be disclosed. <E T="03">But see</E> Regulation DD, 12 CFR part 1030. An institution is not required to disclose fees for inquiries made at an ATM since no transfer of funds is involved.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Fees also applicable to non-EFT.</E> A per-item fee for EFTs must be disclosed even if the same fee is imposed on non-electronic transfers. If a per-item fee is imposed only under certain conditions, such as when the transactions in the cycle exceed a certain number, those conditions must be disclosed. Itemization of the various fees may be provided on the disclosure statement or on an accompanying document that is referenced in the statement.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Interchange system fees.</E> Fees paid by the account-holding institution to the operator of a shared or interchange ATM system need not be disclosed, unless they are imposed on the consumer by the account-holding institution. Fees for use of an ATM that are debited directly from the consumer's account by an institution other than the account-holding institution (for example, fees included in the transfer amount) need not be disclosed. <E T="03">See</E> § 1005.7(b)(11) for the general notice requirement regarding fees that may be imposed by ATM operators and by a network used to complete the transfer.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">7(b)(9) Confidentiality</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Information provided to third parties.</E> An institution must describe the circumstances under which any information relating to an account to or from which EFTs are permitted will be made available to third parties, not just information concerning those EFTs. The term “third parties” includes affiliates such as other subsidiaries of the same holding company.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">7(b)(10) Error Resolution</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Substantially similar.</E> The error resolution notice must be substantially similar to the model form in appendix A of part 1005. An institution may use different wording so long as the substance of the notice remains the same, may delete inapplicable provisions (for example, the requirement for written confirmation of an oral notification), and may substitute substantive state law requirements affording greater consumer protection than Regulation E.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Extended time-period for certain transactions.</E> To take advantage of the longer time periods for resolving errors under § 1005.11(c)(3) (for new accounts as defined in Regulation CC of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (12 CFR part 229), transfers initiated outside the United States, or transfers resulting from POS debit-card transactions), a financial institution must have disclosed these longer time periods. Similarly, an institution that relies on the exception from provisional crediting in § 1005.11(c)(2) for accounts subject to Regulation T of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (12 CFR part 220) must have disclosed accordingly.</P>

            <P>2. <E T="03">Changes not requiring notice.</E> The following changes do not require disclosure:</P>
            <P>i. Closing some of an institution's ATMs;</P>
            <P>ii. Cancellation of an access device.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Limitations on transfers.</E> When the initial disclosures omit details about limitations because secrecy is essential to the security of the account or system, a subsequent increase in those limitations need not be disclosed if secrecy is still essential. If, however, an institution had no limits in place when the initial disclosures were given and now wishes to impose limits for the first time, it must disclose at least the fact that limits have been adopted. <E T="03">See also</E> § 1005.7(b)(4) and the related commentary.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Change in telephone number or address.</E> When a financial institution changes the telephone number or address used for reporting possible unauthorized transfers, a change-in-terms notice is required only if the institution will impose liability on the consumer for unauthorized transfers under § 1005.6. <E T="03">See also</E> § 1005.6(a) and the related commentary.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">8(b) Error Resolution Notice</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Change between annual and periodic notice.</E> If an institution switches from an annual to a periodic notice, or vice versa, the first notice under the new method must be sent no later than 12 months after the last notice sent under the old method.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Exception for new accounts.</E> For new accounts, disclosure of the longer error resolution time periods under § 1005.11(c)(3) is not required in the annual error resolution notice or in the notice that may be provided with each periodic statement as an alternative to the annual notice.<PRTPAGE P="239"/>

            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Section 1005.9 Receipts at Electronic Terminals; Periodic Statements</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">9(a) Receipts at Electronic Terminals</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Receipts furnished only on request.</E> The regulation requires that a receipt be “made available.” A financial institution may program its electronic terminals to provide a receipt only to consumers who elect to receive one.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Third party providing receipt.</E> An account-holding institution may make terminal receipts available through third parties such as merchants or other financial institutions.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Inclusion of promotional material.</E> A financial institution may include promotional material on receipts if the required information is set forth clearly (for example, by separating it from the promotional material). In addition, a consumer may not be required to surrender the receipt or that portion containing the required disclosures in order to take advantage of a promotion.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Transfer not completed.</E> The receipt requirement does not apply to a transfer that is initiated but not completed (for example, if the ATM is out of currency or the consumer decides not to complete the transfer).</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Receipts not furnished due to inadvertent error.</E> If a receipt is not provided to the consumer because of a bona fide unintentional error, such as when a terminal runs out of paper or the mechanism jams, no violation results if the financial institution maintains procedures reasonably adapted to avoid such occurrences.</P>
            <P>6. <E T="03">Multiple transfers.</E> If the consumer makes multiple transfers at the same time, the financial institution may document them on a single or on separate receipts.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">9(a)(1) Amount</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Disclosure of transaction fee.</E> The required display of a fee amount on or at the terminal may be accomplished by displaying the fee on a sign at the terminal or on the terminal screen for a reasonable duration. Displaying the fee on a screen provides adequate notice, as long as a consumer is given the option to cancel the transaction after receiving notice of a fee. <E T="03">See</E> § 1005.16 for the notice requirements applicable to ATM operators that impose a fee for providing EFT services.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Relationship between § 1005.9(a)(1) and § 1005.16.</E> The requirements of §§ 1005.9(a)(1) and 1005.16 are similar but not identical.</P>
            <P>i. Section 1005.9(a)(1) requires that if the amount of the transfer as shown on the receipt will include the fee, then the fee must be disclosed either on a sign on or at the terminal, or on the terminal screen. Section 1005.16 requires disclosure both on a sign on or at the terminal (in a prominent and conspicuous location) and on the terminal screen. Section 1005.16 permits disclosure on a paper notice as an alternative to the on-screen disclosure.</P>
            <P>ii. The disclosure of the fee on the receipt under § 1005.9(a)(1) cannot be used to comply with the alternative paper disclosure procedure under § 1005.16, if the receipt is provided at the completion of the transaction because, pursuant to the statute, the paper notice must be provided before the consumer is committed to paying the fee.</P>
            <P>iii. Section 1005.9(a)(1) applies to any type of electronic terminal as defined in Regulation E (for example, to POS terminals as well as to ATMs), while § 1005.16 applies only to ATMs.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">9(a)(2) Date</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Calendar date.</E> The receipt must disclose the calendar date on which the consumer uses the electronic terminal. An accounting or business date may be disclosed in addition if the dates are clearly distinguished.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">9(a)(3) Type</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Identifying transfer and account.</E> Examples identifying the type of transfer and the type of the consumer's account include “withdrawal from checking,” “transfer from savings to checking,” or “payment from savings.”</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Exception.</E> Identification of an account is not required when the consumer can access only one asset account at a particular time or terminal, even if the access device can normally be used to access more than one account. For example, the consumer may be able to access only one particular account at terminals not operated by the account-holding institution, or may be able to access only one particular account when the terminal is off-line. The exception is available even if, in addition to accessing one asset account, the consumer also can access a credit line.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Access to multiple accounts.</E> If the consumer can use an access device to make transfers to or from different accounts of the same type, the terminal receipt must specify which account was accessed, such as “withdrawal from checking I” or “withdrawal from checking II.” If only one account besides the primary checking account can be debited, the receipt can identify the account as “withdrawal from other account.”</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Generic descriptions.</E> Generic descriptions may be used for accounts that are similar in function, such as share draft or NOW accounts and checking accounts. In a shared system, for example, when a credit union member initiates transfers to or from a share draft account at a terminal owned or operated by a bank, the receipt may identify a withdrawal from the account as a “withdrawal from checking.”</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Point-of-sale transactions.</E> There is no prescribed terminology for identifying a transfer at a merchant's POS terminal. A transfer <PRTPAGE P="240"/>may be identified, for example, as a purchase, a sale of goods or services, or a payment to a third party. When a consumer obtains cash from a POS terminal in addition to purchasing goods, or obtains cash only, the documentation need not differentiate the transaction from one involving the purchase of goods.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">9(a)(5) Terminal Location</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Options for identifying terminal.</E> The institution may provide either:</P>
            <P>i. The city, state or foreign country, and the information in § 1005.9(a)(5) (i), (ii), or (iii), or</P>
            <P>ii. A number or a code identifying the terminal. If the institution chooses the second option, the code or terminal number identifying the terminal where the transfer is initiated may be given as part of a transaction code.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Omission of city name.</E> The city may be omitted if the generally accepted name (such as a branch name) contains the city name.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Omission of a state.</E> A state may be omitted from the location information on the receipt if:</P>
            <P>i. All the terminals owned or operated by the financial institution providing the statement (or by the system in which it participates) are located in that state, or</P>
            <P>ii. All transfers occur at terminals located within 50 miles of the financial institution's main office.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Omission of a city and state.</E> A city and state may be omitted if all the terminals owned or operated by the financial institution providing the statement (or by the system in which it participates) are located in the same city.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Paragraph 9(a)(5)(i)</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Street address.</E> The address should include number and street (or intersection); the number (or intersecting street) may be omitted if the street alone uniquely identifies the terminal location.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Paragraph 9(a)(5)(ii)</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Generally accepted name.</E> Examples of a generally accepted name for a specific location include a branch of the financial institution, a shopping center, or an airport.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Paragraph 9(a)(5)(iii)</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Name of owner or operator of terminal.</E> Examples of an owner or operator of a terminal are a financial institution or a retail merchant.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">9(a)(6) Third Party Transfer</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Omission of third-party name.</E> The receipt need not disclose the third-party name if the name is provided by the consumer in a form that is not machine readable (for example, if the consumer indicates the payee by depositing a payment stub into the ATM). If, on the other hand, the consumer keys in the identity of the payee, the receipt must identify the payee by name or by using a code that is explained elsewhere on the receipt.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Receipt as proof of payment.</E> Documentation required under the regulation constitutes prima facie proof of a payment to another person, except in the case of a terminal receipt documenting a deposit.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">9(b) Periodic Statements</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Periodic cycles.</E> Periodic statements may be sent on a cycle that is shorter than monthly. The statements must correspond to periodic cycles that are reasonably equal, that is, do not vary by more than four days from the regular cycle. The requirement of reasonably equal cycles does not apply when an institution changes cycles for operational or other reasons, such as to establish a new statement day or date.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Interim statements.</E> Generally, a financial institution must provide periodic statements for each monthly cycle in which an EFT occurs, and at least quarterly if a transfer has not occurred. Where EFTs occur between regularly-scheduled cycles, interim statements must be provided. For example, if an institution issues quarterly statements at the end of March, June, September and December, and the consumer initiates an EFT in February, an interim statement for February must be provided. If an interim statement contains interest or rate information, the institution must comply with Regulation DD, 12 CFR 1030.6.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Inactive accounts.</E> A financial institution need not send statements to consumers whose accounts are inactive as defined by the institution.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Statement pickup.</E> A financial institution may permit, but may not require, consumers to pick up their periodic statements at the financial institution.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Periodic statements limited to EFT activity.</E> A financial institution that uses a passbook as the primary means for displaying account activity, but also allows the account to be debited electronically, may provide a periodic statement requirement that reflects only the EFTs and other required disclosures (such as charges, account balances, and address and telephone number for inquiries). <E T="03">See</E> § 1005.9(c)(1)(i) for the exception applicable to preauthorized transfers for passbook accounts.</P>
            <P>6. <E T="03">Codes and accompanying documents.</E> To meet the documentation requirements for periodic statements, a financial institution may:</P>
            <P>i. Include copies of terminal receipts to reflect transfers initiated by the consumer at electronic terminals;</P>

            <P>ii. Enclose posting memos, deposit slips, and other documents that, together with the <PRTPAGE P="241"/>statement, disclose all the required information;</P>
            <P>iii. Use codes for names of third parties or terminal locations and explain the information to which the codes relate on an accompanying document.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">9(b)(1) Transaction Information</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Information obtained from others.</E> While financial institutions must maintain reasonable procedures to ensure the integrity of data obtained from another institution, a merchant, or other third parties, verification of each transfer that appears on the periodic statement is not required.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Paragraph 9(b)(1)(i)</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Incorrect deposit amount.</E> If a financial institution determines that the amount actually deposited at an ATM is different from the amount entered by the consumer, the institution need not immediately notify the consumer of the discrepancy. The periodic statement reflecting the deposit may show either the correct amount of the deposit or the amount entered by the consumer along with the institution's adjustment.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Paragraph 9(b)(1)(iii)</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Type of transfer.</E> There is no prescribed terminology for describing a type of transfer. Placement of the amount of the transfer in the debit or the credit column is sufficient if other information on the statement, such as a terminal location or third-party name, enables the consumer to identify the type of transfer.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Paragraph 9(b)(1)(iv)</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Nonproprietary terminal in network.</E> An institution need not reflect on the periodic statement the street addresses, identification codes, or terminal numbers for transfers initiated in a shared or interchange system at a terminal operated by an institution other than the account-holding institution. The statement must, however, specify the entity that owns or operates the terminal, plus the city and state.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Paragraph 9(b)(1)(v)</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Recurring payments by government agency.</E> The third-party name for recurring payments from Federal, state, or local governments need not list the particular agency. For example, “U.S. gov't” or “N.Y. sal” will suffice.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Consumer as third-party payee.</E> If a consumer makes an electronic fund transfer to another consumer, the financial institution must identify the recipient by name (not just by an account number, for example).</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Terminal location/third party.</E> A single entry may be used to identify both the terminal location and the name of the third party to or from whom funds are transferred. For example, if a consumer purchases goods from a merchant, the name of the party to whom funds are transferred (the merchant) and the location of the terminal where the transfer is initiated will be satisfied by a disclosure such as “XYZ Store, Anytown, Ohio.”</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Account-holding institution as third party.</E> Transfers to the account-holding institution (by ATM, for example) must show the institution as the recipient, unless other information on the statement (such as, “loan payment from checking”) clearly indicates that the payment was to the account-holding institution.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Consistency in third-party identity.</E> The periodic statement must disclose a third-party name as it appeared on the receipt, whether it was, for example, the “dba” (doing business as) name of the third party or the parent corporation's name.</P>
            <P>6. <E T="03">Third-party identity on deposits at electronic terminal.</E> A financial institution need not identify third parties whose names appear on checks, drafts, or similar paper instruments deposited to the consumer's account at an electronic terminal.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">9(b)(3) Fees</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Disclosure of fees.</E> The fees disclosed may include fees for EFTs and for other non-electronic services, and both fixed fees and per-item fees; they may be given as a total or may be itemized in part or in full.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Fees in interchange system.</E> An account-holding institution must disclose any fees it imposes on the consumer for EFTs, including fees for ATM transactions in an interchange or shared ATM system. Fees for use of an ATM imposed on the consumer by an institution other than the account-holding institution and included in the amount of the transfer by the terminal-operating institution need not be separately disclosed on the periodic statement.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Finance charges.</E> The requirement to disclose any fees assessed against the account does not include a finance charge imposed on the account during the statement period.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">9(b)(4) Account Balances</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Opening and closing balances.</E> The opening and closing balances must reflect both EFTs and other account activity.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">9(b)(5) Address and Telephone Number for Inquiries</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Telephone number.</E> A single telephone number, preceded by the “direct inquiries to” language, will satisfy the requirements of §§ 1005.9(b)(5) and (6).</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">9(b)(6) Telephone Number for Preauthorized Transfers</HD>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">9(c) Exceptions to the Periodic Statement Requirements for Certain Accounts</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Transfers between accounts.</E> The regulation provides an exception from the periodic statement requirement for certain intra-institutional transfers between a consumer's accounts. The financial institution must still comply with the applicable periodic statement requirements for any other EFTs to or from the account. For example, a Regulation E statement must be provided quarterly for an account that also receives payroll deposits electronically, or for any month in which an account is also accessed by a withdrawal at an ATM.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">9(c)(1) Preauthorized Transfers to Accounts</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Accounts that may be accessed only by preauthorized transfers to the account.</E> The exception for “accounts that may be accessed only by preauthorized transfers to the account” includes accounts that can be accessed by means other than EFTs, such as checks. If, however, an account may be accessed by any EFT other than preauthorized credits to the account, such as preauthorized debits or ATM transactions, the account does not qualify for the exception.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Reversal of direct deposits.</E> For direct-deposit-only accounts, a financial institution must send a periodic statement at least quarterly. A reversal of a direct deposit to correct an error does not trigger the monthly statement requirement when the error represented a credit to the wrong consumer's account, a duplicate credit, or a credit in the wrong amount. <E T="03">See also</E> comment 2(m)-5.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">9(d) Documentation for Foreign-Initiated Transfers</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Foreign-initiated transfers.</E> An institution must make a good faith effort to provide all required information for foreign-initiated transfers. For example, even if the institution is not able to provide a specific terminal location, it should identify the country and city in which the transfer was initiated.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Section 1005.10 Preauthorized Transfers</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">10(a) Preauthorized Transfers to Consumer's Account</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">10(a)(1) Notice by Financial Institution</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Content.</E> No specific language is required for notice regarding receipt of a preauthorized transfer. Identifying the deposit is sufficient; however, simply providing the current account balance is not.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Notice of credit.</E> A financial institution may use different methods of notice for various types or series of preauthorized transfers, and the institution need not offer consumers a choice of notice methods.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Positive notice.</E> A periodic statement sent within two business days of the scheduled transfer, showing the transfer, can serve as notice of receipt.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Negative notice.</E> The absence of a deposit entry (on a periodic statement sent within two business days of the scheduled transfer date) will serve as negative notice.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Telephone notice.</E> If a financial institution uses the telephone notice option, the institution should be able in most instances to verify during a consumer's initial call whether a transfer was received. The institution must respond within two business days to any inquiry not answered immediately.</P>
            <P>6. <E T="03">Phone number for passbook accounts.</E> The financial institution may use any reasonable means necessary to provide the telephone number to consumers with passbook accounts that can only be accessed by preauthorized credits and that do not receive periodic statements. For example, it may print the telephone number in the passbook, or include the number with the annual error resolution notice.</P>
            <P>7. <E T="03">Telephone line availability.</E> To satisfy the readily-available standard, the financial institution must provide enough telephone lines so that consumers get a reasonably prompt response. The institution need only provide telephone service during normal business hours. Within its primary service area, an institution must provide a local or toll-free telephone number. It need not provide a toll-free number or accept collect long-distance calls from outside the area where it normally conducts business.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">10(b) Written Authorization for Preauthorized Transfers From Consumer's Account</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Preexisting authorizations.</E> The financial institution need not require a new authorization before changing from paper-based to electronic debiting when the existing authorization does not specify that debiting is to occur electronically or specifies that the debiting will occur by paper means. A new authorization also is not required when a successor institution begins collecting payments.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Authorization obtained by third party.</E> The account-holding financial institution does not violate the regulation when a third-party payee fails to obtain the authorization in writing or fails to give a copy to the consumer; rather, it is the third-party payee that is in violation of the regulation.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Written authorization for preauthorized transfers.</E> The requirement that preauthorized EFTs be authorized by the consumer “only by a writing” cannot be met by a payee's signing a written authorization on the consumer's behalf with only an oral authorization from the consumer.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Use of a confirmation form.</E> A financial institution or designated payee may comply <PRTPAGE P="243"/>with the requirements of this section in various ways. For example, a payee may provide the consumer with two copies of a preauthorization form, and ask the consumer to sign and return one and to retain the second copy.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Similarly authenticated.</E> The similarly authenticated standard permits signed, written authorizations to be provided electronically. The writing and signature requirements of this section are satisfied by complying with the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, 15 U.S.C. 7001 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> which defines electronic records and electronic signatures. Examples of electronic signatures include, but are not limited to, digital signatures and security codes. A security code need not originate with the account-holding institution. The authorization process should evidence the consumer's identity and assent to the authorization. The person that obtains the authorization must provide a copy of the terms of the authorization to the consumer either electronically or in paper form. Only the consumer may authorize the transfer and not, for example, a third-party merchant on behalf of the consumer.</P>
            <P>6. <E T="03">Requirements of an authorization.</E> An authorization is valid if it is readily identifiable as such and the terms of the preauthorized transfer are clear and readily understandable.</P>
            <P>7. <E T="03">Bona fide error.</E> Consumers sometimes authorize third-party payees, by telephone or online, to submit recurring charges against a credit card account. If the consumer indicates use of a credit card account when in fact a debit card is being used, the payee does not violate the requirement to obtain a written authorization if the failure to obtain written authorization was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error, and if the payee maintains procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error. Procedures reasonably adapted to avoid error will depend upon the circumstances. Generally, requesting the consumer to specify whether the card to be used for the authorization is a debit (or check) card or a credit card is a reasonable procedure. Where the consumer has indicated that the card is a credit card (or that the card is not a debit or check card), the payee may rely on the consumer's statement without seeking further information about the type of card. If the payee believes, at the time of the authorization, that a credit card is involved, and later finds that the card used is a debit card (for example, because the consumer later brings the matter to the payee's attention), the payee must obtain a written and signed or (where appropriate) a similarly authenticated authorization as soon as reasonably possible, or cease debiting the consumer's account.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">10(c) Consumer's Right to Stop Payment</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Stop-payment order.</E> The financial institution must honor an oral stop-payment order made at least three business days before a scheduled debit. If the debit item is resubmitted, the institution must continue to honor the stop-payment order (for example, by suspending all subsequent payments to the payee-originator until the consumer notifies the institution that payments should resume).</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Revocation of authorization.</E> Once a financial institution has been notified that the consumer's authorization is no longer valid, it must block all future payments for the particular debit transmitted by the designated payee-originator. <E T="03">But see</E> comment 10(c)-3. The institution may not wait for the payee-originator to terminate the automatic debits. The institution may confirm that the consumer has informed the payee-originator of the revocation (for example, by requiring a copy of the consumer's revocation as written confirmation to be provided within 14 days of an oral notification). If the institution does not receive the required written confirmation within the 14-day period, it may honor subsequent debits to the account.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Alternative procedure for processing a stop-payment request.</E> If an institution does not have the capability to block a preauthorized debit from being posted to the consumer's account—as in the case of a preauthorized debit made through a debit card network or other system, for example—the institution may instead comply with the stop-payment requirements by using a third party to block the transfer(s), as long as the consumer's account is not debited for the payment.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">10(d)(2) Range</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Range.</E> A financial institution or designated payee that elects to offer the consumer a specified range of amounts for debiting (in lieu of providing the notice of transfers varying in amount) must provide an acceptable range that could be anticipated by the consumer. For example, if the transfer is for payment of a gas bill, an appropriate range might be based on the highest bill in winter and the lowest bill in summer.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Transfers to an account of the consumer held at another institution.</E> A financial institution need not provide a consumer the option of receiving notice with each varying transfer, and may instead provide notice <PRTPAGE P="244"/>only when a debit to an account of the consumer falls outside a specified range or differs by more than a specified amount from the most recent transfer, if the funds are transferred and credited to an account of the consumer held at another financial institution. The specified range or amount, however, must be one that reasonably could be anticipated by the consumer, and the institution must notify the consumer of the range or amount at the time the consumer provides authorization for the preauthorized transfers. For example, if the transfer is for payment of interest for a fixed-rate certificate of deposit account, an appropriate range might be based on a month containing 28 days and a month containing 31 days.</P>

            <P>1. <E T="03">Loan payments.</E> Creditors may not require repayment of loans by electronic means on a preauthorized, recurring basis. A creditor may offer a program with a reduced annual percentage rate or other cost-related incentive for an automatic repayment feature, provided the program with the automatic payment feature is not the only loan program offered by the creditor for the type of credit involved. Examples include:</P>
            <P>i. Mortgages with graduated payments in which a pledged savings account is automatically debited during an initial period to supplement the monthly payments made by the borrower.</P>
            <P>ii. Mortgage plans calling for preauthorized biweekly payments that are debited electronically to the consumer's account and produce a lower total finance charge.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Overdraft.</E> A financial institution may require the automatic repayment of an overdraft credit plan even if the overdraft extension is charged to an open-end account that may be accessed by the consumer in ways other than by overdrafts.</P>

An employer may require direct deposit of salary by electronic means if employees are allowed to choose the institution that will receive the direct deposit.

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">11(a) Definition of Error</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Terminal location.</E> With regard to deposits at an ATM, a consumer's request for the terminal location or other information triggers the error resolution procedures, but the financial institution need only provide the ATM location if it has captured that information.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Verifying an account debit or credit.</E> If the consumer contacts the financial institution to ascertain whether a payment (for example, in a home-banking or bill-payment program) or any other type of EFT was debited to the account, or whether a deposit made via ATM, preauthorized transfer, or any other type of EFT was credited to the account, without asserting an error, the error resolution procedures do not apply.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Loss or theft of access device.</E> A financial institution is required to comply with the error resolution procedures when a consumer reports the loss or theft of an access device if the consumer also alleges possible unauthorized use as a consequence of the loss or theft.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Error asserted after account closed.</E> The financial institution must comply with the error resolution procedures when a consumer properly asserts an error, even if the account has been closed.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Request for documentation or information.</E> A request for documentation or other information must be treated as an error unless it is clear that the consumer is requesting a duplicate copy for tax or other record-keeping purposes.</P>
            <P>6. <E T="03">Terminal receipts for transfers of $15 or less.</E> The fact that an institution does not make a terminal receipt available for a transfer of $15 or less in accordance with § 1005.9(e) is not an error for purposes of § 1005.11(a)(1)(vi) or (vii).</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">11(b)(1) Timing; Contents</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Content of error notice.</E> The notice of error is effective even if it does not contain the consumer's account number, so long as the financial institution is able to identify the account in question. For example, the consumer could provide a Social Security number or other unique means of identification.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Investigation pending receipt of information.</E> While a financial institution may request a written, signed statement from the consumer relating to a notice of error, it may not delay initiating or completing an investigation pending receipt of the statement.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Statement held for consumer.</E> When a consumer has arranged for periodic statements to be held until picked up, the statement for <PRTPAGE P="245"/>a particular cycle is deemed to have been transmitted on the date the financial institution first makes the statement available to the consumer.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Failure to provide statement.</E> When a financial institution fails to provide the consumer with a periodic statement, a request for a copy is governed by this section if the consumer gives notice within 60 days from the date on which the statement should have been transmitted.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Discovery of error by institution.</E> The error resolution procedures of this section apply when a notice of error is received from the consumer, and not when the financial institution itself discovers and corrects an error.</P>
            <P>6. <E T="03">Notice at particular phone number or address.</E> A financial institution may require the consumer to give notice only at the telephone number or address disclosed by the institution, provided the institution maintains reasonable procedures to refer the consumer to the specified telephone number or address if the consumer attempts to give notice to the institution in a different manner.</P>
            <P>7. <E T="03">Effect of late notice.</E> An institution is not required to comply with the requirements of this section for any notice of error from the consumer that is received by the institution later than 60 days from the date on which the periodic statement first reflecting the error is sent. Where the consumer's assertion of error involves an unauthorized EFT, however, the institution must comply with § 1005.6 before it may impose any liability on the consumer.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">11(b)(2) Written Confirmation</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Written confirmation-of-error notice.</E> If the consumer sends a written confirmation of error to the wrong address, the financial institution must process the confirmation through normal procedures. But the institution need not provisionally credit the consumer's account if the written confirmation is delayed beyond 10 business days in getting to the right place because it was sent to the wrong address.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">11(c) Time Limits and Extent of Investigation</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Notice to consumer.</E> Unless otherwise indicated in this section, the financial institution may provide the required notices to the consumer either orally or in writing.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Written confirmation of oral notice.</E> A financial institution must begin its investigation promptly upon receipt of an oral notice. It may not delay until it has received a written confirmation.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Charges for error resolution.</E> If a billing error occurred, whether as alleged or in a different amount or manner, the financial institution may not impose a charge related to any aspect of the error-resolution process (including charges for documentation or investigation). Since the Act grants the consumer error-resolution rights, the institution should avoid any chilling effect on the good-faith assertion of errors that might result if charges are assessed when no billing error has occurred.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Correction without investigation.</E> A financial institution may make, without investigation, a final correction to a consumer's account in the amount or manner alleged by the consumer to be in error, but must comply with all other applicable requirements of § 1005.11.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Correction notice.</E> A financial institution may include the notice of correction on a periodic statement that is mailed or delivered within the 10-business-day or 45-calendar-day time limits and that clearly identifies the correction to the consumer's account. The institution must determine whether such a mailing will be prompt enough to satisfy the requirements of this section, taking into account the specific facts involved.</P>
            <P>6. <E T="03">Correction of an error.</E> If the financial institution determines an error occurred, within either the 10-day or 45-day period, it must correct the error (subject to the liability provisions of §§ 1005.6(a) and (b)) including, where applicable, the crediting of interest and the refunding of any fees imposed by the institution. In a combined credit/EFT transaction, for example, the institution must refund any finance charges incurred as a result of the error. The institution need not refund fees that would have been imposed whether or not the error occurred.</P>
            <P>7. <E T="03">Extent of required investigation.</E> A financial institution complies with its duty to investigate, correct, and report its determination regarding an error described in § 1005.11(a)(1)(vii) by transmitting the requested information, clarification, or documentation within the time limits set forth in § 1005.11(c). If the institution has provisionally credited the consumer's account in accordance with § 1005.11(c)(2), it may debit the amount upon transmitting the requested information, clarification, or documentation.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Paragraph 11(c)(2)(i)</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Compliance with all requirements.</E> Financial institutions exempted from provisionally crediting a consumer's account under §§ 1005.11(c)(2)(i)(A) and (B) must still comply with all other requirements of § 1005.11.</P>

The deadlines do not apply to transactions at an ATM, however, even though the ATM may be in a merchant location.<PRTPAGE P="246"/>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">11(c)(4) Investigation</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Third parties.</E> When information or documentation requested by the consumer is in the possession of a third party with whom the financial institution does not have an agreement, the institution satisfies the error resolution requirement by so advising the consumer within the specified time period.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Scope of investigation.</E> When an alleged error involves a payment to a third party under the financial institution's telephone bill-payment plan, a review of the institution's own records is sufficient, assuming no agreement exists between the institution and the third party concerning the bill-payment service.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">POS transfers.</E> When a consumer alleges an error involving a transfer to a merchant via a POS terminal, the institution must verify the information previously transmitted when executing the transfer. For example, the financial institution may request a copy of the sales receipt to verify that the amount of the transfer correctly corresponds to the amount of the consumer's purchase.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Agreement.</E> An agreement that a third party will honor an access device is an agreement for purposes of this paragraph. A financial institution does not have an agreement for purposes of § 1005.11(c)(4)(ii) solely because it participates in transactions that occur under the Federal recurring payments programs, or that are cleared through an ACH or similar arrangement for the clearing and settlement of fund transfers generally, or because the institution agrees to be bound by the rules of such an arrangement.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">No EFT agreement.</E> When there is no agreement between the institution and the third party for the type of EFT involved, the financial institution must review any relevant information within the institution's own records for the particular account to resolve the consumer's claim. The extent of the investigation required may vary depending on the facts and circumstances. However, a financial institution may not limit its investigation solely to the payment instructions where additional information within its own records pertaining to the particular account in question could help to resolve a consumer's claim. Information that may be reviewed as part of an investigation might include:</P>
            <P>i. The ACH transaction records for the transfer;</P>
            <P>ii. The transaction history of the particular account for a reasonable period of time immediately preceding the allegation of error;</P>
            <P>iii. Whether the check number of the transaction in question is notably out-of-sequence;</P>
            <P>iv. The location of either the transaction or the payee in question relative to the consumer's place of residence and habitual transaction area;</P>
            <P>v. Information relative to the account in question within the control of the institution's third-party service providers if the financial institution reasonably believes that it may have records or other information that could be dispositive; or</P>
            <P>vi. Any other information appropriate to resolve the claim.</P>

            <P>1. <E T="03">Error different from that alleged.</E> When a financial institution determines that an error occurred in a manner or amount different from that described by the consumer, it must comply with the requirements of both §§ 1005.11(c) and (d), as relevant. The institution may give the notice of correction and the explanation separately or in a combined form.</P>

            <P>1. <E T="03">Alternative procedure for debiting of credited funds.</E> The financial institution may comply with the requirements of this section by notifying the consumer that the consumer's account will be debited five business days from the transmittal of the notification, specifying the calendar date on which the debiting will occur.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Fees for overdrafts.</E> The financial institution may not impose fees for items it is required to honor under § 1005.11. It may, however, impose any normal transaction or item fee that is unrelated to an overdraft resulting from the debiting. If the account is still overdrawn after five business days, the institution may impose the fees or finance charges to which it is entitled, if any, under an overdraft credit plan.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">11(e) Reassertion of Error</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Withdrawal of error; right to reassert.</E> The financial institution has no further error resolution responsibilities if the consumer voluntarily withdraws the notice alleging an error. A consumer who has withdrawn an allegation of error has the right to reassert the allegation unless the financial institution had already complied with all of the error resolution requirements before the allegation was withdrawn. The consumer must do so, however, within the original 60-day period.<PRTPAGE P="247"/>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">12(a) Relation to Truth in Lending</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Determining applicable regulation.</E> i. For transactions involving access devices that also function as credit cards, whether Regulation E or Regulation Z (12 CFR part 1026) applies depends on the nature of the transaction. For example, if the transaction solely involves an extension of credit, and does not include a debit to a checking account (or other consumer asset account), the liability limitations and error resolution requirements of Regulation Z apply. If the transaction debits a checking account only (with no credit extended), the provisions of Regulation E apply. If the transaction debits a checking account but also draws on an overdraft line of credit attached to the account, Regulation E's liability limitations apply, in addition to §§ 1026.13(d) and (g) of Regulation Z (which apply because of the extension of credit associated with the overdraft feature on the checking account). If a consumer's access device is also a credit card and the device is used to make unauthorized withdrawals from a checking account, but also is used to obtain unauthorized cash advances directly from a line of credit that is separate from the checking account, both Regulation E and Regulation Z apply.</P>
            <P>ii. The following examples illustrate these principles:</P>
            <P>A. A consumer has a card that can be used either as a credit card or a debit card. When used as a debit card, the card draws on the consumer's checking account. When used as a credit card, the card draws only on a separate line of credit. If the card is stolen and used as a credit card to make purchases or to get cash advances at an ATM from the line of credit, the liability limits and error resolution provisions of Regulation Z apply; Regulation E does not apply.</P>
            <P>B. In the same situation, if the card is stolen and is used as a debit card to make purchases or to get cash withdrawals at an ATM from the checking account, the liability limits and error resolution provisions of Regulation E apply; Regulation Z does not apply.</P>
            <P>C. In the same situation, assume the card is stolen and used both as a debit card and as a credit card; for example, the thief makes some purchases using the card as a debit card, and other purchases using the card as a credit card. Here, the liability limits and error resolution provisions of Regulation E apply to the unauthorized transactions in which the card was used as a debit card, and the corresponding provisions of Regulation Z apply to the unauthorized transactions in which the card was used as a credit card.</P>
            <P>D. Assume a somewhat different type of card, one that draws on the consumer's checking account and can also draw on an overdraft line of credit attached to the checking account. There is no separate line of credit, only the overdraft line, associated with the card. In this situation, if the card is stolen and used, the liability limits and the error resolution provisions of Regulation E apply. In addition, if the use of the card has resulted in accessing the overdraft line of credit, the error resolution provisions of §§ 1026.13(d) and (g) of Regulation Z also apply, but not the other error resolution provisions of Regulation Z.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Issuance rules.</E> For access devices that also constitute credit cards, the issuance rules of Regulation E apply if the only credit feature is a preexisting credit line attached to the asset account to cover overdrafts (or to maintain a specified minimum balance) or an overdraft service, as defined in § 1005.17(a). Regulation Z (12 CFR part 1026) rules apply if there is another type of credit feature; for example, one permitting direct extensions of credit that do not involve the asset account.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Overdraft service.</E> The addition of an overdraft service, as that term is defined in § 1005.17(a), to an accepted access device does not constitute the addition of a credit feature subject to Regulation Z. Instead, the provisions of Regulation E apply, including the liability limitations (§ 1005.6) and the requirement to obtain consumer consent to the service before any fees or charges for paying an overdraft may be assessed on the account (§ 1005.17).</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">12(b) Preemption of Inconsistent State Laws</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Specific determinations.</E> The regulation prescribes standards for determining whether state laws that govern EFTs, and state laws regarding gift certificates, store gift cards, or general-use prepaid cards that govern dormancy, inactivity, or service fees, or expiration dates, are preempted by the Act and the regulation. A state law that is inconsistent may be preempted even if the Bureau has not issued a determination. However, nothing in § 1005.12(b) provides a financial institution with immunity for violations of state law if the institution chooses not to make state disclosures and the Bureau later determines that the state law is not preempted.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Preemption determination.</E> The Bureau recognizes state law preemption determinations made by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System prior to July 21, 2011, until and unless the Bureau makes and publishes any contrary determination. The Board of Governors determined that certain provisions in the state law of Michigan are preempted by the Federal law, effective March 30, 1981:</P>
            <P>i. Definition of unauthorized use. Section 5(4) is preempted to the extent that it relates to the section of state law governing consumer liability for unauthorized use of an access device.</P>

            <P>ii. Consumer liability for unauthorized use of an account. Section 14 is inconsistent with <PRTPAGE P="248"/>§ 1005.6 and is less protective of the consumer than the Federal law. The state law places liability on the consumer for the unauthorized use of an account in cases involving the consumer's negligence. Under the Federal law, a consumer's liability for unauthorized use is not related to the consumer's negligence and depends instead on the consumer's promptness in reporting the loss or theft of the access device.</P>
            <P>iii. Error resolution. Section 15 is preempted because it is inconsistent with § 1005.11 and is less protective of the consumer than the Federal law. The state law allows financial institutions up to 70 days to resolve errors, whereas the Federal law generally requires errors to be resolved within 45 days.</P>
            <P>iv. Receipts and periodic statements. Sections 17 and 18 are preempted because they are inconsistent with § 1005.9. The state provisions require a different disclosure of information than does the Federal law. The receipt provision is also preempted because it allows the consumer to be charged for receiving a receipt if a machine cannot furnish one at the time of a transfer.</P>

            <P>1. <E T="03">Applicability.</E> This section applies only when a service provider issues an access device to a consumer for initiating transfers to or from the consumer's account at a financial institution and the two entities have no agreement regarding this EFT service. If the service provider does not issue an access device to the consumer for accessing an account held by another institution, it does not qualify for the treatment accorded by § 1005.14. For example, this section does not apply to an institution that initiates preauthorized payroll deposits to consumer accounts on behalf of an employer. By contrast, § 1005.14 can apply to an institution that issues a code for initiating telephone transfers to be carried out through the ACH from a consumer's account at another institution. This is the case even if the consumer has accounts at both institutions.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">ACH agreements.</E> The ACH rules generally do not constitute an agreement for purposes of this section. However, an ACH agreement under which members specifically agree to honor each other's debit cards is an “agreement,” and thus this section does not apply.</P>

            <P>1. <E T="03">Scope.</E> i. <E T="03">Account-holding institutions.</E> Section 1005.17(b) applies to ATM and one-time debit card transactions made with a debit card issued by or on behalf of the account-holding institution. Section 1005.17(b) does <PRTPAGE P="249"/>not apply to ATM and one-time debit card transactions made with a debit card issued by or through a third party unless the debit card is issued on behalf of the account-holding institution.</P>
            <P>ii. <E T="03">Coding of transactions.</E> A financial institution complies with the rule if it adapts its systems to identify debit card transactions as either one-time or recurring. If it does so, the financial institution may rely on the transaction's coding by merchants, other institutions, and other third parties as a one-time or a preauthorized or recurring debit card transaction.</P>
            <P>iii. <E T="03">One-time debit card transactions.</E> The opt-in applies to any one-time debit card transaction, whether the card is used, for example, at a point-of-sale, in an online transaction, or in a telephone transaction.</P>
            <P>iv. <E T="03">Application of fee prohibition.</E> The prohibition on assessing overdraft fees under § 1005.17(b)(1) applies to all institutions. For example, the prohibition applies to an institution that has a policy and practice of declining to authorize and pay any ATM or one-time debit card transactions when the institution has a reasonable belief at the time of the authorization request that the consumer does not have sufficient funds available to cover the transaction. However, the institution is not required to comply with §§ 1005.17(b)(1)(i)-(iv), including the notice and opt-in requirements, if it does not assess overdraft fees for paying ATM or one-time debit card transactions that overdraw the consumer's account. Assume an institution does not provide an opt-in notice, but authorizes an ATM or one-time debit card transaction on the reasonable belief that the consumer has sufficient funds in the account to cover the transaction. If, at settlement, the consumer has insufficient funds in the account (for example, due to intervening transactions that post to the consumer's account), the institution is not permitted to assess an overdraft fee or charge for paying that transaction.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">No affirmative consent.</E> A financial institution may pay overdrafts for ATM and one-time debit card transactions even if a consumer has not affirmatively consented or opted in to the institution's overdraft service. If the institution pays such an overdraft without the consumer's affirmative consent, however, it may not impose a fee or charge for doing so. These provisions do not limit the institution's ability to debit the consumer's account for the amount overdrawn if the institution is permitted to do so under applicable law.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Overdraft transactions not required to be authorized or paid.</E> Section 1005.17 does not require a financial institution to authorize or pay an overdraft on an ATM or one-time debit card transaction even if the consumer has affirmatively consented to an institution's overdraft service for such transactions.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Reasonable opportunity to provide affirmative consent.</E> A financial institution provides a consumer with a reasonable opportunity to provide affirmative consent when, among other things, it provides reasonable methods by which the consumer may affirmatively consent. A financial institution provides such reasonable methods, if:</P>
            <P>i. <E T="03">By mail.</E> The institution provides a form for the consumer to fill out and mail to affirmatively consent to the service.</P>
            <P>ii. <E T="03">By telephone.</E> The institution provides a readily-available telephone line that consumers may call to provide affirmative consent.</P>
            <P>iii. <E T="03">By electronic means.</E> The institution provides an electronic means for the consumer to affirmatively consent. For example, the institution could provide a form that can be accessed and processed at its Web site, where the consumer may click on a check box to provide consent and confirm that choice by clicking on a button that affirms the consumer's consent.</P>
            <P>iv. <E T="03">In person.</E> The institution provides a form for the consumer to complete and present at a branch or office to affirmatively consent to the service.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Implementing opt-in at account-opening.</E> A financial institution may provide notice regarding the institution's overdraft service prior to or at account-opening. A financial institution may require a consumer, as a necessary step to opening an account, to choose whether or not to opt into the payment of ATM or one-time debit card transactions pursuant to the institution's overdraft service. For example, the institution could require the consumer, at account opening, to sign a signature line or check a box on a form (consistent with comment 17(b)-6) indicating whether or not the consumer affirmatively consents at account opening. If the consumer does not check any box or provide a signature, the institution must assume that the consumer does not opt in. Or, the institution could require the consumer to choose between an account that does not permit the payment of ATM or one-time debit card transactions pursuant to the institution's overdraft service and an account that permits the payment of such overdrafts, provided that the accounts comply with § 1005.17(b)(2) and § 1005.17(b)(3).</P>
            <P>6. <E T="03">Affirmative consent required.</E> A consumer's affirmative consent, or opt-in, to a financial institution's overdraft service must be obtained separately from other consents or acknowledgements obtained by the institution, including a consent to receive disclosures electronically. An institution may obtain a consumer's affirmative consent by providing a blank signature line or check box that the consumer could sign or select to affirmatively consent, provided that the signature <PRTPAGE P="250"/>line or check box is used solely for purposes of evidencing the consumer's choice whether or not to opt into the overdraft service and not for other purposes. An institution does not obtain a consumer's affirmative consent by including preprinted language about the overdraft service in an account disclosure provided with a signature card or contract that the consumer must sign to open the account and that acknowledges the consumer's acceptance of the account terms. Nor does an institution obtain a consumer's affirmative consent by providing a signature card that contains a pre-selected check box indicating that the consumer is requesting the service.</P>
            <P>7. <E T="03">Confirmation.</E> A financial institution may comply with the requirement in § 1005.17(b)(1)(iv) to provide confirmation of the consumer's affirmative consent by mailing or delivering to the consumer a copy of the consumer's completed opt-in notice, or by mailing or delivering a letter or notice to the consumer acknowledging that the consumer has elected to opt into the institution's service. The confirmation, which must be provided in writing, or electronically if the consumer agrees, must include a statement informing the consumer of the right to revoke the opt-in at any time. <E T="03">See</E> § 1005.17(d)(6), which permits institutions to include the revocation statement on the initial opt-in notice. An institution complies with the confirmation requirement if it has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that overdraft fees are assessed only in connection with transactions paid after the confirmation has been mailed or delivered to the consumer.</P>
            <P>8. <E T="03">Outstanding Negative Balance.</E> If a fee or charge is based on the amount of the outstanding negative balance, an institution is prohibited from assessing any such fee if the negative balance is solely attributable to an ATM or one-time debit card transaction, unless the consumer has opted into the institution's overdraft service for ATM or one-time debit card transactions. However, the rule does not prohibit an institution from assessing such a fee if the negative balance is attributable in whole or in part to a check, ACH, or other type of transaction not subject to the prohibition on assessing overdraft fees in § 1005.17(b)(1).</P>
            <P>9. <E T="03">Daily or Sustained Overdraft, Negative Balance, or Similar Fee or Charge</E> i. <E T="03">Daily or sustained overdraft, negative balance, or similar fees or charges.</E> If a consumer has not opted into the institution's overdraft service for ATM or one-time debit card transactions, the fee prohibition in § 1005.17(b)(1) applies to all overdraft fees or charges for paying those transactions, including but not limited to daily or sustained overdraft, negative balance, or similar fees or charges. Thus, where a consumer's negative balance is solely attributable to an ATM or one-time debit card transaction, the rule prohibits the assessment of such fees unless the consumer has opted in. However, the rule does not prohibit an institution from assessing daily or sustained overdraft, negative balance, or similar fees or charges if a negative balance is attributable in whole or in part to a check, ACH, or other type of transaction not subject to the fee prohibition. When the negative balance is attributable in part to an ATM or one-time debit card transaction, and in part to a check, ACH, or other type of transaction not subject to the fee prohibition, the date on which such a fee may be assessed is based on the date on which the check, ACH, or other type of transaction is paid into overdraft.</P>
            <P>ii. <E T="03">Examples.</E> The following examples illustrate how an institution complies with the fee prohibition. For each example, assume the following: (a) The consumer has not opted into the payment of ATM or one-time debit card overdrafts; (b) these transactions are paid into overdraft because the amount of the transaction at settlement exceeded the amount authorized or the amount was not submitted for authorization; (c) under the account agreement, the institution may charge a per-item fee of $20 for each overdraft, and a one-time sustained overdraft fee of $20 on the fifth consecutive day the consumer's account remains overdrawn; (d) the institution posts ATM and debit card transactions before other transactions; and (e) the institution allocates deposits to account debits in the same order in which it posts debits.</P>
            <P>A. Assume that a consumer has a $50 account balance on March 1. That day, the institution posts a one-time debit card transaction of $60 and a check transaction of $40. The institution charges an overdraft fee of $20 for the check overdraft but cannot assess an overdraft fee for the debit card transaction. At the end of the day, the consumer has an account balance of negative $70. The consumer does not make any deposits to the account, and no other transactions occur between March 2 and March 6. Because the consumer's negative balance is attributable in part to the $40 check (and associated overdraft fee), the institution may charge a sustained overdraft fee on March 6 in connection with the check.</P>

            <P>B. Same facts as in A., except that on March 3, the consumer deposits $40 in the account. The institution allocates the $40 to the debit card transaction first, consistent with its posting order policy. At the end of the day on March 3, the consumer has an account balance of negative $30, which is attributable to the check transaction (and associated overdraft fee). The consumer does not make any further deposits to the account, and no other transactions occur between March 4 and March 6. Because the remaining negative balance is attributable to <PRTPAGE P="251"/>the March 1 check transaction, the institution may charge a sustained overdraft fee on March 6 in connection with the check.</P>
            <P>C. Assume that a consumer has a $50 account balance on March 1. That day, the institution posts a one-time debit card transaction of $60. At the end of that day, the consumer has an account balance of negative $10. The institution may not assess an overdraft fee for the debit card transaction. On March 3, the institution pays a check transaction of $100 and charges an overdraft fee of $20. At the end of that day, the consumer has an account balance of negative $130. The consumer does not make any deposits to the account, and no other transactions occur between March 4 and March 8. Because the consumer's negative balance is attributable in part to the check, the institution may assess a $20 sustained overdraft fee. However, because the check was paid on March 3, the institution must use March 3 as the start date for determining the date on which the sustained overdraft fee may be assessed. Thus, the institution may charge a $20 sustained overdraft fee on March 8.</P>
            <P>iii. <E T="03">Alternative approach.</E> For a consumer who does not opt into the institution's overdraft service for ATM and one-time debit card transactions, an institution may also comply with the fee prohibition in § 1005.17(b)(1) by not assessing daily or sustained overdraft, negative balance, or similar fees or charges unless a consumer's negative balance is attributable solely to check, ACH or other types of transactions not subject to the fee prohibition while that negative balance remains outstanding. In such case, the institution would not have to determine how to allocate subsequent deposits that reduce but do not eliminate the negative balance. For example, if a consumer has a negative balance of $30, of which $10 is attributable to a one-time debit card transaction, an institution complies with the fee prohibition if it does not assess a sustained overdraft fee while that negative balance remains outstanding.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">17(b)(2) Conditioning Payment of Other Overdrafts on Consumer's Affirmative Consent</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Application of the same criteria.</E> The prohibitions on conditioning in § 1005.17(b)(2) generally require an institution to apply the same criteria for deciding when to pay overdrafts for checks, ACH transactions, and other types of transactions, whether or not the consumer has affirmatively consented to the institution's overdraft service with respect to ATM and one-time debit card overdrafts. For example, if an institution's internal criteria would lead the institution to pay a check overdraft if the consumer had affirmatively consented to the institution's overdraft service for ATM and one-time debit card transactions, it must also apply the same criteria in a consistent manner in determining whether to pay the check overdraft if the consumer has not opted in.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">No requirement to pay overdrafts on checks, ACH transactions, or other types of transactions.</E> The prohibition on conditioning in § 1005.17(b)(2) does not require an institution to pay overdrafts on checks, ACH transactions, or other types of transactions in all circumstances. Rather, the rule simply prohibits institutions from considering the consumer's decision not to opt in when deciding whether to pay overdrafts for checks, ACH transactions, or other types of transactions.2&gt;17(b)(3) Same Account Terms, Conditions, and Features</P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Variations in terms, conditions, or features.</E> A financial institution may not vary the terms, conditions, or features of an account provided to a consumer who does not affirmatively consent to the payment of ATM or one-time debit card transactions pursuant to the institution's overdraft service. This includes, but is not limited to:</P>
            <P>i. Interest rates paid and fees assessed;</P>
            <P>ii. The type of ATM or debit card provided to the consumer. For instance, an institution may not provide consumers who do not opt in a PIN-only card while providing a debit card with both PIN and signature-debit functionality to consumers who opt in;</P>
            <P>iii. Minimum balance requirements; or</P>
            <P>iv. Account features such as online bill payment services.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Limited-feature bank accounts.</E> Section 1005.17(b)(3) does not prohibit institutions from offering deposit account products with limited features, provided that a consumer is not required to open such an account because the consumer did not opt in. For example, § 1005.17(b)(3) does not prohibit an institution from offering a checking account designed to comply with state basic banking laws, or designed for consumers who are not eligible for a checking account because of their credit or checking account history, which may include features limiting the payment of overdrafts. However, a consumer who applies, and is otherwise eligible, for a full-service or other particular deposit account product may not be provided instead with the account with more limited features because the consumer has declined to opt in.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">17(c) Timing</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Permitted fees or charges.</E> Fees or charges for ATM and one-time debit card overdrafts may be assessed only for overdrafts paid on or after the date the financial institution receives the consumer's affirmative consent to the institution's overdraft service. <E T="03">See also</E> comment 17(b)-7.<PRTPAGE P="252"/>
            </P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">17(d) Content and Format</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Overdraft service.</E> The description of the institution's overdraft service should indicate that the consumer has the right to affirmatively consent, or opt into payment of overdrafts for ATM and one-time debit card transactions. The description should also disclose the institution's policies regarding the payment of overdrafts for other transactions, including checks, ACH transactions, and automatic bill payments, provided that this content is not more prominent than the description of the consumer's right to opt into payment of overdrafts for ATM and one-time debit card transactions. As applicable, the institution also should indicate that it pays overdrafts at its discretion, and should briefly explain that if the institution does not authorize and pay an overdraft, it may decline the transaction.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Maximum fee.</E> If the amount of a fee may vary from transaction to transaction, the financial institution may indicate that the consumer may be assessed a fee “up to” the maximum fee. The financial institution must disclose all applicable overdraft fees, including but not limited to:</P>
            <P>i. Per item or per transaction fees;</P>
            <P>ii. Daily overdraft fees;</P>
            <P>iii. Sustained overdraft fees, where fees are assessed when the consumer has not repaid the amount of the overdraft after some period of time (for example, if an account remains overdrawn for five or more business days); or</P>
            <P>iv. Negative balance fees.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Opt-in methods.</E> The opt-in notice must include the methods by which the consumer may consent to the overdraft service for ATM and one-time debit card transactions. Institutions may tailor Model Form A-9 to the methods offered to consumers for affirmatively consenting to the service. For example, an institution need not provide the tear-off portion of Model Form A-9 if it is only permitting consumers to opt-in telephonically or electronically. Institutions may, but are not required, to provide a signature line or check box where the consumer can indicate that he or she declines to opt in.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Identification of consumer's account.</E> An institution may use any reasonable method to identify the account for which the consumer submits the opt-in notice. For example, the institution may include a line for a printed name and an account number, as shown in Model Form A-9. Or, the institution may print a bar code or use other tracking information. <E T="03">See also</E> comment 17(b)-6, which describes how an institution obtains a consumer's affirmative consent.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Alternative plans for covering overdrafts.</E> If the institution offers both a line of credit subject to Regulation Z (12 CFR part 1026) and a service that transfers funds from another account of the consumer held at the institution to cover overdrafts, the institution must state in its opt-in notice that both alternative plans are offered. For example, the notice might state “We also offer <E T="03">overdraft protection plans,</E> such as a link to a savings account or to an overdraft line of credit, which may be less expensive than our standard overdraft practices.” If the institution offers one, but not the other, it must state in its opt-in notice the alternative plan that it offers. If the institution does not offer either plan, it should omit the reference to the alternative plans.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">17(f) Continuing Right To Opt-In or To Revoke the Opt-In</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Fees or charges for overdrafts incurred prior to revocation.</E> Section 1005.17(f)(1) provides that a consumer may revoke his or her prior consent at any time. If a consumer does so, this provision does not require the financial institution to waive or reverse any overdraft fees assessed on the consumer's account prior to the institution's implementation of the consumer's revocation request.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">17(g) Duration of Opt-In</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Termination of overdraft service.</E> A financial institution may, for example, terminate the overdraft service when the consumer makes excessive use of the service.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Section 1005.18 Requirements for Financial Institutions Offering Payroll Card Accounts</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">18(a) Coverage</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Issuance of access device.</E> Consistent with § 1005.5(a), a financial institution may issue an access device only in response to an oral or written request for the device, or as a renewal or substitute for an accepted access device. A consumer is deemed to request an access device for a payroll card account when the consumer chooses to receive salary or other compensation through a payroll card account.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Application to employers and service providers.</E> Typically, employers and third-party service providers do not meet the definition of a “financial institution” subject to the regulation because they neither hold payroll card accounts nor issue payroll cards and agree with consumers to provide EFT services in connection with payroll card accounts. However, to the extent an employer or a service provider undertakes either of these functions, it would be deemed a financial institution under the regulation.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">18(b) Alternative to Periodic Statements</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Posted transactions.</E> A history of transactions provided under §§ 1005.18(b)(1)(ii) and (iii) shall reflect transfers once they have been posted to the account. Thus, an institution does not need to include transactions <PRTPAGE P="253"/>that have been authorized, but that have not yet posted to the account.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Electronic history.</E> The electronic history required under § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii) must be provided in a form that the consumer may keep, as required under § 1005.4(a)(1). Financial institutions may satisfy this requirement if they make the electronic history available in a format that is capable of being retained. For example, an institution satisfies the requirement if it provides a history at a Web site in a format that is capable of being printed or stored electronically using a web browser.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">18(c) Modified Requirements</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Error resolution safe harbor provision.</E> Institutions that choose to investigate notices of error provided up to 120 days from the date a transaction has posted to a consumer's account may still disclose the error resolution time period required by the regulation (as set forth in the Model Form in appendix A-7). Specifically, an institution may disclose to payroll card account holders that the institution will investigate any notice of error provided within 60 days of the consumer electronically accessing an account or receiving a written history upon request that reflects the error, even if, for some or all transactions, the institution investigates any notice of error provided up to 120 days from the date that the transaction alleged to be in error has posted to the consumer's account. Similarly, an institution's summary of the consumer's liability (as required under § 1005.7(b)(1)) may disclose that liability is based on the consumer providing notice of error within 60 days of the consumer electronically accessing an account or receiving a written history reflecting the error, even if, for some or all transactions, the institution allows a consumer to assert a notice of error up to 120 days from the date of posting of the alleged error.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Electronic access.</E> A consumer is deemed to have accessed a payroll card account electronically when the consumer enters a user identification code or password or otherwise complies with a security procedure used by an institution to verify the consumer's identity. An institution is not required to determine whether a consumer has in fact accessed information about specific transactions to trigger the beginning of the 60-day periods for liability limits and error resolution under §§ 1005.6 and 1005.11.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Untimely notice of error.</E> An institution that provides a transaction history under § 1005.18(b)(1) is not required to comply with the requirements of § 1005.11 for any notice of error from the consumer pertaining to a transfer that occurred more than 60 days prior to the earlier of the date the consumer electronically accesses the account or the date the financial institution sends a written history upon the consumer's request. (Alternatively, as provided in § 1005.18(c)(4)(ii), an institution need not comply with the requirements of § 1005.11 with respect to any notice of error received from the consumer more than 120 days after the date of posting of the transfer allegedly in error.) Where the consumer's assertion of error involves an unauthorized EFT, however, the institution must comply with § 1005.6 before it may impose any liability on the consumer.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Section 1005.20 Requirements for Gift Cards and Gift Certificates</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">20(a) Definitions</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Form of card, code, or device.</E> Section 1005.20 applies to any card, code, or other device that meets one of the definitions in §§ 1005.20(a)(1) through (a)(3) (and is not otherwise excluded by § 1005.20(b)), even if it is not issued in card form. Section 1005.20 applies, for example, to an account number or bar code that can be used to access underlying funds. Similarly, § 1005.20 applies to a device with a chip or other embedded mechanism that links the device to stored funds, such as a mobile phone or sticker containing a contactless chip that enables the consumer to access the stored funds. A card, code, or other device that meets the definition in §§ 1005.20(a)(1) through (a)(3) includes an electronic promise (<E T="03">see</E> comment 20(a)-2) as well as a promise that is not electronic. <E T="03">See, however,</E> § 1005.20(b)(5). In addition, § 1005.20 applies if a merchant issues a code that entitles a consumer to redeem the code for goods or services, regardless of the medium in which the code is issued (<E T="03">see, however,</E> § 1005.20(b)(5)), and whether or not it may be redeemed electronically or in the merchant's store. Thus, for example, if a merchant emails a code that a consumer may redeem in a specified amount either online or in the merchant's store, that code is covered under § 1005.20, unless one of the exclusions in § 1005.20(b) apply.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Electronic promise.</E> The term “electronic promise” as used in EFTA sections 915(a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), and (a)(2)(D) means a person's commitment or obligation communicated or stored in electronic form made to a consumer to provide payment for goods or services for transactions initiated by the consumer. The electronic promise is itself represented by a card, code or other device that is issued or honored by the person, reflecting the person's commitment or obligation to pay. For example, if a merchant issues a code that can be given as a gift and that entitles the recipient to redeem the code in an online transaction for goods or services, that code represents an electronic promise by the merchant and is a card, code, or other device covered by § 1005.20.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Cards, codes, or other devices redeemable for specific goods or services.</E> Certain cards, codes, or other devices may be redeemable <PRTPAGE P="254"/>upon presentation for a specific good or service, or “experience,” such as a spa treatment, hotel stay, or airline flight. In other cases, a card, code, or other device may entitle the consumer to a certain percentage off the purchase of a good or service, such as 20% off of any purchase in a store. Such cards, codes, or other devices generally are not subject to the requirements of this section because they are not issued to a consumer “in a specified amount” as required under the definitions of “gift certificate,” “store gift card,” or “general-use prepaid card.” However, if the card, code, or other device is issued in a specified or denominated amount that can be applied toward the purchase of a specific good or service, such as a certificate or card redeemable for a spa treatment up to $50, the card, code, or other device is subject to this section, unless one of the exceptions in § 1005.20(b) apply. <E T="03">See, e.g.,</E> § 1005.20(b)(3). Similarly, if the card, code, or other device states a specific monetary value, such as “a $50 value,” the card, code, or other device is subject to this section, unless an exclusion in § 1005.20(b) applies.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Issued primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.</E> Section 1005.20 only applies to cards, codes, or other devices that are sold or issued to a consumer primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. A card, code, or other device initially purchased by a business is subject to this section if the card, code, or other device is purchased for redistribution or resale to consumers primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. Moreover, the fact that a card, code, or other device may be primarily funded by a business, for example, in the case of certain rewards or incentive cards, does not mean the card, code, or other device is outside the scope of § 1005.20, if the card, code, or other device will be provided to a consumer primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. <E T="03">But see</E> § 1005.20(b)(3). Whether a card, code, or other device is issued to a consumer primarily for personal, family, or household purposes will depend on the facts and circumstances. For example, if a program manager purchases store gift cards directly from an issuing merchant and sells those cards through the program manager's retail outlets, such gift cards are subject to the requirements of § 1005.20 because the store gift cards are sold to consumers primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. In contrast, a card, code, or other device generally would not be issued to consumers primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, and therefore would fall outside the scope of § 1005.20, if the purchaser of the card, code, or device is contractually prohibited from reselling or redistributing the card, code, or device to consumers primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, and reasonable policies and procedures are maintained to avoid such sale or distribution for such purposes. However, if an entity that has purchased cards, codes, or other devices for business purposes sells or distributes such cards, codes, or other devices to consumers primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, that entity does not comply with § 1005.20 if it has not otherwise met the substantive and disclosure requirements of the rule or unless an exclusion in § 1005.20(b) applies.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Examples of cards, codes, or other devices issued for business purposes.</E> Examples of cards, codes, or other devices that are issued and used for business purposes and therefore excluded from the definitions of “gift certificate,” “store gift card,” or “general-use prepaid card” include:</P>
            <P>i. Cards, codes, or other devices to reimburse employees for travel or moving expenses.</P>
            <P>ii. Cards, codes, or other devices for employees to use to purchase office supplies and other business-related items.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">20(a)(2) Store Gift Card</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Relationship between “gift certificate” and “store gift card.”</E> The term “store gift card” in § 1005.20(a)(2) includes “gift certificate” as defined in § 1005.20(a)(1). For example, a numeric or alphanumeric code representing a specified dollar amount or value that is electronically sent to a consumer as a gift which can be redeemed or exchanged by the recipient to obtain goods or services may be both a “gift certificate” and a “store gift card” if the specified amount or value cannot be increased.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Affiliated group of merchants.</E> The term “affiliated group of merchants” means two or more affiliated merchants or other persons that are related by common ownership or common corporate control (<E T="03">see, e.g.,</E> 12 CFR 227.3(b) and 12 CFR 223.2) and that share the same name, mark, or logo. For example, the term includes franchisees that are subject to a common set of corporate policies or practices under the terms of their franchise licenses. The term also applies to two or more merchants or other persons that agree among themselves, by contract or otherwise, to redeem cards, codes, or other devices bearing the same name, mark, or logo (other than the mark, logo, or brand of a payment network), for the purchase of goods or services solely at such merchants or persons. For example, assume a movie theatre chain and a restaurant chain jointly agree to issue cards that share the same “Flix and Food” logo that can be redeemed solely towards the purchase of movie tickets or concessions at any of the participating movie theatres, or towards the purchase of food or beverages at any of the participating restaurants. For purposes of § 1005.20, the movie theatre chain and the restaurant chain would be considered to be an affiliated group of merchants, <PRTPAGE P="255"/>and the cards are considered to be “store gift cards.” However, merchants or other persons are not considered to be affiliated merely because they agree to accept a card that bears the mark, logo, or brand of a payment network.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">20(a)(3) General-Use Prepaid Card</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Redeemable upon presentation at multiple, unaffiliated merchants.</E> A card, code, or other device is redeemable upon presentation at multiple, unaffiliated merchants if, for example, such merchants agree to honor the card, code, or device if it bears the mark, logo, or brand of a payment network, pursuant to the rules of the payment network.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Mall gift cards.</E> Mall gift cards that are intended to be used or redeemed for goods or services at participating retailers within a shopping mall may be considered store gift cards or general-use prepaid cards depending on the merchants with which the cards may be redeemed. For example, if a mall card may only be redeemed at merchants within the mall itself, the card is more likely to be redeemable at an affiliated group of merchants and considered a store gift card. However, certain mall cards also carry the brand of a payment network and can be used at any retailer that accepts that card brand, including retailers located outside of the mall. Such cards are considered general-use prepaid cards.</P>

            <P>1. <E T="03">Examples of loyalty, award, or promotional programs.</E> Examples of loyalty, award, or promotional programs under § 1005.20(a)(4) include, but are not limited to:</P>
            <P>i. Consumer retention programs operated or administered by a merchant or other person that provide to consumers cards or coupons redeemable for or towards goods or services or other monetary value as a reward for purchases made or for visits to the participating merchant.</P>
            <P>ii. Sales promotions operated or administered by a merchant or product manufacturer that provide coupons or discounts redeemable for or towards goods or services or other monetary value.</P>
            <P>iii. Rebate programs operated or administered by a merchant or product manufacturer that provide cards redeemable for or towards goods or services or other monetary value to consumers in connection with the consumer's purchase of a product or service and the consumer's completion of the rebate submission process.</P>
            <P>iv. Sweepstakes or contests that distribute cards redeemable for or towards goods or services or other monetary value to consumers as an invitation to enter into the promotion for a chance to win a prize.</P>
            <P>v. Referral programs that provide cards redeemable for or towards goods or services or other monetary value to consumers in exchange for referring other potential consumers to a merchant.</P>
            <P>vi. Incentive programs through which an employer provides cards redeemable for or towards goods or services or other monetary value to employees, for example, to recognize job performance, such as increased sales, or to encourage employee wellness and safety.</P>
            <P>vii. Charitable or community relations programs through which a company provides cards redeemable for or towards goods or services or other monetary value to a charity or community group for their fundraising purposes, for example, as a reward for a donation or as a prize in a charitable event.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Issued for loyalty, award, or promotional purposes.</E> To indicate that a card, code, or other device is issued for loyalty, award, or promotional purposes as required by § 1005.20(a)(4)(iii), it is sufficient for the card, code, or other device to state on the front, for example, “Reward” or “Promotional.”</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Reference to toll-free number and Web site.</E> If a card, code, or other device issued in connection with a loyalty, award, or promotional program does not have any fees, the disclosure under § 1005.20(a)(4)(iii)(D) is not required on the card, code, or other device.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">20(a)(6) Service Fee</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Service fees.</E> Under § 1005.20(a)(6), a service fee includes a periodic fee for holding or use of a gift certificate, store gift card, or general-use prepaid card. A periodic fee includes any fee that may be imposed on a gift certificate, store gift card, or general-use prepaid card from time to time for holding or using the certificate or card, such as a monthly maintenance fee, a transaction fee, an ATM fee, a reload fee, a foreign currency transaction fee, or a balance inquiry fee, whether or not the fee is waived for a certain period of time or is only imposed after a certain period of time. A service fee does not include a one-time fee or a fee that is unlikely to be imposed more than once while the underlying funds are still valid, such as an initial issuance fee, a cash-out fee, a supplemental card fee, or a lost or stolen certificate or card replacement fee.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">20(a)(7) Activity</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Activity.</E> Under § 1005.20(a)(7), any action that results in an increase or decrease of the funds underlying a gift certificate, store gift card, or general-use prepaid card, other than the imposition of a fee, or an adjustment due to an error or a reversal of a prior transaction, constitutes activity for purposes of § 1005.20. For example, the purchase and activation of a certificate or card, the use of the <PRTPAGE P="256"/>certificate or card to purchase a good or service, or the reloading of funds onto a store gift card or general-use prepaid card constitutes activity. However, the imposition of a fee, the replacement of an expired, lost, or stolen certificate or card, and a balance inquiry do not constitute activity. In addition, if a consumer attempts to engage in a transaction with a gift certificate, store gift card, or general-use prepaid card, but the transaction cannot be completed due to technical or other reasons, such attempt does not constitute activity. Furthermore, if the funds underlying a gift certificate, store gift card, or general-use prepaid card are adjusted because there was an error or the consumer has returned a previously purchased good, the adjustment also does not constitute activity with respect to the certificate or card.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">20(b) Exclusions</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Application of exclusion.</E> A card, code, or other device is excluded from the definition of “gift certificate,” “store gift card,” or “general-use prepaid card” if it meets any of the exclusions in § 1005.20(b). An excluded card, code, or other device generally is not subject to any of the requirements of this section. <E T="03">See, however,</E> § 1005.20(a)(4)(iii), requiring certain disclosures for loyalty, award, or promotional gift cards.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Eligibility for multiple exclusions.</E> A card, code, or other device may qualify for one or more exclusions. For example, a corporation may give its employees a gift card that is marketed solely to businesses for incentive-related purposes, such as to reward job performance or promote employee safety. In this case, the card may qualify for the exclusion for loyalty, award, or promotional gift cards under § 1005.20(b)(3), or for the exclusion for cards, codes, or other devices not marketed to the general public under § 1005.20(b)(4). In addition, as long as any one of the exclusions applies, a card, code, or other device is not covered by § 1005.20, even if other exclusions do not apply. In the above example, the corporation may give its employees a type of gift card that can also be purchased by a consumer directly from a merchant. Under these circumstances, while the card does not qualify for the exclusion for cards, codes, or other devices not marketed to the general public under § 1005.20(b)(4) because the card can also be obtained through retail channels, it is nevertheless exempt from the substantive requirements of § 1005.20 because it is a loyalty, award, or promotional gift card. <E T="03">See, however,</E> § 1005.20(a)(4)(iii), requiring certain disclosures for loyalty, award, or promotional gift cards. Similarly, a person may market a reloadable card to teenagers for occasional expenses that enables parents to monitor spending. Although the card does not qualify for the exclusion for cards, codes, or other devices not marketed to the general public under § 1005.20(b)(4), it may nevertheless be exempt from the requirements of § 1005.20 under § 1005.20(b)(2) if it is reloadable and not marketed or labeled as a gift card or gift certificate.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Paragraph 20(b)(1)</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Examples of excluded products.</E> The exclusion for products usable solely for telephone services applies to prepaid cards for long-distance telephone service, prepaid cards for wireless telephone service and prepaid cards for other services that function similar to telephone services, such as prepaid cards for voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) access time.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Paragraph 20(b)(2)</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Reloadable.</E> A card, code, or other device is “reloadable” if the terms and conditions of the agreement permit funds to be added to the card, code, or other device after the initial purchase or issuance. A card, code, or other device is not “reloadable” merely because the issuer or processor is technically able to add functionality that would otherwise enable the card, code, or other device to be reloaded.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Marketed or labeled as a gift card or gift certificate.</E> The term “marketed or labeled as a gift card or gift certificate” means directly or indirectly offering, advertising, or otherwise suggesting the potential use of a card, code or other device, as a gift for another person. Whether the exclusion applies generally does not depend on the type of entity that makes the promotional message. For example, a card may be marketed or labeled as a gift card or gift certificate if anyone (other than the purchaser of the card), including the issuer, the retailer, the program manager that may distribute the card, or the payment network on which a card is used, promotes the use of the card as a gift card or gift certificate. A card, code, or other device, including a general-purpose reloadable card, is marketed or labeled as a gift card or gift certificate even if it is only occasionally marketed as a gift card or gift certificate. For example, a network-branded general purpose reloadable card would be marketed or labeled as a gift card or gift certificate if the issuer principally advertises the card as a less costly alternative to a bank account but promotes the card in a television, radio, newspaper, or Internet advertisement, or on signage as “the perfect gift” during the holiday season. However, the mere mention of the availability of gift cards or gift certificates in an advertisement or on a sign that also indicates the availability of other excluded prepaid cards does not by itself cause the excluded prepaid cards to be marketed as a gift card or a gift certificate. For example, <PRTPAGE P="257"/>the posting of a sign in a store that refers to the availability of gift cards does not by itself constitute the marketing of otherwise excluded prepaid cards that may also be sold in the store as gift cards or gift certificates, provided that a consumer acting reasonably under the circumstances would not be led to believe that the sign applies to all prepaid cards sold in the store. <E T="03">See, however,</E> comment 20(b)(2)-4.ii.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Examples of marketed or labeled as a gift card or gift certificate.</E> i. Examples of marketed or labeled as a gift card or gift certificate include:</P>
            <P>A. Using the word “gift” or “present” on a card, certificate, or accompanying material, including documentation, packaging and promotional displays.</P>
            <P>B. Representing or suggesting that a certificate or card can be given to another person, for example, as a “token of appreciation” or a “stocking stuffer,” or displaying a congratulatory message on the card, certificate or accompanying material.</P>
            <P>C. Incorporating gift-giving or celebratory imagery or motifs, such as a bow, ribbon, wrapped present, candle, or congratulatory message, on a card, certificate, accompanying documentation, or promotional material.</P>
            <P>ii. The term does not include:</P>
            <P>A. Representing that a card or certificate can be used as a substitute for a checking, savings, or deposit account.</P>
            <P>B. Representing that a card or certificate can be used to pay for a consumer's health-related expenses—for example, a card tied to a health savings account.</P>
            <P>C. Representing that a card or certificate can be used as a substitute for traveler's checks or cash.</P>
            <P>D. Representing that a card or certificate can be used as a budgetary tool, for example, by teenagers, or to cover emergency expenses.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Reasonable policies and procedures to avoid marketing as a gift card.</E> The exclusion for a card, code, or other device that is reloadable and not marketed or labeled as a gift card or gift certificate in § 1005.20(b)(2) applies if a reloadable card, code, or other device is not marketed or labeled as a gift card or gift certificate and if persons subject to the rule, including issuers, program managers, and retailers, maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to avoid such marketing. Such policies and procedures may include contractual provisions prohibiting a reloadable card, code, or other device from being marketed or labeled as a gift card or gift certificate, merchandising guidelines or plans regarding how the product must be displayed in a retail outlet, and controls to regularly monitor or otherwise verify that the card, code or other device is not being marketed as a gift card. Whether a reloadable card, code, or other device has been marketed as a gift card or gift certificate will depend on the facts and circumstances, including whether a reasonable consumer would be led to believe that the card, code, or other device is a gift card or gift certificate. The following examples illustrate the application of § 1005.20(b)(2):</P>
            <P>i. An issuer or program manager of prepaid cards agrees to sell general-purpose reloadable cards through a retailer. The contract between the issuer or program manager and the retailer establishes the terms and conditions under which the cards may be sold and marketed at the retailer. The terms and conditions prohibit the general-purpose reloadable cards from being marketed as a gift card or gift certificate, and require policies and procedures to regularly monitor or otherwise verify that the cards are not being marketed as such. The issuer or program manager sets up one promotional display at the retailer for gift cards and another physically separated display for excluded products under § 1005.20(b), including general-purpose reloadable cards and wireless telephone cards, such that a reasonable consumer would not believe that the excluded cards are gift cards. The exclusion in § 1005.20(b)(2) applies because policies and procedures reasonably designed to avoid the marketing of the general-purpose reloadable cards as gift cards or gift certificates are maintained, even if a retail clerk inadvertently stocks or a consumer inadvertently places a general-purpose reloadable card on the gift card display.</P>
            <P>ii. Same facts as in i., except that the issuer or program manager sets up a single promotional display at the retailer on which a variety of prepaid cards are sold, including store gift cards and general-purpose reloadable cards. A sign stating “Gift Cards” appears prominently at the top of the display. The exclusion in § 1005.20(b)(2) does not apply with respect to the general-purpose reloadable cards because policies and procedures reasonably designed to avoid the marketing of excluded cards as gift cards or gift certificates are not maintained.</P>

            <P>iii. Same facts as in i., except that the issuer or program manager sets up a single promotional multi-sided display at the retailer on which a variety of prepaid card products, including store gift cards and general-purpose reloadable cards are sold. Gift cards are segregated from excluded cards, with gift cards on one side of the display and excluded cards on a different side of a display. Signs of equal prominence at the top of each side of the display clearly differentiate between gift cards and the other types of prepaid cards that are available for sale. The retailer does not use any more conspicuous signage suggesting the general availability of gift cards, such as a large sign stating “Gift Cards” at the top of the display or located near the display. The exclusion in <PRTPAGE P="258"/>§ 1005.20(b)(2) applies because policies and procedures reasonably designed to avoid the marketing of the general-purpose reloadable cards as gift cards or gift certificates are maintained, even if a retail clerk inadvertently stocks or a consumer inadvertently places a general-purpose reloadable card on the gift card display.</P>
            <P>iv. Same facts as in i., except that the retailer sells a variety of prepaid card products, including store gift cards and general-purpose reloadable cards, arranged side-by-side in the same checkout lane. The retailer does not affirmatively indicate or represent that gift cards are available, such as by displaying any signage or other indicia at the checkout lane suggesting the general availability of gift cards. The exclusion in § 1005.20(b)(2) applies because policies and procedures reasonably designed to avoid marketing the general-purpose reloadable cards as gift cards or gift certificates are maintained.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Online sales of prepaid cards.</E> Some Web sites may prominently advertise or promote the availability of gift cards or gift certificates in a manner that suggests to a consumer that the Web site exclusively sells gift cards or gift certificates. For example, a Web site may display a banner advertisement or a graphic on the home page that prominently states “Gift Cards,” “Gift Giving,” or similar language without mention of other available products, or use a web address that includes only a reference to gift cards or gift certificates in the address. In such a case, a consumer acting reasonably under the circumstances could be led to believe that all prepaid products sold on the Web site are gift cards or gift certificates. Under these facts, the Web site has marketed all such products, including general-purpose reloadable cards, as gift cards or gift certificates, and the exclusion in § 1005.20(b)(2) does not apply.</P>
            <P>6. <E T="03">Temporary non-reloadable cards issued in connection with a general-purpose reloadable card.</E> Certain general-purpose reloadable cards that are typically marketed as an account substitute initially may be sold or issued in the form of a temporary non-reloadable card. After the card is purchased, the cardholder is typically required to call the issuer to register the card and to provide identifying information in order to obtain a reloadable replacement card. In most cases, the temporary non-reloadable card can be used for purchases until the replacement reloadable card arrives and is activated by the cardholder. Because the temporary non-reloadable card may only be obtained in connection with the general-purpose reloadable card, the exclusion in § 1005.20(b)(2) applies so long as the card is not marketed as a gift card or gift certificate.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Paragraph 20(b)(4)</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Marketed to the general public.</E> A card, code, or other device is marketed to the general public if the potential use of the card, code, or other device is directly or indirectly offered, advertised, or otherwise promoted to the general public. A card, code, or other device may be marketed to the general public through any advertising medium, including television, radio, newspaper, the Internet, or signage. However, the posting of a company policy that funds may be disbursed by prepaid card (such as a sign posted at a cash register or customer service center stating that store credit will be issued by prepaid card) does not constitute the marketing of a card, code, or other device to the general public. In addition, the method of distribution by itself is not dispositive in determining whether a card, code, or other device is marketed to the general public. Factors that may be considered in determining whether the exclusion applies to a particular card, code, or other device include the means or channel through which the card, code, or device may be obtained by a consumer, the subset of consumers that are eligible to obtain the card, code, or device, and whether the availability of the card, code, or device is advertised or otherwise promoted in the marketplace.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Examples.</E> The following examples illustrate the application of the exclusion in § 1005.20(b)(4):</P>

            <P>i. A merchant sells its gift cards at a discount to a business which may give them to employees or loyal consumers as incentives or rewards. In determining whether the gift card falls within the exclusion in § 1005.20(b)(4), the merchant must consider whether the card is of a type that is advertised or made available to consumers generally or can be obtained elsewhere. If the card can also be purchased through retail channels, the exclusion in § 1005.20(b)(4) does not apply, even if the consumer obtained the card from the business as an incentive or reward. <E T="03">See, however,</E> § 1005.20(b)(3).</P>

            <P>ii. A national retail chain decides to market its gift cards only to members of its frequent buyer program. Similarly, a bank may decide to sell gift cards only to its customers. If a member of the general public may become a member of the program or a customer of the bank, the card does not fall within the exclusion in § 1005.20(b)(4) because the general public has the ability to obtain the cards. <E T="03">See, however,</E> § 1005.20(b)(3).</P>

            <P>iii. A card issuer advertises a reloadable card to teenagers and their parents promoting the card for use by teenagers for occasional expenses, schoolbooks and emergencies and by parents to monitor spending. Because the card is marketed to and may be sold to any member of the general public, <PRTPAGE P="259"/>the exclusion in § 1005.20(b)(4) does not apply. <E T="03">See, however,</E> § 1005.20(b)(2).</P>
            <P>iv. An insurance company settles a policyholder's claim and distributes the insurance proceeds to the consumer by means of a prepaid card. Because the prepaid card is simply the means for providing the insurance proceeds to the consumer and the availability of the card is not advertised to the general public, the exclusion in § 1005.20(b)(4) applies.</P>
            <P>v. A merchant provides store credit to a consumer following a merchandise return by issuing a prepaid card that clearly indicates that the card contains funds for store credit. Because the prepaid card is issued for the stated purpose of providing store credit to the consumer and the ability to receive refunds by a prepaid card is not advertised to the general public, the exclusion in § 1005.20(b)(4) applies.</P>
            <P>vi. A tax preparation company elects to distribute tax refunds to its clients by issuing prepaid cards, but does not advertise or otherwise promote the ability to receive proceeds in this manner. Because the prepaid card is simply the mechanism for providing the tax refund to the consumer, and the tax preparer does not advertise the ability to obtain tax refunds by a prepaid card, the exclusion in § 1005.20(b)(4) applies. However, if the tax preparer promotes the ability to receive tax refund proceeds through a prepaid card as a way to obtain “faster” access to the proceeds, the exclusion in § 1005.20(b)(4) does not apply.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Paragraph 20(b)(5)</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Exclusion explained.</E> To qualify for the exclusion in § 1005.20(b)(5), the sole means of issuing the card, code, or other device must be in a paper form. Thus, the exclusion generally applies to certificates issued in paper form where solely the paper itself may be used to purchase goods or services. A card, code or other device is not issued solely in paper form simply because it may be reproduced or printed on paper. For example, a bar code, card or certificate number, or certificate or coupon electronically provided to a consumer and redeemable for goods and services is not issued in paper form, even if it may be reproduced or otherwise printed on paper by the consumer. In this circumstance, although the consumer might hold a paper facsimile of the card, code, or other device, the exclusion does not apply because the information necessary to redeem the value was initially issued in electronic form. A paper certificate is within the exclusion regardless of whether it may be redeemed electronically. For example, a paper certificate or receipt that bears a bar code, code, or account number falls within the exclusion in § 1005.20(b)(5) if the bar code, code, or account number is not issued in any form other than on the paper. In addition, the exclusion in § 1005.20(b)(5) continues to apply in circumstances where an issuer replaces a gift certificate that was initially issued in paper form with a card or electronic code (for example, to replace a lost paper certificate).</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Examples.</E> The following examples illustrate the application of the exclusion in § 1005.20(b)(5):</P>
            <P>i. A merchant issues a paper gift certificate that entitles the bearer to a specified dollar amount that can be applied towards a future meal. The merchant fills in the certificate with the name of the certificate holder and the amount of the certificate. The certificate falls within the exclusion in § 1005.20(b)(5) because it is issued in paper form only.</P>
            <P>ii. A merchant allows a consumer to prepay for a good or service, such as a car wash or time at a parking meter, and issues a paper receipt bearing a numerical or bar code that the consumer may redeem to obtain the good or service. The exclusion in § 1005.20(b)(5) applies because the code is issued in paper form only.</P>
            <P>iii. A merchant issues a paper certificate or receipt bearing a bar code or certificate number that can later be scanned or entered into the merchant's system and redeemed by the certificate or receipt holder towards the purchase of goods or services. The bar code or certificate number is not issued by the merchant in any form other than paper. The exclusion in § 1005.20(b)(5) applies because the bar code or certificate number is issued in paper form only.</P>
            <P>iv. An online merchant electronically provides a bar code, card or certificate number, or certificate or coupon to a consumer that the consumer may print on a home printer and later redeem towards the purchase of goods or services. The exclusion in § 1005.20(b)(5) does not apply because the bar code or card or certificate number was issued to the consumer in electronic form, even though it can be reproduced or otherwise printed on paper by the consumer.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Paragraph 20(b)(6)</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Exclusion explained.</E> The exclusion for cards, codes, or other devices that are redeemable solely for admission to events or venues at a particular location or group of affiliated locations generally applies to cards, codes, or other devices that are not redeemed for a specified monetary value, but rather solely for admission or entry to an event or venue. The exclusion also covers a card, code, or other device that is usable to purchase goods or services in addition to entry into the event or the venue, either at the event or venue or at an affiliated location or location in geographic proximity to the event or venue.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Examples.</E> The following examples illustrate the application of the exclusion in § 1005.20(b)(6):<PRTPAGE P="260"/>
            </P>

            <P>i. A consumer purchases a prepaid card that entitles the holder to a ticket for entry to an amusement park. The prepaid card may only be used for entry to the park. The card qualifies for the exclusion in § 1005.20(b)(6) because it is redeemable for admission or entry and for goods or services in conjunction with that admission. In addition, if the prepaid card does not have a monetary value, and therefore is not “issued in a specified amount,” the card does not meet the definitions of “gift certificate,” “store gift card,” or “general-use prepaid card” in § 1005.20(a). <E T="03">See</E> comment 20(a)-3.</P>
            <P>ii. Same facts as in i., except that the gift card also entitles the holder of the gift card to a dollar amount that can be applied towards the purchase of food and beverages or goods or services at the park or at nearby affiliated locations. The card qualifies for the exclusion in § 1005.20(b)(6) because it is redeemable for admission or entry and for goods or services in conjunction with that admission.</P>
            <P>iii. A consumer purchases a $25 gift card that the holder of the gift card can use to make purchases at a merchant, or, alternatively, can apply towards the cost of admission to the merchant's affiliated amusement park. The card is not eligible for the exclusion in § 1005.20(b)(6) because it is not redeemable solely for the admission or ticket itself (or for goods and services purchased in conjunction with such admission). The card meets the definition of “store gift card” and is therefore subject to § 1005.20, unless a different exclusion applies.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">20(c) Form of Disclosures</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">20(c)(1) Clear and Conspicuous</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Clear and conspicuous standard.</E> All disclosures required by this section must be clear and conspicuous. Disclosures are clear and conspicuous for purposes of this section if they are readily understandable and, in the case of written and electronic disclosures, the location and type size are readily noticeable to consumers. Disclosures need not be located on the front of the certificate or card, except where otherwise required, to be considered clear and conspicuous. Disclosures are clear and conspicuous for the purposes of this section if they are in a print that contrasts with and is otherwise not obstructed by the background on which they are printed. For example, disclosures on a card or computer screen are not likely to be conspicuous if obscured by a logo printed in the background. Similarly, disclosures on the back of a card that are printed on top of indentations from embossed type on the front of the card are not likely to be conspicuous if the indentations obstruct the readability of the disclosures. To the extent permitted, oral disclosures meet the standard when they are given at a volume and speed sufficient for a consumer to hear and comprehend them.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Abbreviations and symbols.</E> Disclosures may contain commonly accepted or readily understandable abbreviations or symbols, such as “mo.” for month or a “/” to indicate “per.” Under the clear and conspicuous standard, it is sufficient to state, for example, that a particular fee is charged “$2.50/mo. after 12 mos.”</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">20(c)(2) Format</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Electronic disclosures.</E> Disclosures provided electronically pursuant to this section are not subject to compliance with the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act) (15 U.S.C. 7001 <E T="03">et seq.).</E> Electronic disclosures must be in a retainable form. For example, a person may satisfy the requirement if it provides an online disclosure in a format that is capable of being printed. Electronic disclosures may not be provided through a hyperlink or in another manner by which the purchaser can bypass the disclosure. A person is not required to confirm that the consumer has read the electronic disclosures.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">20(c)(3) Disclosure Prior to Purchase</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Method of purchase.</E> The disclosures required by this paragraph must be provided before a certificate or card is purchased regardless of whether the certificate or card is purchased in person, online, by telephone, or by other means.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Electronic disclosures.</E> Section 1005.20(c)(3) provides that the disclosures required by this section must be provided to the consumer prior to purchase. For certificates or cards purchased electronically, disclosures made to the consumer after a consumer has initiated an online purchase of a certificate or card, but prior to completing the purchase of the certificate or card, would satisfy the prior-to-purchase requirement. However, electronic disclosures made available on a person's Web site that may or may not be accessed by the consumer are not provided to the consumer and therefore would not satisfy the prior-to-purchase requirement.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Non-physical certificates and cards.</E> If no physical certificate or card is issued, the disclosures must be provided to the consumer before the certificate or card is purchased. For example, where a gift certificate or card is a code that is provided by telephone, the required disclosures may be provided orally prior to purchase. <E T="03">See also</E> § 1005.20(c)(2).</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">20(c)(4) Disclosures on the Certificate or Card</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Non-physical certificates and cards.</E> If no physical certificate or card is issued, the disclosures required by this paragraph must be disclosed on the code, confirmation, or other written or electronic document provided to <PRTPAGE P="261"/>the consumer. For example, where a gift certificate or card is a code or confirmation that is provided to a consumer online or sent to a consumer's email address, the required disclosures may be provided electronically on the same document as the code or confirmation.2. <E T="03">No disclosures on a certificate or card.</E> Disclosures required by § 1005.20(c)(4) need not be made on a certificate or card if it is accompanied by a certificate or card that complies with this section. For example, a person may issue or sell a supplemental gift card that is smaller than a standard size and that does not bear the applicable disclosures if it is accompanied by a fully compliant certificate or card. <E T="03">See also</E> comment 20(c)(2)-2.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">20(d) Prohibition on Imposition of Fees or Charges</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">One-year period.</E> Section 1005.20(d) provides that a person may impose a dormancy, inactivity, or service fee only if there has been no activity with respect to a certificate or card for one year. The following examples illustrate this rule:</P>
            <P>i. A certificate or card is purchased on January 15 of year one. If there has been no activity on the certificate or card since the certificate or card was purchased, a dormancy, inactivity, or service fee may be imposed on the certificate or card on January 15 of year two.</P>

            <P>ii. Same facts as i., and a fee was imposed on January 15 of year two. Because no more than one dormancy, inactivity, or service fee may be imposed in any given calendar month, the earliest date that another dormancy, inactivity, or service fee may be imposed, assuming there continues to be no activity on the certificate or card, is February 1 of year two. A dormancy, inactivity, or service fee is permitted to be imposed on February 1 of year two because there has been no activity on the certificate or card for the preceding year (February 1 of year one through January 31 of year two), and February is a new calendar month. The imposition of a fee on January 15 of year two is not activity for purposes of § 1005.20(d). <E T="03">See</E> comment 20(a)(7)-1.</P>
            <P>iii. Same facts as i., and a fee was imposed on January 15 of year two. On January 31 of year two, the consumer uses the card to make a purchase. Another dormancy, inactivity, or service fee could not be imposed until January 31 of year three, assuming there has been no activity on the certificate or card since January 31 of year two.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Relationship between §§ 1005.20(d)(2) and (c)(3).</E> Sections 1005.20(d)(2) and (c)(3) contain similar, but not identical, disclosure requirements. Section 1005.20(d)(2) requires the disclosure of dormancy, inactivity, and service fees on a certificate or card. Section 1005.20(c)(3) requires that vendor person that issues or sells such certificate or card disclose to a consumer any dormancy, inactivity, and service fees associated with the certificate or card before such certificate or card may be purchased. Depending on the context, a single disclosure that meets the clear and conspicuous requirements of both §§ 1005.20(d)(2) and (c)(3) may be used to disclose a dormancy, inactivity, or service fee. For example, if the disclosures on a certificate or card, required by § 1005.20(d)(2), are visible to the consumer without having to remove packaging or other materials sold with the certificate or card, for a purchase made in person, the disclosures also meet the requirements of § 1005.20(c)(3). Otherwise, a dormancy, inactivity, or service fee may need to be disclosed multiple times to satisfy the requirements of §§ 1005.20(d)(2) and (c)(3). For example, if the disclosures on a certificate or card, required by § 1005.20(d)(2), are obstructed by packaging sold with the certificate or card, for a purchase made in person, they also must be disclosed on the packaging sold with the certificate or card to meet the requirements of § 1005.20(c)(3).</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Relationship between §§ 1005.20(d)(2), (e)(3), and (f)(2).</E> In addition to any disclosures required under § 1005.20(d)(2), any applicable disclosures under §§ 1005.20(e)(3) and (f)(2) of this section must also be provided on the certificate or card.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">One fee per month.</E> Under § 1005.20(d)(3), no more than one dormancy, inactivity, or service fee may be imposed in any given calendar month. For example, if a dormancy fee is imposed on January 1, following a year of inactivity, and a consumer makes a balance inquiry on January 15, a balance inquiry fee may not be imposed at that time because a dormancy fee was already imposed earlier that month and a balance inquiry fee is a type of service fee. If, however, the dormancy fee could be imposed on January 1, following a year of inactivity, and the consumer makes a balance inquiry on the same date, the person assessing the fees may choose whether to impose the dormancy fee or the balance inquiry fee on January 1. The restriction in § 1005.20(d)(3) does not apply to any fee that is not a dormancy, inactivity, or service fee. For example, assume a service fee is imposed on a general-use prepaid card on January 1, following a year of inactivity. If a consumer cashes out the remaining funds by check on January 15, a cash-out fee, to the extent such cash-out fee is permitted under § 1005.20(e)(4), may be imposed at that time because a cash-out fee is not a dormancy, inactivity, or service fee.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Accumulation of fees.</E> Section 1005.20(d) prohibits the accumulation of dormancy, inactivity, or service fees for previous periods into a single fee because such a practice would circumvent the limitation in § 1005.20(d)(3) that only one fee may be charged per month. For example, if a consumer purchases and activates a store gift <PRTPAGE P="262"/>card on January 1 but never uses the card, a monthly maintenance fee of $2.00 a month may not be accumulated such that a fee of $24 is imposed on January 1 the following year.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">20(e) Prohibition on Sale of Gift Certificates or Cards With Expiration Dates</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Reasonable opportunity.</E> Under § 1005.20(e)(1), no person may sell or issue a gift certificate, store gift card, or general-use prepaid card with an expiration date, unless there are policies and procedures in place to provide consumers with a reasonable opportunity to purchase a certificate or card with at least five years remaining until the certificate or card expiration date. Consumers are deemed to have a reasonable opportunity to purchase a certificate or card with at least five years remaining until the certificate or card expiration date if:</P>
            <P>i. There are policies and procedures established to prevent the sale of a certificate or card unless the certificate or card expiration date is at least five years after the date the certificate or card was sold or initially issued to a consumer; or</P>
            <P>ii. A certificate or card is available to consumers to purchase five years and six months before the certificate or card expiration date.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Applicability to replacement certificates or cards.</E> Section 1005.20(e)(1) applies solely to the <E T="03">purchase</E> of a certificate or card. Therefore, § 1005.20(e)(1) does not apply to the replacement of such certificates or cards. Certificates or cards issued as a replacement may bear a certificate or card expiration date of less than five years from the date of issuance of the replacement certificate or card. If the certificate or card expiration date for a replacement certificate or card is later than the date set forth in § 1005.20(e)(2)(i), then pursuant to § 1005.20(e)(2), the expiration date for the underlying funds at the time the replacement certificate or card is issued must be no earlier than the expiration date for the replacement certificate or card. For purposes of § 1005.20(e)(2), funds are not considered to be loaded to a store gift card or general-use prepaid card solely because a replacement card has been issued or activated for use.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Disclosure of funds expiration—date not required.</E> Section 1005.20(e)(3)(i) does not require disclosure of the precise date the funds will expire. It is sufficient to disclose, for example, “Funds expire 5 years from the date funds last loaded to the card.”; “Funds can be used 5 years from the date money was last added to the card.”; or “Funds do not expire.”</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Disclosure not required if no expiration date.</E> If the certificate or card and underlying funds do not expire, the disclosure required by § 1005.20(e)(3)(i) need not be stated on the certificate or card. If the certificate or card and underlying funds expire at the same time, only one expiration date need be disclosed on the certificate or card.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Reference to toll-free telephone number and Web site.</E> If a certificate or card does not expire, or if the underlying funds are not available after the certificate or card expires, the disclosure required by § 1005.20(e)(3)(ii) need not be stated on the certificate or card. <E T="03">See, however,</E> § 1005.20(f)(2).</P>
            <P>6. <E T="03">Relationship to § 226.20(f)(2).</E> The same toll-free telephone number and Web site may be used to comply with §§ 226.20(e)(3)(ii) and (f)(2). Neither a toll-free number nor a Web site must be maintained or disclosed if no fees are imposed in connection with a certificate or card, and the certificate or card and the underlying funds do not expire.</P>
            <P>7. <E T="03">Distinguishing between certificate or card expiration and funds expiration.</E> If applicable, a disclosure must be made on the certificate or card that notifies a consumer that the certificate or card expires, but the funds either do not expire or expire later than the certificate or card, and that the consumer may contact the issuer for a replacement card. The disclosure must be made with equal prominence and in close proximity to the certificate or card expiration date. The close proximity requirement does not apply to oral disclosures. In the case of a certificate or card, close proximity means that the disclosure must be on the same side as the certificate or card expiration date. For example, if the disclosure is the same type size and is located immediately next to or directly above or below the certificate or card expiration date, without any intervening text or graphical displays, the disclosures would be deemed to be equally prominent and in close proximity. The disclosure need not be embossed on the certificate or card to be deemed equally prominent, even if the expiration date is embossed on the certificate or card. The disclosure may state on the front of the card, for example, “Funds expire after card. Call for replacement card.” or “Funds do not expire. Call for new card after 09/2016.” Disclosures made pursuant to § 1005.20(e)(3)(iii)(A) may also fulfill the requirements of § 1005.20(e)(3)(i). For example, making a disclosure that “Funds do not expire” to comply with § 1005.20(e)(3)(iii)(A) also fulfills the requirements of § 1005.20(e)(3)(i).</P>
            <P>8. <E T="03">Expiration date safe harbor.</E> A non-reloadable certificate or card that bears an expiration date that is at least seven years from the date of manufacture need not state the disclosure required by § 1005.20(e)(3)(iii). However, § 1005.20(e)(1) still prohibits the sale or issuance of such certificate or card unless there are policies and procedures in place to provide a consumer with a reasonable opportunity to purchase the certificate or card with at least five years remaining until the <PRTPAGE P="263"/>certificate or card expiration date. In addition, under § 1005.20(e)(2), the funds may not expire before the certificate or card expiration date, even if the expiration date of the certificate or card bears an expiration date that is more than five years from the date of purchase. For purposes of this safe harbor, the date of manufacture is the date on which the certificate or card expiration date is printed on the certificate or card.</P>
            <P>9. <E T="03">Relationship between §§ 1005.20(d)(2), (e)(3), and (f)(2).</E> In addition to any disclosures required to be made under § 1005.20(e)(3), any applicable disclosures under §§ 1005.20(d)(2) and (f)(2) must also be provided on the certificate or card.</P>
            <P>10. <E T="03">Replacement or remaining balance of an expired certificate or card.</E> When a certificate or card expires, but the underlying funds have not expired, an issuer, at its option in accordance with applicable state law, may provide either a replacement certificate or card or otherwise provide the certificate or card holder, for example, by check, with the remaining balance on the certificate or card. In either case, the issuer may not charge a fee for the service.</P>
            <P>11. <E T="03">Replacement of a lost or stolen certificate or card not required.</E> Section 1005.20(e)(4) does not require the replacement of a certificate or card that has been lost or stolen.</P>
            <P>12. <E T="03">Date of issuance or loading.</E> For purposes of § 1005.20(e)(2)(i), a certificate or card is not issued or loaded with funds until the certificate or card is activated for use.</P>
            <P>13. <E T="03">Application of expiration date provisions after redemption of certificate or card.</E> The requirement that funds underlying a certificate or card must not expire for at least five years from the date of issuance or date of last load ceases to apply once the certificate or card has been fully redeemed, even if the underlying funds are not used to contemporaneously purchase a specific good or service. For example, some certificates or cards can be used to purchase music, media, or virtual goods. Once redeemed by a consumer, the entire balance on the certificate or card is debited from the certificate or card and credited or transferred to another “account” established by the merchant of such goods or services. The consumer can then make purchases of songs, media, or virtual goods from the merchant using that “account” either at the time the value is transferred from the certificate or card or at a later time. Under these circumstances, once the card has been fully redeemed and the “account” credited with the amount of the underlying funds, the five-year minimum expiration term no longer applies to the underlying funds. However, if the consumer only partially redeems the value of the certificate or card, the five-year minimum expiration term requirement continues to apply to the funds remaining on the certificate or card.</P>

            <P>1. <E T="03">Reference to toll-free telephone number and Web site.</E> If a certificate or card does not have any fees, the disclosure under § 1005.20(f)(2) is not required on the certificate or card. <E T="03">See, however,</E> § 1005.20(e)(3)(ii).</P>

            <P>1. <E T="03">Period of eligibility for loyalty, award, or promotional programs.</E> For purposes of § 1005.20(g)(2), the period of eligibility is the time period during which a consumer must engage in a certain action or actions to meet the terms of eligibility for a loyalty, award, or promotional program and obtain the card, code, or other device. Under § 1005.20(g)(2), a gift card issued pursuant to a loyalty, award, or promotional program that began prior to August 22, 2010 need not state the disclosures in § 1005.20(a)(4)(iii) regardless of whether the consumer became eligible to receive the gift card prior to August 22, 2010, or after that date. For example, a product manufacturer may provide a $20 rebate card to a consumer if the consumer purchases a particular product and submits a fully completed entry between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2010. Similarly, a merchant may provide a $20 gift card to a consumer if the consumer makes $200 worth of qualifying purchases between June 1, 2010 and October 30, 2010. Under both examples, gift cards provided pursuant to these loyalty, award, or promotional programs need not state the disclosures in § 1005.20(a)(4)(iii) to qualify for the exclusion in § 1005.20(b)(3) for loyalty, award, or promotional gift cards because the period of eligibility for each program began prior to August 22, 2010.</P>

            <P>3. <E T="03">Short hours.</E> A provider may determine, at its election, whether an abbreviated day is a business day. For example, if a provider engages in substantially all business functions until noon on Saturdays instead of its usual 3 p.m. closing, it may consider Saturday a business day.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Telephone line.</E> If a provider makes a telephone line available on Sundays for cancelling the transfer, but performs no other business functions, Sunday is not a business day under the “substantially all business functions” standard.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">30(c) Designated Recipient</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Person.</E> A designated recipient can be either a natural person or an organization, such as a corporation. <E T="03">See</E> § 1005.2(j) (definition of person). The designated recipient is identified by the name of the person provided by the sender to the remittance transfer provider and disclosed by the provider to the sender pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(iii).</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Location in a foreign country.</E> i. A remittance transfer is received at a location in a foreign country if funds are to be received at a location physically outside of any State, as defined in § 1005.2(l). A specific pick-up location need not be designated for funds to be received at a location in a foreign country. If it is specified that the funds will be transferred to a foreign country to be picked up by the designated recipient, the transfer will be received at a location in a foreign country, even though a specific pick-up location within that country has not been designated. If it is specified that the funds will be received at a location on a U.S. military installation that is physically located in a foreign country, the transfer will be received in a State.</P>
            <P>ii. For transfers to a designated recipient's account, whether funds are to be received at a location physically outside of any State depends on where the recipient's account is located. If the account is located in a State, the funds will not be received at a location in a foreign country. Accounts that are located on a U.S. military installation that is physically located in a foreign country are located in a State.</P>

            <P>iii. Where the sender does not specify information about a designated recipient's account, but instead provides information about the recipient, a remittance transfer provider may make the determination of whether the funds will be received at a location in a foreign country on information that is provided by the sender, and other information the provider may have, at the time the transfer is requested. For example, if a consumer in a State gives a provider the recipient's email address, and the provider has no other information about whether the funds will be received by the recipient at a location in a foreign country, then the provider may determine that funds are not to be received at a location in a foreign country. However, if the provider at the time the transfer is requested has additional information indicating that funds are to be received <PRTPAGE P="265"/>in a foreign country, such as if the recipient's email address is already registered with the provider and associated with a foreign account, then the provider has sufficient information to conclude that the remittance transfer will be received at a location in a foreign country. Similarly, if a consumer in a State purchases a prepaid card, and the provider mails or delivers the card directly to the consumer, the provider may conclude that funds are not to be received in a foreign country, because the provider does not know whether the consumer will subsequently send the prepaid card to a recipient in a foreign country. In contrast, the provider has sufficient information to conclude that the funds are to be received in a foreign country if the remittance transfer provider sends a prepaid card to a specified recipient in a foreign country, even if a person located in a State, including the sender, retains the ability to access funds on the prepaid card.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Sender as designated recipient.</E> A “sender,” as defined in § 1005.30(g), may also be a designated recipient if the sender meets the definition of “designated recipient” in § 1005.30(c). For example, a sender may request that a provider send an electronic transfer of funds from the sender's checking account in a State to the sender's checking account located in a foreign country. In this case, the sender would also be a designated recipient.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">30(d) Preauthorized Remittance Transfer</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Advance authorization.</E> A preauthorized remittance transfer is a remittance transfer authorized in advance of a transfer that will take place on a recurring basis, at substantially regular intervals, and will require no further action by the consumer to initiate the transfer. In a bill-payment system, for example, if the consumer authorizes a remittance transfer provider to make monthly payments to a payee by means of a remittance transfer, and the payments take place without further action by the consumer, the payments are preauthorized remittance transfers. In contrast, if the consumer must take action each month to initiate a transfer (such as by entering instructions on a telephone or home computer), the payments are not preauthorized remittance transfers.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">30(e) Remittance Transfer</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Electronic transfer of funds.</E> The definition of “remittance transfer” requires an electronic transfer of funds. The term electronic has the meaning given in section 106(2) of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act. There may be an electronic transfer of funds if a provider makes an electronic book entry between different settlement accounts to effectuate the transfer. However, where a sender mails funds directly to a recipient, or provides funds to a courier for delivery to a foreign country, there is not an electronic transfer of funds. Similarly, generally, where a provider issues a check, draft, or other paper instrument to be mailed to a person abroad, there is not an electronic transfer of funds. Nonetheless, an electronic transfer of funds occurs for a payment made by a provider under a bill-payment service available to a consumer via computer or other electronic means, unless the terms of the bill-payment service explicitly state that all payments, or all payments to a particular payee or payees, will be solely by check, draft, or similar paper instrument drawn on the consumer's account to be mailed abroad, and the payee or payees that will be paid in this manner are identified to the consumer. With respect to such a bill-payment service, if a provider provides a check, draft or similar paper instrument drawn on a consumer's account to be mailed abroad for a payee that is not identified to the consumer as described above, this payment by check, draft or similar payment instrument will be an electronic transfer of funds.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Sent by a remittance transfer provider.</E> i. The definition of “remittance transfer” requires that a transfer be “sent by a remittance transfer provider.” This means that there must be an intermediary that is directly engaged with the sender to send an electronic transfer of funds on behalf of the sender to a designated recipient.</P>
            <P>ii. A payment card network or other third party payment service that is functionally similar to a payment card network does not send a remittance transfer when a consumer provides a debit, credit or prepaid card directly to a foreign merchant as payment for goods or services. In such a case, the payment card network or third party payment service is not directly engaged with the sender to send a transfer of funds to a person in a foreign country; rather, the network or third party payment service is merely providing contemporaneous third-party payment processing and settlement services on behalf of the merchant or the card issuer, rather than on behalf of the sender. In such a case, the card issuer also is not directly engaged with the sender to send an electronic transfer of funds to the foreign merchant when the card issuer provides payment to the merchant. Similarly, where a consumer provides a checking or other account number, or a debit, credit or prepaid card, directly to a foreign merchant as payment for goods or services, the merchant is not acting as an intermediary that sends a transfer of funds on behalf of the sender when it submits the payment information for processing.</P>

            <P>iii. However, a card issuer or a payment network may offer a service to a sender where the card issuer or a payment network is an intermediary that is directly engaged with the sender to obtain funds using the sender's debit, prepaid or credit card and to <PRTPAGE P="266"/>send those funds to a recipient's checking account located in a foreign country. In this case, the card issuer or the payment network is an intermediary that is directly engaged with the sender to send an electronic transfer of funds on behalf of the sender, and this transfer of funds is a remittance transfer because it is made to a designated recipient. <E T="03">See</E> comment 30(c)-2.ii.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Examples of remittance transfers.</E>
            </P>
            <P>i. Examples of remittance transfers include:</P>
            <P>A. Transfers where the sender provides cash or another method of payment to a money transmitter or financial institution and requests that funds be sent to a specified location or account in a foreign country.</P>
            <P>B. Consumer wire transfers, where a financial institution executes a payment order upon a sender's request to wire money from the sender's account to a designated recipient.</P>
            <P>C. An addition of funds to a prepaid card by a participant in a prepaid card program, such as a prepaid card issuer or its agent, that is directly engaged with the sender to add these funds, where the prepaid card is sent or was previously sent by a participant in the prepaid card program to a person in a foreign country, even if a person located in a State (including a sender) retains the ability to withdraw such funds.</P>
            <P>D. International ACH transactions sent by the sender's financial institution at the sender's request.</P>
            <P>E. Online bill payments and other electronic transfers that a sender schedules in advance, including preauthorized remittance transfers, made by the sender's financial institution at the sender's request to a designated recipient.</P>
            <P>ii. The term remittance transfer does not include, for example:</P>

            <P>A. A consumer's provision of a debit, credit or prepaid card, directly to a foreign merchant as payment for goods or services because the issuer is not directly engaged with the sender to send an electronic transfer of funds to the foreign merchant when the issuer provides payment to the merchant. <E T="03">See</E> comment 30(e)-2.</P>

            <P>B. A consumer's deposit of funds to a checking or savings account located in a State, because there has not been a transfer of funds to a designated recipient. <E T="03">See</E> comment 30(c)-2.ii.</P>

            <P>C. Online bill payments and other electronic transfers that senders can schedule in advance, including preauthorized transfers, made through the Web site of a merchant located in a foreign country and via direct provision of a checking account, credit card, debit card or prepaid card number to the merchant, because the financial institution is not directly engaged with the sender to send an electronic transfer of funds to the foreign merchant when the institution provides payment to the merchant. <E T="03">See</E> comment 30(e)-2.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">30(f) Remittance Transfer Provider</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Agents.</E> A person is not deemed to be acting as a remittance transfer provider when it performs activities as an agent on behalf of a remittance transfer provider.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Normal course of business.</E> i. <E T="03">General.</E> Whether a person provides remittance transfers in the normal course of business depends on the facts and circumstances, including the total number and frequency of remittance transfers sent by the provider. For example, if a financial institution generally does not make remittance transfers available to customers, but sends a couple of such transfers in a given year as an accommodation for a customer, the institution does not provide remittance transfers in the normal course of business. In contrast, if a financial institution makes remittance transfers generally available to customers (whether described in the institution's deposit account agreement, or in practice) and makes transfers many times per month, the institution provides remittance transfers in the normal course of business.</P>
            <P>ii. <E T="03">Safe harbor.</E> Under § 1005.30(f)(2)(i), a person that provided 100 or fewer remittance transfers in the previous calendar year and provides 100 or fewer remittance transfers in the current calendar year is deemed not to be providing remittance transfers in the normal course of its business. Accordingly, a person that qualifies for the safe harbor in § 1005.30(f)(2)(i) is not a “remittance transfer provider” and is not subject to the requirements of subpart B. For purposes of determining whether a person qualifies for the safe harbor under § 1005.30(f)(2)(i), the number of remittance transfers provided includes any transfers excluded from the definition of “remittance transfer” due simply to the safe harbor. In contrast, the number of remittance transfers provided does not include any transfers that are excluded from the definition of “remittance transfer” for reasons other than the safe harbor, such as small value transactions or securities and commodities transfers that are excluded from the definition of “remittance transfer” by § 1005.30(e)(2).</P>
            <P>iii. <E T="03">Transition period.</E> A person may cease to satisfy the requirements of the safe harbor described in § 1005.30(f)(2)(i) if the person provides in excess of 100 remittance transfers in a calendar year. For example, if a person that provided 100 or fewer remittance transfers in the previous calendar year provides more than 100 remittance transfers in the current calendar year, the safe harbor applies to the first 100 remittance transfers that the person provides in the current calendar year. For any additional remittance transfers provided in the current calendar <PRTPAGE P="267"/>year and for any remittance transfers provided in the subsequent calendar year, whether the person provides remittance transfers for a consumer in the normal course of its business, as defined in § 1005.30(f)(1), and is thus a remittance transfer provider for those additional transfers, depends on the facts and circumstances. Section 1005.30(f)(2)(ii) provides a reasonable period of time, not to exceed six months, for such a person to begin complying with subpart B, if that person is then providing remittance transfers in the normal course of its business. At the end of that reasonable period of time, such person would be required to comply with subpart B unless, based on the facts and circumstances, the person is not a remittance transfer provider.</P>
            <P>iv. <E T="03">Example of safe harbor and transition period.</E> Assume that a person provided 90 remittance transfers in 2012 and 90 such transfers in 2013. The safe harbor will apply to the person's transfers in 2013, as well as the person's first 100 remittance transfers in 2014. However, if the person provides a 101st transfer on September 5, the facts and circumstances determine whether the person provides remittance transfers in the normal course of business and is thus a remittance transfer provider for the 101st and any subsequent remittance transfers that it provides in 2014. Furthermore, the person would not qualify for the safe harbor described in § 1005.30(f)(2)(i) in 2015 because the person did not provide 100 or fewer remittance transfers in 2014. However, for the 101st remittance transfer provided in 2014, as well as additional remittance transfers provided thereafter in 2014 and 2015, if that person is then providing remittance transfers for a consumer in the normal course of business, the person will have a reasonable period of time, not to exceed six months, to come into compliance with subpart B. Assume that in this case, a reasonable period of time is six months. Thus, compliance with subpart B is not required for remittance transfers made on or before March 5, 2015 (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> six months after September 5, 2014). After March 5, 2015, the person is required to comply with subpart B if, based on the facts and circumstances, the person provides remittance transfers in the normal course of business and is thus a remittance transfer provider.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Multiple remittance transfer providers.</E> If the remittance transfer involves more than one remittance transfer provider, only one set of disclosures must be given, and the remittance transfer providers must agree among themselves which provider must take the actions necessary to comply with the requirements that subpart B imposes on any or all of them. Even though the providers must designate one provider to take the actions necessary to comply with the requirements that subpart B imposes on any or all of them, all remittance transfer providers involved in the remittance transfer remain responsible for compliance with the applicable provisions of the EFTA and Regulation E.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">30(g) Sender</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Determining whether a consumer is located in a State.</E> Under § 1005.30(g), the definition of “sender” means a consumer in a State who, primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, requests a remittance transfer provider to send a remittance transfer to a designated recipient. A sender located on a U.S. military installation that is physically located in a foreign country is located in a State. For transfers from a consumer's account, whether a consumer is located in a State depends on where the consumer's account is located. If the account is located in a State, the consumer will be located in a State for purposes of the definition of “sender” in § 1005.30(g), notwithstanding comment 3(a)-3. Accounts that are located on a U.S. military installation that is physically located in a foreign country are located in a State. Where a transfer is requested electronically or by telephone and the transfer is not from an account, the provider may make the determination of whether a consumer is located in a State based on information that is provided by the consumer and on any records associated with the consumer that the provider may have, such as an address provided by the consumer.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Personal, family, or household purposes.</E> Under § 1005.30(g), a consumer is a “sender” only where he or she requests a transfer primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. A consumer who requests a transfer primarily for other purposes, such as business or commercial purposes, is not a sender under § 1005.30(g). For transfers from an account that was established primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, a remittance transfer provider may generally deem that the transfer is requested primarily for personal, family, or household purposes and the consumer is therefore a “sender” under § 1005.30(g). But if the consumer indicates that he or she is requesting the transfer primarily for other purposes, such as business or commercial purposes, then the consumer is not a sender under § 1005.30(g), even if the consumer is requesting the transfer from an account that is used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Non-consumer accounts.</E> A provider may deem that a transfer that is requested to be sent from an account that was not established primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, such as an account that was established as a business or commercial account or an account held by a business entity such as a corporation, not-for-profit corporation, professional corporation, limited <PRTPAGE P="268"/>liability company, partnership, or sole proprietorship, as not being requested primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. A consumer requesting a transfer from such an account therefore is not a sender under § 1005.30(g). Additionally, a transfer that is requested to be sent from an account held by a financial institution under a <E T="03">bona fide</E> trust agreement pursuant to § 1005.2(b)(3) is not requested primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, and a consumer requesting a transfer from such an account is therefore not a sender under § 1005.30(g).</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">30(h) Third-Party Fees</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Fees imposed on the remittance transfer.</E> Fees imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the remittance transfer provider include only those fees that are charged to the designated recipient and are specifically related to the remittance transfer. For example, overdraft fees that are imposed by a recipient's bank or funds that are garnished from the proceeds of a remittance transfer to satisfy an unrelated debt are not fees imposed on the remittance transfer because these charges are not specifically related to the remittance transfer. Account fees are also not specifically related to a remittance transfer if such fees are merely assessed based on general account activity and not for receiving transfers. Where an incoming remittance transfer results in a balance increase that triggers a monthly maintenance fee, that fee is not specifically related to a remittance transfer. Similarly, fees that banks charge one another for handling a remittance transfer or other fees that do not affect the total amount of the transaction or the amount that will be received by the designated recipient are not fees imposed on the remittance transfer. For example, an interchange fee that is charged to a provider when a sender uses a credit or debit card to pay for a remittance transfer is not a fee imposed upon the remittance transfer. Fees that specifically relate to a remittance transfer may be structured on a flat per-transaction basis, or may be conditioned on other factors (such as account status or the quantity of remittance transfers received) in addition to the remittance transfer itself. For example, where an institution charges an incoming transfer fee on most customers' accounts, but not on preferred accounts, such a fee is nonetheless specifically related to a remittance transfer. Similarly, if the institution assesses a fee for every transfer beyond the fifth received each month, such a fee would be specifically related to the remittance transfer regardless of how many remittance transfers preceded it that month.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Covered third-party fees.</E> i. Under § 1005.30(h)(1), a covered third-party fee means any fee that is imposed on the remittance transfer by a person other than the remittance transfer provider that is not a non-covered third-party fee.</P>
            <P>ii. Examples of covered third-party fees include:</P>
            <P>A. Fees imposed on a remittance transfer by intermediary institutions in connection with a wire transfer (sometimes referred to as “lifting fees”).</P>
            <P>B. Fees imposed on a remittance transfer by an agent of the provider at pick-up for receiving the transfer.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Non-covered third-party fees.</E> Under § 1005.30(h)(2), a non-covered third-party fee means any fee imposed by the designated recipient's institution for receiving a remittance transfer into an account except if such institution acts as the agent of the remittance transfer provider. For example, a fee imposed by the designated recipient's institution for receiving an incoming transfer into an account is a non-covered third-party fee, provided such institution is not acting as the agent of the remittance transfer provider. <E T="03">See also</E> comment 31(b)(1)(viii)-1. Furthermore, designated recipient's account in § 1005.30(h)(2) refers to an asset account, regardless of whether it is a consumer asset account, established for any purpose and held by a bank, savings association, credit union, or equivalent institution. A designated recipient's account does not, however, include a credit card, prepaid card, or a virtual account held by an Internet-based or mobile telephone company that is not a bank, savings association, credit union or equivalent institution.</P>

Oral disclosures as permitted by § 1005.31(a)(3), (4), and (5) are clear and conspicuous when they are given at a volume and speed sufficient for a sender to hear and comprehend them.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Abbreviations and symbols.</E> Disclosures may contain commonly accepted or readily understandable abbreviations or symbols, such as “USD” to indicate currency in U.S. dollars or “MXN” to indicate currency in Mexican pesos.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">31(a)(2) Written and Electronic Disclosures</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">E-Sign Act requirements.</E> If a sender electronically requests the remittance transfer provider to send a remittance transfer, the disclosures required by § 1005.31(b)(1) may be provided to the sender in electronic form without regard to the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the Electronic <PRTPAGE P="269"/>Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act) (15 U.S.C. 7001 <E T="03">et seq.</E>). If a sender electronically requests the provider to send a remittance transfer, the disclosures required by § 1005.31(b)(2) may be provided to the sender in electronic form, subject to compliance with the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the E-Sign Act. <E T="03">See</E> § 1005.4(a)(1).</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Paper size.</E> Written disclosures may be provided on any size paper, as long as the disclosures are clear and conspicuous. For example, disclosures may be provided on a register receipt or on an 8.5 inch by 11 inch sheet of paper.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Retainable electronic disclosures.</E> A remittance transfer provider may satisfy the requirement to provide electronic disclosures in a retainable form if it provides an online disclosure in a format that is capable of being printed. Electronic disclosures may not be provided through a hyperlink or in another manner by which the sender can bypass the disclosure. A provider is not required to confirm that the sender has read the electronic disclosures.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Pre-payment disclosures to a mobile telephone.</E> Disclosures provided via mobile application or text message, to the extent permitted by § 1005.31(a)(5), need not be retainable. However, disclosures provided electronically to a mobile telephone that are not provided via mobile application or text message must be retainable. For example, disclosures provided via email must be retainable, even if a sender accesses them by mobile telephone.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Disclosures provided by fax.</E> For purposes of disclosures required to be provided pursuant to § 1005.31 or § 1005.36, disclosures provided by facsimile transmission (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> fax) are considered to be provided in writing for purposes of providing disclosures in writing pursuant to subpart B and are not subject to the requirements for electronic disclosures set forth in § 1005.31(a)(2).</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">31(a)(3) Disclosures for Oral Telephone Transactions</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Transactions conducted partially by telephone.</E> Except as provided in comment 31(a)(3)-2, for transactions conducted partially by telephone, providing the information required by § 1005.31(b)(1) to a sender orally does not fulfill the requirement to provide the disclosures required by § 1005.31(b)(1). For example, a sender may begin a remittance transfer at a remittance transfer provider's dedicated telephone in a retail store, and then provide payment in person to a store clerk to complete the transaction. In such cases, all disclosures must be provided in writing. A provider complies with this requirement, for example, by providing the written pre-payment disclosure in person prior to the sender's payment for the transaction, and the written receipt when the sender pays for the transaction.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Oral telephone transactions.</E> Section 1005.31(a)(3) applies to transactions conducted orally and entirely by telephone, such as transactions conducted orally on a landline or mobile telephone. A remittance transfer provider may treat a written or electronic communication as an inquiry when it believes that treating the communication as a request would be impractical. For example, if a sender physically located abroad contacts a U.S. branch of the sender's financial institution and attempts to initiate a remittance transfer by first sending a mailed letter, further communication with the sender by letter may be impractical due to the physical distance and likely mail delays. In such circumstances, a provider may conduct the transaction orally and entirely by telephone pursuant to § 1005.31(a)(3) when the provider treats that initial communication as an inquiry and subsequently responds to the consumer's inquiry by calling the consumer on a telephone and orally gathering or confirming the information needed to identify and understand a request for a remittance transfer and otherwise conducts the transaction orally and entirely by telephone.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">31(a)(5) Disclosures for Mobile Application or Text Message Transactions</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Mobile application and text message transactions.</E> A remittance transfer provider may provide the required pre-payment disclosures orally or via mobile application or text message if the transaction is conducted entirely by telephone via mobile application or text message, the remittance transfer provider complies with the requirements of § 1005.31(g)(2), and the provider discloses orally or via mobile application or text message a statement about the rights of the sender regarding cancellation required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) pursuant to the timing requirements in § 1005.31(e)(1). For example, if a sender conducts a transaction via text message on a mobile telephone, the remittance transfer provider may call the sender and orally provide the required pre-payment disclosures. Alternatively, the provider may provide the required pre-payment disclosures via text message. Section 1005.31(a)(5) applies only to transactions conducted entirely by mobile telephone via mobile application or text message.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">31(b) Disclosure Requirements</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Disclosures provided as applicable.</E> Disclosures required by § 1005.31(b) need only be provided to the extent applicable. A remittance transfer provider may choose to omit an item of information required by § 1005.31(b) if it is inapplicable to a particular transaction. Alternatively, for disclosures <PRTPAGE P="270"/>required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(i) through (vii), a provider may disclose a term and state that an amount or item is “not applicable,” “N/A,” or “None.” For example, if fees or taxes are not imposed in connection with a particular transaction, the provider need not provide the disclosures about fees and taxes generally required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii), the disclosures about covered third-party fees generally required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi), or the disclaimers about non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected by a person other than the provider generally required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii). Similarly, a Web site need not be disclosed if the provider does not maintain a Web site. A provider need not provide the exchange rate disclosure required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) if a recipient receives funds in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded, or if funds are delivered into an account denominated in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded. For example, if a sender in the United States sends funds from an account denominated in Euros to an account in France denominated in Euros, no exchange rate would need to be provided. Similarly, if a sender funds a remittance transfer in U.S. dollars and requests that a remittance transfer be delivered to the recipient in U.S. dollars, a provider need not disclose an exchange rate.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Substantially similar terms, language, and notices.</E> Certain disclosures required by § 1005.31(b) must be described using the terms set forth in § 1005.31(b) or substantially similar terms. Terms may be more specific than those provided. For example, a remittance transfer provider sending funds may describe fees imposed by an agent at pick-up as “Pick-up Fees” in lieu of describing them as “Other Fees.” Foreign language disclosures required under § 1005.31(g) must contain accurate translations of the terms, language, and notices required by § 1005.31(b) or permitted by § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) and § 1005.33(h)(3).</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">31(b)(1) Pre-Payment Disclosures</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Fees and taxes.</E> i. Taxes collected on the remittance transfer by the remittance transfer provider include taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a State or other governmental body. A provider need only disclose fees imposed or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by the provider in § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii), as applicable. For example, if no transfer taxes are imposed on a remittance transfer, a provider would only disclose applicable transfer fees. <E T="03">See</E> comment 31(b)-1. If both fees and taxes are imposed, the fees and taxes must be disclosed as separate, itemized disclosures. For example, a provider would disclose all transfer fees using the term “Transfer Fees” or a substantially similar term and would separately disclose all transfer taxes using the term “Transfer Taxes” or a substantially similar term.</P>

            <P>ii. The fees and taxes required to be disclosed by § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) include all fees imposed and all taxes collected on the remittance transfer by the provider. For example, a provider must disclose any service fee, any fees imposed by an agent of the provider at the time of the transfer, and any State taxes collected on the remittance transfer at the time of the transfer. Fees imposed on the remittance transfer by the provider required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) include only those fees that are charged to the sender and are specifically related to the remittance transfer. <E T="03">See also</E> comment 30(h)-1. In contrast, the fees required to be disclosed by § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) are any covered third-party fees as defined in § 1005.30(h)(1).</P>
            <P>iii. The term used to describe the fees imposed on the remittance transfer by the provider in § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) and the term used to describe covered third-party fees under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) must differentiate between such fees. For example the terms used to describe fees disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii) and (vi) may not both be described solely as “Fees.”</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Transfer amount.</E> Sections 1005.31(b)(1)(i) and (v) require two transfer amount disclosures. First, under § 1005.31(b)(1)(i), a provider must disclose the transfer amount in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded to show the calculation of the total amount of the transaction. Typically, the remittance transfer is funded in U.S. dollars, so the transfer amount would be expressed in U.S. dollars. However, if the remittance transfer is funded, for example, from a Euro-denominated account, the transfer amount would be expressed in Euros. Second, under § 1005.31(b)(1)(v), a provider must disclose the transfer amount in the currency in which the funds will be made available to the designated recipient. For example, if the funds will be picked up by the designated recipient in Japanese yen, the transfer amount would be expressed in Japanese yen. However, this second transfer amount need not be disclosed if covered third-party fees as described under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) are not imposed on the remittance transfer. The terms used to describe each transfer amount should be the same.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Exchange rate for calculation.</E> The exchange rate used to calculate the transfer amount in § 1005.31(b)(1)(v), the covered third-party fees in § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi), the amount received in § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii), and the optional disclosures of non-covered third-party fees and other taxes permitted by § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) is the exchange rate in § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), including an estimated exchange rate to the extent permitted by § 1005.32, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate. For example, if one U.S. dollar <PRTPAGE P="271"/>exchanges for 11.9483779 Mexican pesos, a provider must calculate these disclosures using this rate, even though the provider may disclose pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) that the U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.9484 Mexican pesos. Similarly, if a provider estimates pursuant to § 1005.32 that one U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.9483 Mexican pesos, a provider must calculate these disclosures using this rate, even though the provider may disclose pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) that the U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.95 Mexican pesos (Estimated). If an exchange rate need not be rounded, a provider must use that exchange rate to calculate these disclosures. For example, if one U.S. dollar exchanges for exactly 11.9 Mexican pesos, a provider must calculate these disclosures using this exchange rate.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">31(b)(1)(iv) Exchange Rate</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Applicable exchange rate.</E> If the designated recipient will receive funds in a currency other than the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded, a remittance transfer provider must disclose the exchange rate to be used by the provider for the remittance transfer. An exchange rate that is estimated must be disclosed pursuant to the requirements of § 1005.32. A remittance transfer provider may not disclose, for example, that an exchange rate is “unknown,” “floating,” or “to be determined.” If a provider does not have specific knowledge regarding the currency in which the funds will be received, the provider may rely on a sender's representation as to the currency in which funds will be received for purposes of determining whether an exchange rate is applied to the transfer. For example, if a sender requests that a remittance transfer be deposited into an account in U.S. dollars, the provider need not disclose an exchange rate, even if the account is actually denominated in Mexican pesos and the funds are converted prior to deposit into the account. If a sender does not know the currency in which funds will be received, the provider may assume that the currency in which funds will be received is the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Rounding.</E> The exchange rate disclosed by the provider for the remittance transfer is required to be rounded. The provider may round to two, three, or four decimal places, at its option. For example, if one U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.9483779 Mexican pesos, a provider may disclose that the U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.9484 Mexican pesos. The provider may alternatively disclose, for example, that the U.S. dollar exchanges for 11.948 pesos or 11.95 pesos. On the other hand, if one U.S. dollar exchanges for exactly 11.9 Mexican pesos, the provider may disclose that “US$1 = 11.9 MXN” in lieu of, for example, “US$1 = 11.90 MXN.” The exchange rate disclosed for the remittance transfer must be rounded consistently for each currency. For example, a provider may not round to two decimal places for some transactions exchanged into Euros and round to four decimal places for other transactions exchanged into Euros.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Exchange rate used.</E> The exchange rate used by the provider for the remittance transfer need not be set by that provider. For example, an exchange rate set by an intermediary institution and applied to the remittance transfer would be the exchange rate used for the remittance transfer and must be disclosed by the provider.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">31(b)(1)(vi) Disclosure of Covered Third-Party Fees</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Fees disclosed in the currency in which the funds will be received.</E> Section 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) requires the disclosure of covered third-party fees in the currency in which the funds will be received by the designated recipient. A covered third-party fee described in § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) may be imposed in one currency, but the funds may be received by the designated recipient in another currency. In such cases, the remittance transfer provider must calculate the fee to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) in the currency of receipt using the exchange rate in § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), including an estimated exchange rate to the extent permitted by § 1005.32, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate. For example, an intermediary institution involved in sending an international wire transfer funded in U.S. dollars may impose a fee in U.S. dollars, but funds are ultimately deposited in the recipient's account in Euros. In this case, the provider would disclose the covered third-party fee to the sender expressed in Euros, calculated using the exchange rate disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv), prior to any rounding of the exchange rate. For purposes of § 1005.31(b)(1)(v), (vi), and (vii), if a provider does not have specific knowledge regarding the currency in which the funds will be received, the provider may rely on a sender's representation as to the currency in which funds will be received. For example, if a sender requests that a remittance transfer be deposited into an account in U.S. dollars, the provider may provide the disclosures required in § 1005.31(b)(1)(v), (vi), and (vii) in U.S. dollars, even if the account is actually denominated in Mexican pesos and the funds are subsequently converted prior to deposit into the account. If a sender does not know the currency in which funds will be received, the provider may assume that the currency in which funds will be received is the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded.<PRTPAGE P="272"/>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">31(b)(1)(vii) Amount Received</HD>
            <P>
              <E T="03">1. Amount received.</E> The remittance transfer provider is required to disclose the amount that will be received by the designated recipient in the currency in which the funds will be received. The amount received must reflect the exchange rate, all fees imposed and all taxes collected on the remittance transfer by the remittance transfer provider, as well as any covered third-party fees required to be disclosed by § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi). The disclosed amount received must be reduced by the amount of any fee or tax—except for a non-covered third-party fee or tax collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider—that is imposed on the remittance transfer that affects the amount received even if that amount is imposed or itemized separately from the transaction amount.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">31(b)(1)(viii) Statement When Additional Fees and Taxes May Apply</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Required disclaimer when non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected by a person other than the provider may apply.</E> If non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected by a person other than the provider apply to a particular remittance transfer or if a provider does not know if such fees or taxes may apply to a particular remittance transfer, § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) requires the provider to include the disclaimer with respect to such fees and taxes. Required disclosures under § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) may only be provided to the extent applicable. For example, if the designated recipient's institution is an agent of the provider and thus, non-covered third-party fees cannot apply to the transfer, the provider must disclose all fees imposed on the remittance transfer and may not provide the disclaimer regarding non-covered third-party fees. In this scenario, the provider may only provide the disclaimer regarding taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider, as applicable. <E T="03">See</E> Model Form A-30(c).</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Optional disclosure of non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected by a person other than the provider.</E> When a remittance transfer provider knows the non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider that will apply to a particular transaction, § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) permits the provider to disclose the amount of such fees and taxes. Section 1005.32(b)(3)-1 additionally permits a provider to disclose an estimate of such fees and taxes, provided any estimates are based on reasonable source of information. <E T="03">See</E> comment 32(b)(3). For example, a provider may know that the designated recipient's institution imposes an incoming wire fee for receiving a transfer. Alternatively, a provider may know that foreign taxes will be collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the remittance transfer provider. In these examples, the provider may choose, at its option, to disclose the amounts of the relevant recipient institution fee and tax as part of the information disclosed pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii). The provider must not include that fee or tax in the amount disclosed pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) or (b)(1)(vii). Fees and taxes disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) must be disclosed in the currency in which the funds will be received. <E T="03">See</E> comment 31(b)(1)(vi)-1. Estimates of any non-covered third-party fees and any taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider must be disclosed in accordance with § 1005.32(b)(3).</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">31(b)(2) Receipt</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Date funds will be available.</E> A remittance transfer provider does not comply with the requirements of § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) if it provides a range of dates that the remittance transfer may be available or an estimate of the date on which funds will be available. If a provider does not know the exact date on which funds will be available, the provider may disclose the latest date on which the funds will be available. For example, if funds may be available on January 3, but are not certain to be available until January 10, then a provider complies with § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) if it discloses January 10 as the date funds will be available. However, a remittance transfer provider may also disclose that funds “may be available sooner” or use a substantially similar term to inform senders that funds may be available to the designated recipient on a date earlier than the date disclosed. For example, a provider may disclose “January 10 (may be available sooner).”</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Agencies required to be disclosed.</E> A remittance transfer provider must only disclose information about a State agency that licenses or charters the remittance transfer provider with respect to the remittance transfer as applicable. For example, if a financial institution is solely regulated by a Federal agency, and not licensed or chartered by a State agency, then the institution need not disclose information about a State agency. A remittance transfer provider must disclose information about the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, whether or not the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is the provider's primary Federal regulator.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">State agency that licenses or charters a provider.</E> A remittance transfer provider must only disclose information about one State agency that licenses or charters the remittance transfer provider with respect to the remittance transfer, even if other State agencies also regulate the remittance transfer provider. For example, a provider may disclose information about the State agency <PRTPAGE P="273"/>which granted its license. If a provider is licensed in multiple States, and the State agency that licenses the provider with respect to the remittance transfer is determined by a sender's location, a provider may make the determination as to the State in which the sender is located based on information that is provided by the sender and on any records associated with the sender. For example, if the State agency that licenses the provider with respect to an online remittance transfer is determined by a sender's location, a provider could rely on the sender's statement regarding the State in which the sender is located and disclose the State agency that licenses the provider in that State. A State-chartered bank must disclose information about the State agency that granted its charter, regardless of the location of the sender.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Web site of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.</E> Section 1005.31(b)(2)(vi) requires a remittance transfer provider to disclose the name, toll-free telephone number(s), and Web site of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Providers may satisfy this requirement by disclosing the Web site of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's homepage, <E T="03">www.consumerfinance.gov,</E> as shown on Model Forms A-32, A-34, A-35, and A-39. Alternatively, providers may, but are not required to, disclose the Bureau's Web site as the address of a page on the Bureau's Web site that provides information for consumers about remittance transfers, currently, <E T="03">consumerfinance.gov/sending-money</E>, as shown on Model Form A-31. In addition, providers making disclosures in a language other than English pursuant to § 1005.31(g) may, but are not required to, disclose the Bureau's Web site as a page on the Bureau's Web site that provides information for consumers about remittance transfers in the relevant language, if such Web site exists. For example, a provider that is making disclosures in Spanish under § 1005.31(g) may, but is not required to, disclose the Bureau's Web site on Spanish-language disclosures as the page on the Bureau's Web site that provides information regarding remittance transfers in Spanish, currently <E T="03">consumerfinance.gov/envios.</E> This optional disclosure is shown on Model A-40. The Bureau will publish a list of any other foreign language Web sites that provide information regarding remittance transfers.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Date of transfer on receipt.</E> Where applicable, § 1005.31(b)(2)(vii) requires disclosure of the date of transfer for the remittance transfer that is the subject of a receipt required by § 1005.31(b)(2), including a receipt that is provided in accordance with the timing requirements in § 1005.36(a). For any subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer subject to § 1005.36(d)(2)(ii), the future date of transfer must be provided on any receipt provided for the initial transfer in that series of preauthorized remittance transfers, or where permitted, or disclosed as permitted by § 1005.31(a)(3) and (a)(5), in accordance with § 1005.36(a)(1)(i).</P>
            <P>6. <E T="03">Transfer date disclosures.</E> The following example demonstrates how the information required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(vii) and § 1005.36(d)(1) should be disclosed on receipts: On July 1, a sender instructs the provider to send a preauthorized remittance transfer of US$100 each week to a designated recipient. The sender requests that first transfer in the series be sent on July 15. On the receipt, the remittance transfer provider discloses an estimated exchange rate to the sender pursuant to § 1005.32(b)(2). In accordance with § 1005.31(b)(2)(vii), the provider should disclose the date of transfer for that particular transaction (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> July 15) on the receipt provided when payment is made for the transfer pursuant to the timing requirements in § 1005.36(a)(1)(i). The second receipt, which § 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) requires to be provided within one business day after the date of the transfer or, for transfers from the sender's account held by the provider, on the next regularly scheduled periodic statement or within 30 days after payment is made if a periodic statement is not provided, is also required to include the date of transfer. If the provider discloses on either receipt the cancellation period applicable to and dates of subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers in accordance with § 1005.36(d)(2), the disclosure must be phrased and formatted in such a way that it is clear to the sender which cancellation period is applicable to any date of transfer on the receipt.</P>
            <P>7. <E T="03">Cancellation disclosure.</E> Remittance transfer providers that offer remittance transfers scheduled three or more business days before the date of the transfer, as well as remittance transfers scheduled fewer than three business days before the date of the transfer, may meet the cancellation disclosure requirements in § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) by describing the three-business-day and 30-minute cancellation periods on the same disclosure and using a checkbox or other method to clearly designate the applicable cancellation period. The provider may use a number of methods to indicate which cancellation period applies to the transaction including, but not limited to, a statement to that effect, use of a checkbox, highlighting, circling, and the like. For transfers scheduled three business days before the date of the transfer, the cancellation disclosures provided pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) should be phrased and formatted in such a way that it is clear to the sender which cancellation period is applicable to the date of transfer disclosed on the receipt.<PRTPAGE P="274"/>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">31(b)(3) Combined Disclosure</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Proof of payment.</E> If a sender initiating a remittance transfer receives a combined disclosure provided under § 1005.31(b)(3) and then completes the transaction, the remittance transfer provider must provide the sender with proof of payment. The proof of payment must be clear and conspicuous, provided in writing or electronically, and provided in a retainable form. The combined disclosure must be provided to the sender when the sender requests the remittance transfer, but prior to payment for the transfer, pursuant to § 1005.31(e)(1), and the proof of payment must be provided when payment is made for the remittance transfer. The proof of payment for the transaction may be provided on the same piece of paper as the combined disclosure or on a separate piece of paper. For example, a provider may feed a combined disclosure through a computer printer when payment is made to add the date and time of the transaction, a confirmation code, and an indication that the transfer was paid in full. A provider may also provide this additional information to a sender on a separate piece of paper when payment is made. A remittance transfer provider does not comply with the requirements of § 1005.31(b)(3) by providing a combined disclosure with no further indication that payment has been received.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Confirmation of scheduling.</E> As discussed in comment 31(e)-2, payment is considered to be made when payment is authorized for purposes of various timing requirements in subpart B, including with regard to the timing requirement for provision of the proof of payment described in § 1005.31(b)(3)(i). However, where a transfer (whether a one-time remittance transfer or the first in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers) is scheduled before the date of transfer and the provider does not intend to process payment until at or near the date of transfer, the provider may provide a confirmation of scheduling in lieu of the proof of payment required by § 1005.31(b)(3)(i). No further proof of payment is required when payment is later processed.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">31(c)(1) Grouping</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Grouping.</E> Information is grouped together for purposes of subpart B if multiple disclosures are in close proximity to one another and a sender can reasonably calculate the total amount of the transaction and the amount that will be received by the designated recipient. Model Forms A-30(a)-(d) through A-35 in Appendix A illustrate how information may be grouped to comply with the rule, but a remittance transfer provider may group the information in another manner. For example, a provider could provide the grouped information as a horizontal, rather than a vertical, calculation. A provider could also send multiple text messages sequentially to provide the full disclosure.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">31(c)(4) Segregation</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Segregation.</E> Disclosures may be segregated from other information in a variety of ways. For example, the disclosures may appear on a separate sheet of paper or may appear on the front of a page where other information appears on the back of that page. The disclosures may be set off from other information on a notice by outlining them in a box or series of boxes, with bold print dividing lines or a different color background, or by using other means.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Directly related.</E> For purposes of § 1005.31(c)(4), the following is directly related information:</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">31(d) Estimates</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Terms.</E> A remittance transfer provider may provide estimates of the amounts required by § 1005.31(b), to the extent permitted by § 1005.32. An estimate must be described using the term “Estimated” or a substantially similar term in close proximity to the term or terms described. For example, a remittance transfer provider could describe an estimated disclosure as “Estimated Transfer Amount,” “Other Estimated Fees and Taxes,” or “Total to Recipient (Est.).”</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">31(e) Timing</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Request to send a remittance transfer.</E> Except as provided in § 1005.36(a), pre-payment and combined disclosures are required to be provided to the sender when the sender requests the remittance transfer, but prior to payment for the transfer. Whether a consumer has requested a remittance transfer <PRTPAGE P="275"/>depends on the facts and circumstances. A sender that asks a provider to send a remittance transfer, and provides transaction-specific information to the provider in order to send funds to a designated recipient, has requested a remittance transfer. A sender that has sent an email, fax, mailed letter, or similar written or electronic communication has not requested a remittance transfer if the provider believes that it is impractical for the provider to treat that communication as a request and if the provider treats the communication as an inquiry and subsequently responds to that inquiry by calling the consumer on a telephone and orally gathering or confirming the information needed to process a request for a remittance transfer. <E T="03">See</E> comment 31(a)(3)-2. Likewise, a consumer who solely inquires about that day's rates and fees to send to Mexico has not requested the provider to send a remittance transfer. Conversely, a sender who asks the provider at an agent location to send money to a recipient in Mexico and provides the sender and recipient information to the provider has requested a remittance transfer.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">When payment is made.</E> Except as provided in § 1005.36(a), a receipt required by § 1005.31(b)(2) must be provided to the sender when payment is made for the remittance transfer. For example, a remittance transfer provider could give the sender the disclosures after the sender pays for the remittance transfer, but before the sender leaves the counter. A provider could also give the sender the disclosures immediately before the sender pays for the transaction. For purposes of subpart B, payment is made, for example, when a sender provides cash to the remittance transfer provider or when payment is authorized.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Telephone transfer from an account.</E> A sender may transfer funds from his or her account, as defined by § 1005.2(b), that is held by the remittance transfer provider. For example, a financial institution may send an international wire transfer for a sender using funds from the sender's account with the institution. Except as provided in § 1005.36(a), if the sender conducts such a transfer entirely by telephone, the institution may provide a receipt required by § 1005.31(b)(2) on or with the sender's next regularly scheduled periodic statement for that account or within 30 days after payment is made for the remittance transfer if a periodic statement is not provided.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Mobile application and text message transactions.</E> If a transaction is conducted entirely by telephone via mobile application or text message, a receipt required by § 1005.31(b)(2) may be mailed or delivered to the sender pursuant to the timing requirements in § 1005.31(e)(2). For example, if a sender conducts a transfer entirely by telephone via mobile application, a remittance transfer provider may mail or deliver the disclosures to a sender pursuant to the timing requirements in § 1005.31(e)(2).</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Statement about cancellation rights.</E> The statement about the rights of the sender regarding cancellation required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) may, but need not, be disclosed pursuant to the timing requirements of § 1005.31(e)(2) if a provider discloses this information pursuant to § 1005.31(a)(3)(iii) or (a)(5)(iii). The statement about the rights of the sender regarding error resolution required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv), however, must be disclosed pursuant to the timing requirements of § 1005.31(e)(2).</P>

            <P>1. <E T="03">No guarantee of disclosures provided before payment.</E> Except as provided in § 1005.36(b), disclosures required by § 1005.31(b) or permitted by § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) must be accurate when a sender makes payment for the remittance transfer. A remittance transfer provider is not required to guarantee the terms of the remittance transfer in the disclosures required or permitted by § 1005.31(b) for any specific period of time. However, if any of the disclosures required by § 1005.31(b) or permitted by § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) are not accurate when a sender makes payment for the remittance transfer, a provider must give new disclosures before accepting payment.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">31(g) Foreign Language Disclosures</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Number of foreign languages used in written disclosure.</E> Section 1005.31(g)(1) does not limit the number of languages that may be used on a single document, but such disclosures must be clear and conspicuous pursuant to § 1005.31(a)(1). Under § 1005.31(g)(1), a remittance transfer provider may, but need not, provide the sender with a written or electronic disclosure that is in English and, if applicable, in each foreign language that the remittance transfer provider principally uses to advertise, solicit, or market either orally, in writing, or electronically, at the office in which a sender conducts a transaction or asserts an error, respectively. Alternatively, the remittance transfer provider may provide the disclosure solely in English and, if applicable, the foreign language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction or assert an error, provided such language is principally used by the remittance transfer provider to advertise, solicit, or market either orally, in writing, or electronically, at the office in which the sender conducts the transaction or asserts the error, respectively. If the remittance transfer provider chooses the alternative method, it may provide disclosures in a single document with both languages or in two separate documents with one document in English and the other document in the applicable <PRTPAGE P="276"/>foreign language. The following examples illustrate this concept.</P>
            <P>i. A remittance transfer provider principally uses only Spanish and Vietnamese to advertise, solicit, or market remittance transfer services at a particular office. The remittance transfer provider may provide all senders with disclosures in English, Spanish, and Vietnamese, regardless of the language the sender uses with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction or assert an error.</P>
            <P>ii. Same facts as i. If a sender primarily uses Spanish with the remittance transfer provider to conduct a transaction or assert an error, the remittance transfer provider may provide a written or electronic disclosure in English and Spanish, whether in a single document or two separate documents. If the sender primarily uses English with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction or assert an error, the remittance transfer provider may provide a written or electronic disclosure solely in English. If the sender primarily uses a foreign language with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction or assert an error that the remittance transfer provider does not use to advertise, solicit, or market either orally, in writing, or electronically, at the office in which the sender conducts the transaction or asserts the error, respectively, the remittance transfer provider may provide a written or electronic disclosure solely in English.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Primarily used.</E> The language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction is the primary language used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to convey the information necessary to complete the transaction. Similarly, the language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to assert the error is the primary language used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to provide the information required by § 1005.33(b) to assert an error. For example:</P>
            <P>i. A sender initiates a conversation with a remittance transfer provider with a greeting in English and expresses interest in sending a remittance transfer to Mexico in English. If the remittance transfer provider thereafter communicates with the sender in Spanish and the sender conveys the other information needed to complete the transaction, including the designated recipient's information and the amount and funding source of the transfer, in Spanish, then Spanish is the language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction.</P>
            <P>ii. A sender initiates a conversation with the remittance transfer provider with a greeting in English and states in English that there was a problem with a prior remittance transfer to Vietnam. If the remittance transfer provider thereafter communicates with the sender in Vietnamese and the sender uses Vietnamese to convey the information required by § 1005.33(b) to assert an error, then Vietnamese is the language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to assert the error.</P>
            <P>iii. A sender accesses the Web site of a remittance transfer provider that may be used by senders to conduct remittance transfers or assert errors. The Web site is offered in English and French. If the sender uses the French version of the Web site to conduct the remittance transfer, then French is the language primarily used by the sender with the remittance transfer provider to conduct the transaction.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">31(g)(1) General</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Principally used.</E> i. All relevant facts and circumstances determine whether a foreign language is principally used by the remittance transfer provider to advertise, solicit, or market under § 1005.31(g)(1). Generally, whether a foreign language is considered to be principally used by the remittance transfer provider to advertise, solicit, or market is based on:</P>
            <P>A. The frequency with which the foreign language is used in advertising, soliciting, or marketing of remittance transfer services at that office;</P>
            <P>B. The prominence of the advertising, soliciting, or marketing of remittance transfer services in that foreign language at that office; and</P>
            <P>C. The specific foreign language terms used in the advertising soliciting, or marketing of remittance transfer service at that office.</P>

            <P>ii. For example, if a remittance transfer provider posts several prominent advertisements in a foreign language for remittance transfer services, including rate and fee information, on a consistent basis in an office, the provider is creating an expectation that a consumer could receive information on remittance transfer services in the foreign language used in the advertisements. The foreign language used in such advertisements would be considered to be principally used at that office based on the frequency and prominence of the advertising. In contrast, an advertisement for remittance transfer services, including rate and fee information, that is featured prominently at an office and is entirely in English, except for a greeting in a foreign language, does not create an expectation that a consumer could receive information on remittance transfer services in the foreign language used for such greeting. The foreign language used in such an advertisement is not considered to be principally used at that office based on the incidental specific foreign language term used.<PRTPAGE P="277"/>
            </P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Advertise, solicit, or market.</E> i. Any commercial message in a foreign language, appearing in any medium, that promotes directly or indirectly the availability of remittance transfer services constitutes advertising, soliciting, or marketing in such foreign language for purposes of § 1005.31(g)(1). Examples illustrating when a foreign language is used to advertise, solicit, or market include:</P>
            <P>A. Messages in a foreign language in a leaflet or promotional flyer at an office.</P>
            <P>B. Announcements in a foreign language on a public address system at an office.</P>
            <P>C. On-line messages in a foreign language, such as on the internet.</P>
            <P>D. Printed material in a foreign language on any exterior or interior sign at an office.</P>
            <P>E. Point-of-sale displays in a foreign language at an office.</P>
            <P>F. Telephone solicitations in a foreign language.</P>
            <P>ii. Examples illustrating use of a foreign language for purposes other than to advertise, solicit, or market include:</P>
            <P>A. Communicating in a foreign language (whether by telephone, electronically, or otherwise) about remittance transfer services in response to a consumer-initiated inquiry.</P>
            <P>B. Making disclosures in a foreign language that are required by Federal or other applicable law.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Office.</E> An office includes any physical location, telephone number, or Web site of a remittance transfer provider where a sender may conduct a remittance transfer or assert an error for a remittance transfer. The location need not exclusively offer remittance transfer services. For example, if an agent of a remittance transfer provider is located in a grocery store, the grocery store is considered an office for purposes of § 1005.31(g)(1). Because a consumer must be located in a State in order to be considered a “sender” under § 1005.30(g), a Web site is not an office for purposes of § 1005.31(g)(1), even if the Web site can be accessed by consumers that are located in the United States, unless a sender may conduct a remittance transfer on the Web site or may assert an error for a remittance transfer on the Web site.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">At the office.</E> Any advertisement, solicitation, or marketing is considered to be made at the office in which a sender conducts a transaction or asserts an error if such advertisement, solicitation, or marketing is posted, provided, or made: at a physical office of a remittance transfer provider; on a Web site of a remittance transfer provider that may be used by senders to conduct remittance transfers or assert errors; during a telephone call with a remittance transfer provider that may be used by senders to conduct remittance transfers or assert errors; or via mobile application or text message by a remittance transfer provider if the mobile application or text message may be used by senders to conduct remittance transfers or assert errors. An advertisement, solicitation, or marketing that is considered to be made at an office does not include general advertisements, solicitations, or marketing that are not intended to be made at a particular office. For example, if an advertisement for remittance transfers in Chinese appears in a Chinese newspaper that is being distributed at a grocery store in which the agent of a remittance transfer provider is located, such advertisement would not be considered to be made at that office. For disclosures provided pursuant to § 1005.31, the relevant office is the office in which the sender conducts the transaction. For disclosures provided pursuant to § 1005.33 for error resolution purposes, the relevant office is the office in which the sender first asserts the error, not the office where the transaction was conducted.</P>

            <P>1. <E T="03">Disclosures where estimates can be used.</E> Sections 1005.32(a) and (b)(1) permit estimates to be used in certain circumstances for disclosures described in §§ 1005.31(b)(1) through (3) and 1005.36(a)(1) and(2). To the extent permitted in § 1005.32(a) and (b)(1), estimates may be used in the pre-payment disclosure described in § 1005.31(b)(1), the receipt disclosure described in § 1005.31(b)(2), the combined disclosure described in § 1005.31(b)(3), and the pre-payment disclosures and receipt disclosures for both first and subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers described in § 1005.36(a)(1) and (a)(2). Section 1005.32(b)(2) permits estimates to be used for certain information if the remittance transfer is scheduled by a sender five or more business days before the date of the transfer, for disclosures described in § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) and (a)(2)(i).</P>

            <P>1. <E T="03">Control.</E> For purposes of this section, an insured institution cannot determine exact amounts “for reasons beyond its control” when a person other than the insured institution or with which the insured institution has no correspondent relationship sets the exchange rate required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) or imposes a covered third-party fee required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi). For example, if an insured institution has a correspondent relationship with an intermediary financial institution in another country and that intermediary institution sets the exchange rate or imposes a <PRTPAGE P="278"/>fee for remittance transfers sent from the insured institution to the intermediary institution, then the insured institution must determine exact amounts for the disclosures required under § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) or (vi), because the determination of those amounts are not beyond the insured institution's control.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Examples of scenarios that qualify for the temporary exception.</E> The following examples illustrate when an insured institution cannot determine an exact amount “for reasons beyond its control” and thus would qualify for the temporary exception.</P>
            <P>i. <E T="03">Exchange rate.</E> An insured institution cannot determine the exact exchange rate to disclose under § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) for an international wire transfer if the insured institution does not set the exchange rate, and the rate is set when the funds are deposited into the recipient's account by the designated recipient's institution with which the insured institution does not have a correspondent relationship. The insured institution will not know the exchange rate that the recipient institution will apply when the funds are deposited into the recipient's account.</P>
            <P>ii. <E T="03">Covered third-party fees.</E> An insured institution cannot determine the exact covered third-party fees to disclose under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) if an intermediary institution with which the insured institution does not have a correspondent relationship, imposes a transfer or conversion fee.</P>

The determination of the exchange rate is in the insured institution's control even if there is no correspondent relationship with an intermediary institution in the transmittal route or the designated recipient's institution.</P>
            <P>ii. <E T="03">Covered third-party fees.</E> An insured institution can determine the exact covered third-party fees required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi) if it has agreed upon the specific fees with an intermediary correspondent institution, and this correspondent institution is the only institution in the transmittal route to the designated recipient's institution.</P>

            <P>2. <E T="03">Example illustrating when exact amounts can and cannot be determined because of the laws of the recipient country.</E>
            </P>
            <P>i. The laws of the recipient country do not permit a remittance transfer provider to determine the exact exchange rate required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) when, for example, the government of the recipient country, on a daily basis, sets the exchange rate that must, by law, apply to funds received and the funds are made available to the designated recipient in the local currency the day after the remittance transfer provider sends the remittance transfer.</P>
            <P>ii. In contrast, the laws of the recipient country permit a remittance transfer provider to determine the exact exchange rate required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) when, for example, the government of the recipient country ties the value of its currency to the U.S. dollar.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Method by which transactions are made in the recipient country.</E> The method by which transactions are made in the recipient country does not permit a remittance transfer provider to determine exact amounts required to be disclosed when transactions are sent via international ACH on terms negotiated between the United States government and the recipient country's government, under which the exchange rate is a rate set by the recipient country's central bank or other governmental authority after the provider sends the remittance transfer.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Example illustrating when exact amounts can and cannot be determined because of the method by which transactions are made in the recipient country.</E>
            </P>
            <P>i. The method by which transactions are made in the recipient country does not permit a remittance transfer provider to determine the exact exchange rate required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) when the provider sends a remittance transfer via international ACH on terms negotiated between the United States government and the recipient country's government, under which the exchange rate is a rate set by the recipient country's central bank on the business day after the provider has sent the remittance transfer.</P>

            <P>ii. In contrast, a remittance transfer provider would not qualify for the § 1005.32(b)(1)(i)(B) methods exception if it sends a remittance transfer via international ACH on terms negotiated between the United <PRTPAGE P="279"/>States government and a private-sector entity or entities in the recipient country, under which the exchange rate is set by the institution acting as the entry point to the recipient country's payments system on the next business day. However, a remittance transfer provider sending a remittance transfer using such a method may qualify for the § 1005.32(a) temporary exception.</P>
            <P>iii. A remittance transfer provider would not qualify for the § 1005.32(b)(1)(i)(B) methods exception if, for example, it sends a remittance transfer via international ACH on terms negotiated between the United States government and the recipient country's government, under which the exchange rate is set by the recipient country's central bank or other governmental authority before the sender requests a transfer.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Safe harbor list.</E> If a country is included on a safe harbor list published by the Bureau under § 1005.32(b)(1)(ii), a remittance transfer provider may provide estimates of the amounts to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) through (b)(1)(vii). If a country does not appear on the Bureau's list, a remittance transfer provider may provide estimates under § 1005.32(b)(1)(i) if the provider determines that the recipient country does not legally permit or method by which transactions are conducted in that country does not permit the provider to determine exact disclosure amounts.</P>
            <P>6. <E T="03">Reliance on Bureau list of countries.</E> A remittance transfer provider may rely on the list of countries published by the Bureau to determine whether the laws of a recipient country do not permit the remittance transfer provider to determine exact amounts required to be disclosed under § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) through (vii). Thus, if a country is on the Bureau's list, the provider may give estimates under this section, unless a remittance transfer provider has information that a country on the Bureau's list legally permits the provider to determine exact disclosure amounts.</P>
            <P>7. <E T="03">Change in laws of recipient country.</E> i. If the laws of a recipient country change such that a remittance transfer provider can determine exact amounts, the remittance transfer provider must begin providing exact amounts for the required disclosures as soon as reasonably practicable if the provider has information that the country legally permits the provider to determine exact disclosure amounts.</P>
            <P>ii. If the laws of a recipient country change such that a remittance transfer provider cannot determine exact disclosure amounts, the remittance transfer provider may provide estimates under § 1005.32(b)(1)(i), even if that country does not appear on the list published by the Bureau.</P>

            <P>1. <E T="03">Fixed amount of foreign currency.</E> The following is an example of when and how a remittance transfer provider may disclose estimates for remittance transfers scheduled five or more business days before the date of transfer where the provider agrees to the sender's request to fix the amount to be transferred in a currency in which the transfer will be received and not the currency in which it was funded. If on February 1, a sender schedules a 1000 Euro wire transfer to be sent from the sender's bank account denominated in U.S. dollars to a designated recipient on February 15, § 1005.32(b)(2) allows the provider to estimate the amount that will be transferred to the designated recipient (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the amount described in § 1005.31(b)(1)(i)), any fees imposed or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by the provider (if based on the amount transferred) (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the amount described in § 1005.31(b)(1)(ii)), and the total amount of the transaction (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the amount described in § 1005.31(b)(1)(iii)). The provider may also estimate any covered third-party fees if the exchange rate is also estimated and the estimated exchange rate affects the amount of fees (as allowed by § 1005.32(b)(2)(ii)).</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Relationship to § 1005.10(d).</E> To the extent § 1005.10(d) requires, for an electronic fund transfer that is also a remittance transfer, notice when a preauthorized electronic fund transfer from the consumer's account will vary in amount from the previous transfer under the same authorization or from the preauthorized amount, that provision applies even if subpart B would not otherwise require notice before the date of transfer. However, insofar as § 1005.10(d) does not specify the form of such notice, a notice sent pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(2)(i) will satisfy § 1005.10(d) as long as the timing requirements of § 1005.10(d) are satisfied.</P>

            <P>1. <E T="03">In general.</E> When providing an estimate pursuant to § 1005.32(b)(2), § 1005.32(d) requires that a remittance transfer provider's estimated exchange rate must be the exchange rate (or estimated exchange rate) that the remittance transfer provider would have used or did use that day in providing disclosures to a sender requesting such a remittance transfer to be made on the same day. If, for the same-day remittance transfer, the provider could utilize either of the other two exceptions permitting the provision of estimates in § 1005.32(a) or (b)(1), the provider may provide estimates based on a methodology permitted under § 1005.32(c). For example, if, on February 1, the sender schedules a remittance transfer to occur on February 10, the provider should disclose the exchange rate as if the sender was requesting the transfer be sent on February 1. However, if at the time payment is made for the requested transfer, the remittance transfer provider could not send any remittance transfer until the next day (for reasons such as the provider's deadline for the batching of transfers), the remittance transfer provider can use the rate (or estimated exchange rate) that the remittance transfer provider would have used or did use in providing disclosures that day with respect to a remittance transfer requested that day that could not be sent until the following day.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">33(a) Definition of Error</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Incorrect amount of currency paid by sender.</E> Section 1005.33(a)(1)(i) covers circumstances in which a sender pays an amount that differs from the total amount of the transaction, including fees imposed in connection with the transfer, stated in the receipt or combined disclosure provided under § 1005.31(b)(2) or (3). Such error may be asserted by a sender regardless of the form or method of payment provided, including when a debit, credit, or prepaid card is used to fund the transfer and an excess amount is paid. For example, if a remittance transfer provider incorrectly charged a sender's credit card account for US$150, and US$120 was sent, plus a transfer fee of US$10, the sender could assert an error with the remittance transfer provider for the incorrect charge under § 1005.33(a)(1)(i).</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Incorrect amount of currency received—coverage.</E> Section 1005.33(a)(1)(iii) covers circumstances in which the designated recipient receives an amount of currency that differs from the amount of currency identified on the disclosures provided to the sender, except where the disclosure stated an estimate of the amount of currency to be received in <PRTPAGE P="281"/>accordance with § 1005.32 and the difference results from application of the actual exchange rate, fees, and taxes, rather than any estimated amounts, or the failure was caused by circumstances outside the remittance transfer provider's control. A designated recipient may receive an amount of currency that differs from the amount of currency disclosed, for example, if an exchange rate other than the disclosed rate is applied to the remittance transfer, or if the provider fails to account for fees or taxes that may be imposed by the provider or a third party before the transfer is picked up by the designated recipient or deposited into the recipient's account in the foreign country. However, if the provider rounds the exchange rate used to calculate the amount received consistent with § 1005.31(b)(1)(iv) and comment 31(b)(1)(iv)-2 for the disclosed rate, there is no error if the designated recipient receives an amount of currency that results from applying the exchange rate used, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate, to calculate fees, taxes, or the amount received rather than the disclosed rate. Section 1005.33(a)(1)(iii) also covers circumstances in which the remittance transfer provider transmits an amount that differs from the amount requested by the sender.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Incorrect amount of currency received—examples.</E> For purposes of the following examples illustrating the error for an incorrect amount of currency received under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iii), assume that none of the circumstances permitting an estimate under § 1005.32 apply (unless otherwise stated).</P>
            <P>i. A consumer requests to send funds to a relative in Mexico to be received in local currency. Upon receiving the sender's payment, the remittance transfer provider provides a receipt indicating that the amount of currency that will be received by the designated recipient will be 1180 Mexican pesos, after fees and taxes are applied. However, when the relative picks up the transfer in Mexico a day later, he only receives 1150 Mexican pesos because the exchange rate applied by the recipient agent in Mexico was lower than the exchange rate used by the provider, prior to any rounding of the exchange rate, to disclose the amount of currency to be received by the designated recipient on the receipt. Because the designated recipient has received less than the amount of currency disclosed on the receipt, an error has occurred.</P>
            <P>ii. A consumer requests to send funds to a relative in Colombia to be received in local currency. The remittance transfer provider provides the sender a receipt stating an amount of currency that will be received by the designated recipient, which does not reflect the additional foreign taxes that will be collected in Colombia on the transfer but does include the statement required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii). If the designated recipient will receive less than the amount of currency disclosed on the receipt due solely to the additional foreign taxes that the provider was not required to disclose, no error has occurred.</P>
            <P>iii. Same facts as in ii., except that the receipt provided by the remittance transfer provider does not reflect additional fees that are imposed by the receiving agent in Colombia on the transfer. Because the designated recipient will receive less than the amount of currency disclosed in the receipt due to the additional covered third-party fees, an error has occurred.</P>
            <P>iv. A consumer requests to send US$250 to a relative in India to a U.S. dollar-denominated account held by the relative at an Indian bank. Instead of the US$250 disclosed on the receipt as the amount to be sent, the remittance transfer provider sends US$200, resulting in a smaller deposit to the designated recipient's account than was disclosed as the amount to be received after fees and taxes. Because the designated recipient received less than the amount of currency that was disclosed, an error has occurred.</P>
            <P>v. A consumer requests to send US$100 to a relative in a foreign country to be received in local currency. The remittance transfer provider provides the sender a receipt that discloses an estimated exchange rate, other taxes, and amount of currency that will be received due to the law in the foreign country requiring that the exchange rate be set by the foreign country's central bank. When the relative picks up the remittance transfer, the relative receives less currency than the estimated amount disclosed to the sender on the receipt due to application of the actual exchange rate, fees, and taxes, rather than any estimated amounts. Because § 1005.32(b) permits the remittance transfer provider to disclose an estimate of the amount of currency to be received, no error has occurred unless the estimate was not based on an approach set forth under § 1005.32(c).</P>
            <P>vi. A sender requests that his bank send US$120 to a designated recipient's account at an institution in a foreign country. The foreign institution is not an agent of the provider. Only US$100 is deposited into the designated recipient's account because the recipient institution imposed a US$20 incoming wire fee and deducted the fee from the amount transferred. Because this fee is a non-covered third-party fee that the provider is not required to disclose under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi), no error has occurred if the provider provided the disclosure required by § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii).</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Incorrect amount of currency received—extraordinary circumstances.</E> Under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iii)(B), a remittance transfer provider's failure to make available to a designated recipient the amount of currency disclosed pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii) and <PRTPAGE P="282"/>stated in the disclosure provided pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(2) or (3) for the remittance transfer is not an error if such failure was caused by extraordinary circumstances outside the remittance transfer provider's control that could not have been reasonably anticipated. Examples of extraordinary circumstances outside the remittance transfer provider's control that could not have been reasonably anticipated under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iii)(B) include circumstances such as war or civil unrest, natural disaster, garnishment or attachment of some of the funds after the transfer is sent, and government actions or restrictions that could not have been reasonably anticipated by the remittance transfer provider, such as the imposition of foreign currency controls or foreign taxes unknown at the time the receipt or combined disclosure is provided under § 1005.31(b)(2) or (3).</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Failure to make funds available by disclosed date of availability—coverage.</E> Section 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) generally covers disputes about the failure to make funds available in connection with a remittance transfer to a designated recipient by the disclosed date of availability. If only a portion of the funds were made available by the disclosed date of availability, then § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv) does not apply, but § 1005.33(a)(1)(iii) may apply instead. The following are examples of errors for failure to make funds available by the disclosed date of availability (assuming that none of the exceptions in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(A), (B), or (C) apply).</P>
            <P>i. Late or non-delivery of a remittance transfer;</P>
            <P>ii. Delivery of funds to the wrong account;</P>
            <P>iii. The fraudulent pick-up of a remittance transfer in a foreign country by a person other than the designated recipient;</P>
            <P>iv. The recipient agent or institution's retention of the remittance transfer, instead of making the funds available to the designated recipient.</P>
            <P>6. <E T="03">Failure to make funds available by disclosed date of availability—extraordinary circumstances.</E> Under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(A), a remittance transfer provider's failure to deliver or transmit a remittance transfer by the disclosed date of availability is not an error if such failure was caused by extraordinary circumstances outside the remittance transfer provider's control that could not have been reasonably anticipated. Examples of extraordinary circumstances outside the remittance transfer provider's control that could not have been reasonably anticipated under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(A) include circumstances such as war or civil unrest, natural disaster, garnishment or attachment of funds after the transfer is sent, and government actions or restrictions that could not have been reasonably anticipated by the remittance transfer provider, such as the imposition of foreign currency controls.</P>
            <P>7. <E T="03">Failure to make funds available by disclosed date of availability—fraud and other screening procedures.</E> Under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(B), a remittance transfer provider's failure to deliver funds by the disclosed date of availability is not an error if such delay is related to the provider's or any third party's investigation necessary to address potentially suspicious, blocked or prohibited activity, and the provider did not and could not have reasonably foreseen the delay so as to enable it to timely disclose an accurate date of availability when providing the sender with a receipt or combined disclosure. For example, no error occurs if delivery of funds is delayed because, after the receipt is provided, the provider's fraud screening system flags a remittance transfer because the designated recipient has a name similar to the name of a blocked person under a sanctions program and further investigation is needed to determine that the designated recipient is not actually a blocked person. Similarly, no error occurs where, after disclosing a date of availability to the sender, a remittance transfer provider receives specific law enforcement information indicating that the characteristics of a remittance transfer match a pattern of fraudulent activity, and as a result, the provider deems it necessary to delay delivery of the funds to allow for further investigation. However, if a delay could have been reasonably foreseen, the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(B) would not apply. For example, if a provider knows in time to make a disclosure that all remittance transfers to a certain geographic area must undergo screening procedures that routinely delay such transfers by two days, the provider's failure to include the additional two days in its disclosure of the date of availability constitutes an error if delivery of the funds is indeed delayed beyond the disclosed date of availability.</P>
            <P>8. <E T="03">Sender account number or recipient institution identifier error.</E> The exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) applies where a sender gives the remittance transfer provider an incorrect account number or recipient institution identifier and all five conditions in § 1005.33(h) are satisfied. The exception does not apply, however, where the failure to make funds available is the result of a mistake by a provider or a third party or due to incorrect or insufficient information provided by the sender other than an incorrect account number or recipient institution identifier, such as an incorrect name of the recipient institution.</P>
            <P>9. <E T="03">Account number or recipient institution identifier.</E> For purposes of the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D), the terms account number and recipient institution identifier refer to alphanumerical account or institution identifiers other than names or addresses, such as account numbers, routing numbers, Canadian transit numbers, International <PRTPAGE P="283"/>Bank Account Numbers (IBANs), Business Identifier Codes (BICs) and other similar account or institution identifiers used to route a transaction. In addition and for purposes of this exception, the term designated recipient's account in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) refers to an asset account, regardless of whether it is a consumer asset account, established for any purpose and held by a bank, savings association, credit union, or equivalent institution. A designated recipient's account does not, however, include a credit card, prepaid card, or a virtual account held by an Internet-based or mobile telephone company that is not a bank, savings association, credit union or equivalent institution.</P>
            <P>10. <E T="03">Recipient-requested changes.</E> Under § 1005.33(a)(2)(iii), a change requested by the designated recipient that the remittance transfer provider or others involved in the remittance transfer decide to accommodate is not considered an error. The exception under § 1005.33(a)(2)(iii) is available only if the change is made solely because the designated recipient requested the change. For example, if a sender requests to send US$100 to a designated recipient at a designated location, but the designated recipient requests the amount in a different currency (either at the sender-designated location or another location requested by the recipient) and the remittance transfer provider accommodates the recipient's request, the change does not constitute an error.</P>
            <P>11. <E T="03">Change from disclosure made in reliance on sender information.</E> Under the commentary accompanying § 1005.31, the remittance transfer provider may rely on the sender's representations in making certain disclosures. <E T="03">See, e.g.,</E> comments 31(b)(1)(iv)-1 and 31(b)(1)(vi)-1. For example, suppose a sender requests U.S. dollars to be deposited into an account of the designated recipient and represents that the account is U.S. dollar-denominated. If the designated recipient's account is actually denominated in local currency and the recipient account-holding institution must convert the remittance transfer into local currency in order to deposit the funds and complete the transfer, the change in currency does not constitute an error pursuant to § 1005.33(a)(2)(iv).</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">33(b) Notice of Error From Sender</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Person asserting or discovering error.</E> The error resolution procedures of this section apply only when a notice of error is received from the sender, and not when a notice of error is received from the designated recipient or when the remittance transfer provider itself discovers and corrects an error.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Content of error notice.</E> The notice of error is effective so long as the remittance transfer provider is able to identify the elements in § 1005.33(b)(1)(ii). For example, the sender could provide the confirmation number or code that would be used by the designated recipient to pick up the transfer, or other identification number or code supplied by the remittance transfer provider in connection with the transfer, if such number or code is sufficient for the remittance transfer provider to identify the sender (and contact information), designated recipient, and the transfer in question. For an account-based remittance transfer, the notice of error is effective even if it does not contain the sender's account number, so long as the remittance transfer provider is able to identify the account and the transfer in question.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Address on notice of error.</E> A remittance transfer provider may request, or a sender may provide, the sender's or designated recipient's email address, as applicable, instead of a physical address, on a notice of error.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Effect of late notice.</E> A remittance transfer provider is not required to comply with the requirements of this section for any notice of error from a sender that is received by the provider more than 180 days from the disclosed date of availability of the remittance transfer to which the notice of error applies or, if applicable, more than 60 days after a provider sent documentation, additional information, or clarification requested by the sender, provided such date is later than 180 days after the disclosed date of availability.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Notice of error provided to agent.</E> A notice of error provided by a sender to an agent of the remittance transfer provider is deemed to be received by the provider under § 1005.33(b)(1)(i) when received by the agent.</P>
            <P>6. <E T="03">Consumer notice of error resolution rights.</E> Section 1005.31 requires a remittance transfer provider to include an abbreviated notice of the consumer's error resolution rights on the receipt or combined notice provided under § 1005.31(b)(2) or (3). In addition, the remittance transfer provider must make available to a sender upon request, a notice providing a full description of the sender's error resolution rights, using language set forth in Appendix A of this part (Model Form A-36) or substantially similar language.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">33(c) Time Limits and Extent of Investigation</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Notice to sender of finding of error.</E> If the remittance transfer provider determines during its investigation that an error occurred as described by the sender, the remittance provider may inform the sender of its findings either orally or in writing. However, if the provider determines that no error or a different error occurred, the provider must provide a written explanation of its findings under § 1005.33(d)(1).</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Incorrect or insufficient information provided for transfer.</E> The remedy in § 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) applies if a remittance transfer provider's failure to make funds in <PRTPAGE P="284"/>connection with a remittance transfer available to a designated recipient by the disclosed date of availability occurred because the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information in connection with the transfer, such as by erroneously identifying the designated recipient's address or by providing insufficient information such that the entity distributing the funds cannot identify the correct designated recipient. A sender is not considered to have provided incorrect or insufficient information for purposes of § 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) if the provider discloses the incorrect location where the transfer may be picked up, gives the wrong confirmation number/code for the transfer, or otherwise miscommunicates information necessary for the designated recipient to pick-up the transfer. The remedies in § 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) do not apply if the sender provided an incorrect account number or recipient institution identifier and the provider has met the requirements of § 1005.33(h) because under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) no error would have occurred. <E T="03">See</E> § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) and comment 33(a)-7.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Designation of requested remedy.</E> Under § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii), the sender may generally choose to obtain a refund of funds that were not properly transmitted or delivered to the designated recipient or, request redelivery of the amount appropriate to correct the error at no additional cost unless the error is determined to have occurred because the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information. Upon receiving the sender's request, the remittance transfer provider shall correct the error within one business day, or as soon as reasonably practicable, applying the same exchange rate, fees, and taxes stated in the disclosure provided under § 1005.31(b)(2) or (3), if the sender requests delivery of the amount appropriate to correct the error and the error did not occur because the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information. The provider may also request that the sender indicate the preferred remedy at the time the sender provides notice of the error although if provider does so, it should indicate that the if the sender chooses a resend at the time, the remedy may be unavailable if the error occurred because the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information. However, if the sender does not indicate the desired remedy at the time of providing notice of error, the remittance transfer provider must notify the sender of any available remedies in the report provided under § 1005.33(c)(1) or (d)(1) if the provider determines an error occurred.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Default remedy.</E> Unless the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information and § 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) applies, the remittance transfer provider may set a default remedy that the provider will provide if the sender does not designate a remedy within a reasonable time after the sender receives the report provided under § 1005.33(c)(1). A provider that permits a sender to designate a remedy within 10 days after the provider has sent the report provided under § 1005.33(c)(1) or (d)(1) before imposing the default remedy is deemed to have provided the sender with a reasonable time to designate a remedy. In the case a default remedy is provided, the provider must correct the error within one business day, or as soon as reasonably practicable, after the reasonable time for the sender to designate the remedy has passed, consistent with § 1005.33(c)(2).</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Amount appropriate to resolve the error.</E> For purposes of the remedies set forth in § 1005.33(c)(2)(i)(A), (c)(2)(i)(B), (c)(2)(ii)(A)(<E T="03">1</E>), and (c)(2)(i)(A)(<E T="03">2</E>) the amount appropriate to resolve the error is the specific amount of transferred funds that should have been received if the remittance transfer had been effected without error. The amount appropriate to resolve the error does not include consequential damages. For example, when the amount that was disclosed pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(1)(vii) was received by the designated recipient before the provider must determine the appropriate remedy for an error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv), no additional amounts are required to resolve the error after the remittance transfer provider refunds the appropriate fees and taxes paid by the sender pursuant to § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(B) or (c)(2)(iii), as applicable.</P>
            <P>6. <E T="03">Form of refund.</E> For a refund provided under § 1005.33(c)(2)(i)(A), (c)(2)(ii)(A)(<E T="03">1</E>), (c)(2)(ii)(B), or (c)(2)(iii), a remittance transfer provider may generally, at its discretion, issue a refund either in cash or in the same form of payment that was initially provided by the sender for the remittance transfer. For example, if the sender originally provided a credit card as payment for the transfer, the remittance transfer provider may issue a credit to the sender's credit card account in the appropriate amount. However, if a sender initially provided cash for the remittance transfer, a provider may issue a refund by check. For example, if the sender originally provided cash as payment for the transfer, the provider may mail a check to the sender in the amount of the payment.</P>
            <P>7. <E T="03">Remedies for incorrect amount paid.</E> If an error under § 1005.33(a)(1)(i) occurred, the sender may request the remittance transfer provider refund the amount necessary to resolve the error under § 1005.33(c)(2)(i)(A) or that the remittance transfer provider make the amount necessary to resolve the error available to the designated recipient at no additional cost under § 1005.33(c)(2)(i)(B).</P>
            <P>8. <E T="03">Correction of an error if funds not available by disclosed date.</E> If the remittance transfer provider determines an error of failure to make funds available by the disclosed date occurred under § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv), it must correct the error in accordance with § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(A), as applicable, and refund <PRTPAGE P="285"/>any fees imposed for the transfer (unless the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information to the remittance transfer provider in connection with the remittance transfer), whether the fee was imposed by the provider or a third party involved in sending the transfer, such as an intermediary bank involved in sending a wire transfer or the institution from which the funds are picked up in accordance with § 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(B).</P>
            <P>9. <E T="03">Charges for error resolution.</E> If an error occurred, whether as alleged or in a different amount or manner, the remittance transfer provider may not impose a charge related to any aspect of the error resolution process (including charges for documentation or investigation).</P>
            <P>10. <E T="03">Correction without investigation.</E> A remittance transfer provider may correct an error, without investigation, in the amount or manner alleged by the sender, or otherwise determined, to be in error, but must comply with all other applicable requirements of § 1005.33.</P>
            <P>11. <E T="03">Procedure for sending a new remittance transfer after a sender provides incorrect or insufficient information.</E> Section 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) generally requires a remittance transfer provider to refund the transfer amount to the sender even if the sender's previously designated remedy was a resend or if the provider's default remedy in other circumstances is a resend. However, if before the refund is processed, the sender receives notice pursuant to § 1005.33(c)(1) or (d)(1) that an error occurred because the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information and then requests that the provider send the remittance transfer again, and the provider agrees to that request, § 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) requires that the request be treated as a new remittance transfer and the provider must provide new disclosures in accordance with § 1005.31 and all other applicable provisions of subpart B. However, § 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) does not obligate the provider to agree to a sender's request to send a new remittance transfer.</P>
            <P>12. <E T="03">Determining amount of refund.</E> Section 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) permits the provider to deduct from the amount refunded, or applied towards a new transfer, any fees or taxes actually deducted from the transfer amount by a person other than the provider as part of the first unsuccessful remittance transfer attempt or that were deducted in the course of returning the transfer amount to the provider following a failed delivery. However, a provider may not deduct those fees and taxes that will ultimately be refunded to the provider. When the provider deducts fees or taxes from the amount refunded pursuant to § 1005.33(c)(2)(iii), the provider must inform the sender of the deduction as part of the notice required by either § 1005.33(c)(1) or (d)(1) and the reason for the deduction. The following examples illustrate these concepts.</P>
            <P>i. A sender instructs a remittance transfer provider to send US$100 to a designated recipient in local currency, for which the provider charges a transfer fee of US$10 (and thus the sender pays the provider $110). The provider's correspondent imposes a fee of US$15 that it deducts from the amount of the transfer. The sender provides incorrect or insufficient information that results in non-delivery of the remittance transfer as requested. Once the provider determines that an error occurred because the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information, the provider must provide the report required by § 1005.33(c)(1) or (d)(1) and inform the sender, pursuant to § 1005.33(c)(1) or (d)(1), that it will refund US$95 to the sender within three business days, unless the sender chooses to apply the US$95 towards a new remittance transfer and the provider agrees. Of the $95 that is refunded to the sender, $10 reflects the refund of the provider's transfer fee, and $85 reflects the refund of the amount of funds provided by the sender in connection with the transfer which was not properly transmitted. The provider is not required to refund the US$15 fee imposed by the correspondent (unless the $15 will be refunded to the provider by the correspondent).</P>

            <P>ii. A sender instructs a remittance transfer provider to send US$100 to a designated recipient in a foreign country, for which the provider charges a transfer fee of US$10 (and thus the sender pays the provider US$110) and an intermediary institution charges a lifting fee of US$5, such that the designated recipient is expected to receive only US$95, as indicated in the receipt. If an error occurs because the sender provides incorrect or insufficient information that results in non-delivery of the remittance transfer by the date of availability stated in the disclosure provided to the sender for the remittance transfer under § 1005.31(b)(2) or (3), the provider is required to refund, or reapply if requested and the provider agrees, $105 unless the intermediary institution refunds to the provider the US$5 fee. If the sender requests to have the transfer amount applied to a new remittance transfer pursuant to § 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) and provides the corrected or additional information, and the remittance transfer provider agrees to a resend remedy, the remittance transfer provider may charge the sender another transfer fee of US$10 to send the remittance transfer again with the corrected or additional information necessary to complete the transfer. Insofar as the resend is an entirely new remittance transfer, the provider must provide a prepayment disclosure and receipt or combined disclosure in accordance with, among other provisions, the timing requirements of § 1005.31(f) and the cancellation provision of § 1005.34(a).<PRTPAGE P="286"/>
            </P>
            <P>iii. In connection with a remittance transfer, a provider imposes a $15 tax that it then remits to a State taxing authority. An error occurs because the sender provided incorrect or insufficient information that resulted in non-delivery of the transfer to the designated recipient. The provider may deduct $15 from the amount it refunds to the sender pursuant to § 1005.33(c)(2)(iii) unless the relevant tax law will result in the $15 tax being refunded to the provider by the State taxing authority because the transfer was not completed.</P>

            <P>1. <E T="03">Error different from that alleged.</E> When a remittance transfer provider determines that an error occurred in a manner or amount different from that described by the sender, it must comply with the requirements of both § 1005.33(c) and (d), as applicable. The provider may give the notice of correction and the explanation separately or in a combined form.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">33(e) Reassertion of Error</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Withdrawal of error; right to reassert.</E> The remittance transfer provider has no further error resolution responsibilities if the sender voluntarily withdraws the notice alleging an error. A sender who has withdrawn an allegation of error has the right to reassert the allegation unless the remittance transfer provider had already complied with all of the error resolution requirements before the allegation was withdrawn. The sender must do so, however, within the original 180-day period from the disclosed date of availability or, if applicable, the 60-day period for a notice of error asserted pursuant to § 1005.33(b)(2).</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">33(f) Relation to Other Laws</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Concurrent error obligations.</E> A financial institution that is also the remittance transfer provider may have error obligations under both §§ 1005.11 and 1005.33. For example, if a sender asserts an error under § 1005.11 with a remittance transfer provider that holds the sender's account, and the error is not also an error under § 1005.33 (such as the omission of an EFT on a periodic statement), then the error-resolution provisions of § 1005.11 exclusively apply to the error. However, if a sender asserts an error under § 1005.33 with a remittance transfer provider that holds the sender's account, and the error is also an error under § 1005.11 (such as when the amount the sender requested to be deducted from the sender's account and sent for the remittance transfer differs from the amount that was actually deducted from the account and sent), then the error-resolution provisions of § 1005.33 exclusively apply to the error.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Holder in due course.</E> Nothing in this section limits a sender's rights to assert claims and defenses against a card issuer concerning property or services purchased with a credit card under Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.12(c)(1), as applicable.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Assertion of same error with multiple parties.</E> If a sender receives credit to correct an error of an incorrect amount paid in connection with a remittance transfer from either the remittance transfer provider or account-holding institution (or creditor), and subsequently asserts the same error with another party, that party has no further responsibilities to investigate the error if the error has been corrected. For example, assume that a sender initially asserts an error with a remittance transfer provider with respect to a remittance transfer alleging that US$130 was debited from his checking account, but the sender only requested a remittance transfer for US$100, plus a US$10 transfer fee. If the remittance transfer provider refunds US$20 to the sender to correct the error, and the sender subsequently asserts the same error with his account-holding institution, the account-holding institution has no error resolution responsibilities under Regulation E because the error has been fully corrected. In addition, nothing in this section prevents an account-holding institution or creditor from reversing amounts it has previously credited to correct an error if a sender receives more than one credit to correct the same error. For example, assume that a sender concurrently asserts an error with his or her account-holding institution and remittance transfer provider for the same error, and the sender receives credit from the account-holding institution for the error within 45 days of the notice of error. If the remittance transfer provider subsequently provides a credit of the same amount to the sender for the same error, the account-holding institution may reverse the amounts it had previously credited to the consumer's account, even after the 45-day error resolution period under § 1005.11.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">33(g) Error Resolution Standards and Recordkeeping Requirements</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Record retention requirements.</E> As noted in § 1005.33(g)(2), remittance transfer providers are subject to the record retention requirements under § 1005.13. Therefore, remittance transfer providers must retain documentation, including documentation related to error investigations, for a period of not less than two years from the date a notice of error was submitted to the provider or action was required to be taken by the provider. A remittance transfer provider need not maintain records of individual disclosures that it has provided to each sender; it <PRTPAGE P="287"/>need only retain evidence demonstrating that its procedures reasonably ensure the sender's receipt of required disclosures and documentation.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">33(h) Incorrect Account Number Supplied</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Reasonable methods of verification.</E> When a sender provides an incorrect recipient institution identifier, § 1005.33(h)(2) limits the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) to situations where the provider used reasonably available means to verify that the recipient institution identifier provided by the sender did correspond to the recipient institution name provided by the sender. Reasonably available means may include accessing a directory of Business Identifier Codes and verifying that the code provided by the sender matches the provided institution name, and, if possible, the specific branch or location provided by the sender. Providers may also rely on other commercially available databases or directories to check other recipient institution identifiers. If reasonable verification means fail to identify that the recipient institution identifier is incorrect, the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) will apply, assuming that the provider can satisfy the other conditions in § 1005.33(h). Similarly, if no reasonably available means exist to verify the accuracy of the recipient institution identifier, § 1005.33(h)(2) would be satisfied and thus the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) also will apply, again assuming the provider can satisfy the other conditions in § 1005.33(h). However, where a provider does not employ reasonably available means to verify a recipient institution identifier, § 1005.33(h)(2) is not satisfied and the exception in § 1005.33(a)(1)(iv)(D) will not apply.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Reasonable efforts.</E> Section 1005.33(h)(5) requires a remittance transfer provider to use reasonable efforts to recover the amount that was to be received by the designated recipient. Whether a provider has used reasonable efforts does not depend on whether the provider is ultimately successful in recovering the amount that was to be received by the designated recipient. Under § 1005.33(h)(5), if the remittance transfer provider is requested to provide documentation or other supporting information in order for the pertinent institution or authority to obtain the proper authorization for the return of the incorrectly credited amount, reasonable efforts to recover the amount include timely providing any such documentation to the extent that it is available and permissible under law. The following are examples of reasonable efforts:</P>
            <P>i. The remittance transfer provider promptly calls or otherwise contacts the institution that received the transfer, either directly or indirectly through any correspondent(s) or other intermediaries or service providers used for the particular transfer, to request that the amount that was to be received by the designated recipient be returned, and if required by law or contract, by requesting that the recipient institution obtain a debit authorization from the holder of the incorrectly credited account.</P>
            <P>ii. The remittance transfer provider promptly uses a messaging service through a funds transfer system to contact institution that received the transfer, either directly or indirectly through any correspondent(s) or other intermediaries or service providers used for the particular transfer, to request that the amount that was to be received by the designated recipient be returned, in accordance with the messaging service's rules and protocol, and if required by law or contract, by requesting that the recipient institution obtain a debit authorization from the holder of the incorrectly credited account.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Promptness of Reasonable Efforts.</E> Section 1005.33(h)(5) requires that a remittance transfer provider act promptly in using reasonable efforts to recover the amount that was to be received by the designated recipient. Whether a provider acts promptly to use reasonable efforts depends on the facts and circumstances. For example, if, before the date of availability disclosed pursuant to § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii), the sender informs the provider that the sender provided a mistaken account number, the provider will have acted promptly if it attempts to contact the recipient's institution before the date of availability.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Section 1005.34—Procedures for Cancellation and Refund of Remittance Transfers</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">34(a) Sender Right of Cancellation and Refund</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Content of cancellation request.</E> A request to cancel a remittance transfer is valid so long as the remittance transfer provider is able to identify the remittance transfer in question. For example, the sender could provide the confirmation number or code that would be used by the designated recipient to pick up the transfer or other identification number or code supplied by the remittance transfer provider in connection with the transfer, if such number or code is sufficient for the remittance transfer provider to identify the transfer. A remittance transfer provider may also request, or the sender may provide, the sender's email address instead of a physical address, so long as the remittance transfer provider is able to identify the transfer to which the request to cancel applies.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Notice of cancellation right.</E> Section 1005.31 requires a remittance transfer provider to include an abbreviated notice of the sender's right to cancel a remittance transfer on the receipt or combined disclosure given under <PRTPAGE P="288"/>§ 1005.31(b)(2) or (3). In addition, the remittance transfer provider must make available to a sender upon request, a notice providing a full description of the right to cancel a remittance transfer using language that is set forth in Model Form A-36 of Appendix A to this part or substantially similar language.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Thirty-minute cancellation right.</E> A remittance transfer provider must comply with the cancellation and refund requirements of § 1005.34 if the cancellation request is received by the provider no later than 30 minutes after the sender makes payment. The provider may, at its option, provide a longer time period for cancellation. A provider must provide the 30-minute cancellation right regardless of the provider's normal business hours. For example, if an agent closes less than 30 minutes after the sender makes payment, the provider could opt to take cancellation requests through the telephone number disclosed on the receipt. The provider could also set a cutoff time after which the provider will not accept requests to send a remittance transfer. For example, a financial institution that closes at 5:00 p.m. could stop accepting payment for remittance transfers after 4:30 p.m.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Cancellation request provided to agent.</E> A cancellation request provided by a sender to an agent of the remittance transfer provider is deemed to be received by the provider under § 1005.34(a) when received by the agent.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Payment made.</E> For purposes of subpart B, payment is made, for example, when a sender provides cash to the remittance transfer provider or when payment is authorized.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">34(b) Time Limits and Refund Requirements</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Form of refund.</E> At its discretion, a remittance transfer provider generally may issue a refund either in cash or in the same form of payment that was initially provided by the sender for the remittance transfer. For example, if the sender originally provided a credit card as payment for the transfer, the remittance transfer provider may issue a credit to the sender's credit card account in the amount of the payment. However, if a sender initially provided cash for the remittance transfer, a provider may issue a refund by check. For example, if the sender originally provided cash as payment for the transfer, the provider may mail a check to the sender in the amount of the payment.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Fees and taxes refunded.</E> If a sender provides a timely request to cancel a remittance transfer, a remittance transfer provider must refund all funds provided by the sender in connection with the remittance transfer, including any fees and, to the extent not prohibited by law, taxes that have been imposed for the transfer, whether the fee or tax was assessed by the provider or a third party, such as an intermediary institution, the agent or bank in the recipient country, or a State or other governmental body.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Section 1005.35—Acts of Agents</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">General.</E> Remittance transfer providers must comply with the requirements of subpart B, including, but not limited to, providing the disclosures set forth in § 1005.31 and providing any remedies as set forth in § 1005.33, even if an agent or other person performs functions for the remittance transfer provider, and regardless of whether the provider has an agreement with a third party that transfers or otherwise makes funds available to a designated recipient.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Section 1005.36—Transfers Scheduled Before the Date of Transfer</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Applicability of subpart B.</E> The requirements set forth in subpart B apply to remittance transfers subject to § 1005.36, to the extent that § 1005.36 does not modify those requirements. For example, the foreign language disclosure requirements in § 1005.31(g) and related commentary continue to apply to disclosures provided in accordance with § 1005.36(a)(2).</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">36(a) Timing</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">36(a)(2) Subsequent Preauthorized Remittance Transfers</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Changes in Disclosures.</E> When a sender schedules a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, the provider is generally not required to provide a pre-payment disclosure prior to the date of each subsequent transfer. However, § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) requires the provider to provide a pre-payment disclosure and receipt for the first in the series of preauthorized remittance transfers in accordance with the timing requirements set forth in § 1005.31(e). While certain information in those disclosures is expressly permitted to be estimated (see § 1005.32(b)(2)), other information is not permitted to be estimated, or is limited in how it may be estimated. When any of the information on the most recent receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) or (a)(2)(i), other than the temporal disclosures required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) and (b)(2)(vii), is no longer accurate with respect to a subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer for reasons other than as permitted by § 1005.32, the provider must provide, within a reasonable time prior to the scheduled date of the next preauthorized remittance transfer, a receipt that complies with § 1005.31(b)(2) and which discloses, among the other disclosures required by § 1005.31(b)(2), the changed terms. For example, if the provider discloses in the pre-payment disclosure for the first in the series of preauthorized remittance transfers that its fee for each remittance transfer is $20 and, after six preauthorized remittance <PRTPAGE P="289"/>transfers, the provider increases its fee to $30 (to the extent permitted by contract law), the provider must provide the sender a receipt that complies with §§ 1005.31(b)(2) and 1005.36(b)(2) within a reasonable time prior to the seventh transfer. Barring a further change, this receipt will apply to transfers after the seventh transfer. Or, if, after the sixth transfer, a tax collected by the provider increases from 1.5% of the amount that will be transferred to the designated recipient to 2.0% of the amount that will be transferred to the designated recipient, the provider must provide the sender a receipt that complies with §§ 1005.31(b)(2) and 1005.36(b)(2) within a reasonable time prior to the seventh transfer. In contrast, § 1005.36(a)(2)(i) does not require an updated receipt where an exchange rate, estimated as permitted by § 1005.32(b)(2), changes.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Clearly and conspicuously.</E> In order to indicate clearly and conspicuously that the provider's fee has changed as required by § 1005.36(a)(2)(i), the provider could, for example, state on the receipt: “Transfer Fees (UPDATED) * * * $30.” To the extent that other figures on the receipt must be revised because of the new fee, the receipt should also indicate that those figures are updated.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Reasonable time.</E> If a disclosure required by § 1005.36(a)(2)(i) or (d)(1) is mailed, the disclosure would be considered to be received by the sender five business days after it is posted in the mail. If hand delivered or provided electronically, the receipt would be considered to be received by the sender at the time of delivery. Thus, if the provider mails a disclosure required by § 1005.36(a)(2)(i) or (d)(1) not later than ten business days before the scheduled date of the transfer, or hand or electronically delivers a disclosure not later than five business days before the scheduled date of the transfer, the provider would be deemed to have provided the disclosure within a reasonable time prior to the scheduled date of the subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">36(b) Accuracy</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Use of estimates.</E> In providing the disclosures described in § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) or (a)(2)(i), remittance transfer providers may use estimates to the extent permitted by any of the exceptions in § 1005.32. When estimates are permitted, however, they must be disclosed in accordance with § 1005.31(d).</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers.</E> For a subsequent transfer in a series of preauthorized remittance transfers, the receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i), except for the temporal disclosures in that receipt required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(ii) (Date Available) and (b)(2)(vii) (Transfer Date), applies to each subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer unless and until it is superseded by a receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(2)(i). For each subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer, only the most recent receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) or (a)(2)(i) must be accurate as of the date each subsequent transfer is made.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Receipts.</E> A receipt required by § 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) or (a)(2)(ii) must accurately reflect the details of the transfer to which it pertains and may not contain estimates pursuant to § 1005.32(b)(2). However, the remittance transfer provider may continue to disclose estimates to the extent permitted by § 1005.32(a) or (b)(1). In providing receipts pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) or (a)(2)(ii), § 1005.36(b)(2) and (3) do not allow a remittance transfer provider to change figures previously disclosed on a receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) or (a)(2)(i), unless a figure was an estimate or based on an estimate disclosed pursuant to § 1005.32. Thus, for example, if a provider disclosed its fee as $10 in a receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i) and that receipt contained an estimate of the exchange rate pursuant to § 1005.32(b)(2), the second receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(ii) must also disclose the fee as $10.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">36(c) Cancellation</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Scheduled remittance transfer.</E> Section 1005.36(c) applies when a remittance transfer is scheduled by the sender at least three business days before the date of the transfer, whether the sender schedules a preauthorized remittance transfer or a one-time transfer. A remittance transfer is scheduled if it will require no further action by the sender to send the transfer after the sender requests the transfer. For example, a remittance transfer is scheduled at least three business days before the date of the transfer, and § 1005.36(c) applies, where a sender on March 1 requests a remittance transfer provider to send a wire transfer to pay a bill in a foreign country on March 15, if it will require no further action by the sender to send the transfer after the sender requests the transfer. A remittance transfer is not scheduled, and § 1005.36(c) does not apply, where a transfer occurs more than three days after the date the sender requests the transfer solely due to the provider's processing time. The following are examples of when a sender has not scheduled a remittance transfer at least three business days before the date of the remittance transfer, such that the cancellation rule in § 1005.34 applies.</P>
            <P>i. A sender on March 1 requests a remittance transfer provider to send a wire transfer to pay a bill in a foreign country on March 3.</P>

            <P>ii. A sender on March 1 requests that a remittance transfer provider send a remittance transfer on March 15, but the provider requires the sender to confirm the request on March 14 in order to send the transfer.<PRTPAGE P="290"/>
            </P>
            <P>iii. A sender on March 1 requests that a remittance transfer provider send an ACH transfer, and that transfer is sent on March 2, but due to the time required for processing, funds will not be deducted from the sender's account until March 5.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Cancelled preauthorized remittance transfers.</E> For preauthorized remittance transfers, the provider must assume the request to cancel applies to all future preauthorized remittance transfers, unless the sender specifically indicates that it should apply only to the next scheduled remittance transfer.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Concurrent cancellation obligations.</E> A financial institution that is also a remittance transfer provider may have both stop payment obligations under § 1005.10 and cancellation obligations under § 1005.36. If a sender cancels a remittance transfer under § 1005.36 with a remittance transfer provider that holds the sender's account, and the transfer is a preauthorized transfer under § 1005.10, then the cancellation provisions of § 1005.36 exclusively apply.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">36(d) Date of Transfer for Subsequent Preauthorized Remittance Transfers</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">General.</E> Section 1005.36(d)(2)(i) permits remittance transfer providers some flexibility in determining how and when the disclosures required by § 1005.36(d)(1) may be provided to senders. The disclosure described in § 1005.36(d)(1) may be provided as a separate disclosure, or on or with any other disclosure required by this subpart B related to the same series of preauthorized remittance transfers, provided that the disclosure and timing requirements in § 1005.36(d)(2) and other applicable provisions in subpart B are satisfied. For example, the required disclosures may be made on or with a receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(1)(i); a receipt provided pursuant to § 1005.36(a)(2); or in a separate disclosure created by the provider. Thus, for example, a remittance transfer provider complies with § 1005.36(d)(1) for a period of one year if it provides in the receipt provided to the sender when payment is made for the initial preauthorized remittance transfer, a schedule or summary of the dates of transfer of all the subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers in the series scheduled to occur over the next 12 months (and the applicable cancellation requirements and contact information).</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Delivery of disclosure.</E> Section 1005.36(d)(2)(i) requires that the sender receive disclosure of the date of transfer, applicable cancellation requirements, and the provider's contact information no more than 12 months, and no less than 5 business days prior to the date of transfer of the subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer. For purposes of determining when a disclosure required by § 1005.36(d)(1) is received by the sender, refer to comment 36(a)(2)-3.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Disclosure of the date of transfer.</E> The date of transfer of a subsequent preauthorized remittance transfer may be disclosed as a specific date (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> July 19, 2013) or by using a method that clearly permits identification of the date of the transfer, such as periodic intervals (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the third Monday of every month, or the 15th of every month). If the future dates of transfer are disclosed as occurring periodically and there is a break in the sequence, or the date of transfer does not otherwise conform to the described period, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> if a holiday or weekend causes the provider to deviate from the normal schedule, the remittance transfer provider should disclose the specific date of transfer for the affected transfer.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Accuracy requirements.</E> Section 1005.36(d)(4) sets forth accuracy requirements for disclosures required for subsequent preauthorized remittance transfers under § 1005.36(d)(1). If any of the information provided in these disclosures change, the provider must provide an updated disclosure with the revised information that is accurate as of when the transfer is made, pursuant to § 1005.36(d)(2).</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Appendix A—Model Disclosure Clauses and Forms</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Review of forms.</E> The Bureau will not review or approve disclosure forms or statements for financial institutions. However, the Bureau has issued model clauses for institutions to use in designing their disclosures. If an institution uses these clauses accurately to reflect its service, the institution is protected from liability for failure to make disclosures in proper form.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Use of forms.</E> The appendix contains model disclosure clauses for optional use by financial institutions and remittance transfer providers to facilitate compliance with the disclosure requirements of §§ 1005.5(b)(2) and (3), 1005.6(a), 1005.7, 1005.8(b), 1005.14(b)(1)(ii), 1005.15(d)(1) and (2), 1005.18(c)(1) and (2), 1005.31, 1005.32 and 1005.36. The use of appropriate clauses in making disclosures will protect a financial institution and a remittance transfer provider from liability under sections 916 and 917 of the act provided the clauses accurately reflect the institution's EFT services and the provider's remittance transfer services, respectively.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Altering the clauses.</E> Financial institutions may use clauses of their own design in conjunction with the Bureau's model clauses. The inapplicable words or portions of phrases in parentheses should be deleted. The catchlines are not part of the clauses and need not be used. Financial institutions may make alterations, substitutions, or additions in the clauses to reflect the services offered, such as technical changes (including the substitution of a trade name for the word “card,” deletion of inapplicable services, or <PRTPAGE P="291"/>substitution of lesser liability limits). Several of the model clauses include references to a telephone number and address. Where two or more of these clauses are used in a disclosure, the telephone number and address may be referenced and need not be repeated.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Model forms for remittance transfers.</E> The Bureau will not review or approve disclosure forms for remittance transfer providers. However, this appendix contains 15 model forms for use in connection with remittance transfers. These model forms are intended to demonstrate several formats a remittance transfer provider may use to comply with the requirements of § 1005.31(b). Model Forms A-30 through A-32 demonstrate how a provider could provide the required disclosures for a remittance transfer exchanged into local currency. Model Forms A-30(a), (b), (c), and (d) demonstrate four options regarding model language related to the required disclaimer, where applicable, of non-covered third-party fees and taxes on the remittance transfer collected by a person other than the provider under § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii). Model forms 30(b) through (d) also include language that may be used if a provider elects to estimate either these non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected by a person other than the provider as part of the disclaimer. Model Forms A-33 through A-35 demonstrate how a provider could provide the required disclosures for dollar-to-dollar remittance transfers. These forms also demonstrate disclosure of the required content, in accordance with the grouping and proximity requirements of § 1005.31(c)(1) and (2), in both a register receipt format and an 8.5 inch by 11 inch format. Model Form A-36 provides long form model error resolution and cancellation disclosures required by § 1005.31(b)(4), and Model Form A-37 provides short form model error resolution and cancellation disclosures required by § 1005.31(b)(2)(iv) and (vi). Model Forms A-38 through A-41 provide language for Spanish language disclosures.</P>

The model forms contain information that is not required by subpart B, including a confirmation code, the sender's name and contact information, and the optional disclosure of the estimated amount of these non-covered third-party fees and taxes collected by a person other than the provider as part of the disclaimer. Additional information not required by subpart B may be presented on the model forms as permitted by § 1005.31(b)(1)(viii) and (c)(4). Any additional information must be presented consistent with a remittance transfer provider's obligation to provide required disclosures in a clear and conspicuous manner.</P>
            <P>ii. Use of the model forms is optional. A remittance transfer provider may change the forms by rearranging the format or by making modifications to the language of the forms, in each case without modifying the substance of the disclosures. Any rearrangement or modification of the format of the model forms must be consistent with the form, grouping, proximity, and other requirements of § 1005.31(a) and (c). Providers making revisions that do not comply with this section will lose the benefit of the safe harbor for appropriate use of Model Forms A-30 to A-41.</P>
            <P>iii. Permissible changes to the language and format of the model forms include, for example:</P>
            <P>A. Substituting the information contained in the model forms that is intended to demonstrate how to complete the information in the model forms—such as names, addresses, and Web sites; dates; numbers; and State-specific contact information—with information applicable to the remittance transfer. In addition, if the applicable non-covered third-party fees are imposed by an institution other than a bank, a provider could modify the disclaimer accordingly.</P>
            <P>B. Eliminating disclosures that are not applicable to the transfer, as described under § 1005.31(b). For example, if only covered third-party fees are imposed, a provider would not use a disclaimer related to additional fees that may apply because all applicable fees are covered and included in the disclosure as required under § 1005.31(b)(1)(vi).</P>
            <P>C. Correcting or updating telephone numbers, mailing addresses, or Web site addresses that may change over time.</P>
            <P>D. Providing the disclosures on a paper size that is different from a register receipt and 8.5 inch by 11 inch formats.</P>
            <P>E. Adding a term substantially similar to “estimated” in close proximity to the specified terms in § 1005.31(b)(1) and (2), as required under § 1005.31(d).</P>
            <P>F. Providing the disclosures in a foreign language, or multiple foreign languages, subject to the requirements of § 1005.31(g).</P>
            <P>G. Substituting cancellation language to reflect the right to a cancellation made pursuant to the requirements of § 1005.36(c).</P>
            <P>iv. Changes to the model forms that are not permissible include, for example, adding information that is not segregated from the required disclosures, other than as permitted by § 1005.31(c)(4).</P>

                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 2(b)(3)(i)</HD>
                  <P>1. <E T="03">Debit card includes prepaid card.</E> For purposes of subpart A of Regulation E, unless otherwise specified, the term debit card also includes a prepaid card.</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Certain employment-related cards not covered as payroll card accounts.</E> The term “payroll card account” does not include an account used solely to disburse incentive-based payments (other than commissions which can represent the primary means through which a consumer is paid), such as bonuses, which are unlikely to be a consumer's primary source of salary or other compensation. The term also does not include an account used solely to make disbursements unrelated to compensation, such as petty cash reimbursements or travel per diem payments. Similarly, a payroll card account does not include an account that is used in isolated instances to which an employer typically does not make recurring payments, such as when providing final payments or in emergency situations when other payment methods are unavailable. While such accounts would not be payroll card accounts, such accounts could constitute prepaid accounts generally, provided the other conditions of the definition of that term in § 1005.2(b)(3) are satisfied. In addition, all transactions involving the transfer of funds to or from a payroll card account or prepaid account are covered by the regulation, even if a particular transaction involves payment of a bonus, other incentive-based payment, or reimbursement, or the transaction does not represent a transfer of wages, salary, or other employee compensation.</P>
                  <P>3. <E T="03">Marketed or labeled as “prepaid.”</E> The term “marketed or labeled as `prepaid' ” means promoting or advertising an account using the term “prepaid.” For example, an account is marketed or labeled as prepaid if the term “prepaid” appears on the access device associated with the account or the access device's packaging materials, or on a display, advertisement, or other publication to promote purchase or use of the account. An account may be marketed or labeled as prepaid if the financial institution, its service provider, including a program manager, or the payment network on which an access device for the account is used, promotes or advertises, or contracts with another party to promote or advertise, the account using the label “prepaid.” A product or service that is marketed or labeled as prepaid is not a “prepaid account” pursuant to § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(C) if it does not otherwise meet the definition of account under § 1005.2(b)(1).</P>
                  <P>4. <E T="03">Issued on a prepaid basis.</E> To be issued on a prepaid basis, a prepaid account must be loaded with funds when it is first provided to the consumer for use. For example, if a consumer purchases a prepaid account and provides funds that are loaded onto a card at the time of purchase, the prepaid account is issued on a prepaid basis.</P>
                  <P>5. <E T="03">Capable of being loaded with funds.</E> A prepaid account that is not issued on a prepaid basis but is capable of being loaded with funds thereafter includes a prepaid card issued to a consumer with a zero balance to which funds may be loaded by the consumer or a third party subsequent to issuance.</P>
                  <P>6. <E T="03">Prepaid account acting as a pass-through vehicle for funds.</E> To satisfy § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D), <PRTPAGE P="293"/>a prepaid account must be issued on a prepaid basis or be capable of being loaded with funds. This means that the prepaid account must be capable of holding funds, rather than merely acting as a pass-through vehicle. For example, if a product, such as a digital wallet, is only capable of storing a consumer's payment credentials for other accounts but is incapable of having funds stored on it, such a product is not a prepaid account. However, if a product allows a consumer to transfer funds, which can be stored before the consumer designates a destination for the funds, the product satisfies § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D).</P>
                  <P>7. <E T="03">Not required to be reloadable.</E> Prepaid accounts need not be reloadable by the consumer or a third party.</P>
                  <P>8. <E T="03">Primary function.</E> To satisfy § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D), an account's primary function must be to provide consumers with general transaction capability, which includes the general ability to use loaded funds to conduct transactions with multiple, unaffiliated merchants for goods or services, or at automated teller machines, or to conduct person-to-person transfers. This definition excludes accounts that provide such capability only incidentally. For example, the primary function of a brokerage account is to hold funds so that the consumer can conduct transactions through a licensed broker or firm, not to conduct transactions with multiple, unaffiliated merchants for good or services, or at automated teller machines, or to conduct person-to-person transfers. Similarly, the primary function of a savings account is to accrue interest on funds held in the account; such accounts restrict the extent to which the consumer can conduct general transactions and withdrawals. Accordingly, brokerage accounts and savings accounts do not satisfy § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D), and thus are not prepaid accounts as defined by § 1005.2(b)(3). The following examples provide additional guidance:</P>

                  <P>i. An account's primary function is to enable a consumer to conduct transactions with multiple, unaffiliated merchants for goods or services, at automated teller machines, or to conduct person-to-person transfers, even if the account also enables a third party to disburse funds to a consumer. For example, a prepaid account that conveys tax refunds or insurance proceeds to a consumer meets the primary function test if the account can be used, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> to purchase goods or services at multiple, unaffiliated merchants.</P>
                  <P>ii. Whether an account satisfies § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D) is determined by reference to the account, not the access device associated with the account. An account satisfies § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D) even if the account's access device can be used for other purposes, for example, as a form of identification. Such accounts may include, for example, a prepaid account used to disburse student loan proceeds via a card device that can be used at unaffiliated merchants or to withdraw cash from an automated teller machine, even if that access device also acts as a student identification card.</P>
                  <P>iii. Where multiple accounts are associated with the same access device, the primary function of each account is determined separately. One or more accounts can satisfy § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D) even if other accounts associated with the same access device do not. For example, a student identification card may act as an access device associated with two separate accounts: An account used to conduct transactions with multiple, unaffiliated merchants for goods or services, and an account used to conduct closed-loop transactions on campus. The account used to conduct transactions with multiple, unaffiliated merchants for goods or services satisfies § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D), even though the account used to conduct closed-loop transactions does not (and as such the latter is not a prepaid account as defined by § 1005.2(b)(3)).</P>
                  <P>iv. An account satisfies § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D) if its primary function is to provide general transaction capability, even if an individual consumer does not in fact use it to conduct multiple transactions. For example, the fact that a consumer may choose to withdraw the entire account balance at an automated teller machine or transfer it to another account held by the consumer does not change the fact that the account's primary function is to provide general transaction capability.</P>
                  <P>v. An account whose primary function is other than to conduct transactions with multiple, unaffiliated merchants for goods or services, or at automated teller machines, or to conduct person-to-person transfers, does not satisfy § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D). Such accounts may include, for example, a product whose only function is to make a one-time transfer of funds into a separate prepaid account.</P>
                  <P>9. <E T="03">Redeemable upon presentation at multiple, unaffiliated merchants.</E> For guidance, see comments 20(a)(3)-1 and -2.</P>
                  <P>10. <E T="03">Person-to-person transfers.</E> A prepaid account whose primary function is to conduct person-to-person transfers is an account that allows a consumer to send funds by electronic fund transfer to another consumer or business. An account may qualify as a prepaid account if its primary function is person-to-person transfers even if it is neither redeemable upon presentation at multiple, unaffiliated merchants for goods or services, nor usable at automated teller machines. A transaction involving a store gift card would not be a person-to-person transfer if it could only be used to make payments to the merchant or affiliated group of merchants on whose behalf the card was issued.</P>
                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 2(b)(3)(ii)</HD>
                  <P>1. <E T="03">Excluded health care and employee benefit related prepaid products.</E> For purposes of <PRTPAGE P="294"/>§ 1005.2(b)(3)(ii)(A), “health savings account” means a health savings account as defined in 26 U.S.C. 223(d); “flexible spending arrangement” means a health benefits or a health flexible spending arrangement pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 125; “medical savings account” means an Archer MSA as defined in 26 U.S.C. 220(d); “health reimbursement arrangement” means a health reimbursement arrangement which is treated as employer-provided coverage under an accident or health plan for purposes of 26 U.S.C. 106; “dependent care assistance program” means a dependent care assistance program pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 129; and “transit or parking reimbursement arrangement” means a qualified transportation fringe benefit provided by an employer pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 132.</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Excluded disaster relief funds.</E> For purposes of § 1005.2(b)(3)(ii)(B), “qualified disaster relief funds” means funds made available through a qualified disaster relief program as defined in 26 U.S.C. 139(b).</P>
                  <P>3. <E T="03">Marketed and labeled as a gift card or gift certificate.</E> Section 1005.2(b)(3)(ii)(D) excludes, among other things, reloadable general-use prepaid cards that are both marketed and labeled as gift cards or gift certificates, whereas § 1005.20(b)(2) excludes such products that are marketed or labeled as gift cards or gift certificates. Comment 20(b)(2)-2 describes, in part, a network-branded GPR card that is principally advertised as a less-costly alternative to a bank account but is promoted in a television, radio, newspaper, or Internet advertisement, or on signage as “the perfect gift” during the holiday season. For purposes of § 1005.20, such a product would be considered marketed as a gift card or gift certificate because of this occasional holiday marketing activity. For purposes of § 1005.2(b)(3)(ii)(D), however, such a product would not be considered to be both marketed and labeled as a gift card or gift certificate and thus would be covered by the definition of prepaid account.<STARS/>

                  <P>1. <E T="03">General rule for loan payments.</E> Creditors may not require repayment of loans by electronic means on a preauthorized, recurring basis.</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Overdraft credit plans not accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards.</E> i. Section 1005.10(e)(1) provides an exception from the general rule for an overdraft credit plan other than for a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.61. A financial institution may therefore require the automatic repayment of an overdraft credit plan, other than a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card, even if the overdraft extension is charged to an open-end account that may be accessed by the consumer in ways other than by overdrafts.</P>
                  <P>ii. Credit extended through a negative balance on the asset feature of a prepaid account that meets the conditions of Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.61(a)(4), is considered credit extended pursuant to an overdraft credit plan for purposes of § 1005.10(e)(1). Thus, the exception for overdraft credit plans in § 1005.10(e)(1) applies to this credit.</P>
                  <P>3. <E T="03">Applicability to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards.</E> i. Under § 1005.10(e)(1), creditors may not require by electronic means on a preauthorized, recurring basis repayment of credit extended under a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.61. The prohibition in § 1005.10(e)(1) applies to any credit extended under such a credit feature, including preauthorized checks. <E T="03">See</E> Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.61, and comment 61(a)(1)-3.</P>

                  <P>ii. Under Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.12(d)(1), a card issuer may not take any action, either before or after termination of credit card privileges, to offset a cardholder's indebtedness arising from a consumer credit transaction under the relevant credit card plan against funds of the cardholder held on deposit with the card issuer. Under Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.12(d)(3), with respect to covered separate credit features accessible by hybrid prepaid-credit cards as defined in 12 CFR 1026.61, a card issuer generally is not prohibited from periodically deducting all or part of the cardholder's credit card debt from a deposit account (such as a prepaid account) held with the card issuer under a plan that is authorized in writing by the cardholder, so long as the card issuer does not make such deductions to the plan more frequently than <PRTPAGE P="295"/>once per calendar month. A card issuer is prohibited under Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.12(d), from automatically deducting all or part of the cardholder's credit card debt under a covered separate credit feature from a deposit account (such as a prepaid account) held with the card issuer on a daily or weekly basis, or whenever deposits are made to the deposit account. Section 1005.10(e)(1) further restricts the card issuer from requiring payment from a deposit account (such as a prepaid account) of credit card balances of a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card by electronic means on a preauthorized, recurring basis.</P>
                  <P>4. <E T="03">Incentives.</E> A creditor may offer a program with a reduced annual percentage rate or other cost-related incentive for an automatic repayment feature, provided the program with the automatic payment feature is not the only loan program offered by the creditor for the type of credit involved. Examples include:</P>
                  <P>i. Mortgages with graduated payments in which a pledged savings account is automatically debited during an initial period to supplement the monthly payments made by the borrower.</P>
                  <P>ii. Mortgage plans calling for preauthorized biweekly payments that are debited electronically to the consumer's account and produce a lower total finance charge.</P>

                  <STARS/>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Government benefit.</E> A government agency may not require consumers to receive government benefits by direct deposit to any particular institution. A government agency may require direct deposit of benefits by electronic means if recipients are allowed to choose the institution that will receive the direct deposit. Alternatively, a government agency may give recipients the choice of having their benefits deposited at a particular institution (designated by the government agency) or receiving their benefits by another means.<STARS/>

                  <P>1. <E T="03">Issuance rules for access devices other than access devices for prepaid accounts.</E> For access devices that also constitute credit cards (other than access devices for prepaid accounts), the issuance rules of Regulation E apply if the only credit feature is a preexisting credit line attached to the asset account to cover overdrafts (or to maintain a specified minimum balance) or an overdraft service, as defined in § 1005.17(a). Regulation Z (12 CFR part 1026) rules apply if there is another type of credit feature; for example, one permitting direct extensions of credit that do not involve the asset account.</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Overdraft services.</E> The addition of an overdraft service, as that term is defined in § 1005.17(a), to an accepted access device does not constitute the addition of a credit feature subject to Regulation Z. Instead, the provisions of Regulation E apply, including the liability limitations (§ 1005.6) and the requirement to obtain consumer consent to the service before any fees or charges for paying an overdraft may be assessed on the account (§ 1005.17).</P>
                  <P>3. <E T="03">Issuance of prepaid access devices that can access a covered separate credit feature subject to Regulation Z.</E> An access device for a prepaid account cannot access a covered separate credit feature as defined in Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.61, when the access device is issued if the access device is issued prior to the expiration of the 30-day period set forth in 12 CFR 1026.61(c). Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.61(c), provides that with respect to a covered separate credit feature that could be accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card at any point, a card issuer must not do any of the following until 30 days after the prepaid account has been registered: (1) Open a covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card; (2) make a solicitation or provide an application to open a covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card; or (3) allow an existing credit feature that was opened prior to the consumer to become a covered separate credit feature accessible by the hybrid prepaid-credit card. An access device for a prepaid account that is not a hybrid prepaid-credit card as that term is defined in Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.61, is subject to the issuance rules in Regulation E.</P>
                  <P>4. <E T="03">Addition of a covered separate credit feature to an existing access device for a prepaid account.</E> Regulation Z governs the addition of a covered separate credit feature as that term is defined in Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.61, to an existing access device for a prepaid account. In this case, the access device would become a hybrid prepaid-credit card under Regulation Z (12 CFR part 1026). A covered separate credit feature may be added to a previously issued access device for a prepaid account only upon the consumer's application or specific request as described in Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.12(a)(1), and only in compliance with 12 CFR 1026.61(c).</P>
                  <P>5. <E T="03">Determining applicable regulation related to liability and error resolution.</E> i. Under § 1005.12(a)(1)(iv)(B), with respect to a transaction that involves a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature on a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as those terms are defined in Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.61, where credit is extended under a covered separate <PRTPAGE P="296"/>credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card that is incident to an electronic fund transfer when the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses both funds in the asset feature of a prepaid account and credit extensions from the credit feature with respect to a particular transaction, Regulation E's liability limitations and error resolution provisions apply to the transaction, in addition to Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.13(d) and (g) (which apply because of the extension of credit associated with the covered separate credit feature). Section 1005.12(a)(1)(iv)(C) provides that with respect to transactions that involves credit extended through a negative balance to the asset feature of a prepaid account that meets the conditions set forth in Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.61(a)(4), these transactions are governed solely by the liability limitations and error resolution procedures in Regulation E, and Regulation Z does not apply. Section 1005.12(a)(1)(iv)(D) and (a)(2)(iii), taken together, provide that with respect to transactions involving a prepaid account and a non-covered separate credit feature as defined in Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.61, a financial institution must comply with Regulation E's liability limitations and error resolution procedures with respect to transactions that access the prepaid account as applicable, and the creditor must comply with Regulation Z's liability limitations and error resolution procedures with respect to transactions that access the non-covered separate credit feature, as applicable.</P>
                  <P>ii. Under § 1005.12(a)(1)(iv)(A), with respect to an account (other than a prepaid account) where credit is extended incident to an electronic fund transfer under an agreement to extend overdraft credit between the consumer and the financial institution, Regulation E's liability limitations and error resolution provisions apply to the transaction, in addition to Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.13(d) and (g) (which apply because of the extension of credit associated with the overdraft feature on the asset account).</P>
                  <P>iii. For transactions involving access devices that also function as credit cards under Regulation Z (12 CFR part 1026), whether Regulation E or Regulation Z applies depends on the nature of the transaction. For example, if the transaction solely involves an extension of credit, and does not access funds in a consumer asset account, such as a checking account or prepaid account, the liability limitations and error resolution requirements of Regulation Z apply. If the transaction accesses funds in an asset account only (with no credit extended), the provisions of Regulation E apply. If the transaction access funds in an asset account but also involves an extension of credit under the overdraft credit feature subject to Regulation Z attached to the account, Regulation E's liability limitations and error resolution provisions apply, in addition to Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.13(d) and (g) (which apply because of the extension of credit associated with the overdraft feature on the asset account). If a consumer's access device is also a credit card and the device is used to make unauthorized withdrawals from an asset account, but also is used to obtain unauthorized cash advances directly from a credit feature that is subject to Regulation Z that is separate from the asset account, both Regulation E and Regulation Z apply.</P>
                  <P>iv. The following examples illustrate these principles:</P>
                  <P>A. A consumer has a card that can be used either as a credit card or an access device that draws on the consumer's checking account. When used as a credit card, the card does not first access any funds in the checking account but draws only on a separate credit feature subject to Regulation Z. If the card is stolen and used as a credit card to make purchases or to get cash advances at an ATM from the line of credit, the liability limits and error resolution provisions of Regulation Z apply; Regulation E does not apply.</P>
                  <P>B. In the same situation, if the card is stolen and is used as an access device to make purchases or to get cash withdrawals at an ATM from the checking account, the liability limits and error resolution provisions of Regulation E apply; Regulation Z does not apply.</P>
                  <P>C. In the same situation, assume the card is stolen and used both as an access device for the checking account and as a credit card; for example, the thief makes some purchases using the card to access funds in the checking account and other purchases using the card as a credit card. Here, the liability limits and error resolution provisions of Regulation E apply to the unauthorized transactions in which the card was used as an access device for the checking account, and the corresponding provisions of Regulation Z apply to the unauthorized transactions in which the card was used as a credit card.</P>

                  <P>D. Assume a somewhat different type of card, one that draws on the consumer's checking account and can also draw on an overdraft credit feature subject to Regulation Z attached to the checking account. The overdraft credit feature associated with the card is accessed only when the consumer uses the card to make a purchase (or other transaction) for which there are insufficient or unavailable funds in the checking account. In this situation, if the card is stolen and used to make purchases funded entirely by available funds in the checking account, the liability limits and the error resolution provisions of Regulation E apply. If the use of the card results in an extension of credit that is incident to an electronic fund transfer where the transaction is funded partially by funds in the consumer's asset account and <PRTPAGE P="297"/>partially by credit extended under the overdraft credit feature, the error resolution provisions of Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.13(d) and (g), apply in addition to the Regulation E provisions, but the other liability limit and error resolution provisions of Regulation Z do not. Relatedly, if the use of the card is funded entirely by credit extended under the overdraft credit feature, the transaction is governed solely by the liability limitations and error resolution requirements of Regulation Z. <E T="03">See</E> Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.13(i).</P>

                  <P>E. The same principles in comment 12(a)-5.iv.A, B, C, and D apply to an access device for a prepaid account that also is a hybrid prepaid-credit card with respect to a covered separate credit feature under Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.61. <E T="03">See also</E> Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.13(i)(2) and comment 13(i)-4.</P>

                  <P>3. <E T="03">Preemption determination—Michigan.</E> The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System determined that certain provisions in the state law of Michigan are preempted by the Federal law, effective March 30, 1981:</P>
                  <P>i. <E T="03">Definition of unauthorized use.</E> Section 488.5(4) of the state law of Michigan, governing electronic fund transfers, is preempted to the extent that it relates to the section of state law governing consumer liability for unauthorized use of an access device.</P>
                  <P>ii. <E T="03">Consumer liability for unauthorized use of an account.</E> Section 488.14 of the state law of Michigan, governing electronic fund transfers, is preempted because it is inconsistent with § 1005.6 and is less protective of the consumer than the Federal law. The state law places liability on the consumer for the unauthorized use of an account in cases involving the consumer's negligence. Under the Federal law, a consumer's liability for unauthorized use is not related to the consumer's negligence and depends instead on the consumer's promptness in reporting the loss or theft of the access device.</P>
                  <P>iii. <E T="03">Error resolution.</E> Section 488.15 of the state law of Michigan, governing electronic fund transfers, is preempted because it is inconsistent with § 1005.11 and is less protective of the consumer than the Federal law. The state law allows financial institutions up to 70 days to resolve errors, whereas the Federal law generally requires errors to be resolved within 45 days.</P>

The state provisions require a different disclosure of information than does the Federal law. The receipt provision is also preempted because it allows the consumer to be charged for receiving a receipt if a machine cannot furnish one at the time of a transfer.</P>

                  <P>1. <E T="03">Disclosing the short and long form before acquisition.</E> Section 1005.15(c)(1) requires that, before a consumer acquires an account governed by § 1005.15, a government agency must comply with the pre-acquisition disclosure requirements applicable to prepaid accounts as set forth in § 1005.18(b). Section 1005.18(b)(1)(i) generally requires delivery of both the short form disclosure required by § 1005.18(b)(2), accompanied by the information in § 1005.18(b)(5), and the long form disclosure required by § 1005.18(b)(4) before a consumer acquires a prepaid account. For purposes of § 1005.15(c), a consumer is deemed to have received the disclosures required by § 1005.18(b) prior to acquisition when the consumer receives the disclosures before choosing to receive benefits via the government benefit account. The following example illustrates when a consumer receives disclosures before acquisition of an account for purposes of § 1005.15(c):</P>

                  <P>i. A government agency informs a consumer that she can receive distribution of benefits via a government benefit account in the form of a prepaid card. The consumer receives the prepaid card and the disclosures required by § 1005.18(b) to review at the time the consumer receives benefits eligibility information from the agency. After receiving <PRTPAGE P="298"/>the disclosures, the consumer chooses to receive benefits via the government benefit account. These disclosures were provided to the consumer pre-acquisition, and the agency has complied with § 1005.15(c). By contrast, if the consumer does not receive the disclosures required by § 1005.18(b) to review until the time at which the consumer received the first benefit payment deposited into the government benefit account, these disclosures were provided to the consumer post-acquisition, and were not provided in compliance with § 1005.15(c).</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Acquisition and disclosures given during the same appointment.</E> The disclosures and notice required by § 1005.15(c) may be given in the same process or appointment during which the consumer receives a government benefit card. When a consumer receives benefits eligibility information and enrolls to receive benefits during the same process or appointment, a government agency that gives the disclosures and notice required by § 1005.15(c) before the consumer chooses to receive the first benefit payment on the card complies with the timing requirements of § 1005.15(c).</P>
                  <P>3. <E T="03">Form and formatting requirements for government benefit account disclosures.</E> The form and formatting requirements for government benefit accounts in § 1005.15(c) correspond to those for payroll card accounts set forth in § 1005.18(b). See comments 18(b)(2)(xiv)(A)-1 and 18(b)(2)(xiv)(B)-1 for additional guidance regarding the requirements set forth in § 1005.15(c)(2)(i) and (ii), respectively.</P>

For government benefit accounts, the financial institution that must be disclosed pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(5) is the financial institution that directly holds the account or issues the account's access device. The disclosure provided outside the short form disclosure may, but is not required to, also include the name of the government agency that established the government benefit account.</P>

                  <P>1. <E T="03">Issuance of access device.</E> Consistent with § 1005.5(a) and except as provided, as applicable, in § 1005.5(b), a financial institution may issue an access device only in response to an oral or written request for the device, or as a renewal or substitute for an accepted access device. A consumer is deemed to request an access device for a payroll card account when the consumer chooses to receive salary or other compensation through a payroll card account. A consumer is deemed to request an access device for a prepaid account when, for example, the consumer acquires a prepaid account offered for sale at a retail location or applies for a prepaid account by telephone or online.</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Application to employers and service providers.</E> Typically, employers and third-party service providers do not meet the definition of a “financial institution” subject to the regulation because they neither hold prepaid accounts (including payroll card accounts) nor issue prepaid cards and agree with consumers to provide EFT services in connection with prepaid accounts.

                  <P>1. <E T="03">Written and electronic pre-acquisition disclosures.</E> Section 1005.4(a)(1) generally requires that disclosures be made in writing; written disclosures may be provided in electronic form in accordance with the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act) (15 U.S.C. 7001 <E T="03">et seq.</E>). Because § 1005.18(b)(6)(i)(B) provides that electronic disclosures required by § 1005.18(b) need not meet the consumer consent or other applicable provisions of the E-Sign Act, § 1005.18(b) addresses certain requirements for written and electronic pre-acquisition disclosures separately. Section <PRTPAGE P="299"/>1005.18(b) also addresses specific requirements for pre-acquisition disclosures provided orally.</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Currency.</E> Fee amounts required to be disclosed by § 1005.18(b) may be disclosed in a foreign currency for a prepaid account denominated in that foreign currency, other than the fee for the purchase price required by § 1005.18(b)(5). For example, a prepaid account sold in a U.S. airport intended for use in England may disclose in pound sterling (£) the fees required to be disclosed in the short form and long form disclosures and outside the short form disclosure, except for the purchase price.</P>

                  <P>1. <E T="03">Disclosing the short form and long form before acquisition.</E> Section 1005.18(b)(1)(i) generally requires delivery of a short form disclosure as described in § 1005.18(b)(2), accompanied by the information required to be disclosed by § 1005.18(b)(5), and a long form disclosure as described in § 1005.18(b)(4) before a consumer acquires a prepaid account. For purposes of § 1005.18(b)(1)(i), a consumer acquires a prepaid account by purchasing, opening or choosing to be paid via a prepaid account, as illustrated by the following examples:</P>
                  <P>i. A consumer inquires about obtaining a prepaid account at a branch location of a bank. A consumer then receives the disclosures required by § 1005.18(b). After receiving the disclosures, a consumer then opens a prepaid account with the bank. This consumer received the short form and long form pre-acquisition in accordance with § 1005.18(b)(1)(i).</P>
                  <P>ii. A consumer learns that he or she can receive wages via a payroll card account, at which time the consumer is provided with a payroll card and the disclosures required by § 1005.18(b) to review. The consumer then chooses to receive wages via a payroll card account. These disclosures were provided pre-acquisition in compliance with § 1005.18(b)(1)(i). By contrast, if a consumer receives the disclosures required by § 1005.18(b) to review at the end of the first pay period, after the consumer received the first payroll payment on the payroll card, these disclosures were provided to a consumer post-acquisition, and thus not provided in compliance with § 1005.18(b)(1)(i).</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Disclosures provided electronically.</E> Disclosures required by § 1005.18(b) may be provided before or after a consumer has initiated the process of acquiring a prepaid account electronically. When the disclosures required by § 1005.18(b) are presented after a consumer has initiated the process for acquiring a prepaid account online or via a mobile device, but before a consumer chooses to accept the prepaid account, such disclosures are also made pre-acquisition in accordance with § 1005.18(b)(1)(i). The disclosures required by § 1005.18(b) that are provided electronically when a consumer acquires a prepaid account electronically are not considered to be given pre-acquisition unless a consumer must view the Web page containing the disclosures before choosing to accept the prepaid account. The following examples illustrate several methods by which a financial institution may present § 1005.18(b) disclosures before a consumer acquires a prepaid account electronically in compliance with § 1005.18(b)(1)(i):</P>
                  <P>i. A financial institution presents the short form disclosure required by § 1005.18(b)(2), together with the information required by § 1005.18(b)(5), and the long form disclosure required by § 1005.18(b)(4) on the same Web page. A consumer must view the Web page before choosing to accept the prepaid account.</P>
                  <P>ii. A financial institution presents the short form disclosure required by § 1005.18(b)(2), together with the information required by § 1005.18(b)(5), on a Web page. The financial institution includes, after the short form disclosure or as part of the statement required by § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiii), a link that directs the consumer to a separate Web page containing the long form disclosure required by § 1005.18(b)(4). The consumer must view the Web page containing the long form disclosure before choosing to accept the prepaid account.</P>
                  <P>iii. A financial institution presents on a Web page the short form disclosure required by § 1005.18(b)(2), together with the information required by § 1005.18(b)(5), followed by the initial disclosures required by § 1005.7(b), which contains the long form disclosure required by § 1005.18(b)(4), in accordance with § 1005.18(f)(1). The financial institution includes, after the short form disclosure or as part of the statement required by § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiii), a link that directs the consumer to the section of the initial disclosures containing the long form disclosure pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(4).

For purposes of § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii), a retail location is a store or other physical site where a consumer can purchase a prepaid account in person and that is operated by an entity other than the financial institution that issues the prepaid account. A branch of a financial institution that offers its own prepaid accounts is not a retail location with respect to those accounts and, thus, both the <PRTPAGE P="300"/>short form and the long form disclosure must be provided pre-acquisition pursuant to the timing requirement set forth in § 1005.18(b)(1)(i).</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Disclosures provided inside prepaid account access device packaging material.</E> Except when providing the long form disclosure post-acquisition in accordance with the retail location exception set forth in § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii), the disclosures required by § 1005.18(b)(2), (4), and (5) must be provided to a consumer pre-acquisition in compliance with § 1005.18(b)(1)(i). A short form disclosures is not considered to have been provided pre-acquisition if, for example, it is inside the packaging material accompanying a prepaid account access device such that the consumer cannot see or access the disclosures before acquiring the prepaid account.</P>
                  <P>3. <E T="03">Consumers working in retail locations.</E> A payroll card account offered to consumers working in retail locations is not eligible for the retail location exception in § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii); thus, a consumer employee must receive both the short form and long form disclosures for the payroll card account pre-acquisition pursuant to the timing requirement set forth in § 1005.18(b)(1)(i).</P>
                  <P>4. <E T="03">Providing the long form disclosure by telephone and Web site pursuant to the retail location exception.</E> Pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii), a financial institution may provide the long form disclosure described in § 1005.18(b)(4) after a consumer acquires a prepaid account in a retail location, if the conditions set forth in § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii)(A) through (D) are met. Pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii)(C), a financial institution must make the long form disclosure accessible to consumers by telephone and via a Web site when not providing a written version of the long form disclosure pre-acquisition. A financial institution may, for example, provide the long form disclosure by telephone using an interactive voice response or similar system or by using a customer service agent.</P>

For purposes of § 1005.18(b)(1)(iii), a prepaid account is considered to have been acquired orally by telephone when a consumer speaks to a customer service agent or communicates with an automated system, such as an interactive voice response system, to provide personally identifiable information to acquire a prepaid account. Prepaid accounts acquired using a mobile device without speaking to a customer service agent or communicating with an automated system are not considered to have been acquired orally by telephone.</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Disclosures for prepaid accounts acquired by telephone.</E> Pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(1)(iii), a financial institution must disclose the information required by § 1005.18(b)(2) and (5) orally before a consumer acquires a prepaid account orally by telephone. A financial institution may, for example, provide these disclosures by using an interactive voice response or similar system or by using a customer service agent, after the consumer has initiated the purchase of a prepaid account by telephone, but before the consumer acquires the prepaid account. In addition, a financial institution must provide the initial disclosures required by § 1005.7, as modified by § 1005.18(f)(1), before the first electronic fund transfer is made involving the prepaid account.</P>

                  <P>1. <E T="03">Disclosures that are not applicable or are free.</E> The short form disclosures required by § 1005.18(b)(2) must always be provided prior to prepaid account acquisition, even when a particular feature is free or is not applicable to a specific prepaid account product. For example, if a financial institution does not charge a fee to a consumer for withdrawing money at an automated teller machine in the financial institution's network or an affiliated network, which is required to be disclosed pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(iii), the financial institution would list “ATM withdrawal in-network” on the short form disclosure and list “$0” as the fee. If, however, the financial institution does not have its own network or an affiliated network from which a consumer can withdraw money via automated teller machine, the financial institution would list “ATM withdrawal in-network” on the short form disclosure but instead of disclosing a fee amount, state “N/A.” (The financial institution must still disclose any fee it charges for out-of-network ATM withdrawals.)</P>

                  <P>1. <E T="03">International ATM withdrawal fees.</E> Pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(iii), a financial institution must disclose the fees imposed when a consumer uses an automated teller machine to initiate a withdrawal of cash in the United States from the prepaid account, both within and outside of the financial institution's network or a network affiliated with the financial institution. A financial institution may not disclose its fee (if any) for using an automated teller machine to initiate a withdrawal of cash in a foreign country in the disclosure required by § 1005.18(b)(2)(iii), although it may be required to disclose that fee as an additional fee type pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix).</P>
                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">18(b)(2)(iv) Cash Reload Fee</HD>
                  <P>1. <E T="03">Total of all charges.</E> Pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(iv), a financial institution must disclose the total of all charges imposed when a consumer reloads cash into a prepaid account, including charges imposed by the financial institution as well as any charges that may be imposed by third parties for the cash reload. The cash reload fee includes the cost of adding cash to the prepaid account at a point-of-sale terminal, the cost of purchasing an additional card or other device on which cash is loaded and then transferred into the prepaid account, or any other method a consumer may use to reload cash into the prepaid account. For example, a financial institution does not have its own proprietary cash reload network and instead contracts with a third-party reload network for this service. The financial institution itself does not charge any fee related to cash reloads but the third-party reload network charges a fee of $3.95 per cash reload. The financial institution must disclose the cash reload fee as $3.95. If the financial institution offers more than one method to reload cash into the prepaid account, § 1005.18(b)(3)(i) requires disclosure of the highest cash reload fee. For example, a financial institution contracts with two third-party cash reload networks; one third party charges $3.95 for a point-of-sale reload and the other third party charges $2.95 for purchase of a reload pack. In addition to the third-party cash reload charge, the financial institution charges a $1 fee for every cash reload. The financial institution must disclose the cash reload fee on the short form as $4.95, that is, the highest third-party fee plus the financial institution's $1 fee. See comments 18(b)(3)(v)-1 for additional guidance regarding third-party fees for cash reloads.</P>

A financial institution may not disclose its fee (if any) for using an automated teller machine to check the balance of the prepaid account in a foreign country in the disclosure required by § 1005.18(b)(2)(v), although it may be required to disclose that fee as an additional fee type pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix).</P>

                  <P>1. <E T="03">Fee types counted in total number of additional fee types.</E> Section 1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A) requires a statement disclosing the number of additional fee types the financial institution may charge consumers with respect to the prepaid account, using the following clause or a substantially similar clause: “We charge [x] other types of fees.” The number of additional fee types disclosed must reflect the total number of fee types under which the financial institution may charge fees, excluding fees required to be disclosed pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) through (vii) and (b)(5) and any finance charges as described in Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.4(b)(11), imposed in connection with a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in 12 CFR 1026.61. The following clarify which fee types to include in the total number of additional fee types:</P>
                  <P>i. <E T="03">Fee types excluded from the number of additional fee types.</E> The number of additional fee types required to be disclosed pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A) does not include the fees otherwise required to be disclosed in the short form pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) through (vii), nor any purchase fee or activation fee required to be disclosed outside the short form pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(5). It also <PRTPAGE P="302"/>does not include any finance charges as described in Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.4(b)(11), imposed in connection with a credit feature defined in 12 CFR 1026.61. The number of additional fee types includes only fee types under which the financial institution may charge fees; accordingly, third-party fees are not included unless they are imposed for services performed on behalf of the financial institution. In addition, the number of additional fee types includes only fee types the financial institution may charge consumers with respect to the prepaid account; accordingly, additional fee types does not include other revenue sources such as interchange fees or fees paid by employers for payroll card programs, government agencies for government benefit programs, or other entities sponsoring prepaid account programs for financial disbursements.</P>
                  <P>ii. <E T="03">Fee types counted in the number of additional fee types.</E> Fee types that bear a relationship to, but are separate from, the static fee types disclosed in the short form must be counted as additional fees for purposes of § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii). For example, the ATM withdrawal and ATM balance inquiry fee types required to be disclosed respectively by § 1005.18(b)(2)(iii) and (v) that are excluded from the number of additional fee types pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii) do not include such services outside of the United States. Thus, any international ATM fees charged by the financial institution for ATM withdrawal or balance inquiries must each be counted in the total number of additional fee types. Similarly, any fees for reloading funds into a prepaid account in a form other than cash (such as electronic reload and check reload, as described in comment 18(b)(2)(viii)(A)-2) must be counted in the total number of additional fee types because § 1005.18(b)(2)(iv) is limited to cash reloads. Also, additional fee types disclosed in the short form pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) must be counted in the total number of additional fee types.</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Examples of fee types and fee variations.</E> The term fee type, as used in § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii) and (ix), is a general category under which a financial institution charges fees to consumers. A financial institution may charge only one fee within a particular fee type, or may charge two or more variations of fees within the same fee type. The following is a list of examples of fee types a financial institution may use when determining both the number of additional fee types charged pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A) and any additional fee types to disclose pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix). A financial institution may create an appropriate name for other additional fee types.</P>
                  <P>i. <E T="03">Fee types related to reloads of funds.</E> Fees for reloading funds into a prepaid account. Fees for cash reloads are required to be disclosed in the short form pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(iv) and that such fees are not counted in the total number of additional fee types or disclosed as an additional fee type pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix). Fee types for other methods to reload funds, such as Electronic reload or Check reload, would be counted in the total number of additional fee types and may be required to be disclosed as additional fee types pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix).</P>
                  <P>A. <E T="03">Electronic reload.</E> Fees for reloading a prepaid account through electronic methods.

Per purchase fees and ATM withdrawal fees within the United States are fee types required to be disclosed in the short form respectively pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii) and (iii) and thus such fees are not counted in the total number of additional fee types or disclosed as an additional fee type pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix). Fee types for other methods to withdraw funds, such as Electronic withdrawal, Teller withdrawal, Cash back at point of sale (POS), and Account closure would be counted in the total of additional fee types and may be required to be disclosed as additional fee types pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix).</P>

                  <P>1. <E T="03">Statement clauses.</E> Section 1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(B) requires, if a financial institution makes a disclosure of additional fee types pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix), it must include in the short form a statement directing consumers to that disclosure, located after but on the same line of text as the statement regarding the number of additional fee types required by § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A), using the following clause or a substantially similar clause: “Here are some of them:”. A financial institution that makes no disclosure pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) may not include a disclosure pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(B). The following examples provide guidance regarding substantially similar clauses a financial institution may use in certain circumstances to make its disclosures under § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A) and (B):</P>
                  <P>i. A financial institution that has one additional fee type and discloses that additional fee type pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) might provide the statements required by § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A) and (B) together as: “We charge 1 other type of fee. It is:”.</P>
                  <P>ii. A financial institution that has five additional fee types and discloses one of those additional fee types pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) might provide the statements required by § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A) and (B) together as: “We charge 5 other types of fees. Here is 1 of them:”.</P>

                  <P>iii. A financial institution that has two additional fee types and discloses both of those fee types pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) might provide the statement required by § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A) and (B) together as: “We charge 2 other types of fees.

                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">18(b)(2)(ix)(A) Determination of Which Additional Fee Types To Disclose</HD>
                  <P>1. <E T="03">Number of fee types to disclose.</E> Section 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A) requires disclosure of the two fee types that generate the highest revenue from consumers for the prepaid account program or across prepaid account programs that share the same fee schedule during the time period provided in § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(D) and (E), excluding the categories set forth in § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)(<E T="03">1</E>) through (<E T="03">3</E>). See comment 18(b)(2)(viii)(A)-2 for guidance on and examples of fee types. If a prepaid account program has two fee types that satisfy the criteria in § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A), it must disclose both fees. If a prepaid account program has three or more fee types that potentially satisfy the criteria in § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A), the financial institution must disclose only the two fee types that generate the highest revenue from consumers. See comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(B)-1 for guidance regarding the disclosure of additional fee types for a prepaid account with fewer than two fee types that satisfy the criteria in § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A).</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Abbreviations.</E> Commonly accepted or readily understandable abbreviations may be used as needed for additional fee types and fee variations disclosed pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix). For example, to accommodate on one line in the short form disclosure the additional fee types “international ATM balance inquiry” or “person-to-person transfer of funds,” with or without fee variations, a financial institution may choose to abbreviate the fee type name as “Int'l ATM inquiry” or “P2P transfer.”</P>
                  <P>3. <E T="03">Revenue from consumers.</E> The revenue calculation for the disclosure of additional fee types pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A) is based on fee types that the financial institution may charge consumers with respect to the prepaid account. The calculation excludes other revenue sources such as revenue generated from interchange fees and fees paid by employers for payroll card programs, government agencies for government benefit programs, and other entities sponsoring prepaid account programs for financial disbursements. It also excludes third-party fees, unless they are imposed for services performed on behalf of the financial institution.</P>
                  <P>4. <E T="03">Assessing revenue within and across prepaid account programs to determine disclosure of additional fee types.</E> Pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A), the disclosure of the two fee types that generate the highest revenue from consumers must be determined for each prepaid account program or across prepaid account programs that share the same fee schedule. Thus, if a financial institution offers more than one prepaid account program, unless the programs share the same fee schedule, the financial institution must consider the fee revenue data separately for each prepaid account program and not consolidate the fee revenue data across prepaid account programs. Prepaid account programs are deemed to have the same fee schedules if they charge the same fee amounts, including offering the same fee waivers and fee reductions for the same features. The following examples illustrate how to assess revenue within and across prepaid account programs to determine the disclosure of additional fee types:</P>
                  <P>i. <E T="03">Prepaid account programs with different fee schedules.</E> A financial institution offers multiple prepaid account programs and each program has a different fee schedule. The financial institution must consider the revenue from consumers for each program separately; it may not consider the revenue from all of its prepaid account programs together in determining the disclosure of additional fee types for its programs.</P>
                  <P>ii. <E T="03">Prepaid account programs with identical fee schedules.</E> A financial institution offers multiple prepaid account programs and they all share the same fee schedule. The financial institution may consider the revenue across all of its prepaid account programs together in determining the disclosure of additional fee types for its programs.</P>
                  <P>iii. <E T="03">Prepaid account programs with both different fee schedules and identical fee schedules.</E> A financial institution offers multiple prepaid account programs, some of which share the same fee schedule. The financial institution may consider the revenue across all prepaid account programs with identical fee schedules in determining the disclosure of additional fee types for those programs. The financial institution must separately consider the revenue from each of the prepaid account programs with unique fee schedules.</P>
                  <P>iv. <E T="03">Multiple service plan prepaid account programs.</E> A financial institution that discloses multiple service plans on a short form disclosure as permitted by § 1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(<E T="03">2</E>) must consider revenue across all of those plans in determining the disclosure of additional fee types for that program. If, however, the financial institution instead is disclosing the default service plan pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(<E T="03">1</E>), the financial institution must consider the revenue generated from consumers for the default service plan only. See § 1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(<E T="03">2</E>) and comment 18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(<E T="03">2</E>)-1 for guidance on what constitutes multiple service plans.</P>
                  <P>5. <E T="03">Exclusions.</E> Once the financial institution has calculated the fee revenue data for the prepaid account program or across prepaid account programs that share the same fee schedule during the appropriate time period, it must remove from consideration the categories excluded pursuant to <PRTPAGE P="305"/>§ 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)(<E T="03">1</E>) through (<E T="03">3</E>) before determining the fee types, if any, that generated the highest revenue.</P>
                  <P>i. <E T="03">Exclusion for fee types required to be disclosed elsewhere.</E> Fee types otherwise required to be disclosed in or outside the short form are excluded from the additional fee types required to be disclose pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)(<E T="03">1</E>). Thus, the following fee types are excluded: Periodic fee, per purchase fee, ATM withdrawal fees (for ATM withdrawals in the United States), cash reload fee, ATM balance inquiry fees (for ATM balance inquiries in the United States), customer service fees, and inactivity fee. However, while the cash reload fee type is excluded, other reload fee types, such as electronic reload and check reload, are not excluded under § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)(<E T="03">1</E>) and thus may be disclosed as additional fee types pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix). Similarly, while the fee types ATM withdrawal and ATM balance inquiry in the United States are excluded, international ATM withdrawal and international ATM balance inquiry fees are not excluded under § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)(<E T="03">1</E>) and thus may be disclosed as additional fee types pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix). Also pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)(<E T="03">1</E>), the purchase price and activation fee, if any, required to be disclosed outside the short form disclosure pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(5), are excluded from the additional fee types required to be disclosed pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix).</P>
                  <P>ii. <E T="03">De minimis exclusion.</E> Any fee types that generated less than 5 percent of the total revenue from consumers for the prepaid account program or across prepaid account programs that share the same fee schedule during the time period provided in § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(D) and (E) are excluded from the additional fee types required to be disclosed pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)(<E T="03">2</E>). For example, for a particular prepaid account program over the appropriate time period, bill payment, check reload, and card replacement are the only fee types that generated 5 percent or more of the total revenue from consumers at, respectively, 15 percent, 10 percent, and 7 percent. Two other fee types, legal fee and personalized card, generated revenue below 1 percent of the total revenue from consumers. The financial institution must disclose bill payment and check reload as the additional fee types for that particular prepaid account program because those two fee types generated the highest revenue from consumers from among the categories not excluded from disclosure as additional fee types. For a different prepaid account program over the appropriate time period, bill payment is the only fee type that generated 5 percent or more of the total revenue from consumers. Two other fee types, check reload and card replacement, each generated revenue below 5 percent of the total revenue from consumers. The financial institution must disclose bill payment as an additional fee type for that particular prepaid account program because it is the only fee type that satisfies the criteria of § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A). The financial institution may, but is not required to, disclose either check reload or card replacement on the short form as well, pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(B). <E T="03">See</E> comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(B)-1.</P>

                  <P>i. A financial institution has a prepaid account program with only one fee type that satisfies the criteria in § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A) and thus, pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A), the financial institution must disclose that one fee type. The prepaid account program has three other fee types that generate revenue from consumers, but they do not exceed the de minimis threshold or otherwise satisfy the criteria in § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(B). Pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(B), the financial institution is not required to make any additional disclosure, but it may choose to disclose one of the three fee types that do not meet the criteria in § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A).</P>
                  <P>ii. A financial institution has a prepaid account program with four fee types that generate revenue from consumers, but none exceeds the de minimis threshold or otherwise satisfy the criteria in § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A). Pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(B), the financial institution is not required to make any disclosure, but it may choose to disclose one or two of the fee types that do not meet the criteria in § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A).</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">No disclosure of finance charges as an additional fee type.</E> Pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(3)(vi), a financial institution may not disclose any finance charges as a voluntary additional fee disclosure under § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(B).</P>
                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">18(b)(2)(ix)(C) Fee Variations in Additional Fee Types</HD>
                  <P>1. <E T="03">Two or more fee variations.</E> Section 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(C) specifies how to disclose additional fee types with two fee variations, <PRTPAGE P="306"/>more than two fee variations, and for multiple service plans pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(<E T="03">2</E>). See comment 18(b)(2)(viii)(A)-2 for guidance on and examples of fee types and fee variations within those fee types. The following examples illustrate how to disclose two-tier fees and other fee variations in additional fee types:</P>
                  <P>i. <E T="03">Two fee variations with different fee amounts.</E> A financial institution charges a fee of $1 for providing a card replacement using standard mail service and charges a fee of $5 for providing a card replacement using expedited delivery. The financial institution must calculate the total revenue generated from consumers for all card replacements, both via standard mail service and expedited delivery, during the required time period to determine whether it is required to disclose card replacement as an additional fee type pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix). Because there are only two fee variations for the fee type “card replacement,” if card replacement is required to be disclosed as an additional fee type pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A), the financial institution must disclose both fee variations pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(C). Thus, the financial institution would disclose on the short form the fee type and two variations as “Card replacement (regular or expedited delivery)” and the fee amount as “$1.00 or $5.00”.</P>
                  <P>ii. <E T="03">More than two fee variations.</E> A financial institution offers two methods of bill payment—via ACH and paper check—and offers two modes of delivery for bill payments made by paper check—regular standard mail service and expedited delivery. The financial institution charges $0.25 for bill pay via ACH, $0.50 for bill pay via paper check sent by regular standard mail service, and $3 for bill pay via paper check sent via expedited delivery. The financial institution must calculate the total revenue generated from consumers for all methods of bill pay and all modes of delivery during the required time period to determine whether it must disclose bill payment as an additional fee type pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix). Because there are more than two fee variations for the fee type “bill payment,” if bill payment is required to be disclosed as an additional fee type pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A), the financial institution must disclose the highest fee, $3, followed by a symbol, such as an asterisk, linked to a statement explaining that the fee could be lower depending on how and where the prepaid account is used, pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(3)(i). Thus, the financial institution would disclose on the short form the fee type as “Bill payment” and the fee amount as “$3.00*”.</P>
                  <P>iii. <E T="03">Two fee variations with like fee amounts.</E> A financial institution offers two methods of check reload for which it charges a fee—depositing checks at an ATM and depositing checks with a teller at the financial institution's branch locations. There is a fee of $0.50 for both methods of check deposit. The financial institution must calculate the total revenue generated from both of these check reload methods during the required time period to determine whether it must disclose this fee type as an additional fee type pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix). Because the fee amounts are the same for the two methods of check deposit, if the fee type is required to be disclosed as an additional fee type, the financial institution's options for disclosing this fee type in accordance with § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(C) and (b)(3)(iii) include: “Check reload (ATM or teller check dep)” and the fee amount as “$0.50” or “Check reload” and the fee amount as “$0.50”.</P>
                  <P>iv. <E T="03">Multiple service plans.</E> A financial institution provides a short form disclosure for multiple service plans pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(<E T="03">2</E>). Notwithstanding that an additional fee type has only two fee variations, a financial institution must disclose the highest fee in accordance with § 1005.18(b)(3)(i).</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">One fee variation under a particular fee type.</E> Section 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(C) provides in part that, if a financial institution only charges one fee under a particular fee type, the financial institution must disclose the name of the additional fee type and the fee amount; it may, but is not required to, disclose also the name of the one fee variation, if any, for which the fee amount is charged, in a format substantially similar to that used to disclose the two-tier fees required by § 1005.18(b)(2)(v) and (vi), except that the financial institution must disclose only the one fee variation name and fee amount instead of two. For example, a financial institution offers one method of electronic reload for which it charges a fee—electronic reload conducted using a debit card. The financial institution must calculate the total revenue generated from consumers for the fee type electronic reload (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> in this case, electronic reloads conducted using a debit card) during the required time period to determine whether it must disclose electronic reload as an additional fee type pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix). Because the financial institution only charges one fee variation under the fee type electronic reload, if this fee type is required to be disclosed as an additional fee type, the financial institution has two options for disclosing this fee type in accordance with § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(C): “Electronic reload (debit card)” and the fee amount as “$1.00” or “Electronic reload” and the fee amount as “$1.00”.<PRTPAGE P="307"/>

Thus, a prepaid account program that was in existence as of October 1, 2017 must assess its additional fee types disclosure from data collected during a consecutive 24-month period that took place between October 1, 2014 and October 1, 2017. For example, an existing prepaid account program was first offered to consumers on January 1, 2012 and provides its first short form disclosure on October 1, 2017. The earliest 24-month period from which that financial institution could calculate its first additional fee types disclosure would be from October 1, 2014 to September 30, 2016.</P>

For example, a financial institution begins offering to consumers a prepaid account program six months before October 1, 2017. Because the prepaid account program will not have 24 months of fee revenue data prior to October 1, 2017, pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(D)(<E T="03">2</E>) the financial institution must disclose the additional fee types it reasonably anticipates the prepaid account program will generate over the 24-month period that begins on October 1, 2017.

                  <P>1. <E T="03">Periodic reassessment and, if applicable, update of additional fee types disclosure.</E> Pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<E T="03">2</E>), a financial institution must reassess whether its previously disclosed additional fee types continue to comply with the requirements of § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) every 24 months based on revenue for the previous 24-month period. The financial institution must complete this reassessment and update its disclosures, if applicable, within three months of the end of the 24-month period, except as provided in the update printing exception in § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<E T="03">4</E>). The following examples provide guidance on the periodic assessment and, if applicable, update of the disclosure of additional fee types pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<E T="03">2</E>):</P>
                  <P>i. <E T="03">Reassessment with no change in the additional fee types disclosed.</E> A financial institution disclosed two additional fee types (bill payment and card replacement) for a particular prepaid account program on October 1, 2017. Starting on October 1, 2019, the financial institution assessed the fee revenue data it collected over the previous 24 months, and the two additional fee types previously disclosed continue to qualify as additional fee types pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix). The financial institution is not required to take any action with regard to the disclosure of additional fee types for that prepaid account program.</P>
                  <P>ii. <E T="03">Reassessment with a change in the additional fee types disclosed.</E> A financial institution disclosed two additional fee types (bill payment and card replacement) for a particular prepaid account program on October 1, 2017. Starting on October 1, 2019, the financial institution assessed the fee revenue data it collected over the previous 24 months, and bill payment continued to qualify as an additional fee type pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) but check reload qualified as the second additional fee type instead of card replacement. The financial institution must update the additional fee types disclosure in its short form disclosures provided electronically, orally, and in writing (other than for printed materials that qualify for the update printing exception in § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<E T="03">4</E>)) no later than January 1, 2020, which is three months after the end of the 24-month period.</P>
                  <P>iii. <E T="03">Reassessment with the addition of an additional fee type already voluntarily disclosed.</E> A financial institution disclosed one additional fee type (bill payment) and voluntarily disclosed one other additional fee type (card replacement, both for regular and expedited delivery) for a particular prepaid account program on October 1, 2017. Starting on October 1, 2019, the financial institution assessed the fee revenue data it collected over the previous 24 months, and bill payment continued to qualify as an additional fee type pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) and card replacement now qualified as the second additional fee type. Because the financial institution already had disclosed its card replacement fees in the format required for an additional fee type disclosure, the financial <PRTPAGE P="308"/>institution is not required to take any action with regard to the additional fee types disclosure in the short form for that prepaid account program.</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Reassessment more frequently than every 24 months.</E> Pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<E T="03">2</E>), a financial institution may, but is not required to, carry out the reassessment and update, if applicable, more frequently than every 24 months, at which time a new 24-month period commences. A financial institution may choose to do this, for example, to sync its reassessment process for additional fee types with its financial reporting schedule or other financial analysis it performs regarding the particular prepaid account program. If a financial institution chooses to reassess its additional fee types disclosure more frequently than every 24 months, it is still required to use 24 months of fee revenue data to conduct the reassessment. For example, a financial institution first offered a particular prepaid account program on October 1, 2016 and thus was required to estimate its initial additional fee types disclosure pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(D)(<E T="03">2</E>). If the financial institution chooses to begin its reassessment of its fee revenue data on October 1, 2018, it would use the data it collected over the previous 24 months (October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2018) and complete its reassessment and its update, if applicable, by January 1, 2019.</P>
                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(3) Fee Schedule Change</HD>
                  <P>1. <E T="03">Revised prepaid account programs.</E> Section 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<E T="03">3</E>) requires that if a financial institution revises the fee schedule for a prepaid account program, it must determine whether it reasonably anticipates that the previously disclosed additional fee types will continue to comply with the requirements of § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) for the 24 months following implementation of the fee schedule change. A fee schedule change resets the 24-month period for assessment; a financial institution must comply with the requirements of § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<E T="03">2</E>) at the end of the 24-month period following implementation of the fee schedule change. If the financial institution reasonably anticipates that the previously disclosed additional fee types will not comply with the requirements of § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix), it must update the disclosure based on its reasonable anticipation of what those additional fee types will be at the time the fee schedule change goes into effect, except as provided in the update printing exception in § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<E T="03">4</E>). For example, if a financial institution lowers its card replacement fee from $4 to $3 on December 1, 2018 after having first assessed its additional fee types disclosure as of October 1, 2017, the financial institution would assess whether it reasonably anticipates that the existing additional fee types disclosure will continue to reflect the additional fee types that generate the highest revenue from consumers for that prepaid account program for the next 24 months (until December 1, 2020). If the financial institution reasonably anticipates that its additional fee types will remain unchanged over the next 24 months, the financial institution is not required to take any action with regard to the additional fee types disclosure for that prepaid account program. In the same example, if the financial institution reasonably anticipates that the previously disclosed additional fee types will not comply with the requirements of § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) for the 24 months following implementation of the fee schedule change, the financial institution must update the listing of additional fee types at the time the fee schedule change goes into effect, except as provided in the update printing exception pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<E T="03">4</E>).</P>

For prepaid accounts sold in retail locations, for example, § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<E T="03">4</E>) permits a financial institution to implement any necessary updates to the listing of the additional fee types disclosures on the short form disclosure that appear on its physical prepaid account packaging materials at the time the financial institution prints new materials. Section 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<E T="03">4</E>) does not require financial institutions to destroy existing inventory in retail locations or elsewhere in the distribution channel, to the extent the disclosures on such packaging materials are otherwise accurate, to comply with this requirement. For example, a financial institution determines that an additional fee type listed on a short form disclosure in a retail location no longer qualifies as an additional fee type pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix). The financial institution must update any electronic and oral short form disclosures pursuant to the timing requirements set forth in § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E). Pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<E T="03">4</E>), the financial institution may continue selling any previously printed prepaid account packages that contain the prior listing of additional fee types; <PRTPAGE P="309"/>prepaid account packages printed after that time must contain the updated listing of additional fee types.</P>

To provide the long form disclosure by telephone, a financial institution could use a live customer service agent or an interactive voice response system. The financial institution could use a telephone number specifically dedicated to providing the long form disclosure or a more general customer service telephone number for the prepaid account program. For example, a financial institution would be deemed to provide direct access pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiii) if a consumer navigates one or two prompts to reach the oral long form disclosure via a live customer service agent or an interactive voice response system using either a specifically dedicated telephone number of a more general customer service telephone number.</P>

For example, a financial institution that requires a consumer to navigate various other Web pages before viewing the long form disclosure would not be deemed to provide direct access pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiii). Trademark and product names and their commonly accepted or readily understandable abbreviations comply with the requirement in § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiii) that the URL be meaningfully named.

For example, a financial institution issuing a prepaid account to disburse student financial aid proceeds may disclose a statement such as the following: “You have several options to receive your financial aid payments: Direct deposit to your bank account, direct deposit to your own prepaid card, paper check, or this prepaid card. Tell your school which option you choose.”</P>

For example, a financial institution might include the following line of text in the short form disclosure: “See below for free ways to access your funds and balance information” and then list below, but on the same page as, the short form disclosure several ways consumers can access their prepaid account funds and balance information for free. Alternatively, the financial institution might direct the consumer to another location for that information, such as by stating “See the cardholder agreement for free ways to access your funds and balance information.” A similar statement is permitted for government benefit accounts pursuant to § 1005.15(c)(2)(ii).</P>

                  <P>1. <E T="03">Short form disclosure of variable fees.</E> Section 1005.18(b)(3)(i) requires disclosure in the short form of the highest fee when a fee can vary, followed by a symbol, such as an asterisk, linked to a statement explaining that the fee could be lower depending on how and where the prepaid account is used. For example, a financial institution provides interactive voice response (IVR) customer service for free and provides the first three live agent customer service calls per month for free, after which it charges $0.50 for each additional live agent customer service call during that month. Pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(vi), the financial institution must disclose both its IVR and live agent customer service fees on the short form disclosure. The financial institution would disclose the IVR fee as $0 and the live agent customer service fee as $0.50, followed by an asterisk (or other symbol) linked to a statement explaining that the fee can be lower depending on how and where the prepaid account is used. Except as described in § 1005.18(b)(3)(ii), § 1005.18(b)(3)(i) does not permit a financial institution to describe in the short form disclosure the specific conditions under which a fee may be reduced or waived, but the financial institution could use, for example, any other part of the prepaid account's packaging or other printed materials to disclose that information. The conditions under which a fee may be lower are required to be disclosed in the long form disclosure pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii).</P>

For example, a financial institution charges a monthly fee of $4.95, but waives this fee if a consumer receives direct deposit into the prepaid account or conducts 30 or more transactions during that month. Pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(3)(ii), the financial institution could list its monthly fee of $4.95 on the short form disclosure followed by a dagger symbol that links to a statement that states, for example, “No monthly fee with direct deposit or 30 transactions per month.” This statement may take up no more than one line of text in the short form disclosure and must be located directly above or in place of the linked statement required by § 1005.18(b)(3)(i). Alternatively, pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(3)(i), the financial institution could list its monthly fee of $4.95 on the short form disclosure followed by an asterisk that links to a statement that states, “This fee can be lower depending on how and where this card is used.”</P>

Fees imposed by another party, such as a program manager, for services performed on behalf of the financial institution are not third-party fees and therefore must be disclosed pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(3)(iv). For example, if a program manager performs customer service functions for a financial institution's prepaid account program, and charges a fee for live agent customer service, that fee must be disclosed pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(iv).</P>

                  <P>1. <E T="03">Updating third-party fees.</E> Section 1005.18(b)(3)(v) provides that a financial institution is not required to revise its short form disclosure to reflect a cash reload fee change by a third party until such time that the financial institution manufactures, prints, or otherwise produces new prepaid account packaging materials or otherwise updates the short form disclosure. For example, at the time a financial institution first prints packaging material for its prepaid account program, it discloses on the short form the $3.99 fee charged by the third-party reload network with which it contracts to provide cash reloads. Ten months later, the third-party reload network raises its cash reload fee to $4.25. The financial institution is not required to update its on-package disclosures to reflect the change in the cash reload fee until the financial institution next prints packaging materials for that prepaid account program. With respect to that financial institution's electronic and oral disclosures for that prepaid account program, the financial institution may, but is not required to, update its short form disclosure immediately upon learning of the third-party reload network's change to its cash reload fee. Alternatively, the financial institution may wait to update its electronic and oral short form disclosures to reflect the change in the cash reload fee until it otherwise updates those disclosures.</P>

If a financial institution imposes a higher fee or charge on the asset feature of a prepaid account with a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card than the amount of a comparable fee or charge it imposes on any prepaid account in the same prepaid account program that does not have such a credit feature, it must disclose on the short form for purposes of § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) through (vii) and (ix) the amount of the comparable fee rather than the higher fee. <E T="03">See, e.g.,</E> § 1005.18(g)(2) and related commentary.</P>

                  <P>1. <E T="03">Disclosure of all fees.</E> Section 1005.18(b)(4)(ii) requires a financial institution to disclose in the long form all fees that may be imposed in connection with a prepaid account, not just fees for electronic fund transfers or the right to make transfers. The requirement to disclose all fees in the long form includes any finance charges imposed on the prepaid account as described in Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.4(b)(11)(ii), in connection with a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in 12 CFR 1026.61 but does not include finance charges imposed on the covered separate credit feature as described in 12 CFR 1026.4(b)(11)(i). See comment 18(b)(7)(i)(B)-2 for guidance on disclosure of finance charges as part of the § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii) fee disclosure in the long form. A financial institution may also be required to include finance charges in the Regulation Z disclosures required pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(4)(vii).</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Disclosure of conditions.</E> Section 1005.18(b)(4)(ii) requires a financial institution to disclose the amount of each fee and the conditions, if any, under which the fee <PRTPAGE P="312"/>may be imposed, waived, or reduced. For example, if a financial institution charges a cash reload fee, the financial institution must list the amount of the cash reload fee and also specify any circumstances under which a consumer can qualify for a lower fee. Similarly, if a financial institution discloses both a periodic fee and an inactivity fee, it must indicate whether the inactivity fee will be charged in addition to, or instead of, the periodic fee. A financial institution may, but is not required to, also include on the long form disclosure additional information or limitations related to the service or feature for which a fee is charged, such as, for cash reloads, any limit on the amount of cash a consumer may load into the prepaid account in a single transaction or during a particular time period. The general requirement in § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii) does not apply to individual fee waivers or reductions granted to a particular consumer or group of consumers on a discretionary or case-by-case basis.</P>
                  <P>3. <E T="03">Disclosure of a service or feature without a charge.</E> Pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii), a financial institution may, but is not required to, list in the long form disclosure any service or feature it provides or offers at no charge to the consumer. For example, a financial institution may list “online bill pay” in its long form disclosure and indicate a fee amount of “$0” when the financial institution does not charge consumers a fee for that feature. By contrast, where a fee is waived or reduced under certain circumstances or where a service or feature is available for an introductory period without a fee, the financial institution may not list the fee amount as “$0”. Rather, the financial institution must list the highest fee, accompanied by an explanation of the waived or reduced fee amount and any conditions for the waiver or discount. For example, if a financial institution waives its monthly fee for any consumer who receives direct deposit payments into the prepaid account or conducts 30 or more transactions in a given month, the long form disclosure must list the regular monthly fee amount along with an explanation that the monthly fee is waived if the consumer receives direct deposit or conducts 30 or more transactions each month. Similarly, for an introductory fee, the financial institution would list the highest fee, and explain the introductory fee amount, the duration of the introductory period, and any conditions that apply during the introductory period.</P>
                  <P>4. <E T="03">Third-party fees.</E> Section 1005.18(b)(4)(ii) requires disclosure in the long form of any third-party fee amounts known to the financial institution that may apply. Fees imposed by another party, such as a program manager, for services performed on behalf of the financial institution are not third-party fees and therefore must be disclosed on the long form pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii). Also pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii), for any third-party fee disclosed, a financial institution may, but is not required to, include either or both a statement that the fee is accurate as of or through a specific date or that the third-party fee is subject to change. For example, a financial institution that contracts with a third-party remote deposit capture service must include in the long form disclosure the amount of the fee known to the financial institution that is charged by the third party for remote deposit capture services. The financial institution may, but is not required to, also state that the third-party remote deposit capture fee is accurate as of or through a specific date, such as the date the financial institution prints the long form disclosure. The financial institution may also state that the fee is subject to change. Section 1005.18(b)(4)(ii) also provides that, if a third-party fee may apply but the amount of the fee is not known by the financial institution, it must include a statement indicating that a third-party fee may apply without specifying the fee amount. For example, a financial institution that permits out-of-network ATM withdrawals would disclose that, for ATM withdrawals that occur outside the financial institution's network, the ATM operator may charge the consumer a fee for the withdrawal, but the financial institution is not required to disclose the out-of-network ATM operator's fee amount if it does not know the amount of the fee.</P>

                  <P>i. <E T="03">Bank disclosure of FDIC insurance.</E> For example, XYZ Bank offers a prepaid account program for sale at retail locations that is set up to be eligible for FDIC deposit insurance, but does not conduct customer identification and verification before consumers purchase the prepaid account. XYZ Bank may disclose the required statements as “Register your card for FDIC insurance eligibility and other protections. Your funds will be held at or transferred to XYZ Bank, an FDIC-insured institution. Once there, your funds are insured up to $250,000 by the FDIC in the event XYZ Bank fails, if specific deposit insurance requirements are met and your card is registered. See <E T="03">fdic.gov/deposit/deposits/prepaid.html</E> for details.” Conversely, if XYZ Bank offers another prepaid account <PRTPAGE P="313"/>program for sale at retail locations for which it conducts customer identification and verification after purchase of the prepaid account, but the program is not set up to be eligible for FDIC insurance, XYZ Bank may disclose the required statements as “Not FDIC insured. Your funds will be held at or transferred to XYZ Bank. If XYZ Bank fails, you are not protected by FDIC deposit insurance and could lose some or all of your money. Register your card for other protections.”</P>
                  <P>ii. <E T="03">Credit union disclosure of NCUA insurance.</E> For example, ABC Credit Union offers a prepaid account program for sale at its own branches that is set up to be eligible for NCUA share insurance, but does not conduct customer identification and verification before consumers purchase the prepaid account. ABC Credit Union may disclose the requirement statements as “Register your card for NCUA insurance, if eligible, and other protections. Your funds will be held at or transferred to ABC Credit Union, an NCUA-insured institution. Once there, if specific share insurance requirements are met and your card is registered, your funds are insured up to $250,000 by the NCUA in the event ABC Credit Union fails.” See comment 18(b)(2)(xi)-1 for guidance as to when NCUA insurance coverage should be disclosed instead of FDIC insurance coverage.</P>

For example, if the financial institution provides the short form disclosure online, the information required by § 1005.18(b)(5) is deemed disclosed in close proximity to the short form if it appears on the same Web page as the short form disclosure. If the financial institution offers the prepaid account in its own branch locations and provides the short form disclosure on the exterior of its preprinted packaging materials, the information required by § 1005.18(b)(5) is deemed disclosed in close proximity to the short form disclosure if it appears on the exterior of the packaging. If the financial institution provides written short form disclosures in a manner other than on preprinted packaging materials, such as on paper, the information required by § 1005.18(b)(5) is deemed disclosed in close proximity if it appears on the same piece of paper as the short form disclosure. If the financial institution provides the short form disclosure orally, the information required by § 1005.18(b)(5) is deemed disclosed in close proximity to the short form disclosure if it is provided immediately before or after disclosing the fees and information required pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2). For prepaid accounts sold in a retail location pursuant to the retail location exception in § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii), § 1005.18(b)(5) requires the information other than purchase price be disclosed on the exterior of the access device's packaging material. If the purchase price, if any, is not also disclosed on the exterior of the packaging, disclosure of the <PRTPAGE P="314"/>purchase price on or near the sales rack or display for the packaging material is deemed in close proximity to the short form disclosure.</P>

For example, if a consumer is acquiring a prepaid account via a Web site or mobile application, it would be reasonable to expect that a consumer would be able to access the disclosures required by § 1005.18(b) on the first page or via a direct link from the first page of the Web site or mobile application or on the first page that discloses the details about the specific prepaid account program.

For example, the disclosures permitted by § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(B) or (b)(3)(ii) must take up no more than one additional line of text in the short form disclosure. If a consumer is acquiring a prepaid account using a mobile device with a screen too small to accommodate these disclosures on one line of text in accordance with the size requirements set forth in § 1005.18(b)(7)(ii)(B), a financial institution is permitted to display the disclosures permitted by § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(B) and (b)(3)(ii), for example, by stacking those disclosures in a way that responds to smaller screen sizes, while still meeting the other formatting requirements in § 1005.18(b)(7).</P>

For example, a short form disclosure with a tear strip running though it would not be deemed retainable because use of the tear strip to gain access to the prepaid account access device inside the packaging would destroy part of the short form disclosure.

                  <P>1. <E T="03">Disclosure of multiple service plans.</E> The multiple service plan disclosure requirements in § 1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(<E T="03">2</E>) apply when a financial institution offers more than one <PRTPAGE P="315"/>service plan within a particular prepaid account program, each plan has a different fee schedule, and the financial institution opts not to disclose the default service plan pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(<E T="03">1</E>). <E T="03">See</E> Model Form A-10(e). For example, a financial institution that offers a prepaid account program with one service plan for which a consumer pays no periodic fee but instead pays a fee for each transaction, and another plan that includes a monthly fee but no per transaction fee may use the short form disclosure for multiple service plans pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(<E T="03">2</E>). Similarly, a financial institution that offers a prepaid account program with preferred rates or fees for the prepaid accounts of consumers who also use another non-prepaid service (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> a mobile phone service), often referred to as “loyalty plans,” may also use the short form disclosure for multiple service plans pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(<E T="03">2</E>). Pricing variations based on whether a consumer elects to use a specific feature of a prepaid account, such as waiver of the monthly fee for consumers electing to receive direct deposit, does not constitute multiple service plans or a loyalty plan. See comment 18(b)(3)(iii)-1.ii for guidance on providing a single disclosure for like fees for multiple service plan short form disclosures.</P>

                  <P>1. <E T="03">Conditions must be in close proximity to fee amount.</E> Pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii), the long form disclosure generally must disclose all fees that may be imposed in connection with a prepaid account, including the amount of the fee and any conditions under which the fee may be imposed, waived, or reduced. Pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(7)(i)(B), text describing the conditions under which a fee may be imposed must appear in the table in the long form disclosure in close proximity to the fee amount disclosed pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii). For example, a financial institution is deemed to comply with this requirement if the text describing the conditions is located directly to the right of the fee amount in the long form disclosure, as illustrated in Sample Form A-10(f). See comment 18(b)(6)(i)(B)-2 regarding stacking of electronic disclosures for display on smaller screen sizes.</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Category of function for finance charges.</E> Section 1005.18(b)(7)(i)(B) requires that the information required by § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii) must be generally grouped together and organized under subheadings by the categories of function for which a financial institution may impose the fee. If any finance charges may be imposed on the prepaid account as described in Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.4(b)(11)(ii), in connection with a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in 12 CFR 1026.61, the financial institution may, but is not required to, group all finance charges together under a single subheading. This includes situations where the financial institution imposes a higher fee or charge on the asset feature of a prepaid account with a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card than the amount of a comparable fee or charge it imposes on any prepaid account in the same prepaid account program that does not have such a credit feature. For example, if a financial institution charges on the prepaid account a $0.50 per transaction fee for each transaction that accesses funds in the asset feature of a prepaid account and a $1.25 per transaction fee for each transaction where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit from the covered separate credit feature in the course of the transaction, the financial institution is permitted to disclose the $0.50 per transaction fee under a general transactional subheading and disclose the additional $0.75 per transaction fee under a separate subheading together with any other finance charges that may be imposed on the prepaid account.</P>

                  <P>1. <E T="03">Minimum type size.</E> Section 1005.18(b)(7)(ii) sets forth minimum type/pixel size requirements for each element of the disclosures required by § 1005.18(b)(2), (b)(3)(i) and (ii), and (b)(4). A financial institution may provide disclosures in a type size larger than the required minimum to enhance consumer comprehension in any acquisition scenario, as long as the financial institution complies with the type/pixel size hierarchy set forth in § 1005.18(b)(7)(ii).</P>
                  <P>2. “<E T="03">Point” refers to printed disclosures and “pixel” refers to electronic disclosures.</E> References in § 1005.18(b)(7)(ii) to “point” size correspond to printed disclosures and references to “pixel” size correspond to disclosures provided via electronic means.</P>

                  <P>1. <E T="03">Contrast required between type color and background of disclosures.</E> Section § 1005.18(b)(7)(ii)(A) requires that all text used to disclose information in the short form or in the long form disclosure pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2), (b)(3)(i) and (ii), and (b)(4) must be in a single, easy-to-read type that is all black or one color and printed on a background that provides a clear contrast. A financial institution complies with the color requirements if, for example, it provides the disclosures required by § 1005.18(b)(2), (b)(3)(i) and (ii), and (b)(4) printed in black type on a white background or white type on a black <PRTPAGE P="316"/>background. Also, pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(7)(ii)(A), the type and color may differ between the short form disclosure and the long form disclosure provided for a particular prepaid account program. For example, a financial institution may use one font/type style for the short form disclosure for a particular prepaid account program and use a different font/type style for the long form disclosure for that same prepaid account program. Similarly, a financial institution may use black type for the short form disclosure for a particular prepaid account program and use blue type for the long form disclosure for that same prepaid account program.</P>
                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">18(b)(7)(iii) Segregation</HD>
                  <P>1. <E T="03">Permitted information outside the short form and long form disclosures.</E> Section 1005.18(b)(7)(iii) requires that the short form and long form disclosures required by § 1005.18(b)(2) and (4) be segregated from other information and contain only information that is required or permitted for those disclosures by § 1005.18(b). This segregation requirement does not prohibit the financial institution from providing information elsewhere on the same page as the short form disclosure, such as the information required by § 1005.18(b)(5), additional disclosures required by state law for payroll card accounts, or any other information the financial institution wishes to provide about the prepaid account. Similarly, the segregation requirement does not prohibit a financial institution from providing the long form disclosure on the same page as other disclosures or information, or as part of a larger document, such as the prepaid account agreement. <E T="03">See also</E> § 1005.18(b)(1) and (f)(1).</P>

                  <P>1. <E T="03">Consistent terminology.</E> Section 1005.18(b)(8) requires that fee names and other terms be used consistently within and across the disclosures required by § 1005.18(b). For example, a financial institution may not name the fee required to be disclosed by § 1005.18(b)(2)(vii) an “inactivity fee” in the short form disclosure and a “dormancy fee” in the long form disclosure. However, a financial institution may substitute the term prepaid “account” for the term prepaid “card,” as appropriate, wherever it is used in § 1005.18(b).</P>
                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">18(b)(9) Prepaid Accounts Acquired in Foreign Languages</HD>
                  <P>1. <E T="03">Prepaid accounts acquired in foreign languages.</E> Section 1005.18(b)(9)(i) requires a financial institution to provide the pre-acquisition disclosures required by § 1005.18(b)(2) of this section in a foreign language in certain circumstances.</P>
                  <P>i. <E T="03">Examples of situations in which foreign language disclosures are required.</E> The following examples illustrate situations in which a financial institution must provide the pre-acquisition disclosures in a foreign language in connection with the acquisition of that prepaid account:</P>
                  <P>A. The financial institution principally uses a foreign language on the packaging material of a prepaid account sold in a retail location or distributed at a bank or credit union branch, even though a few words appear in English on the packaging.</P>
                  <P>B. The financial institution principally uses a foreign language in a television advertisement for a prepaid account. That advertisement includes a telephone number a consumer can call to acquire the prepaid account, whether by speaking to a customer service representative or interacting with an interactive voice response (IVR) system.</P>
                  <P>C. The financial institution principally uses a foreign language in an online advertisement for a prepaid account. That advertisement includes a Web site URL through which a consumer can acquire the prepaid account.</P>
                  <P>D. The financial institution principally uses a foreign language on a printed advertisement for a prepaid account. That advertisement includes a telephone number or a Web site URL a consumer can call or visit to acquire the prepaid account. The pre-acquisition disclosures must be provided to the consumer in that same foreign language prior to the consumer acquiring the prepaid account.</P>
                  <P>E. The financial institution does not principally use a foreign language on prepaid account packaging material nor does it principally use a foreign language to advertise, solicit, or market a prepaid account. A consumer calls the financial institution and has the option to proceed with the prepaid account acquisition process in a foreign language, whether by speaking to a customer service representative or interacting with an IVR system.</P>
                  <P>F. The financial institution does not principally use a foreign language on prepaid account packaging material nor does it principally use a foreign language to advertise, solicit, or market a prepaid account. A consumer visits the financial institution's Web site. On that Web site, the consumer has the option to proceed with the prepaid account acquisition process in a foreign language.</P>
                  <P>ii. <E T="03">Examples of situations in which foreign language disclosures are not required.</E> The following examples illustrate situations in which a financial institution is not required to provide the pre-acquisition disclosures in a foreign language:</P>

                  <P>A. A consumer visits the financial institution's branch location in person and speaks to an employee in a foreign language about acquiring a prepaid account. The consumer <PRTPAGE P="317"/>proceeds with the acquisition process in that foreign language.</P>
                  <P>B. The financial institution does not principally use a foreign language on prepaid account packaging material nor does it principally use a foreign language to advertise, solicit, or market a prepaid account. A consumer calls the financial institution's customer service line and speaks to a customer service representative in a foreign language. However, if the customer service representative proceeds with the prepaid account acquisition process over the telephone, the financial institution would be required to provide the pre-acquisition disclosures in that foreign language.</P>
                  <P>C. The financial institution principally uses a foreign language in an advertisement for a prepaid account. That advertisement includes a telephone number a consumer can call to acquire the prepaid account. The consumer calls the telephone number provided on the advertisement and has the option to proceed with the prepaid account acquisition process in English or in a foreign language. The consumer chooses to proceed with the acquisition process in English.</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Principally used.</E> All relevant facts and circumstances determine whether a foreign language is principally used by the financial institution to advertise, solicit, or market under § 1005.18(b)(9). Whether a foreign language is principally used is determined at the packaging material, advertisement, solicitation, or marketing communication level, not at the prepaid account program level or across the financial institution's activities as a whole. A financial institution that advertises a prepaid account program in multiple languages would evaluate its use of foreign language in each advertisement to determine whether it has principally used a foreign language therein.</P>
                  <P>3. <E T="03">Advertise, solicit, or market a prepaid account.</E> Any commercial message, appearing in any medium, that promotes directly or indirectly the availability of prepaid accounts constitutes advertising, soliciting, or marketing for purposes of § 1005.18(b)(9). Examples illustrating advertising, soliciting, or marketing include, but are not limited to:</P>
                  <P>i. Messages in a leaflet, promotional flyer, newspaper, or magazine.</P>
                  <P>ii. Electronic messages, such as on a Web site or mobile application.</P>
                  <P>iii. Telephone solicitations.</P>
                  <P>iv. Solicitations sent to the consumer by mail or email.</P>
                  <P>v. Television or radio commercials.</P>
                  <P>4. <E T="03">Information in the long form disclosure in English.</E> Section 1005.18(b)(9)(ii) states that a financial institution required to provide pre-acquisition disclosures in a foreign language pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(9)(i) must also provide the information required to be disclosed in its pre-acquisition long form disclosure pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(4) in English upon a consumer's request and on any part of the Web site where it discloses this information in a foreign language. A financial institution may, but is not required to, provide the English version of the information required by § 1005.18(b)(4) in accordance with the formatting, grouping, size and other requirements set forth in § 1005.18(b) for the long form disclosure.</P>
                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">18(c) Access to Prepaid Account Information</HD>
                  <P>1. <E T="03">Posted transactions.</E> The electronic and written history of the consumer's account transactions provided under § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) and (iii), respectively, shall reflect transfers once they have been posted to the account. Thus, a financial institution does not need to include transactions that have been authorized but that have not yet posted to the account.</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Electronic history.</E> The electronic history required under § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) must be made available in a form that the consumer may keep, as required under § 1005.4(a)(1). Financial institutions may satisfy this requirement if they make the electronic history available in a format that is capable of being retained. For example, a financial institution satisfies the requirement if it provides electronic history on a Web site in a format that is capable of being printed or stored electronically using a web browser.</P>
                  <P>3. <E T="03">Written history.</E> Requests that exceed the requirements of § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii) for providing written account transaction history, and which therefore a financial institution may charge a fee, include the following:</P>
                  <P>i. A financial institution may assess a fee or charge to a consumer for responding to subsequent requests for written account transaction history made in a single calendar month. For example, if a consumer requests written account transaction history on June 1 and makes another request on August 5, the financial institution may not assess a fee or charge to the consumer for responding to either request. However, if the consumer requests written account transaction history on June 1 and then makes another request on June 15, the financial institution may assess a fee or charge to the consumer for responding to the request made on June 15, as this is the second response in the same month.</P>

                  <P>ii. If a financial institution maintains more than 24 months of written account transaction history, it may assess a fee or charge to the consumer for providing a written history for transactions occurring more than 24 months preceding the date the financial institution receives the consumer's request, provided the consumer specifically requests the written account transaction history for that time period.<PRTPAGE P="318"/>
                  </P>

                  <P>iii. If a financial institution offers a consumer the ability to request automatic mailings of written account transaction history on a monthly or other periodic basis, it may assess a fee or charge for such automatic mailings but not for the written account transaction history requested pursuant to § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii). <E T="03">See</E> comment 18(c)-6.</P>
                  <P>4. <E T="03">12 months of electronic account transaction history.</E> Section 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) requires a financial institution to make available at least 12 months of account transaction history electronically. If a prepaid account has been opened for fewer than 12 months, the financial institution need only provide electronic account transaction history pursuant to § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) since the time of account opening. If a prepaid account is closed or becomes inactive, as defined by the financial institution, the financial institution need not make available electronic account transaction history. <E T="03">See</E> comment 9(b)-3. If an inactive account becomes active, the financial institution must again make available 12 months of electronic account transaction history.</P>
                  <P>5. <E T="03">24 months of written account transaction history.</E> Section 1005.18(c)(1)(iii) requires a financial institution to provide at least 24 months of account transaction history in writing upon the consumer's request. A financial institution may provide fewer than 24 months of written account transaction history if the consumer requests a shorter period of time. If a prepaid account has been opened for fewer than 24 months, the financial institution need only provide written account transaction history pursuant to § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii) since the time of account opening. Even if a prepaid account is closed or becomes inactive, the financial institution must continue to provide upon request at least 24 months of written account transaction history preceding the date the request is received. When a prepaid account has been closed or inactive for 24 months or longer, the financial institution is no longer required to make available any written account transaction history pursuant to § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii).</P>
                  <P>6. <E T="03">Periodic statement alternative for unverified prepaid accounts.</E> For prepaid accounts that are not payroll card accounts or government benefit accounts, a financial institution is not required to provide a written history of the consumer's account transactions for any prepaid account for which the financial institution has not completed its consumer identification and verification process as described in § 1005.18(e)(3)(i)(A) through (C). If a prepaid account is verified, a financial institution must provide written account transaction history upon the consumer's request that includes the period during which the account was not verified, provided that the period is within the 24-month time frame specified in § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii).</P>
                  <P>7. <E T="03">Inclusion of all fees charged.</E> A financial institution that furnishes a periodic statement pursuant to § 1005.9(b) for a prepaid account must disclose the amount of any fees assessed against the account, whether for electronic fund transfers or otherwise, on the periodic statement as well as on any electronic or written account transaction history the financial institution makes available or provides to the consumer. For example, if a financial institution sends periodic statements and also makes available the consumer's electronic account transaction history on its Web site, the financial institution must disclose the amount of any fees assessed against the account, whether for electronic fund transfers or otherwise, on the periodic statement and on the consumer's electronic account transaction history made available on its Web site. Likewise, a financial institution that follows the periodic statement alternative in § 1005.18(c)(1) must disclose the amount of any fees assessed against the account, whether for electronic fund transfers or otherwise, on the electronic history of the consumer's account transactions made available pursuant to § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) and any written history of the consumer's account transactions provided pursuant to § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii).</P>
                  <P>8. <E T="03">Summary totals of fees.</E> Section 1005.18(c)(5) requires a financial institution to disclose a summary total of the amount of all fees assessed by the financial institution against a prepaid account for the prior calendar month and for the calendar year to date.</P>
                  <P>i. <E T="03">Generally.</E> A financial institution that furnishes a periodic statement pursuant to § 1005.9(b) for a prepaid account must display the monthly and annual fee totals on the periodic statement as well as on any electronic or written account transaction history the financial institution makes available or provides to the consumer. For example, if a financial institution sends periodic statements and also makes available the consumer's electronic account transaction history on its Web site, the financial institution must display the monthly and annual fee totals on the periodic statement and on the consumer's electronic account transaction history made available on its Web site. Likewise, a financial institution that follows the periodic statement alternative in § 1005.18(c)(1) must display the monthly and annual fee totals on the electronic history of the consumer's account transactions made available pursuant to § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) and any written history of the consumer's account transactions provided pursuant to § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii). If a financial institution provides periodic statements pursuant to § 1005.9(b), fee totals may be disclosed for each statement period rather than each calendar month, if different. The summary totals of fees should be net of any fee reversals.<PRTPAGE P="319"/>
                  </P>
                  <P>ii. <E T="03">Third-party fees.</E> A financial institution may, but is not required to, include third-party fees in its summary totals of fees provided pursuant to § 1005.18(c)(5). For example, a financial institution must include in the summary totals of fees the fee it charges a consumer for using an out-of-network ATM, but it need not include any fee charged by an ATM operator, with whom the financial institution has no relationship, for the consumer's use of that operator's ATM. Similarly, a financial institution need not include in the summary totals of fees the fee charged by a third-party reload network for the service of adding cash to a prepaid account at a point-of-sale terminal. A financial institution may, but is not required to, inform consumers of third-party fees such as by providing a disclaimer to indicate that the summary totals do not include certain third-party fees or to explain when third-party fees may occur or through some other method.</P>
                  <P>9. <E T="03">Display of summary totals of fees.</E> A financial institution may, but is not required to, also include sub-totals of the types of fees that make up the summary totals of fees as required by § 1005.18(c)(5). For example, if a financial institution distinguishes optional fees (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> custom card design fees) from fees to use the account, in displaying the summary totals of fees, the financial institution may include sub-totals of those fees, provided the financial institution also presents the combined totals of all fees.</P>
                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">18(e) Modified Limitations on Liability and Error Resolution Requirements</HD>
                  <P>1. <E T="03">Error resolution safe harbor provision.</E> Institutions that choose to investigate notices of error provided up to 120 days from the date a transaction has posted to a consumer's account may still disclose the error resolution time period required by the regulation (as set forth in the model clause in paragraph (b) of appendix A-7 of this part). Specifically, an institution may disclose to prepaid account holders that the institution will investigate any notice of error provided within 60 days of the consumer electronically accessing an account or receiving a written history upon request that reflects the error, even if, for some or all transactions, the institution investigates any notice of error provided up to 120 days from the date that the transaction alleged to be in error has posted to the consumer's account. Similarly, an institution's summary of the consumer's liability (as required under § 1005.7(b)(1)) may disclose that liability is based on the consumer providing notice of error within 60 days of the consumer electronically accessing an account or receiving a written history reflecting the error, even if, for some or all transactions, the institution allows a consumer to assert a notice of error up to 120 days from the date of posting of the alleged error.</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Electronic access.</E> A consumer is deemed to have accessed a prepaid account electronically when the consumer enters a user identification code or password or otherwise complies with a security procedure used by an institution to verify the consumer's identity and to provide access to a Web site or mobile application through which account information can be viewed. An institution is not required to determine whether a consumer has in fact accessed information about specific transactions to trigger the beginning of the 60-day periods for liability limits and error resolution under §§ 1005.6 and 1005.11. A consumer is not deemed to have accessed a prepaid account electronically when the consumer receives an automated text message or other automated account alert, or checks the account balance by telephone.</P>
                  <P>3. <E T="03">Untimely notice of error.</E> An institution that provides a transaction history under § 1005.18(c)(1) is not required to comply with the requirements of § 1005.11 for any notice of error from the consumer received more than 60 days after the earlier of the date the consumer electronically accesses the account transaction history or the date the financial institution sends a written account transaction history upon the consumer's request. (Alternatively, as provided in § 1005.18(e)(2)(ii), an institution need not comply with the requirements of § 1005.11 with respect to any notice of error received from the consumer more than 120 days after the date of posting of the transfer allegedly in error.) Where the consumer's assertion of error involves an unauthorized EFT, however, the institution must comply with § 1005.6 (including the extension of time limits in § 1005.6(b)(4)) before it may impose any liability on the consumer.</P>
                  <P>4. <E T="03">Verification of accounts.</E> Section 1005.18(e)(3) provides that for prepaid accounts that are not payroll card accounts or government benefit accounts, a financial institution need not extend provisional credit for any prepaid account for which it has not completed its collection of consumer identification and verification process. Consumer identifying information may include the consumer's full name, address, date of birth, and Social Security number or other government-issued identification number.</P>
                  <P>5. <E T="03">Financial institution has not completed verification.</E> Section 1005.18(e)(3)(ii)(A) states that, provided it discloses to the consumer the risks of not registering a prepaid account, a financial institution has not completed its consumer identification and verification process where it has not concluded the process with respect to a particular consumer. For example, a financial institution initiates the identification and verification process by collecting identifying <PRTPAGE P="320"/>information about a consumer and informing the consumer of the nature of the outstanding information, but despite efforts to obtain additional information from the consumer, the financial institution is unable to conclude the process because of conflicting information about the consumer's current address. As long as the information needed to complete the verification process remains outstanding, the financial institution has not concluded its consumer identification and verification process with respect to that consumer. A financial institution may not delay completing its customer identification and verification process or refuse to verify a consumer's identity based on the consumer's assertion of an error.</P>
                  <P>6. <E T="03">Account verification prior to acquisition.</E> A financial institution that collects and verifies consumer identifying information, or that obtains such information after it has been collected and verified by a third party, prior to or as part of the account acquisition process, is deemed to have completed its consumer identification and verification process with respect to that account. For example, a university contracts with a financial institution to disburse financial aid to students via the financial institution's prepaid accounts. To facilitate the accurate disbursal of aid awards, the university provides the financial institution with identifying information about the university's students, whose identities the university had previously verified. The financial institution is deemed to have completed its consumer identification and verification process with respect to those accounts.</P>

                  <P>1. <E T="03">Initial disclosure of fees and other information.</E> Section 1005.18(f)(1) requires a financial institution to include, as part of the initial disclosures given pursuant to § 1005.7, all of the information required to be disclosed in its pre-acquisition long form disclosure pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(4). Section 1005.18(b)(4)(ii) requires a financial institution to disclose in its pre-acquisition long form disclosure all fees imposed in connection with a prepaid account. Section 1005.18(b)(4) also contains several specific statements that must be provided as part of the long form disclosure. A financial institution may, but is not required to, disclose the information required by § 1005.18(b)(4) in accordance with the formatting, grouping, size and other requirements set forth in § 1005.18(b) for the long form disclosure as part of its initial disclosures provided pursuant to § 1005.7; a financial institution may choose to do so, however, in order to satisfy other requirements in § 1005.18. See, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii) regarding the retail location exception.</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Changes to the Regulation Z disclosures for overdraft credit features.</E> Pursuant to § 1005.18(f)(2), if a financial institution provides pursuant § 1005.18(f)(1) the Regulation Z disclosures required by § 1005.18(b)(4)(vii) for an overdraft credit feature, the financial institution is not required to provide a change-in-terms notice solely to reflect a change in the fees or other terms disclosed therein. This exception does not extend to any finance charges imposed on the prepaid account as described in Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.4(b)(11)(ii), in connection with a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in 12 CFR 1026.61 that are required to be disclosed pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii). <E T="03">See</E> comment 18(b)(4)(ii)-1.</P>
                  <P>3. <E T="03">Web site and telephone number on a prepaid account access device.</E> Section 1005.18(f)(3) requires that the name of a financial institution and the Web site URL and a telephone number that a consumer can use to contact the financial institution about the prepaid account must be disclosed on the prepaid account access device. A disclosure made on an accompanying document, such as a terms and conditions document, on packaging material surrounding an access device, or on a sticker or other label affixed to an access device does not constitute a disclosure on the access device. The financial institution must provide this information to allow consumers to, for example, contact the financial institution to learn about the terms and conditions of the prepaid account, obtain prepaid account balance information, request a copy of transaction history pursuant to § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii) if the financial institution does not provide periodic statements pursuant to § 1005.9(b), or to notify the financial institution when the consumer believes that an unauthorized electronic fund transfer has occurred as required by §§ 1005.7(b)(2) and 1005.18(d)(1)(ii).</P>

                  <P>3. <E T="03">Scope of § 1005.18(g).</E> Under § 1005.18(g), a financial institution may offer different terms on different prepaid account programs.

                  <P>E. Account features offered in connection with the asset feature of the prepaid account, such as online bill payment services.</P>
                  <P>5. <E T="03">Fees.</E> i. With respect to a prepaid account program where consumers may be offered a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined by Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.61, § 1005.18(g) only permits a financial institution to charge the same or higher fees on the asset feature of a prepaid account with a covered separate credit feature than the amount of a comparable fee it charges on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program that do not have a such a credit feature. Section 1005.18(g) prohibits a financial institution from imposing a lower fee or charge on prepaid accounts with a covered separate credit feature than the amount of a comparable fee or charge it charges on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program without such a credit feature. With regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature of a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.61, a fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account generally is a finance charge under Regulation Z (12 CFR part 1026) to the extent that the amount of the fee or charge exceeds the amount of a comparable fee or charge imposed on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program that do not have such a credit feature. <E T="03">See</E> Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.4(b)(11)(ii). With regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature of a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.61, this comment below provides illustrations of how § 1005.18(g) applies to fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of a prepaid account. The term “non-covered separate credit feature” refers to a separate credit feature that is not accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.61.</P>
                  <P>ii. The following examples illustrate how § 1005.18(g) applies to per transaction fees for each transaction to access funds available in the asset feature of the prepaid account.</P>
                  <P>A. Assume that a consumer has selected a prepaid account program where a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card may be offered. For prepaid accounts without such a credit feature, the financial institution charges $0.50 for each transaction conducted that accesses funds available in the prepaid account. For prepaid accounts with a credit feature, the financial institution also charges $0.50 on the asset feature for each transaction conducted that accesses funds available in the asset feature of the prepaid account. In this case, for purposes of § 1005.18(g), the financial institution is imposing the same fee for each transaction that accesses funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account, regardless of whether the prepaid account has a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card. Also, with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature of a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as those terms are defined in Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.61, the $0.50 per transaction fee imposed on the asset feature for each transaction that accesses funds available in the asset feature of the prepaid account is not a finance charge under 12 CFR 1026.4(b)(11)(ii). See Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.4(b)(11)(ii) and comment 4(b)(11)(ii)-1, for a discussion of the definition of finance charge with respect to fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of a prepaid account with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature of a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in 12 CFR 1026.61.</P>

                  <P>B. Same facts as in paragraph A, except that for prepaid accounts with a covered separate credit feature, the financial institution imposes a $1.25 fee for each transaction conducted that accesses funds available in the asset feature of the prepaid account. In this case, the financial institution is permitted <PRTPAGE P="322"/>to charge a higher fee under § 1005.18(g)(2) on prepaid accounts with a covered separate credit feature than it charges on prepaid accounts without such a credit feature. The $0.75 excess is a finance charge under Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.4(b)(11)(ii).</P>
                  <P>C. Same facts as in paragraph A, except that for prepaid accounts with a covered separate credit feature, the financial institution imposes a $0.25 fee for each transaction conducted that accesses funds available in the asset feature of the prepaid account. In this case, the financial institution is in violation of § 1005.18(g) because it is imposing a lower fee on the asset feature of a prepaid account with a covered separate credit feature than it imposes on prepaid accounts in the same program without such a credit feature.</P>
                  <P>iii. Where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit from a covered separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct person-to-person transfers, any per transaction fees imposed on the asset feature of prepaid accounts, including load and transfer fees, with such a credit feature are comparable only to per transaction fees for each transaction to access funds in the asset feature of a prepaid account that are imposed on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program that does not have such a credit feature. Per transaction fees for a transaction that is conducted to load or draw funds into a prepaid account from a source other than the funds in the asset feature are not comparable for purposes of § 1005.18(g). To illustrate:</P>
                  <P>A. Assume a financial institution charges $0.50 on prepaid accounts for each transaction that accesses funds in the asset feature of the prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature. Also, assume that the financial institution charges $0.50 per transaction on the asset feature of prepaid accounts in the same prepaid program where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit from a covered separate credit feature in the course of a transaction. In this case, for purposes of § 1005.18(g), the financial institution is imposing the same fee for each transaction it pays, regardless of whether the transaction accesses funds available in the asset feature of the prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature, or is paid from credit from a covered separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct person-to-person transfers. Also, for purposes of Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.4(b)(11)(ii), the $0.50 per transaction fee imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account with a covered separate credit feature is not a finance charge.</P>
                  <P>B. Assume same facts as in paragraph A above, except that assume the financial institution charges $1.25 on the asset feature of a prepaid account for each transaction where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit from the covered separate credit feature in the course of the transaction. The financial institution is permitted to charge the higher fee under § 1005.18(g) for transactions that access the covered separate credit feature in the course of the transaction than the amount of the comparable fee it charges for each transaction that accesses funds available in the asset feature of the prepaid accounts without such a credit feature. The $0.75 excess is a finance charge under Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.4(b)(11)(ii).</P>
                  <P>C. Same facts as in paragraph A, except that the financial institution imposes $0.25 on the asset feature of the prepaid account for each transaction conducted where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit from the covered separate credit feature in the course of the transaction. In this case, the financial institution is in violation of § 1005.18(g) because it is imposing a lower fee on the asset feature of a prepaid account with a covered separate credit feature than the amount of the comparable fee it imposes on prepaid accounts in the same program without such a credit feature.</P>

                  <P>D. Assume a financial institution charges $0.50 on prepaid accounts for each transaction that accesses funds in the asset feature of the prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature. Assume also that the financial institution charges both a $0.50 per transaction fee and a $1.25 transfer fee on the asset feature of prepaid accounts in the same prepaid program where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit from a covered separate credit feature in the course of a transaction. In this case, both fees charged on a per-transaction basis for the credit transaction (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> a combined fee of $1.75 per transaction) must be compared to the $0.50 per transaction fee to access funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account without a covered separate credit feature. The financial institution is permitted to charge a higher fee under § 1005.18(g) for transactions that access the covered separate credit feature in the course of the transaction than the amount of the comparable fee it charges for each transaction that accesses funds available in the asset feature of the prepaid accounts without such a credit feature. The $1.25 excess is a finance charge under Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.4(b)(11)(ii).</P>

                  <P>E. Assume same facts as in paragraph D above, except that assume the financial institution also charges a load fee of $1.25 whenever funds are transferred or loaded from a separate asset account, such as from a deposit account via a debit card, in the course of a transaction on prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature, in <PRTPAGE P="323"/>addition to charging a $0.50 per transaction fee. In this case, both fees charged on a per-transaction basis for the credit transaction (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> a combined fee of $1.75 per transaction) must be compared to the per transaction fee (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the fee of $0.50) to access funds available in the asset feature of the prepaid accounts on a prepaid account without a covered separate credit feature. Per transaction fees for a transaction that is conducted by drawing funds into a prepaid account from some other source (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the fee of $1.25) are not comparable for purposes of § 1005.18(g). The financial institution is permitted to charge a higher fee under § 1005.18(g) for transactions that access the covered separate credit feature in the course of the transaction than the amount of the comparable fee it charges for each transaction to access funds available in the asset feature of the prepaid accounts without such a credit feature. The $1.25 excess is a finance charge under Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.4(b)(11)(ii).</P>

                  <P>iv. A consumer may choose in a particular circumstance to draw or transfer credit from the covered separate credit feature outside the course of a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or service, obtain cash, or conduct person-to-person transfers. For example, a consumer may use the prepaid card at the financial institution's Web site to load funds from the covered separate credit feature outside the course of a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct person-to-person transfers. <E T="03">See</E> Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.61(a)(2)(i)(B) and comment 61(a)(2)-4.ii. In these situations, load or transfer fees imposed for draws or transfers of credit from the covered separate credit feature outside the course of a transaction are compared only with fees, if any, to load funds as a direct deposit of salary from an employer or a direct deposit of government benefits that are charged on prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature. Fees imposed on prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature for a one-time load or transfer of funds from a separate asset account or from a non-covered separate credit feature are not comparable for purposes of § 1005.18(g). To illustrate:</P>

                  <P>A. Assume a financial institution charges a $1.25 load fee to transfer funds from a non-covered separate credit feature, such as a non-covered separate credit card account, into prepaid accounts that do not have a covered separate credit feature and does not charge a fee for a direct deposit of salary from an employer or a direct deposit of government benefits on those prepaid accounts. Assume the financial institution charges $1.25 on the asset feature of a prepaid account with a covered separate credit feature to load funds from the covered separate credit feature outside the course of a transaction. In this case, the load or transfer fees imposed for draws or transfers of credit from the covered separate credit feature outside the course of a transaction (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the fee of $1.25) is compared with the fees to load funds as a direct deposit of salary from an employer or a direct deposit of government benefits that are charged on prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the fee of $0). Fees imposed on prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature for a one-time load or transfer of funds from a separate asset account (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the fee of $1.25) is not comparable for purposes of § 1005.18(g). In this case, the financial institution is permitted to charge a higher fee under § 1005.18(g) for transactions that access the covered separate credit feature on prepaid accounts with a credit feature than the amount of the comparable fee it charges on prepaid accounts in the same program without such a credit feature. The $1.25 fee imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account with a separate credit feature is a finance charge under Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.4(b)(11)(ii).</P>

                  <P>B. Assume that a financial institution charges a $1.25 load fee for a one-time transfer of funds from a separate asset account, such as from a deposit account via a debit card, to a prepaid account without a covered separate credit feature and does not charge a fee for a direct deposit of salary from an employer or a direct deposit of government benefits on those prepaid accounts. Assume the financial institution charges $1.25 on the asset feature of a prepaid account with a covered separate credit feature to load funds from the covered separate credit feature outside the course of a transaction. In this case, the load or transfer fees imposed for draws or transfers of credit from the covered separate credit feature outside the course of a transaction (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the fee of $1.25) is compared with the fees to load funds as a direct deposit of salary from an employer or a direct deposit of government benefits that are charged on prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the fee of $0). Fees imposed on prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature for a one-time load or transfer of funds from a separate asset account (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the fee of $1.25) is not comparable for purposes of § 1005.18(g). In this case, the financial institution is permitted to charge a higher fee under § 1005.18(g) for transactions that access the covered separate credit feature on prepaid accounts with a credit feature than the amount of the comparable fee it charges on prepaid accounts in the same program without such a credit feature. The $1.25 fee imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account with a covered separate credit feature is a finance charge under Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.4(b)(11)(ii).<PRTPAGE P="324"/>

This effective date applies to disclosures made available or provided to consumers electronically, orally by telephone, or in a form other than on pre-printed materials, such as disclosures printed on paper by a financial institution upon a consumer's request.</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Disclosures on prepaid account access devices and prepaid account packaging materials.</E> Section 1005.18(h)(2)(i) provides that the disclosure requirements of subpart A, as modified by § 1005.18, do not apply to any disclosures that are provided, or that would otherwise be required to be provided, on prepaid account access devices, or on, in, or with prepaid account packaging materials that were manufactured, printed, or otherwise produced in the normal course of business prior to October 1, 2017. This includes, for example, disclosures contained on or in packages for prepaid accounts sold at retail, or disclosures for payroll card accounts or government benefit accounts that are distributed to employees or benefits recipients in packages or envelopes. Disclosures and access devices that are manufactured, printed, or otherwise produced on or after October 1, 2017 must comply with all the requirements of subpart A.</P>
                  <P>3. <E T="03">Form of notice to consumers.</E> A financial institution that is required to notify consumers of a change in terms and conditions pursuant to § 1005.18(h)(2)(ii) or (iii), or that otherwise provides updated initial disclosures as a result of § 1005.18(h)(1) taking effect, may provide the notice or disclosures either as a separate document or included in another notice or mailing that the consumer receives regarding the prepaid account to the extent permitted by other laws and regulations.</P>
                  <P>4. <E T="03">Ability to contact the consumer.</E> A financial institution that has not obtained the consumer's contact information is not required to comply with the requirements set forth in § 1005.18(h)(2)(ii) or (iii). A financial institution is able to contact the consumer when, for example, it has the consumer's mailing address or email address.</P>
                  <P>5. <E T="03">Closed and inactive prepaid accounts.</E> The requirements of § 1005.18(h)(2)(iii) do not apply to prepaid accounts that are closed or inactive, as defined by the financial institution. However, if an inactive account becomes active, the financial institution must comply with the applicable portions of those provisions within 30 days of the account becoming active again in order to avail itself of the timing requirements and accommodations set forth in§ 1005.18(h)(2)(iii) and (iv).</P>

If, on October 1, 2017, the financial institution does not have readily accessible the data necessary to make available or provide the account histories for the required time periods, the financial institution may make available or provide such histories using the data for the time period it has until the financial institution has accumulated the data necessary to comply in full with the requirements set forth in § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) and (iii). For example, a financial institution that had been retaining only 60 days of account history before October 1, 2017 would provide 60 days of written account transaction history upon a consumer's request on October 1, 2017. If, on November 1, 2017, the consumer made another request for written account transaction history, the financial institution would be required to provide three months of account history. The financial institution must continue to provide as much account history as it has accumulated at the time of a consumer's request until it has accumulated 24 months of account history. Thus, all financial institutions must fully comply with the electronic account transaction history requirement set forth in § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) no later than October 1, 2018 and must fully comply with the written account transaction history requirement set forth in § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii) no later than October 1, 2019.</P>

If, on October 1, 2017, the financial institution does not have readily accessible the data necessary to calculate the summary totals of fees for the prior calendar month or the calendar year to date, the financial institution may provide the summary totals using the data it has until the financial institution has accumulated the data necessary to display the summary totals as required by § 1005.18(c)(5). That is, the financial institution would first display the monthly fee total beginning on November 1, 2017 for the month of October, and the year-to-date fee total beginning on October 1, 2017, provided <PRTPAGE P="325"/>the financial institution discloses that it is displaying the year-to-date total beginning on October 1, 2017 rather than for the entire calendar year 2017.

                  <P>i. Addition or deletion of a provision giving the issuer or consumer a right under the agreement, such as a clause that allows an issuer to unilaterally change the terms of an agreement.</P>
                  <P>ii. Addition or deletion of a provision giving the issuer or consumer an obligation under the agreement, such as a clause requiring the consumer to pay an additional fee.</P>
                  <P>iii. Changes that may affect the cost of the prepaid account to the consumer, such as changes in a provision describing how the prepaid account's monthly fee will be calculated.</P>
                  <P>iv. Changes that may affect how the terms of the agreement are construed or applied, such as changes to a choice of law provision.</P>
                  <P>v. Changes that may affect the parties to whom the agreement may apply, such as changes to provisions regarding authorized users or assignment of the agreement.</P>
                  <P>vi. Changes to the corporate name of the issuer or program manager, or to the issuer's address or identifying number, such as its RSSD ID number or tax identification number.</P>
                  <P>vii. Changes to the names of other relevant parties, such as the employer for a payroll card program or the agency for a government benefit program.</P>
                  <P>viii. Changes to the name of the prepaid account program to which the agreement applies.</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Non-substantive changes.</E> Changes that generally would not be considered substantive include, for example:</P>
                  <P>i. Correction of typographical errors that do not affect the meaning of any terms of the agreement.</P>
                  <P>ii. Changes to the issuer's corporate logo or tagline.</P>
                  <P>iii. Changes to the format of the agreement, such as conversion to a booklet from a full-sheet format, changes in font, or changes in margins.</P>
                  <P>iv. Reordering sections of the agreement without affecting the meaning of any terms of the agreement.</P>
                  <P>v. Adding, removing, or modifying a table of contents or index.</P>
                  <P>vi. Changes to titles, headings, section numbers, or captions.</P>
                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">19(a)(4) Issuer</HD>
                  <P>1. <E T="03">Issuer.</E> Section 1005.19(a)(4) provides that, for purposes of § 1005.19, issuer or prepaid account issuer means the entity to which a consumer is legally obligated, or would be legally obligated, under the terms of a prepaid account agreement. For example, Bank X and Bank Y work together to issue prepaid accounts. A consumer that obtains a prepaid account issued pursuant to this arrangement between Bank X and Bank Y is subject to an agreement that states “This is an agreement between you, the consumer, and Bank X that governs the terms of your Bank Y Prepaid Account.” The prepaid account issuer in this example is Bank X, because the agreement creates a legally enforceable obligation between the consumer and Bank X. Bank X is the issuer even if the consumer applied for the prepaid account through a link on Bank Y's Web site and the cards prominently feature the Bank Y logo on the front of the card.</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Use of third-party service providers.</E> An issuer has a legal obligation to comply with the requirements of § 1005.19. However, an issuer generally may use a third-party service provider to satisfy its obligations under § 1005.19, provided that the issuer acts in accordance with regulatory guidance regarding use of third-party service providers and other applicable regulatory guidance. In some cases, an issuer may wish to arrange for the entity with which it partners to issue prepaid accounts to fulfill the requirements of § 1005.19 on the issuer's behalf. For example, Program Manager and Bank work together to issue prepaid accounts. Under the § 1005.19(a)(4) definition of issuer, Bank is the issuer of these prepaid accounts for purposes of § 1005.19. However, Program Manager services the prepaid accounts, including mailing to consumers account opening materials and <PRTPAGE P="326"/>making available to consumers their electronic account transaction history, pursuant to § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii). While Bank is responsible for ensuring compliance with § 1005.19, Bank may arrange for Program Manager (or another appropriate third-party service provider) to submit prepaid account agreements to the Bureau under § 1005.19 on Bank's behalf. Bank must comply with regulatory guidance regarding use of third-party service providers and other applicable regulatory guidance.</P>
                  <P>3. <E T="03">Third-party Web sites.</E> As explained in comment 19(c)-2, if an issuer provides consumers with access to specific information about their individual accounts, such as making available to consumers their electronic account transaction history, pursuant to § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii), through a third-party Web site, the issuer is deemed to maintain that Web site for purposes of § 1005.19. Such a Web site is deemed to be maintained by the issuer for purposes of § 1005.19 even where, for example, an unaffiliated entity designs the Web site and owns and maintains the information technology infrastructure that supports the Web site, consumers with prepaid accounts from multiple issuers can access individual account information through the same Web site, and the Web site is not labeled, branded, or otherwise held out to the public as belonging to the issuer. A partner institution's Web site is an example of a third-party Web site that may be deemed to be maintained by the issuer for purposes of § 1005.19. For example, Program Manager and Bank work together to issue prepaid accounts. Under the § 1005.19(a)(4) definition of issuer, Bank is the issuer of these prepaid accounts for purposes of § 1005.19. Bank does not maintain a Web site specifically related to prepaid accounts. However, consumers can access information about their individual accounts, such as an electronic account transaction history, through a Web site maintained by Program Manager. Program Manager designs the Web site and owns and maintains the information technology infrastructure that supports the Web site. The Web site is branded and held out to the public as belonging to Program Manager. Because consumers can access information about their individual accounts through this Web site, the Web site is deemed to be maintained by Bank for purposes of § 1005.19. Bank therefore may comply with § 1005.19(c) or (d)(1) by ensuring that agreements offered by Bank are posted on Program Manager's Web site in accordance with § 1005.19(c) or (d)(1), respectively. Bank need not create and maintain a Web site branded and held out to the public as belonging to Bank in order to comply with § 1005.19(c) and (d) as long as Bank ensures that Program Manager's Web site complies with these sections.</P>
                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">19(a)(6) Offers to the General Public</HD>
                  <P>1. <E T="03">Prepaid accounts offered to limited groups.</E> An issuer is deemed to offer a prepaid account agreement to the general public even if the issuer markets, solicits applications for, or otherwise makes available prepaid accounts only to a limited group of persons. For example, an issuer may solicit only residents of a specific geographic location for a particular prepaid account; in this case, the agreement would be considered to be offered to the general public. Similarly, agreements for prepaid accounts issued by a credit union are considered to be offered to the general public even though such prepaid accounts are available only to credit union members.</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Prepaid account agreements not offered to the general public.</E> A prepaid account agreement is not offered to the general public when a consumer is offered the agreement only by virtue of the consumer's relationship with a third party. Examples of agreements not offered to the general public include agreements for payroll card accounts, government benefit accounts, or for prepaid accounts used to distribute student financial aid disbursements, or property and casualty insurance payouts, and other similar programs.</P>
                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">19(a)(7) Open Account</HD>
                  <P>1. <E T="03">Open account.</E> A prepaid account is an open account if (i) there is an outstanding balance in the account; (ii) the consumer can load more funds to the account even if the account does not currently hold a balance; or (iii) the consumer can access credit from a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.61, in connection with a prepaid account. Under this definition, an account that meets any of these criteria is considered to be open even if the account is deemed inactive by the issuer.</P>
                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">19(a)(8) Prepaid Account</HD>
                  <P>1. <E T="03">Prepaid account.</E> Section 1005.19(a)(7) provides that, for purposes of § 1005.19, the term prepaid account means a prepaid account as defined in § 1005.2(b)(3). Therefore, for purposes of § 1005.19, a prepaid account includes, among other things, a payroll card account as defined in § 1005.2(b)(3)(iii) and a government benefit account as defined in §§ 1005.2(b)(3)(iii) and 1005.15(a)(2).</P>
                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">19(b) Submission of Agreements to the Bureau</HD>
                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">19(b)(1) Submissions on a Rolling Basis</HD>
                  <P>1. <E T="03">Rolling submission requirement.</E> Section 1005.19(b)(1) requires issuers to send submissions to the Bureau no later than 30 days after offering, amending, or ceasing to offer any prepaid account agreement, as described in § 1005.19(b)(1)(ii) through (iv). For example, <PRTPAGE P="327"/>if on July 1 an issuer offers a prepaid account agreement that has not been previously submitted to the Bureau, it must submit that agreement to the Bureau by July 31 of the same year. Similarly, if on August 1 an issuer amends a prepaid account agreement previously submitted to the Bureau, and the change becomes effective on September 15, the issuer must submit the entire amended agreement as required by § 1005.19(b)(2) by October 15 of the same year. Furthermore, if on December 31 an issuer ceases to offer a prepaid account agreement that was previously submitted to the Bureau, it must submit notification to the Bureau that it is withdrawing that agreement as required by § 1005.19(b)(3) by January 30 of the following year.</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Prepaid accounts offered in conjunction with multiple issuers.</E> If a program manager offers prepaid account agreements in conjunction with multiple issuers, each issuer must submit its own agreement to the Bureau. Alternatively, each issuer may use the program manager to submit the agreement on its behalf, in accordance with comment 19(a)(4)-2.</P>
                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">19(b)(2) Amended Agreements</HD>
                  <P>1. <E T="03">Change-in-terms notices not permissible.</E> Section 1005.19(b)(2) requires that if an agreement previously submitted to the Bureau is amended, the issuer must submit the entire revised agreement to the Bureau. An issuer may not fulfill this requirement by submitting a change-in-terms or similar notice covering only the terms that have changed. Amendments must be integrated into the text of the agreement (or the optional addendum described in § 1005.19(b)(6)), not provided as separate riders.</P>
                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">19(b)(3) Withdrawal of Agreements No Longer Offered</HD>
                  <P>1. <E T="03">No longer offers agreement.</E> Section 1005.19(b)(3) provides that, if an issuer no longer offers an agreement that was previously submitted to the Bureau, the issuer must notify the Bureau no later than 30 days after the issuer ceases to offer the agreement that it is withdrawing the agreement. An issuer no longer offers an agreement when it no longer allows a consumer to activate or register a new account in connection with that agreement.</P>
                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">19(b)(4) De Minimis Exception</HD>
                  <P>1. <E T="03">Relationship to other exceptions.</E> The de minimis exception in § 1005.19(b)(4) is distinct from the product testing exception under § 1005.19(b)(5). The de minimis exception provides that an issuer with fewer than 3,000 open prepaid accounts is not required to submit any agreements to the Bureau, regardless of whether those agreements qualify for the product testing exception. In contrast, the product testing exception provides that an issuer is not required to submit to the Bureau agreements offered solely in connection with certain types of prepaid account programs with fewer than 3,000 open accounts, regardless of the issuer's total number of open accounts.</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">De minimis exception.</E> Under § 1005.19(b)(4), an issuer is not required to submit any prepaid account agreements to the Bureau under § 1005.19(b)(1) if the issuer has fewer than 3,000 open prepaid accounts. For example, an issuer has 2,000 open prepaid accounts. The issuer is not required to submit any agreements to the Bureau because the issuer qualifies for the de minimis exception.</P>
                  <P>3. <E T="03">Date for determining whether issuer qualifies.</E> Whether an issuer qualifies for the de minimis exception is determined as of the last day of each calendar quarter. For example, an issuer has 2,500 open prepaid accounts as of December 31, the last day of the calendar quarter. As of January 30, the issuer has 3,100 open prepaid accounts. As of March 31, the last day of the following calendar quarter, the issuer has 2,700 open prepaid accounts. Even though the issuer had 3,100 open prepaid accounts at one time during the calendar quarter, the issuer qualifies for the de minimis exception because the number of open prepaid accounts was less than 3,000 as of March 31. The issuer therefore is not required to submit any agreements to the Bureau under § 1005.19(b)(1).</P>
                  <P>4. <E T="03">Date for determining whether issuer ceases to qualify.</E> Whether an issuer ceases to qualify for the de minimis exception under § 1005.19(b)(4) is determined as of the last day of the calendar quarter. For example, an issuer has 2,500 open prepaid accounts as of June 30, the last day of the calendar quarter. The issuer is not required to submit any agreements to the Bureau under § 1005.19(b) by July 30 (the 30th day after June 30) because the issuer qualifies for the de minimis exception. As of July 15, the issuer has 3,100 open prepaid accounts. The issuer is not required to take any action at this time, because whether an issuer qualifies for the de minimis exception under § 1005.19(b)(4) is determined as of the last day of the calendar quarter. The issuer still has 3,100 open prepaid accounts as of September 30. Because the issuer had 3,100 open prepaid accounts as of September 30, the issuer ceases to qualify for the de minimis exception and must submit its agreements to the Bureau by October 30, the 30th day after the last day of the calendar quarter.</P>
                  <P>5. <E T="03">Option to withdraw agreements.</E> Section 1005.19(b)(4) provides that if an issuer that did not previously qualify for the de minimis exception newly qualifies for the de minimis exception, the issuer must continue to make <PRTPAGE P="328"/>rolling submissions to the Bureau as required by § 1005.19(b)(1) until the issuer notifies the Bureau that the issuer is withdrawing all agreements it previously submitted to the Bureau. For example, an issuer offers three agreements and has 3,001 open accounts as of December 31. The issuer submitted each of the three agreements to the Bureau by January 30 as required under § 1005.19(b). As of March 31, the issuer has only 2,999 open accounts. The issuer has two options. First, the issuer may notify the Bureau that the issuer is withdrawing each of the three agreements it previously submitted. Once the issuer has notified the Bureau, the issuer is no longer required to make rolling submissions to the Bureau under § 1005.19(b) unless it later ceases to qualify for the de minimis exception. Alternatively, the issuer may choose not to notify the Bureau that it is withdrawing its agreements. In this case, the issuer must continue making rolling submissions to the Bureau as required by § 1005.19(b). The issuer might choose not to withdraw its agreements if, for example, the issuer believes it will likely cease to qualify for the de minimis exception again in the near future.</P>
                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">19(b)(6) Form and Content of Agreements Submitted to the Bureau</HD>
                  <P>1. <E T="03">Agreements currently in effect.</E> Agreements submitted to the Bureau must contain the provisions of the agreement and fee information currently in effect. For example, on June 1, an issuer decides to decrease the out-of-network ATM withdrawal fee associated with one of the agreements it offers. The change in that fee will become effective on August 1. The issuer must submit and post the amended agreement with the decreased out-of-network ATM withdrawal fee to the Bureau by August 31 as required by § 1005.19(b)(2) and (c).</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Fee information variations do not constitute separate agreements.</E> Fee information that may vary from one consumer to another depending on the consumer's state of residence or other factors must be disclosed by setting forth all the possible variations. For example, an issuer offers a prepaid account with a monthly fee of $4.95 or $0 if the consumer regularly receives direct deposit to the prepaid account. The issuer must submit to the Bureau one agreement with fee information listing the possible monthly fees of $4.95 or $0 and including the explanation that the latter fee is dependent upon the consumer regularly receiving direct deposit.</P>
                  <P>3. <E T="03">Integrated agreement requirement.</E> Issuers may not submit provisions of the agreement or fee information in the form of change-in-terms notices or riders. The only addendum that may be submitted as part of an agreement is the optional fee information addendum described in § 1005.19(b)(6)(ii). Changes in provisions or fee information must be integrated into the body of the agreement or the optional fee information addendum described in § 1005.19(b)(6)(ii). For example, it would be impermissible for an issuer to submit to the Bureau an agreement in the form of a terms and conditions document on January 1 and subsequently submit a change-in-terms notice or an addendum to indicate amendments to the previously submitted agreement. Instead, the issuer must submit a document that integrates the changes made by each of the change-in-terms notices into the body of the original terms and conditions document and a single optional addendum displaying variations in fee information.</P>
                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">19(c) Posting of Agreements Offered to the General Public</HD>
                  <P>1. <E T="03">Requirement applies only to agreements offered to the general public.</E> An issuer is only required to post and maintain on its publicly available Web site the prepaid account agreements that the issuer offers to the general public as defined by § 1005.19(a)(6) and must submit to the Bureau under § 1005.19(b). For agreements not offered to the general public, the issuer is not required to post and maintain the agreements on its publicly available Web site, but is still required to provide each individual consumer with access to his or her specific prepaid account agreement under § 1005.19(d). This posting requirement is distinct from that of § 1005.7, as modified by § 1005.18(f)(1), which requires an issuer to provide certain disclosures at the time a consumer contracts for an electronic fund transfer service or before the first electronic fund transfer is made involving the consumer's account, and the change-in-terms notice required under § 1005.8(a), as modified by § 1005.18(f)(2). This requirement is also distinct from that of § 1005.18(b)(4), which requires issuers to make the long form disclosure available to consumers prior to prepaid account acquisition and which, depending on the methods an issuer offers prepaid accounts to consumers, may require posting of the long form disclosure on the issuer's Web site. Additionally, if an issuer is not required to submit any agreements to the Bureau because the issuer qualifies for the de minimis exception under § 1005.19(b)(4) or the agreement qualifies for the product testing exception under § 1005.19(b)(5), the issuer is not required to post and maintain any agreements on its Web site under § 1005.19(c). The issuer is still required to provide each individual consumer with access to his or her specific prepaid account agreement under § 1005.19(d) by posting and maintaining the agreement on the issuer's Web site or by providing a copy of the agreement upon the consumer's request.</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Issuers that do not otherwise maintain Web sites.</E> If an issuer offers an agreement to the <PRTPAGE P="329"/>general public as defined by § 1005.19(a)(6), that issuer must post that agreement on a publicly available Web site it maintains. If an issuer provides consumers with access to specific information about their individual accounts, such as balance information or copies of statements, through a third-party Web site, the issuer is considered to maintain that Web site for purposes of § 1005.19. Such a third-party Web site is deemed to be maintained by the issuer for purposes of § 1005.19(c) even where, for example, an unaffiliated entity designs the Web site and owns and maintains the information technology infrastructure that supports the Web site, consumers with prepaid accounts from multiple issuers can access individual account information through the same Web site, and the Web site is not labeled, branded, or otherwise held out to the public as belonging to the issuer. Therefore, issuers that provide consumers with access to account-specific information through a third-party Web site can comply with § 1005.19(c) by ensuring that the agreements the issuer submits to the Bureau are posted on the third-party Web site in accordance with § 1005.19(c).</P>
                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">19(d) Agreements for All Open Accounts</HD>
                  <P>1. <E T="03">Requirement applies to all open accounts.</E> The requirement to provide access to prepaid account agreements under § 1005.19(d) applies to all open prepaid accounts. For example, an issuer that is not required to post agreements on its Web site because it qualifies for the de minimis exception under § 1005.19(b)(4) would still be required to provide consumers with access to their specific agreements under § 1005.19(d). Similarly, an agreement that is no longer offered would not be required to be posted on the issuer's Web site, but would still need to be provided to the consumer to whom it applies under § 1005.19(d). Additionally, an issuer is not required to post on its Web site agreements not offered to the general public, such as agreements for payroll card accounts and government benefit accounts, as explained in comment 19(c)-1, but the issuer must still provide consumers with access to their specific agreements under § 1005.19(d).</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Agreements sent to consumers.</E> Section 1005.19(d)(1)(ii) provides, in part, that if an issuer makes an agreement available upon request, the issuer must send the consumer a copy of the consumer's prepaid account agreement no later than five business days after the issuer receives the consumer's request. If the issuer mails the agreement, the agreement must be posted in the mail five business days after the issuer receives the consumer's request. If the issuer hand delivers or provides the agreement electronically, the agreement must be hand delivered or provided electronically five business days after the issuer receives the consumer's request. For example, if the issuer emails the agreement, the email with the attached agreement must be sent no later than five business days after the issuer receives the consumer's request.</P>

                  <P>1. <E T="03">Delayed effective date for the agreement submission requirement.</E> Section 1005.19(f)(2) provides that the requirement to submit prepaid account agreements to the Bureau on a rolling basis pursuant to § 1005.19(b) is delayed until October 1, 2018. An issuer must submit to the Bureau no later than October 31, 2018 all prepaid account agreements it offers as of October 1, 2018. After October 1, 2018, issuers must submit on a rolling basis prepaid account agreements or notifications of withdrawn agreements to the Bureau within 30 days after offering, amending, or ceasing to offer the agreements.</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Continuing obligation to post and provide consumer agreements.</E> Pursuant to § 1005.19(f)(3), during the delayed agreement submission period set forth in § 1005.19(f)(2), an issuer must post agreements on its Web site as required by § 1005.19(c) and (d)(1)(i) using the agreements it would have otherwise submitted to the Bureau under § 1005.19(b) and must provide a copy of the consumer's agreement to the consumer upon request pursuant to § 1005.19(d)(1)(ii). For purposes of § 1005.19(c)(2) and (d)(2), agreements posted by an issuer on its Web site must conform to the form and content requirements set forth in § 1005.19(b)(6). For purposes of § 1005.19(c)(3) and (d)(2)(v), amended agreements must be posted to the issuer's Web site no later than 30 days after the change becomes effective as required by § 1005.19(b)(2).<STARS/>

                  <P>1. <E T="03">Determining whether a consumer is located in a State.</E> Under § 1005.30(g), the definition of “sender” means a consumer in a State who, primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, requests a remittance transfer provider to send a remittance transfer to a designated recipient. A sender located on a U.S. military installation that is physically located in a foreign country is located in a State. For transfers sent from a prepaid account (other than a prepaid account that is a payroll card account or a government benefit account), whether the consumer is located in a State depends on the location of the consumer. If the provider does not know where the consumer is at the time the consumer requests the transfer from the consumer's prepaid account (other than a prepaid account that is a payroll card account or a government benefit account) the provider may make the determination of whether a consumer is located in a State based on information that is provided by the consumer and on any records associated with the consumer that the provider may have, such as an address provided by the consumer. For transfers from all other accounts belonging to a consumer, whether a consumer is located in a State depends on where the consumer's account is located. If the account is located in a State, the consumer will be located in a State for purposes of the definition of “sender” in § 1005.30(g), notwithstanding comment 3(a)-3. For these accounts, if they are located on a U.S. military installation that is physically located in a foreign country, then these accounts are located in a State. Where a transfer is requested electronically or by telephone and the transfer is not from an account, the provider may make the determination of whether a consumer is located in a State based on information that is provided by the consumer and on any records associated with the consumer that the provider may have, such as an address provided by the consumer.<STARS/>
                  </P>
                  <P>3. <E T="03">Non-consumer accounts.</E> A transfer that is requested to be sent from an account that was not established primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, such as an account that was established as a business or commercial account or an account held by a business entity such as a corporation, not-for-profit corporation, professional corporation, limited liability company, partnership, or sole proprietorship, is not requested primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. A consumer requesting a transfer from such an account therefore is not a sender under § 1005.30(g). Additionally, a transfer that is requested to be sent from an account held by a financial institution under a <E T="03">bona fide</E> trust agreement pursuant to § 1005.2(b)(2) is not requested primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, and a consumer requesting a transfer from such an account is therefore not a sender under § 1005.30(g).<STARS/>

                  <STARS/>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Use of forms.</E> The appendix contains model disclosure clauses for optional use by financial institutions and remittance transfer providers to facilitate compliance with the disclosure requirements of §§ 1005.5(b)(2) and (3), 1005.6(a), 1005.7, 1005.8(b), 1005.14(b)(1)(ii), 1005.15(c), 1005.15(e)(1) and (2), 1005.18(b)(2), (3), (6) and (7), 1005.18(d)(1) and (2), 1005.31, 1005.32 and 1005.36. The use of appropriate clauses in making disclosures will protect a financial institution and a remittance transfer provider from liability under sections 916 and 917 of the act provided the clauses accurately reflect the institution's EFT services and the provider's remittance transfer services, respectively.</P>
                  <P>3. <E T="03">Altering the clauses.</E> Unless otherwise expressly addressed in the rule, the following applies. Financial institutions may use clauses of their own design in conjunction with the Bureau's model clauses. The inapplicable words or portions of phrases in parentheses should be deleted. The catchlines are not part of the clauses and need not be used. Financial institutions may make alterations, substitutions, or additions in the clauses to reflect the services offered, such as technical changes (including the substitution of a trade name for the word “card,” deletion of inapplicable services, or substitution of lesser liability limits). Several of the model clauses include references to a telephone number and address. Where two or more of these clauses are used in a disclosure, the telephone number and address may be referenced and need not be repeated.<STARS/>

That is, the financial institution would first display the monthly fee total beginning on May 1, 2018 for the month of April, and the year-to-date fee total beginning on April 1, 2018, provided the financial institution discloses that it is displaying the year-to-date total beginning on April 1, 2018 rather than for the entire calendar year 2018.

                  <P>1. <E T="03">Debit card includes prepaid card.</E> For purposes of subpart A of Regulation E, unless otherwise specified, the term debit card also includes a prepaid card.</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Certain employment-related cards not covered as payroll card accounts.</E> The term “payroll card account” does not include an account used solely to disburse incentive-based payments (other than commissions which can represent the primary means through which a consumer is paid), such as bonuses, which are unlikely to be a consumer's primary source of salary or other compensation. The term also does not include an account used solely to make disbursements unrelated to compensation, such as petty cash reimbursements or travel per diem payments. Similarly, a payroll card account does not include an account that is used in isolated instances to which an employer typically does not make recurring payments, such as when providing final payments or in emergency situations when other payment methods are unavailable. While such accounts would not be payroll card accounts, such accounts could constitute prepaid accounts generally, provided the other conditions of the definition of that term in § 1005.2(b)(3) are satisfied. In addition, all transactions involving the transfer of funds to or from a payroll card account or prepaid account are covered by the regulation, even if a particular transaction involves payment of a bonus, other incentive-based payment, or reimbursement, or the transaction does not represent a transfer of wages, salary, or other employee compensation.</P>
                  <P>3. <E T="03">Marketed or labeled as</E> “<E T="03">prepaid.”</E> The term “marketed or labeled as `prepaid' ” means promoting or advertising an account using the term “prepaid.” For example, an account is marketed or labeled as prepaid if the term “prepaid” appears on the access device associated with the account or the access device's packaging materials, or on a display, advertisement, or other publication to promote purchase or use of the account. An account may be marketed or labeled as prepaid if the financial institution, its service provider, including a program manager, or the payment network on which an access device for the account is used, promotes or advertises, or contracts with another party to promote or advertise, the account using the label “prepaid.” A product or service that is marketed or labeled as prepaid is not a “prepaid account” pursuant to § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(C) if it does not otherwise meet the definition of account under § 1005.2(b)(1).</P>
                  <P>4. <E T="03">Issued on a prepaid basis.</E> To be issued on a prepaid basis, a prepaid account must be loaded with funds when it is first provided to the consumer for use. For example, if a consumer purchases a prepaid account and provides funds that are loaded onto a card at the time of purchase, the prepaid account is issued on a prepaid basis.</P>
                  <P>5. <E T="03">Capable of being loaded with funds.</E> A prepaid account that is not issued on a prepaid basis but is capable of being loaded with funds thereafter includes a prepaid card issued to a consumer with a zero balance to which funds may be loaded by the consumer or a third party subsequent to issuance.</P>
                  <P>6. <E T="03">Product acting as a pass-through vehicle for funds.</E> To satisfy § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D), a prepaid account must be issued on a prepaid basis or be capable of being loaded with funds. This means that the prepaid account must be capable of holding funds, rather than merely acting as a pass-through vehicle. For example, if a product, such as a digital wallet, is only capable of storing a consumer's payment credentials for other accounts but is incapable of having funds stored on it, such a product is not a prepaid account. However, if a product allows a consumer to transfer funds, which can be stored before the consumer designates a destination for the funds, the product satisfies § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D).</P>
                  <P>7. <E T="03">Not required to be reloadable.</E> Prepaid accounts need not be reloadable by the consumer or a third party.</P>
                  <P>8. <E T="03">Primary function.</E> To satisfy § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D), an account's primary function must be to provide consumers with general transaction capability, which includes the general ability to use loaded funds to conduct transactions with multiple, unaffiliated merchants for goods or services, or at automated teller machines, or to conduct person-to-person transfers. This definition excludes accounts that provide such capability only incidentally. For example, the primary function of a brokerage account is to hold funds so that the consumer can conduct transactions through a licensed broker or firm, not to conduct transactions with multiple, unaffiliated merchants for good or services, or at automated teller machines, or to conduct person-to-person transfers. Similarly, the primary function of a savings account is to accrue interest on funds held in <PRTPAGE P="333"/>the account; such accounts restrict the extent to which the consumer can conduct general transactions and withdrawals. Accordingly, brokerage accounts and savings accounts do not satisfy § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D), and thus are not prepaid accounts as defined by § 1005.2(b)(3). The following examples provide additional guidance:</P>

                  <P>i. An account's primary function is to enable a consumer to conduct transactions with multiple, unaffiliated merchants for goods or services, at automated teller machines, or to conduct person-to-person transfers, even if the account also enables a third party to disburse funds to a consumer. For example, a prepaid account that conveys tax refunds or insurance proceeds to a consumer meets the primary function test if the account can be used, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> to purchase goods or services at multiple, unaffiliated merchants.</P>
                  <P>ii. Whether an account satisfies § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D) is determined by reference to the account, not the access device associated with the account. An account satisfies § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D) even if the account's access device can be used for other purposes, for example, as a form of identification. Such accounts may include, for example, a prepaid account used to disburse student loan proceeds via a card device that can be used at unaffiliated merchants or to withdraw cash from an automated teller machine, even if that access device also acts as a student identification card.</P>
                  <P>iii. Where multiple accounts are associated with the same access device, the primary function of each account is determined separately. One or more accounts can satisfy § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D) even if other accounts associated with the same access device do not. For example, a student identification card may act as an access device associated with two separate accounts: An account used to conduct transactions with multiple, unaffiliated merchants for goods or services, and an account used to conduct closed-loop transactions on campus. The account used to conduct transactions with multiple, unaffiliated merchants for goods or services satisfies § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D), even though the account used to conduct closed-loop transactions does not (and as such the latter is not a prepaid account as defined by § 1005.2(b)(3)).</P>
                  <P>iv. An account satisfies § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D) if its primary function is to provide general transaction capability, even if an individual consumer does not in fact use it to conduct multiple transactions. For example, the fact that a consumer may choose to withdraw the entire account balance at an automated teller machine or transfer it to another account held by the consumer does not change the fact that the account's primary function is to provide general transaction capability.</P>
                  <P>v. An account whose primary function is other than to conduct transactions with multiple, unaffiliated merchants for goods or services, or at automated teller machines, or to conduct person-to-person transfers, does not satisfy § 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D). Such accounts may include, for example, a product whose only function is to make a one-time transfer of funds into a separate prepaid account.</P>
                  <P>9. <E T="03">Redeemable upon presentation at multiple, unaffiliated merchants.</E> For guidance, see comments 20(a)(3)-1 and -2.</P>
                  <P>10. <E T="03">Person-to-person transfers.</E> A prepaid account whose primary function is to conduct person-to-person transfers is an account that allows a consumer to send funds by electronic fund transfer to another consumer or business. An account may qualify as a prepaid account if its primary function is person-to-person transfers even if it is neither redeemable upon presentation at multiple, unaffiliated merchants for goods or services, nor usable at automated teller machines. A transaction involving a store gift card would not be a person-to-person transfer if it could only be used to make payments to the merchant or affiliated group of merchants on whose behalf the card was issued.</P>
                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">Paragraph 2(b)(3)(ii)</HD>
                  <P>1. <E T="03">Excluded health care and employee benefit related prepaid products.</E> For purposes of § 1005.2(b)(3)(ii)(A), “health savings account” means a health savings account as defined in 26 U.S.C. 223(d); “flexible spending arrangement” means a health benefits or a health flexible spending arrangement pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 125; “medical savings account” means an Archer MSA as defined in 26 U.S.C. 220(d); “health reimbursement arrangement” means a health reimbursement arrangement which is treated as employer-provided coverage under an accident or health plan for purposes of 26 U.S.C. 106; “dependent care assistance program” means a dependent care assistance program pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 129; and “transit or parking reimbursement arrangement” means a qualified transportation fringe benefit provided by an employer pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 132.</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Excluded disaster relief funds.</E> For purposes of § 1005.2(b)(3)(ii)(B), “qualified disaster relief funds” means funds made available through a qualified disaster relief program as defined in 26 U.S.C. 139(b).</P>
                  <P>3. <E T="03">Marketed and labeled as a gift card or gift certificate.</E> Section 1005.2(b)(3)(ii)(D) excludes, among other things, reloadable general-use prepaid cards that are both marketed and labeled as gift cards or gift certificates, whereas § 1005.20(b)(2) excludes such products that are marketed or labeled as gift cards or gift certificates. Comment 20(b)(2)-2 describes, in part, a network-branded GPR card that is principally advertised as a less-costly alternative to a bank account but is promoted in a television, radio, newspaper, or internet advertisement, or on signage as “the perfect gift” during the holiday season. For purposes <PRTPAGE P="334"/>of § 1005.20, such a product would be considered marketed as a gift card or gift certificate because of this occasional holiday marketing activity. For purposes of § 1005.2(b)(3)(ii)(D), however, such a product would not be considered to be both marketed and labeled as a gift card or gift certificate and thus would be covered by the definition of prepaid account.</P>
                  <P>4. <E T="03">Loyalty, award, or promotional gift cards.</E> Section 1005.2(b)(3)(ii)(D)(<E T="03">3</E>) excludes loyalty, award, or promotional gift cards as defined in § 1005.20(a)(4); those cards are excluded from coverage under § 1005.20 pursuant to § 1005.20(b)(3). Section 1005.2(b)(3)(ii)(D)(<E T="03">3</E>) also excludes cards that satisfy the criteria in § 1005.20(a)(4)(i) and (ii) and are excluded from coverage under § 1005.20 pursuant to § 1005.20(b)(4) because they are not marketed to the general public; such products are not required to set forth the disclosures enumerated in § 1005.20(a)(4)(iii) in order to be excluded pursuant to § 1005.2(b)(3)(ii)(D)(<E T="03">3</E>).<STARS/>

                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">18(a) Coverage</HD>
                  <P>1. <E T="03">Issuance of access device.</E> Consistent with § 1005.5(a) and except as provided, as applicable, in § 1005.5(b), a financial institution may issue an access device only in response to an oral or written request for the device, or as a renewal or substitute for an accepted access device. A consumer is deemed to request an access device for a payroll card account when the consumer chooses to receive salary or other compensation through a payroll card account. A consumer is deemed to request an access device for a prepaid account when, for example, the consumer acquires a prepaid account offered for sale at a retail location or applies for a prepaid account by telephone or online. If an access device for a prepaid account is provided on an unsolicited basis where the prepaid account is used for disbursing funds to a consumer, and the financial institution or third party making the disbursement does not offer any alternative means for the consumer to receive those funds in lieu of accepting the prepaid account, in order to satisfy § 1005.5(b)(2), the financial institution must inform the consumer that the consumer has no other means by which to initially receive the funds in the prepaid account other than by accepting the access device, as well as the consequences of disposing of the access device.</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Application to employers and service providers.</E> Typically, employers and third-party service providers do not meet the definition of a “financial institution” subject to the regulation because they neither hold prepaid accounts (including payroll card accounts) nor issue prepaid cards and agree with consumers to provide EFT services in connection with prepaid accounts. However, to the extent an employer or a service provider undertakes either of these functions, it would be deemed a financial institution under the regulation.</P>

                  <P>1. <E T="03">Disclosing the short form and long form before acquisition.</E> Section 1005.18(b)(1)(i) generally requires delivery of a short form disclosure as described in § 1005.18(b)(2), accompanied by the information required to be disclosed by § 1005.18(b)(5), and a long form disclosure as described in § 1005.18(b)(4) before a consumer acquires a prepaid account.</P>
                  <P>i. For purposes of § 1005.18(b)(1)(i), a consumer acquires a prepaid account by purchasing, opening or choosing to be paid via a prepaid account, as illustrated by the following examples:</P>
                  <P>A. A consumer inquires about obtaining a prepaid account at a branch location of a bank. A consumer then receives the disclosures required by § 1005.18(b). After receiving the disclosures, a consumer then opens a prepaid account with the bank. This consumer received the short form and long form pre-acquisition in accordance with § 1005.18(b)(1)(i).</P>
                  <P>B. A consumer learns that he or she can receive wages via a payroll card account, at which time the consumer is provided with a payroll card and the disclosures required by § 1005.18(b) to review. The consumer then chooses to receive wages via a payroll card account. These disclosures were provided pre-acquisition in compliance with § 1005.18(b)(1)(i). By contrast, if a consumer receives the disclosures required by § 1005.18(b) to review at the end of the first pay period, after the consumer received the first payroll payment on the payroll card, these disclosures were provided to a consumer post-acquisition, and thus not provided in compliance with § 1005.18(b)(1)(i).</P>

                  <P>ii. Section 1005.18(b)(1)(i) permits delivery of the disclosures required by § 1005.18(b) at the time the consumer receives the prepaid account, rather than prior to acquisition, for prepaid accounts that are used for disbursing funds to consumers when the financial institution or third party making the disbursement does not offer any alternative means for the consumer to receive those funds in lieu of accepting the prepaid account. For <PRTPAGE P="335"/>example, a utility company refunds consumers' initial deposits for its utility services via prepaid accounts delivered to consumers by mail. Neither the utility company nor the financial institution that issues the prepaid accounts offer another means for a consumer to receive that refund other than by accepting the prepaid account. In this case, the financial institution may provide the disclosures required by § 1005.18(b) together with the prepaid account (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> in the same envelope as the prepaid account); it is not required to deliver the disclosures separately prior to delivery of the prepaid account.</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Disclosures provided electronically.</E> Disclosures required by § 1005.18(b) may be provided before or after a consumer has initiated the process of acquiring a prepaid account electronically. When the disclosures required by § 1005.18(b) are presented after a consumer has initiated the process for acquiring a prepaid account online or via a mobile device, but before a consumer chooses to accept the prepaid account, such disclosures are also made pre-acquisition in accordance with § 1005.18(b)(1)(i). The disclosures required by § 1005.18(b) that are provided electronically when a consumer acquires a prepaid account electronically are not considered to be given pre-acquisition unless a consumer must view the web page containing the disclosures before choosing to accept the prepaid account. The following examples illustrate several methods by which a financial institution may present § 1005.18(b) disclosures before a consumer acquires a prepaid account electronically in compliance with § 1005.18(b)(1)(i):</P>
                  <P>i. A financial institution presents the short form disclosure required by § 1005.18(b)(2), together with the information required by § 1005.18(b)(5), and the long form disclosure required by § 1005.18(b)(4) on the same web page. A consumer must view the web page before choosing to accept the prepaid account.</P>
                  <P>ii. A financial institution presents the short form disclosure required by § 1005.18(b)(2), together with the information required by § 1005.18(b)(5), on a web page. The financial institution includes, after the short form disclosure or as part of the statement required by § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiii), a link that directs the consumer to a separate web page containing the long form disclosure required by § 1005.18(b)(4). The consumer must view the web page containing the long form disclosure before choosing to accept the prepaid account.</P>
                  <P>iii. A financial institution presents on a web page the short form disclosure required by § 1005.18(b)(2), together with the information required by § 1005.18(b)(5), followed by the initial disclosures required by § 1005.7(b), which contains the long form disclosure required by § 1005.18(b)(4), in accordance with § 1005.18(f)(1). The financial institution includes, after the short form disclosure or as part of the statement required by § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiii), a link that directs the consumer to the section of the initial disclosures containing the long form disclosure pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(4). A consumer must view this web page before choosing to accept the prepaid account.</P>
                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">18(b)(1)(ii) Disclosures for Prepaid Accounts Acquired in Retail Locations</HD>
                  <P>1. <E T="03">Retail locations.</E> Section 1005.18(b)(1)(ii) sets forth an alternative timing regime for pre-acquisition disclosures for prepaid accounts acquired in person at retail locations. For purposes of § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii), a retail location is a store or other physical site where a consumer can purchase a prepaid account in person and that is operated by an entity other than the financial institution that issues the prepaid account. A branch of a financial institution that offers its own prepaid accounts is not a retail location with respect to those accounts and, thus, both the short form and the long form disclosure must be provided pre-acquisition pursuant to the timing requirement set forth in § 1005.18(b)(1)(i).</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Disclosures provided inside prepaid account access device packaging material.</E> Except when providing the long form disclosure post-acquisition in accordance with the retail location exception set forth in § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii), the disclosures required by § 1005.18(b)(2), (4), and (5) must be provided to a consumer pre-acquisition in compliance with § 1005.18(b)(1)(i). A short form disclosure is not considered to have been provided pre-acquisition if, for example, it is inside the packaging material accompanying a prepaid account access device such that the consumer cannot see or access the disclosure before acquiring the prepaid account.</P>
                  <P>3. <E T="03">Consumers working in retail locations.</E> A payroll card account offered to consumers working in retail locations is not eligible for the retail location exception in § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii); thus, a consumer employee must receive both the short form and long form disclosures for the payroll card account pre-acquisition pursuant to the timing requirement set forth in § 1005.18(b)(1)(i).</P>
                  <P>4. <E T="03">Providing the long form disclosure by telephone and website pursuant to the retail location exception.</E> Pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii), a financial institution may provide the long form disclosure described in § 1005.18(b)(4) after a consumer acquires a prepaid account in a retail location, if the conditions set forth in § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii)(A) through (D) are met. Pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii)(C), a financial institution must make the long form disclosure accessible to consumers by telephone and via a website when not providing a written version of the long form disclosure pre-acquisition. A financial institution may, <PRTPAGE P="336"/>for example, provide the long form disclosure by telephone using an interactive voice response or similar system or by using a customer service agent. A financial institution that has not obtained the consumer's contact information is not required to comply with the requirements set forth in § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii)(D). A financial institution is able to contact the consumer when, for example, it has the consumer's mailing address or email address.</P>
                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">18(b)(1)(iii) Disclosures for Prepaid Accounts Acquired Orally by Telephone</HD>
                  <P>1. <E T="03">Prepaid accounts acquired by telephone.</E> Section 1005.18(b)(1)(iii) sets forth requirements for prepaid accounts acquired orally by telephone. For purposes of § 1005.18(b)(1)(iii), a prepaid account is considered to have been acquired orally by telephone when a consumer speaks to a customer service agent or communicates with an automated system, such as an interactive voice response system, to provide personally identifiable information to acquire a prepaid account. Prepaid accounts acquired using a mobile device without speaking to a customer service agent or communicating with an automated system are not considered to have been acquired orally by telephone.</P>
                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">18(b)(2) Short Form Disclosure Content</HD>
                  <P>1. <E T="03">Disclosures that are not applicable or are free.</E> The short form disclosures required by § 1005.18(b)(2) must always be provided prior to prepaid account acquisition, even when a particular feature is free or is not applicable to a specific prepaid account product. For example, if a financial institution does not charge a fee to a consumer for withdrawing money at an automated teller machine in the financial institution's network or an affiliated network, which is required to be disclosed pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(iii), the financial institution would list “ATM withdrawal in-network” on the short form disclosure and list “$0” as the fee. If, however, the financial institution does not have its own network or an affiliated network from which a consumer can withdraw money via automated teller machine, the financial institution would list “ATM withdrawal in-network” on the short form disclosure but instead of disclosing a fee amount, state “N/A.” (The financial institution must still disclose any fee it charges for out-of-network ATM withdrawals.)</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Prohibition on disclosure of finance charges.</E> Pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(3)(vi), a financial institution may not include in the short form disclosure finance charges as described in Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.4(b)(11), imposed in connection with a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in § 1026.61. <E T="03">See also</E> comment 18(b)(3)(vi)-1.</P>
                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">18(b)(2)(i) Periodic Fee</HD>
                  <P>1. <E T="03">Periodic fee variation.</E> If the amount of a fee disclosed on the short form could vary, the financial institution must disclose in the short form the information required by § 1005.18(b)(3)(i). If the amount of the periodic fee could vary, the financial institution may opt instead to use an alternative disclosure pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(3)(ii). <E T="03">See</E> comments 18(b)(3)(i)-1 and 18(b)(3)(ii)-1.</P>
                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">18(b)(2)(iii) ATM Withdrawal Fees</HD>
                  <P>1. <E T="03">International ATM withdrawal fees.</E> Pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(iii), a financial institution must disclose the fees imposed when a consumer uses an automated teller machine to initiate a withdrawal of cash in the United States from the prepaid account, both within and outside of the financial institution's network or a network affiliated with the financial institution. A financial institution may not disclose its fee (if any) for using an automated teller machine to initiate a withdrawal of cash in a foreign country in the disclosure required by § 1005.18(b)(2)(iii), although it may be required to disclose that fee as an additional fee type pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix).</P>
                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">18(b)(2)(iv) Cash Reload Fee</HD>
                  <P>1. <E T="03">Total of all charges.</E> Pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(iv), a financial institution must disclose the total of all charges imposed when a consumer reloads cash into a prepaid account, including charges imposed by the financial institution as well as any charges that may be imposed by third parties for the cash reload. The cash reload fee includes the cost of adding cash to the prepaid account at a point-of-sale terminal, the cost of purchasing an additional card or other device on which cash is loaded and then transferred into the prepaid account, or any other method a consumer may use to reload cash into the prepaid account. For example, a financial institution does not have its own proprietary cash reload network and instead contracts with a third-party reload network for this service. The financial institution itself does not charge any fee related to cash reloads but the third-party reload network charges a fee of $3.95 per cash reload. The financial institution must disclose the cash reload fee as $3.95. If the financial institution offers more than one method to reload cash into the prepaid account, § 1005.18(b)(3)(i) requires disclosure of the highest cash reload fee. For example, a financial institution contracts with two third-party cash reload networks; one third party charges $3.95 for a point-of-sale reload and the other third party charges $2.95 for purchase of a reload pack. In addition to the third-party cash reload charge, the financial institution charges a $1 fee for every cash reload. The financial institution must disclose the cash reload fee on <PRTPAGE P="337"/>the short form as $4.95, that is, the highest third-party fee plus the financial institution's $1 fee. See comment 18(b)(3)(v)-1 for additional guidance regarding third-party fees for cash reloads.</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Cash deposit fee.</E> If a financial institution does not permit cash reloads via a third-party reload network but instead permits cash deposits, for example, in a bank branch, the term “cash deposit” may be substituted for “cash reload.”</P>
                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">18(b)(2)(v) ATM Balance Inquiry Fees</HD>
                  <P>1. <E T="03">International ATM balance inquiry fees.</E> Pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(v), a financial institution must disclose the fees imposed when a consumer uses an automated teller machine to check the balance of the prepaid account in the United States, both within and outside of the financial institution's network or a network affiliated with the financial institution. A financial institution may not disclose its fee (if any) for using an automated teller machine to check the balance of the prepaid account in a foreign country in the disclosure required by § 1005.18(b)(2)(v), although it may be required to disclose that fee as an additional fee type pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix).</P>
                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">18(b)(2)(vii) Inactivity Fee</HD>
                  <P>1. <E T="03">Inactivity fee conditions.</E> Section 1005.18(b)(2)(vii) requires disclosure of any fee for non-use, dormancy, or inactivity of the prepaid account as well as the conditions that trigger the financial institution to impose that fee. For example, a financial institution that imposes an inactivity fee of $1 per month after 12 months without any transactions on the prepaid account would disclose on the short form “Inactivity (after 12 months with no transactions)” and “$1.00 per month.”</P>

                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">18(b)(2)(viii)(A) Statement Regarding Number of Additional Fee Types Charged</HD>
                  <P>1. <E T="03">Fee types counted in total number of additional fee types.</E> Section 1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A) requires a statement disclosing the number of additional fee types the financial institution may charge consumers with respect to the prepaid account, using the following clause or a substantially similar clause: “We charge [x] other types of fees.” The number of additional fee types disclosed must reflect the total number of fee types under which the financial institution may charge fees, excluding fees required to be disclosed pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) through (vii) and (b)(5) and any finance charges as described in Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.4(b)(11), imposed in connection with a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in 12 CFR 1026.61. The following clarify which fee types to include in the total number of additional fee types:</P>
                  <P>i. <E T="03">Fee types excluded from the number of additional fee types.</E> The number of additional fee types required to be disclosed pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A) does not include the fees otherwise required to be disclosed in the short form pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) through (vii), nor any purchase fee or activation fee required to be disclosed outside the short form pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(5). It also does not include any finance charges as described in Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.4(b)(11), imposed in connection with a credit feature defined in 12 CFR 1026.61. The number of additional fee types includes only fee types under which the financial institution may charge fees; accordingly, third-party fees are not included unless they are imposed for services performed on behalf of the financial institution. In addition, the number of additional fee types includes only fee types the financial institution may charge consumers with respect to the prepaid account; accordingly, additional fee types does not include other revenue sources such as interchange fees or fees paid by employers for payroll card programs, government agencies for government benefit programs, or other entities sponsoring prepaid account programs for financial disbursements.</P>
                  <P>ii. <E T="03">Fee types counted in the number of additional fee types.</E> Fee types that bear a relationship to, but are separate from, the static fee types disclosed in the short form must be counted as additional fees for purposes of § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii). For example, the ATM withdrawal and ATM balance inquiry fee types required to be disclosed respectively by § 1005.18(b)(2)(iii) and (v) that are excluded from the number of additional fee types pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii) do not include such services outside of the United States. Thus, any international ATM fees charged by the financial institution for ATM withdrawal or balance inquiries must each be counted in the total number of additional fee types. Similarly, any fees for reloading funds into a prepaid account in a form other than cash (such as electronic reload and check reload, as described in comment 18(b)(2)(viii)(A)-2) must be counted in the total number of additional fee types because § 1005.18(b)(2)(iv) is limited to cash reloads. Also, additional fee types disclosed in the short form pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) must be counted in the total number of additional fee types.</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Examples of fee types and fee variations.</E> The term fee type, as used in § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii) and (ix), is a general category under which a financial institution charges fees to consumers. A financial institution may charge only one fee within a particular fee type, or may charge two or more variations of fees within the same fee type. <PRTPAGE P="338"/>The following is a list of examples of fee types a financial institution may use when determining both the number of additional fee types charged pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A) and any additional fee types to disclose pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix). A financial institution may create an appropriate name for other additional fee types.</P>
                  <P>i. <E T="03">Fee types related to reloads of funds.</E> Fee types for reloading funds into a prepaid account. Fees for cash reloads are required to be disclosed in the short form pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(iv) and that such fees are not counted in the total number of additional fee types or disclosed as an additional fee type pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix). Fee types for other methods to reload funds, such as Electronic reload or Check reload, would be counted in the total number of additional fee types and may be required to be disclosed as additional fee types pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix).</P>
                  <P>A. <E T="03">Electronic reload.</E> Fees for reloading a prepaid account through electronic methods.

                  <P>ii. <E T="03">Fee types related to withdrawals of funds.</E> Fee types for withdrawing funds from a prepaid account. Per purchase fees and ATM withdrawal fees within the United States are fee types required to be disclosed in the short form respectively pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ii) and (iii) and thus such fees are not counted in the total number of additional fee types or disclosed as an additional fee type pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix). Fee types for other methods to withdraw funds, such as Electronic withdrawal, Teller withdrawal, Cash back at point of sale (POS), and Account closure would be counted in the total of additional fee types and may be required to be disclosed as additional fee types pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix).</P>
                  <P>A. <E T="03">Electronic withdrawal.</E> Fees for withdrawing funds from a prepaid account through electronic methods other than an ATM. Fee variations within this fee type may include fees for transferring funds from the prepaid account to a consumer's bank account or other destination.</P>

                  <P>A. <E T="03">International ATM withdrawal.</E> Fees for withdrawing funds at an ATM outside the United States. This fee type does not include fees for ATM withdrawals in the United States, as such fees are required to be disclosed in the short form pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(iii).</P>
                  <P>B. <E T="03">International ATM balance inquiry.</E> Fees for balance inquiries at an ATM outside the United States.

                  <P>vi. <E T="03">Paper checks.</E> Fees for providing paper checks that draw on the prepaid account. Fee variations within this fee type may include fees for providing checks and associated shipping costs.

                  <P>vii. <E T="03">Stop payment.</E> Fees for stopping payment of a preauthorized transfer of funds.</P>

Thus, pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii), any charge for calling customer service via an interactive voice response system must be counted in the total number of additional fee types.</P>
                  <P>4. <E T="03">Consistency in additional fee type categorization.</E> A financial institution must use the same categorization of fee types in the number of additional fee types disclosed pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii) and in its determination of which additional fee types to disclose pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix).</P>

                  <P>1. <E T="03">Statement clauses.</E> Section 1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(B) requires, if a financial institution makes a disclosure of additional fee types pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix), it must include in the short form a statement directing consumers to that disclosure, located after but on the same line of text as the statement regarding the number of additional fee types required by § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A), using the following clause or a substantially similar clause: “Here are some of them:”. A financial institution that makes no disclosure pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) may not include a disclosure pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(B). The following examples provide guidance regarding substantially similar clauses a financial institution may use in certain circumstances to make its disclosures under § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A) and (B):</P>
                  <P>i. A financial institution that has one additional fee type and discloses that additional fee type pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) might provide the statements required by § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A) and (B) together as: “We charge 1 other type of fee. It is:”.</P>
                  <P>ii. A financial institution that has five additional fee types and discloses one of those additional fee types pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) might provide the statements required by § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A) and (B) together as: “We charge 5 other types of fees. Here is 1 of them:”.</P>
                  <P>iii. A financial institution that has two additional fee types and discloses both of those fee types pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) might provide the statement required by § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A) and (B) together as: “We charge 2 other types of fees. They are:”.</P>

                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">18(b)(2)(ix)(A) Determination of Which Additional Fee Types To Disclose</HD>
                  <P>1. <E T="03">Number of fee types to disclose.</E> Section 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A) requires disclosure of the two fee types that generate the highest revenue from consumers for the prepaid account program or across prepaid account programs that share the same fee schedule during the time period provided in § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(D) and (E), excluding the categories set forth in § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)(<E T="03">1</E>) through (<E T="03">3</E>). See comment 18(b)(2)(viii)(A)-2 for guidance on and examples of fee types. If a prepaid account program has two fee types that satisfy the criteria in § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A), it must disclose both fees. If a prepaid account program has three or more fee types that potentially satisfy the criteria in § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A), the financial institution must disclose only the two fee types that generate the highest revenue from consumers. See comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(B)-1 for guidance regarding the disclosure of additional fee types for a prepaid account with fewer than two fee types that satisfy the criteria in § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A).</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Abbreviations.</E> Commonly accepted or readily understandable abbreviations may be used as needed for additional fee types and fee variations disclosed pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix). For example, to accommodate on one line in the short form disclosure the additional fee types “international ATM balance inquiry” or “person-to-person transfer of funds,” with or without fee variations, a financial institution may choose to abbreviate the fee type name as “Int'l ATM inquiry” or “P2P transfer.”</P>
                  <P>3. <E T="03">Revenue from consumers.</E> The revenue calculation for the disclosure of additional fee types pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A) is based on fee types that the financial institution may charge consumers with respect to the prepaid account. The calculation excludes other revenue sources such as revenue generated from interchange fees and fees paid by employers for payroll card programs, government agencies for government benefit programs, and other entities sponsoring prepaid account programs for financial disbursements. It also excludes third-party fees, unless they are imposed for services performed on behalf of the financial institution.</P>
                  <P>4. <E T="03">Assessing revenue within and across prepaid account programs to determine disclosure of additional fee types.</E> Pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A), the disclosure of the two <PRTPAGE P="340"/>fee types that generate the highest revenue from consumers must be determined for each prepaid account program or across prepaid account programs that share the same fee schedule. Thus, if a financial institution offers more than one prepaid account program, unless the programs share the same fee schedule, the financial institution must consider the fee revenue data separately for each prepaid account program and not consolidate the fee revenue data across prepaid account programs. Prepaid account programs are deemed to have the same fee schedules if they charge the same fee amounts, including offering the same fee waivers and fee reductions for the same features. The following examples illustrate how to assess revenue within and across prepaid account programs to determine the disclosure of additional fee types:</P>
                  <P>i. <E T="03">Prepaid account programs with different fee schedules.</E> A financial institution offers multiple prepaid account programs and each program has a different fee schedule. The financial institution must consider the revenue from consumers for each program separately; it may not consider the revenue from all of its prepaid account programs together in determining the disclosure of additional fee types for its programs.</P>
                  <P>ii. <E T="03">Prepaid account programs with identical fee schedules.</E> A financial institution offers multiple prepaid account programs and they all share the same fee schedule. The financial institution may consider the revenue across all of its prepaid account programs together in determining the disclosure of additional fee types for its programs.</P>
                  <P>iii. <E T="03">Prepaid account programs with both different fee schedules and identical fee schedules.</E> A financial institution offers multiple prepaid account programs, some of which share the same fee schedule. The financial institution may consider the revenue across all prepaid account programs with identical fee schedules in determining the disclosure of additional fee types for those programs. The financial institution must separately consider the revenue from each of the prepaid account programs with unique fee schedules.</P>
                  <P>iv. <E T="03">Multiple service plan prepaid account programs.</E> A financial institution that discloses multiple service plans on a short form disclosure as permitted by § 1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(<E T="03">2</E>) must consider revenue across all of those plans in determining the disclosure of additional fee types for that program. If, however, the financial institution instead is disclosing the default service plan pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(<E T="03">1</E>), the financial institution must consider the revenue generated from consumers for the default service plan only. See § 1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(<E T="03">2</E>) and comment 18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(<E T="03">2</E>)-1 for guidance on what constitutes multiple service plans.</P>
                  <P>5. <E T="03">Exclusions.</E> Once the financial institution has calculated the fee revenue data for the prepaid account program or across prepaid account programs that share the same fee schedule during the appropriate time period, it must remove from consideration the categories excluded pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)(<E T="03">1</E>) through (<E T="03">3</E>) before determining the fee types, if any, that generated the highest revenue.</P>
                  <P>i. <E T="03">Exclusion for fee types required to be disclosed elsewhere.</E> Fee types otherwise required to be disclosed in or outside the short form are excluded from the additional fee types required to be disclosed pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)(<E T="03">1</E>). Thus, the following fee types are excluded: Periodic fee, per purchase fee, ATM withdrawal fees (for ATM withdrawals in the United States), cash reload fee, ATM balance inquiry fees (for ATM balance inquiries in the United States), customer service fees, and inactivity fee. However, while the cash reload fee type is excluded, other reload fee types, such as electronic reload and check reload, are not excluded under § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)(<E T="03">1</E>) and thus may be disclosed as additional fee types pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix). Similarly, while the fee types ATM withdrawal and ATM balance inquiry in the United States are excluded, international ATM withdrawal and international ATM balance inquiry fees are not excluded under § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)(<E T="03">1</E>) and thus may be disclosed as additional fee types pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix). Also pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)(<E T="03">1</E>), the purchase price and activation fee, if any, required to be disclosed outside the short form disclosure pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(5), are excluded from the additional fee types required to be disclosed pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix).</P>
                  <P>ii. <E T="03">De minimis exclusion.</E> Any fee types that generated less than 5 percent of the total revenue from consumers for the prepaid account program or across prepaid account programs that share the same fee schedule during the time period provided in § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(D) and (E) are excluded from the additional fee types required to be disclosed pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)(<E T="03">2</E>). For example, for a particular prepaid account program over the appropriate time period, bill payment, check reload, and card replacement are the only fee types that generated 5 percent or more of the total revenue from consumers at, respectively, 15 percent, 10 percent, and 7 percent. Two other fee types, legal fee and personalized card, generated revenue below 1 percent of the total revenue from consumers. The financial institution must disclose bill payment and check reload as the additional fee types for that particular prepaid account program because those two fee types generated the highest revenue from consumers from among the categories not excluded from disclosure as additional fee types. For a different prepaid <PRTPAGE P="341"/>account program over the appropriate time period, bill payment is the only fee type that generated 5 percent or more of the total revenue from consumers. Two other fee types, check reload and card replacement, each generated revenue below 5 percent of the total revenue from consumers. The financial institution must disclose bill payment as an additional fee type for that particular prepaid account program because it is the only fee type that satisfies the criteria of § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A). The financial institution may, but is not required to, disclose either check reload or card replacement on the short form as well, pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(B). <E T="03">See</E> comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(B)-1.</P>
                  <P>iii. <E T="03">Exclusion for credit-related fees.</E> Any finance charges as described in Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.4(b)(11), imposed in connection with a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in 12 CFR 1026.61, are excluded from the additional fee types required to be disclosed pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)(<E T="03">3</E>). Pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A)(<E T="03">2</E>), such finance charges are also excluded from the number of additional fee types disclosed.</P>
                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">18(b)(2)(ix)(B) Disclosure of Fewer Than Two Additional Fee Types</HD>
                  <P>1. <E T="03">Disclosure of one or no additional fee types.</E> The following examples provide guidance on the additional fee types disclosure pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(B) for a prepaid account with fewer than two fee types that satisfy the criteria in § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A):</P>
                  <P>i. A financial institution has a prepaid account program with only one fee type that satisfies the criteria in § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A) and thus, pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A), the financial institution must disclose that one fee type. The prepaid account program has three other fee types that generate revenue from consumers, but they do not exceed the de minimis threshold or otherwise satisfy the criteria in § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(B). Pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(B), the financial institution is not required to make any additional disclosure, but it may choose to disclose one of the three fee types that do not meet the criteria in § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A).</P>
                  <P>ii. A financial institution has a prepaid account program with four fee types that generate revenue from consumers, but none exceeds the de minimis threshold or otherwise satisfy the criteria in § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A). Pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(B), the financial institution is not required to make any disclosure, but it may choose to disclose one or two of the fee types that do not meet the criteria in § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A).</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">No disclosure of finance charges as an additional fee type.</E> Pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(3)(vi), a financial institution may not disclose any finance charges as a voluntary additional fee disclosure under § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(B).</P>
                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">18(b)(2)(ix)(C) Fee Variations in Additional Fee Types</HD>
                  <P>1. <E T="03">Two or more fee variations.</E> Section 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(C) specifies how to disclose additional fee types with two fee variations, more than two fee variations, and for multiple service plans pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(<E T="03">2</E>). See comment 18(b)(2)(viii)(A)-2 for guidance on and examples of fee types and fee variations within those fee types. The following examples illustrate how to disclose two-tier fees and other fee variations in additional fee types:</P>
                  <P>i. <E T="03">Two fee variations with different fee amounts.</E> A financial institution charges a fee of $1 for providing a card replacement using standard mail service and charges a fee of $5 for providing a card replacement using expedited delivery. The financial institution must calculate the total revenue generated from consumers for all card replacements, both via standard mail service and expedited delivery, during the required time period to determine whether it is required to disclose card replacement as an additional fee type pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix). Because there are only two fee variations for the fee type “card replacement,” if card replacement is required to be disclosed as an additional fee type pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A), the financial institution must disclose both fee variations pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(C). Thus, the financial institution would disclose on the short form the fee type and two variations as “Card replacement (regular or expedited delivery)” and the fee amount as “$1.00 or $5.00”.</P>
                  <P>ii. <E T="03">More than two fee variations.</E> A financial institution offers two methods of bill payment—via ACH and paper check—and offers two modes of delivery for bill payments made by paper check—regular standard mail service and expedited delivery. The financial institution charges $0.25 for bill pay via ACH, $0.50 for bill pay via paper check sent by regular standard mail service, and $3 for bill pay via paper check sent via expedited delivery. The financial institution must calculate the total revenue generated from consumers for all methods of bill pay and all modes of delivery during the required time period to determine whether it must disclose bill payment as an additional fee type pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix). Because there are more than two fee variations for the fee type “bill payment,” if bill payment is required to be disclosed as an additional fee type pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A), the financial institution has two options for the disclosure. The financial institution may disclose the highest fee, $3, followed by a symbol, such as an asterisk, linked to a statement explaining that the fee could be lower depending on how and where the prepaid account is used, pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(3)(i). <PRTPAGE P="342"/>Thus, the financial institution would disclose on the short form the fee type as “Bill payment” and the fee amount as “$3.00*”. Alternatively, the financial institution may consolidate the fee variations into two categories, such as regular delivery and expedited delivery. In this case, the financial institution would make this disclosure on the short form as: “Bill payment (regular or expedited delivery)” and the fee amount as “$0.50* or $3.00”.</P>
                  <P>iii. <E T="03">Two fee variations with like fee amounts.</E> A financial institution offers two methods of check reload for which it charges a fee—depositing checks at an ATM and depositing checks with a teller at the financial institution's branch locations. There is a fee of $0.50 for both methods of check deposit. The financial institution must calculate the total revenue generated from both of these check reload methods during the required time period to determine whether it must disclose this fee type as an additional fee type pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix). Because the fee amounts are the same for the two methods of check deposit, if the fee type is required to be disclosed as an additional fee type, the financial institution's options for disclosing this fee type in accordance with § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(C) and (b)(3)(iii) include: “Check reload (ATM or teller check dep)” and the fee amount as “$0.50” or “Check reload” and the fee amount as “$0.50”.</P>
                  <P>iv. <E T="03">Multiple service plans.</E> A financial institution provides a short form disclosure for multiple service plans pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(<E T="03">2</E>). Notwithstanding that an additional fee type has only two fee variations, a financial institution must disclose the highest fee in accordance with § 1005.18(b)(3)(i).</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">One fee variation under a particular fee type.</E> Section 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(C) provides in part that, if a financial institution only charges one fee under a particular fee type, the financial institution must disclose the name of the additional fee type and the fee amount; it may, but is not required to, disclose also the name of the one fee variation, if any, for which the fee amount is charged, in a format substantially similar to that used to disclose the two-tier fees required by § 1005.18(b)(2)(v) and (vi), except that the financial institution must disclose only the one fee variation name and fee amount instead of two. For example, a financial institution offers one method of electronic reload for which it charges a fee—electronic reload conducted using a debit card. The financial institution must calculate the total revenue generated from consumers for the fee type electronic reload (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> in this case, electronic reloads conducted using a debit card) during the required time period to determine whether it must disclose electronic reload as an additional fee type pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix). Because the financial institution only charges one fee variation under the fee type electronic reload, if this fee type is required to be disclosed as an additional fee type, the financial institution has two options for disclosing this fee type in accordance with § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(C): “Electronic reload (debit card)” and the fee amount as “$1.00” or “Electronic reload” and the fee amount as “$1.00”.</P>

Thus, a prepaid account program that was in existence as of April 1, 2019 must assess its additional fee types disclosure from data collected during a consecutive 24-month period that took place between October 1, 2014 and April 1, 2019. For example, an existing prepaid account program was first offered to consumers on January 1, 2012 and provides its first short form disclosure on April 1, 2019. The earliest 24-month period from which that financial institution could calculate its first additional fee types disclosure would be from October 1, 2014 to September 30, 2016.</P>

For example, a financial institution begins offering to consumers a prepaid account program six months before April 1, 2019. Because the prepaid account program will not have 24 months of fee revenue data prior to April 1, 2019, pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(D)(<E T="03">2</E>) the financial institution must disclose the additional fee types it reasonably anticipates the prepaid account program will generate over the 24-month period that begins on April 1, 2019. The financial institution would take into account the data it had accumulated at the time of its calculation to arrive at the reasonably anticipated additional fee types for the prepaid account program.<PRTPAGE P="343"/>

                  <P>1. <E T="03">Periodic reassessment and, if applicable, update of additional fee types disclosure.</E> Pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<E T="03">2</E>), a financial institution must reassess whether its previously disclosed additional fee types continue to comply with the requirements of § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) every 24 months based on revenue for the previous 24-month period. The financial institution must complete this reassessment and update its disclosure, if applicable, within three months of the end of the 24-month period, except as provided in the update printing exception in § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<E T="03">4</E>). The following examples provide guidance on the periodic assessment and, if applicable, update of the disclosure of additional fee types pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<E T="03">2</E>):</P>
                  <P>i. <E T="03">Reassessment with no change in the additional fee types disclosed.</E> A financial institution disclosed two additional fee types (bill payment and card replacement) for a particular prepaid account program on April 1, 2019. Starting on April 1, 2021, the financial institution assessed the fee revenue data it collected over the previous 24 months, and the two additional fee types previously disclosed continue to qualify as additional fee types pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix). The financial institution is not required to take any action with regard to the disclosure of additional fee types for that prepaid account program.</P>
                  <P>ii. <E T="03">Reassessment with a change in the additional fee types disclosed.</E> A financial institution disclosed two additional fee types (bill payment and card replacement) for a particular prepaid account program on April 1, 2019. Starting on April 1, 2021, the financial institution assessed the fee revenue data it collected over the previous 24 months, and bill payment continued to qualify as an additional fee type pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) but check reload qualified as the second additional fee type instead of card replacement. The financial institution must update the additional fee types disclosure in its short form disclosures provided electronically, orally, and in writing (other than for printed materials that qualify for the update printing exception in § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<E T="03">4</E>)) no later than July 1, 2021, which is three months after the end of the 24-month period.</P>
                  <P>iii. <E T="03">Reassessment with the addition of an additional fee type already voluntarily disclosed.</E> A financial institution disclosed one additional fee type (bill payment) and voluntarily disclosed one other additional fee type (card replacement, both for regular and expedited delivery) for a particular prepaid account program on April 1, 2019. Starting on April 1, 2021, the financial institution assessed the fee revenue data it collected over the previous 24 months, and bill payment continued to qualify as an additional fee type pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) and card replacement now qualified as the second additional fee type. Because the financial institution already had disclosed its card replacement fees in the format required for an additional fee type disclosure, the financial institution is not required to take any action with regard to the additional fee types disclosure in the short form for that prepaid account program.</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Reassessment more frequently than every 24 months.</E> Pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<E T="03">2</E>), a financial institution may, but is not required to, carry out the reassessment and update, if applicable, more frequently than every 24 months, at which time a new 24-month period commences. A financial institution may choose to do this, for example, to sync its reassessment process for additional fee types with its financial reporting schedule or other financial analysis it performs regarding the particular prepaid account program. If a financial institution chooses to reassess its additional fee types disclosure more frequently than every 24 months, it is still required to use 24 months of fee revenue data to conduct the reassessment. For example, a financial institution first offered a particular prepaid account program on April 1, 2018 and thus was required to estimate its initial additional fee types disclosure pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(D)(<E T="03">2</E>). If the financial institution chooses to begin its reassessment of its fee revenue data on April 1, 2020, it would use the data it collected over the previous 24 months (April 1, 2018 to March 31, 2020) and complete its reassessment and its update, if applicable, by July 1, 2020.</P>

                  <P>1. <E T="03">Revised prepaid account programs.</E> Section 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<E T="03">3</E>) requires that if a financial institution revises the fee schedule for a prepaid account program, it must determine whether it reasonably anticipates that the previously disclosed additional fee types will continue to comply with the requirements of § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) for the 24 months following implementation of the fee schedule change. A fee schedule change resets the 24-month period for assessment; a financial institution must comply with the requirements of § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<E T="03">2</E>) at the end of the 24-month period following implementation of the fee schedule change. If the financial institution reasonably anticipates that the previously disclosed additional fee types will not comply with the requirements of § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix), it must update the disclosure based on its reasonable anticipation of what those additional fee types will be at the <PRTPAGE P="344"/>time the fee schedule change goes into effect, except as provided in the update printing exception in § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<E T="03">4</E>). For example, if a financial institution lowers its card replacement fee from $4 to $3 on June 1, 2019 after having first assessed its additional fee types disclosure as of April 1, 2019, the financial institution would assess whether it reasonably anticipates that the existing additional fee types disclosure will continue to reflect the additional fee types that generate the highest revenue from consumers for that prepaid account program for the next 24 months (until June 1, 2021). If the financial institution reasonably anticipates that its additional fee types will remain unchanged over the next 24 months, the financial institution is not required to take any action with regard to the additional fee types disclosure for that prepaid account program. In the same example, if the financial institution reasonably anticipates that the previously disclosed additional fee types will not comply with the requirements of § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix) for the 24 months following implementation of the fee schedule change, the financial institution must update the listing of additional fee types at the time the fee schedule change goes into effect, except as provided in the update printing exception pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<E T="03">4</E>).</P>
                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(4) Update Printing Exception</HD>
                  <P>1. <E T="03">Application of the update printing exception to prepaid accounts sold in retail locations.</E> Pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<E T="03">4</E>), notwithstanding the requirements to update the additional fee types disclosure in § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E), a financial institution is not required to update the listing of additional fee types that are provided on, in, or with prepaid account packaging materials that were manufactured, printed, or otherwise produced prior to a periodic reassessment and update pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<E T="03">2</E>) or prior to a fee schedule change pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<E T="03">3</E>). For prepaid accounts sold in retail locations, for example, § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<E T="03">4</E>) permits a financial institution to implement any necessary updates to the listing of the additional fee types on the short form disclosure that appear on its physical prepaid account packaging materials at the time the financial institution prints new materials. Section 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<E T="03">4</E>) does not require financial institutions to destroy existing inventory in retail locations or elsewhere in the distribution channel, to the extent the disclosures on such packaging materials are otherwise accurate, to comply with this requirement. For example, a financial institution determines that an additional fee type listed on a short form disclosure in a retail location no longer qualifies as an additional fee type pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix). The financial institution must update any electronic and oral short form disclosures pursuant to the timing requirements set forth in § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E). Pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(<E T="03">4</E>), the financial institution may continue selling any previously printed prepaid account packages that contain the prior listing of additional fee types; prepaid account packages printed after that time must contain the updated listing of additional fee types.</P>

If the consumer's prepaid account funds are held at a credit union, the disclosure must indicate NCUA insurance eligibility. If the consumer's prepaid account funds are held at a financial institution other than a credit union, the disclosure must indicate FDIC insurance eligibility.</P>

                  <P>1. <E T="03">Financial institution's telephone number.</E> For a financial institution offering prepaid accounts at a retail location pursuant to the retail location exception in § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii), the statement required by § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiii) must also include a telephone number (and the website URL) that a consumer may use to directly access an oral version of the long <PRTPAGE P="345"/>form disclosure. To provide the long form disclosure by telephone, a financial institution could use a live customer service agent or an interactive voice response system. The financial institution could use a telephone number specifically dedicated to providing the long form disclosure or a more general customer service telephone number for the prepaid account program. For example, a financial institution would be deemed to provide direct access pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiii) if a consumer navigates one or two prompts to reach the oral long form disclosure via a live customer service agent or an interactive voice response system using either a specifically dedicated telephone number of a more general customer service telephone number.</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Financial institution's website.</E> For a financial institution offering prepaid accounts at a retail location pursuant to the retail location exception in § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii), the statement required by § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiii) must also include a website URL (and a telephone number) that a consumer may use to directly access an electronic version of the long form disclosure. For example, a financial institution that requires a consumer to navigate various other web pages before viewing the long form disclosure would not be deemed to provide direct access pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiii). Trademark and product names and their commonly accepted or readily understandable abbreviations comply with the requirement in § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiii) that the URL be meaningfully named. For example, ABC or ABCard would be readily understandable abbreviations for a prepaid account program named the Alpha Beta Card.</P>

                  <P>1. <E T="03">Statement options for payroll card accounts.</E> Section 1005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(A) requires a financial institution to include at the top of the short form disclosure for payroll card accounts, above the information required by § 1005.18(b)(2)(i) through (iv), one of two statements regarding wage payment options. Financial institutions offering payroll card accounts may choose which of the two statements required by § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(A) to use in the short form disclosure. The list of other options required in the second statement might include the following, as applicable: Direct deposit to the consumer's bank account, direct deposit to the consumer's own prepaid account, paper check, or cash. A financial institution may, but is not required to, provide more specificity as to whom consumers must ask or inform of their choice of wage payment method, such as specifying the employer's Human Resources Department.</P>

                  <P>3. <E T="03">Statement permitted for other prepaid accounts.</E> A financial institution offering a prepaid account other than a payroll card account or government benefit account may, but is not required to, include a statement in the short form disclosure regarding payment options that is similar to either of the statements required for payroll card accounts pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(A) or government benefit accounts pursuant to § 1005.15(c)(2)(i). For example, a financial institution issuing a prepaid account to disburse student financial aid proceeds may disclose a statement such as the following: “You have several options to receive your financial aid payments: Direct deposit to your bank account, direct deposit to your own prepaid card, paper check, or this prepaid card. Tell your school which option you choose.”</P>

For example, a financial institution might include the following line of text in the short form disclosure: “See below for free ways to access your funds and balance information” and then list below, but on the same page as, the short form disclosure several ways consumers can access their prepaid account funds and balance information for free. Alternatively, the financial institution might direct the consumer to another location for that information, such as by stating “See the cardholder agreement for free ways to access your funds and balance information.” A similar statement is permitted for government benefit accounts pursuant to § 1005.15(c)(2)(ii).<STARS/>

                  <P>1. <E T="03">Disclosure of all fees.</E> Section 1005.18(b)(4)(ii) requires a financial institution to disclose in the long form all fees that may be imposed in connection with a prepaid <PRTPAGE P="346"/>account, not just fees for electronic fund transfers or the right to make transfers. The requirement to disclose all fees in the long form includes any finance charges imposed on the prepaid account as described in Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.4(b)(11)(ii), in connection with a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in 12 CFR 1026.61 but does not include finance charges imposed on the covered separate credit feature as described in 12 CFR 1026.4(b)(11)(i). See comment 18(b)(7)(i)(B)-2 for guidance on disclosure of finance charges as part of the § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii) fee disclosure in the long form. A financial institution may also be required to include finance charges in the Regulation Z disclosures required pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(4)(vii).</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Disclosure of conditions.</E> Section 1005.18(b)(4)(ii) requires a financial institution to disclose the amount of each fee and the conditions, if any, under which the fee may be imposed, waived, or reduced. For example, if a financial institution charges a cash reload fee, the financial institution must list the amount of the cash reload fee and also specify any circumstances under which a consumer can qualify for a lower fee. Similarly, if a financial institution discloses both a periodic fee and an inactivity fee, it must indicate whether the inactivity fee will be charged in addition to, or instead of, the periodic fee. A financial institution may, but is not required to, also include on the long form disclosure additional information or limitations related to the service or feature for which a fee is charged, such as, for cash reloads, any limit on the amount of cash a consumer may load into the prepaid account in a single transaction or during a particular time period. The general requirement in § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii) does not apply to individual fee waivers or reductions granted to a particular consumer or group of consumers on a discretionary or case-by-case basis.</P>
                  <P>3. <E T="03">Disclosure of a service or feature without a charge.</E> Pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii), a financial institution may, but is not required to, list in the long form disclosure any service or feature it provides or offers at no charge to the consumer. For example, a financial institution may list “online bill pay” in its long form disclosure and indicate a fee amount of “$0” when the financial institution does not charge consumers a fee for that feature. By contrast, where a fee is waived or reduced under certain circumstances or where a service or feature is available for an introductory period without a fee, the financial institution may not list the fee amount as “$0”. Rather, the financial institution must list the highest fee, accompanied by an explanation of the waived or reduced fee amount and any conditions for the waiver or discount. For example, if a financial institution waives its monthly fee for any consumer who receives direct deposit payments into the prepaid account or conducts 30 or more transactions in a given month, the long form disclosure must list the regular monthly fee amount along with an explanation that the monthly fee is waived if the consumer receives direct deposit or conducts 30 or more transactions each month. Similarly, for an introductory fee, the financial institution would list the highest fee, and explain the introductory fee amount, the duration of the introductory period, and any conditions that apply during the introductory period.</P>
                  <P>4. <E T="03">Third-party fees.</E> Section 1005.18(b)(4)(ii) requires disclosure in the long form of any third-party fee amounts known to the financial institution that may apply. Fees imposed by another party, such as a program manager, for services performed on behalf of the financial institution are not third-party fees and therefore must be disclosed on the long form pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii). Also pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(4)(ii), for any third-party fee disclosed, a financial institution may, but is not required to, include either or both a statement that the fee is accurate as of or through a specific date or that the third-party fee is subject to change. For example, a financial institution that contracts with a third-party remote deposit capture service must include in the long form disclosure the amount of the fee known to the financial institution that is charged by the third party for remote deposit capture services. The financial institution may, but is not required to, also state that the third-party remote deposit capture fee is accurate as of or through a specific date, such as the date the financial institution prints the long form disclosure. The financial institution may also state that the fee is subject to change. Section 1005.18(b)(4)(ii) also provides that, if a third-party fee may apply but the amount of the fee is not known by the financial institution, it must include a statement indicating that a third-party fee may apply without specifying the fee amount. For example, a financial institution that permits out-of-network ATM withdrawals would disclose that, for ATM withdrawals that occur outside the financial institution's network, the ATM operator may charge the consumer a fee for the withdrawal, but the financial institution is not required to disclose the out-of-network ATM operator's fee amount if it does not know the amount of the fee.</P>

                  <P>i. <E T="03">Bank disclosure of FDIC insurance.</E> For example, XYZ Bank offers a prepaid account program for sale at retail locations that is set up to be eligible for FDIC deposit insurance, but does not conduct consumer identification and verification before consumers purchase the prepaid account. XYZ Bank may disclose the required statements as “Register your card for FDIC insurance eligibility and other protections. Your funds will be held at or transferred to XYZ Bank, an FDIC-insured institution. Once there, your funds are insured up to $250,000 by the FDIC in the event XYZ Bank fails, if specific deposit insurance requirements are met and your card is registered. See <E T="03">fdic.gov/deposit/deposits/prepaid.html</E> for details.” Conversely, if XYZ Bank offers another prepaid account program for sale at retail locations for which it conducts consumer identification and verification after purchase of the prepaid account, but the program is not set up to be eligible for FDIC insurance, XYZ Bank may disclose the required statements as “Not FDIC insured. Your funds will be held at or transferred to XYZ Bank. If XYZ Bank fails, you are not protected by FDIC deposit insurance and could lose some or all of your money. Register your card for other protections.”</P>
                  <P>ii. <E T="03">Credit union disclosure of NCUA insurance.</E> For example, ABC Credit Union offers a prepaid account program for sale at its own branches that is set up to be eligible for NCUA share insurance, but does not conduct consumer identification and verification before consumers purchase the prepaid account. ABC Credit Union may disclose the requirement statements as “Register your card for NCUA insurance, if eligible, and other protections. Your funds will be held at or transferred to ABC Credit Union, an NCUA-insured institution. Once there, if specific share insurance requirements are met and your card is registered, your funds are insured up to $250,000 by the NCUA in the event ABC Credit Union fails.” See comment 18(b)(2)(xi)-1 for guidance as to when NCUA insurance coverage should be disclosed instead of FDIC insurance coverage.</P>

If the financial institution includes the disclosures described in Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.60(e)(1), pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(7)(i)(B), such disclosures must appear below the statements required by § 1005.18(b)(4)(vi). If the disclosures provided pursuant to Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.60(e)(1), are provided in writing, these disclosures must be provided in the form required by 12 CFR 1026.60(a)(2), and to the extent possible, on the same page as the other disclosures required by § 1005.18(b)(4).</P>

                  <P>2. <E T="03">Location of disclosure.</E> In addition to setting forth the required content for disclosures outside the short form disclosure, § 1005.18(b)(5) requires that, in a setting other than a retail location, the information required by § 1005.18(b)(5) must be disclosed in close proximity to the short form. For example, if the financial institution provides the short form disclosure online, the information required by § 1005.18(b)(5) is deemed disclosed in close proximity to the short form if it appears on the same web page as the short form disclosure. If the financial institution offers the prepaid account in its own branch locations and provides the short form disclosure on the exterior of its preprinted packaging materials, the information required by § 1005.18(b)(5) is deemed disclosed in close proximity to the short form disclosure if it <PRTPAGE P="348"/>appears on the exterior of the packaging. If the financial institution provides a written short form disclosure in a manner other than on preprinted packaging materials, such as on paper, the information required by § 1005.18(b)(5) is deemed disclosed in close proximity if it appears on the same piece of paper as the short form disclosure. If the financial institution provides the short form disclosure orally, the information required by § 1005.18(b)(5) is deemed disclosed in close proximity to the short form disclosure if it is provided immediately before or after disclosing the fees and information required pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2). For prepaid accounts sold in a retail location pursuant to the retail location exception in § 1005.18(b)(1)(ii), § 1005.18(b)(5) requires the information other than purchase price be disclosed on the exterior of the access device's packaging material. If the purchase price, if any, is not also disclosed on the exterior of the packaging, disclosure of the purchase price on or near the sales rack or display for the packaging material is deemed in close proximity to the access device's packaging material.</P>

For example, an employer distributes to new employees printed copies of the disclosures required by § 1005.18(b) for a payroll card account, together with instructions to complete the payroll card account acquisition process online if the employee wishes to be paid via a payroll card account.

                  <P>1. <E T="03">Providing pre-acquisition disclosures electronically.</E> Unless provided in written form prior to acquisition pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(1)(i), § 1005.18(b)(6)(i)(B) requires electronic delivery of the disclosures required by § 1005.18(b) when a consumer acquires a prepaid account through electronic means, including via a website or mobile application, and, among other things, in a manner which is reasonably expected to be accessible in light of how a consumer is acquiring the prepaid account. For example, if a consumer is acquiring a prepaid account via a website or mobile application, it would be reasonable to expect that a consumer would be able to access the disclosures required by § 1005.18(b) on the first page or via a direct link from the first page of the website or mobile application or on the first page that discloses the details about the specific prepaid account program.

For example, the disclosures permitted by § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(B) or (b)(3)(ii) must take up no more than one additional line of text in the short form disclosure. If a consumer is acquiring a prepaid account using a mobile device with a screen too small to accommodate these disclosures on one line of text in accordance with the size requirements set forth in § 1005.18(b)(7)(ii)(B), a financial institution is permitted to display the disclosures permitted by § 1005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(B) and (b)(3)(ii), for example, by stacking those disclosures in a way that responds to smaller screen sizes, while still meeting the other formatting requirements in § 1005.18(b)(7).</P>

                  <P>1. <E T="03">Minimum type size.</E> Section 1005.18(b)(7)(ii) sets forth minimum point/pixel size requirements for each element of the disclosures required by § 1005.18(b)(2), (b)(3)(i) and (ii), and (b)(4). A financial institution may provide disclosures in a type size larger than the required minimum to enhance consumer comprehension in any acquisition scenario, as long as the financial institution complies with the point/pixel size hierarchy set forth in § 1005.18(b)(7)(ii).</P>
                  <P>2. “<E T="03">Point” refers to printed disclosures and</E> “<E T="03">pixel” refers to electronic disclosures.</E> References in § 1005.18(b)(7)(ii) to “point” size correspond to printed disclosures and references to “pixel” size correspond to disclosures provided via electronic means.</P>

                  <P>1. <E T="03">Contrast required between type color and background of disclosures.</E> Section § 1005.18(b)(7)(ii)(A) requires that all text used to disclose information in the short form or in the long form disclosure pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(2), (b)(3)(i) and (ii), and (b)(4) must be in a single, easy-to-read type that is all black or one color and printed on a background that provides a clear contrast. A financial institution complies with the color requirements if, for example, it provides the disclosures required by § 1005.18(b)(2), (b)(3)(i) and (ii), and (b)(4) printed in black type on a white background or white type on a black background. Also, pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(7)(ii)(A), the type and color may differ between the short form disclosure and the long form disclosure provided for a particular prepaid account program. For example, a financial institution may use one font/type style for the short form disclosure for a particular prepaid account program and use a different font/type style for the long form disclosure for that same prepaid account program. Similarly, a financial institution may use black type for the short form disclosure for a particular prepaid account program and use blue type for the long form disclosure for that same prepaid account program.<STARS/>

                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">18(b)(9) Prepaid Accounts Acquired in Foreign Languages</HD>
                  <P>1. <E T="03">Prepaid accounts acquired in foreign languages.</E> Section 1005.18(b)(9)(i) requires a financial institution to provide the pre-acquisition disclosures required by § 1005.18(b) in a foreign language in certain circumstances.</P>
                  <P>i. <E T="03">Examples of situations in which foreign language disclosures are required.</E> The following examples illustrate situations in which a financial institution must provide the pre-acquisition disclosures in a foreign language in connection with the acquisition of that prepaid account:</P>
                  <P>A. The financial institution principally uses a foreign language on the packaging material of a prepaid account sold in a retail location or distributed at a bank or credit union branch, even though a few words appear in English on the packaging.</P>
                  <P>B. The financial institution principally uses a foreign language in a television advertisement for a prepaid account. That advertisement includes a telephone number a consumer can call to acquire the prepaid account, whether by speaking to a customer service representative or interacting with an interactive voice response (IVR) system.</P>
                  <P>C. The financial institution principally uses a foreign language in an online advertisement for a prepaid account. That advertisement includes a website URL through which a consumer can acquire the prepaid account.</P>
                  <P>D. The financial institution principally uses a foreign language on a printed advertisement for a prepaid account. That advertisement includes a telephone number or a website URL a consumer can call or visit to acquire the prepaid account. The pre-acquisition disclosures must be provided to the consumer in that same foreign language prior to the consumer acquiring the prepaid account.</P>
                  <P>E. The financial institution does not principally use a foreign language on prepaid account packaging material nor does it principally use a foreign language to advertise, solicit, or market a prepaid account. A consumer calls the financial institution and has the option to proceed with the prepaid account acquisition process in a foreign language, whether by speaking to a customer service representative or interacting with an IVR system. (But see § 1005.18(b)(9)(i)(C), which limits the obligation to provide foreign language disclosures for payroll card accounts and government benefit accounts acquired orally by telephone in certain circumstances.)</P>

                  <P>F. The financial institution does not principally use a foreign language on prepaid account packaging material nor does it principally use a foreign language to advertise, solicit, or market a prepaid account. A consumer visits the financial institution's website. On that website, the consumer has <PRTPAGE P="350"/>the option to proceed with the prepaid account acquisition process in a foreign language.</P>
                  <P>ii. <E T="03">Examples of situations in which foreign language disclosures are not required.</E> The following examples illustrate situations in which a financial institution is not required to provide the pre-acquisition disclosures in a foreign language:</P>
                  <P>A. A consumer visits the financial institution's branch location in person and speaks to an employee in a foreign language about acquiring a prepaid account. The consumer proceeds with the acquisition process in that foreign language.</P>
                  <P>B. The financial institution does not principally use a foreign language on prepaid account packaging material nor does it principally use a foreign language to advertise, solicit, or market a prepaid account. A consumer calls the financial institution's customer service line and speaks to a customer service representative in a foreign language. However, if the customer service representative proceeds with the prepaid account acquisition process over the telephone, the financial institution would be required to provide the pre-acquisition disclosures in that foreign language. (But see § 1005.18(b)(9)(i)(C), which limits the obligation to provide foreign language disclosures for payroll card accounts and government benefit accounts acquired orally by telephone in certain circumstances.)</P>
                  <P>C. The financial institution principally uses a foreign language in an advertisement for a prepaid account. That advertisement includes a telephone number a consumer can call to acquire the prepaid account. The consumer calls the telephone number provided on the advertisement and has the option to proceed with the prepaid account acquisition process in English or in a foreign language. The consumer chooses to proceed with the acquisition process in English.</P>
                  <P>D. A consumer calls a government agency to enroll in a government benefits program. The government agency does not offer through its telephone system an option for consumers to proceed in a foreign language. An employee of the government agency assists the consumer with the enrollment process, including helping the consumer acquire a government benefits account. The employee also happens to speak the foreign language in which the consumer is most comfortable communicating, and chooses to communicate with the consumer in that language to facilitate the enrollment process. In this case, the employee offered language interpretation assistance on an informal or ad hoc basis to accommodate the prospective government benefits account holder.</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Principally used.</E> All relevant facts and circumstances determine whether a foreign language is principally used by the financial institution to advertise, solicit, or market under § 1005.18(b)(9). Whether a foreign language is principally used is determined at the packaging material, advertisement, solicitation, or marketing communication level, not at the prepaid account program level or across the financial institution's activities as a whole. A financial institution that advertises a prepaid account program in multiple languages would evaluate its use of foreign language in each advertisement to determine whether it has principally used a foreign language therein.</P>
                  <P>3. <E T="03">Advertise, solicit, or market a prepaid account.</E> Any commercial message, appearing in any medium, that promotes directly or indirectly the availability of prepaid accounts constitutes advertising, soliciting, or marketing for purposes of § 1005.18(b)(9). Examples illustrating advertising, soliciting, or marketing include, but are not limited to:</P>
                  <P>i. Messages in a leaflet, promotional flyer, newspaper, or magazine.</P>
                  <P>ii. Electronic messages, such as on a website or mobile application.</P>
                  <P>iii. Telephone solicitations.</P>
                  <P>iv. Solicitations sent to the consumer by mail or email.</P>
                  <P>v. Television or radio commercials.</P>
                  <P>4. <E T="03">Information in the long form disclosure in English.</E> Section 1005.18(b)(9)(ii) states that a financial institution required to provide pre-acquisition disclosures in a foreign language pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(9)(i) must also provide the information required to be disclosed in its pre-acquisition long form disclosure pursuant to § 1005.18(b)(4) in English upon a consumer's request and on any part of the website where it discloses this information in a foreign language. A financial institution may, but is not required to, provide the English version of the information required by § 1005.18(b)(4) in accordance with the formatting, grouping, size and other requirements set forth in § 1005.18(b) for the long form disclosure.</P>
                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">18(c) Access to Prepaid Account Information</HD>
                  <P>1. <E T="03">Posted transactions.</E> The electronic and written history of the consumer's account transactions provided under § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) and (iii), respectively, shall reflect transfers once they have been posted to the account. Thus, a financial institution does not need to include transactions that have been authorized but that have not yet posted to the account.</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Electronic history.</E> The electronic history required under § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) must be made available in a form that the consumer may keep, as required under § 1005.4(a)(1). Financial institutions may satisfy this requirement if they make the electronic history available in a format that is capable of being retained. For example, a financial institution satisfies the requirement if it provides electronic history on a website in a format <PRTPAGE P="351"/>that is capable of being printed or stored electronically using a web browser.</P>
                  <P>3. <E T="03">Written history.</E> Requests that exceed the requirements of § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii) for providing written account transaction history, and which therefore a financial institution may charge a fee, include the following:</P>
                  <P>i. A financial institution may assess a fee or charge to a consumer for responding to subsequent requests for written account transaction history made in a single calendar month. For example, if a consumer requests written account transaction history on June 1 and makes another request on August 5, the financial institution may not assess a fee or charge to the consumer for responding to either request. However, if the consumer requests written account transaction history on June 1 and then makes another request on June 15, the financial institution may assess a fee or charge to the consumer for responding to the request made on June 15, as this is the second response in the same month.</P>
                  <P>ii. If a financial institution maintains more than 24 months of written account transaction history, it may assess a fee or charge to the consumer for providing a written history for transactions occurring more than 24 months preceding the date the financial institution receives the consumer's request, provided the consumer specifically requests the written account transaction history for that time period.</P>

                  <P>iii. If a financial institution offers a consumer the ability to request automatic mailings of written account transaction history on a monthly or other periodic basis, it may assess a fee or charge for such automatic mailings but not for the written account transaction history requested pursuant to § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii). <E T="03">See</E> comment 18(c)-6.</P>
                  <P>4. <E T="03">12 months of electronic account transaction history.</E> Section 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) requires a financial institution to make available at least 12 months of account transaction history electronically. If a prepaid account has been opened for fewer than 12 months, the financial institution need only provide electronic account transaction history pursuant to § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) since the time of account opening. If a prepaid account is closed or becomes inactive, as defined by the financial institution, the financial institution need not make available electronic account transaction history. <E T="03">See</E> comment 9(b)-3. If an inactive account becomes active, the financial institution must again make available 12 months of electronic account transaction history.</P>
                  <P>5. <E T="03">24 months of written account transaction history.</E> Section 1005.18(c)(1)(iii) requires a financial institution to provide at least 24 months of account transaction history in writing upon the consumer's request. A financial institution may provide fewer than 24 months of written account transaction history if the consumer requests a shorter period of time. If a prepaid account has been opened for fewer than 24 months, the financial institution need only provide written account transaction history pursuant to § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii) since the time of account opening. Even if a prepaid account is closed or becomes inactive, the financial institution must continue to provide upon request at least 24 months of written account transaction history preceding the date the request is received. When a prepaid account has been closed or inactive for 24 months or longer, the financial institution is no longer required to provide any written account transaction history pursuant to § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii).</P>
                  <P>6. <E T="03">Periodic statement alternative for unverified prepaid accounts.</E> For prepaid accounts that are not payroll card accounts or government benefit accounts, a financial institution is not required to provide a written history of the consumer's account transactions for any prepaid account for which the financial institution has not completed its consumer identification and verification process as described in § 1005.18(e)(3)(ii)(A) through (C). If a prepaid account is verified, a financial institution must provide written account transaction history upon the consumer's request that includes the period during which the account was not verified, provided that the period is within the 24-month time frame specified in § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii).</P>
                  <P>7. <E T="03">Inclusion of all fees charged.</E> A financial institution that furnishes a periodic statement pursuant to § 1005.9(b) for a prepaid account must disclose the amount of any fees assessed against the account, whether for electronic fund transfers or otherwise, on the periodic statement as well as on any electronic or written account transaction history the financial institution makes available or provides to the consumer. For example, if a financial institution sends periodic statements and also makes available the consumer's electronic account transaction history on its website, the financial institution must disclose the amount of any fees assessed against the account, whether for electronic fund transfers or otherwise, on the periodic statement and on the consumer's electronic account transaction history made available on its website. Likewise, a financial institution that follows the periodic statement alternative in § 1005.18(c)(1) must disclose the amount of any fees assessed against the account, whether for electronic fund transfers or otherwise, on the electronic history of the consumer's account transactions made available pursuant to § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) and any written history of the consumer's account transactions provided pursuant to § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii).</P>
                  <P>8. <E T="03">Summary totals of fees.</E> Section 1005.18(c)(5) requires a financial institution to disclose a summary total of the amount of all fees assessed by the financial institution <PRTPAGE P="352"/>against a prepaid account for the prior calendar month and for the calendar year to date.</P>
                  <P>i. <E T="03">Generally.</E> A financial institution that furnishes a periodic statement pursuant to § 1005.9(b) for a prepaid account must display the monthly and annual fee totals on the periodic statement as well as on any electronic or written account transaction history the financial institution makes available or provides to the consumer. For example, if a financial institution sends periodic statements and also makes available the consumer's electronic account transaction history on its website, the financial institution must display the monthly and annual fee totals on the periodic statement and on the consumer's electronic account transaction history made available on its website. Likewise, a financial institution that follows the periodic statement alternative in § 1005.18(c)(1) must display the monthly and annual fee totals on the electronic history of the consumer's account transactions made available pursuant to § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) and any written history of the consumer's account transactions provided pursuant to § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii). If a financial institution provides periodic statements pursuant to § 1005.9(b), fee totals may be disclosed for each statement period rather than each calendar month, if different. The summary totals of fees should be net of any fee reversals.</P>
                  <P>ii. <E T="03">Third-party fees.</E> A financial institution may, but is not required to, include third-party fees in its summary totals of fees provided pursuant to § 1005.18(c)(5). For example, a financial institution must include in the summary totals of fees the fee it charges a consumer for using an out-of-network ATM, but it need not include any fee charged by an ATM operator, with whom the financial institution has no relationship, for the consumer's use of that operator's ATM. Similarly, a financial institution need not include in the summary totals of fees the fee charged by a third-party reload network for the service of adding cash to a prepaid account at a point-of-sale terminal. A financial institution may, but is not required to, inform consumers of third-party fees such as by providing a disclaimer to indicate that the summary totals do not include certain third-party fees or to explain when third-party fees may occur or through some other method.</P>
                  <P>9. <E T="03">Display of summary totals of fees.</E> A financial institution may, but is not required to, also include sub-totals of the types of fees that make up the summary totals of fees as required by § 1005.18(c)(5). For example, if a financial institution distinguishes optional fees (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> custom card design fees) from fees to use the account, in displaying the summary totals of fees, the financial institution may include sub-totals of those fees, provided the financial institution also presents the combined totals of all fees.</P>
                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">18(e) Modified Limitations on Liability and Error Resolution Requirements</HD>
                  <P>1. <E T="03">Error resolution safe harbor provision.</E> Institutions that choose to investigate notices of error provided up to 120 days from the date a transaction has posted to a consumer's account may still disclose the error resolution time period required by the regulation (as set forth in the model clause in paragraph (b) of appendix A-7 of this part). Specifically, an institution may disclose to prepaid account holders that the institution will investigate any notice of error provided within 60 days of the consumer electronically accessing an account or receiving a written history upon request that reflects the error, even if, for some or all transactions, the institution investigates any notice of error provided up to 120 days from the date that the transaction alleged to be in error has posted to the consumer's account. Similarly, an institution's summary of the consumer's liability (as required under § 1005.7(b)(1)) may disclose that liability is based on the consumer providing notice of error within 60 days of the consumer electronically accessing an account or receiving a written history reflecting the error, even if, for some or all transactions, the institution allows a consumer to assert a notice of error up to 120 days from the date of posting of the alleged error.</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Electronic access.</E> A consumer is deemed to have accessed a prepaid account electronically when the consumer enters a user identification code or password or otherwise complies with a security procedure used by an institution to verify the consumer's identity and to provide access to a website or mobile application through which account information can be viewed. An institution is not required to determine whether a consumer has in fact accessed information about specific transactions to trigger the beginning of the 60-day periods for liability limits and error resolution under §§ 1005.6 and 1005.11. A consumer is not deemed to have accessed a prepaid account electronically when the consumer receives an automated text message or other automated account alert, or checks the account balance by telephone.</P>
                  <P>3. <E T="03">Untimely notice of error.</E> An institution that provides a transaction history under § 1005.18(c)(1) is not required to comply with the requirements of § 1005.11 for any notice of error from the consumer received more than 60 days after the earlier of the date the consumer electronically accesses the account transaction history or the date the financial institution sends a written account transaction history upon the consumer's request. (Alternatively, as provided in <PRTPAGE P="353"/>§ 1005.18(e)(2)(ii), an institution need not comply with the requirements of § 1005.11 with respect to any notice of error received from the consumer more than 120 days after the date of posting of the transfer allegedly in error.) Where the consumer's assertion of error involves an unauthorized EFT, however, the institution must comply with § 1005.6 (including the extension of time limits in § 1005.6(b)(4)) before it may impose any liability on the consumer.</P>
                  <P>4. <E T="03">Verification of accounts.</E> Section 1005.18(e)(3)(i) provides that for prepaid accounts that are not payroll card accounts or government benefit accounts, a financial institution is not required to comply with the liability limits and error resolution requirements in §§ 1005.6 and 1005.11 for any prepaid account for which it has not successfully completed its consumer identification and verification process. Consumer identifying information may include the consumer's full name, address, date of birth, and Social Security number or other government-issued identification number. Section 1005.18(e)(3)(iii) provides that once a financial institution successfully completes its consumer identification and verification process with respect to a prepaid account, the financial institution must limit the consumer's liability for unauthorized transfers and resolve errors that occur following verification in accordance with § 1005.6 or § 1005.11, or the modified timing requirements in § 1005.18(e), as applicable. A financial institution is not required to limit a consumer's liability for unauthorized transfers or resolve errors that occur prior to the financial institution's successful completion of its consumer identification and verification process with respect to a prepaid account.</P>
                  <P>5. <E T="03">Financial institution has not successfully completed verification.</E> Section 1005.18(e)(3)(ii)(A) states that, provided it discloses to the consumer the risks of not registering and verifying a prepaid account, a financial institution has not successfully completed its consumer identification and verification process where it has not concluded the process with respect to a particular prepaid account. For example, a financial institution initiates its consumer identification and verification process by collecting identifying information about a consumer, and attempts to verify the consumer's identity. The financial institution is unable to conclude the process because of conflicting information about the consumer's current address. The financial institution informs the consumer about the nature of the information at issue and requests additional documentation, but the consumer does not provide the requested documentation. As long as the information needed to complete the verification process remains outstanding, the financial institution has not concluded its consumer identification and verification process with respect to that consumer. A financial institution may not delay completing its consumer identification and verification process or refuse to verify a consumer's identity based on the consumer's assertion of an error.</P>
                  <P>6. <E T="03">Account verification prior to acquisition.</E> A financial institution that collects and verifies consumer identifying information, or that obtains such information after it has been collected and verified by a third party, prior to or as part of the account acquisition process, is deemed to have successfully completed its consumer identification and verification process with respect to that account. For example, a university contracts with a financial institution to disburse financial aid to students via the financial institution's prepaid accounts. To facilitate the accurate disbursal of aid awards, the university provides the financial institution with identifying information about the university's students, whose identities the university had previously verified. The financial institution is deemed to have successfully completed its consumer identification and verification process with respect to those accounts.<STARS/>

                  <P>1. <E T="03">Disclosures not on prepaid account access devices and prepaid account packaging materials.</E> Section 1005.18(h)(1) provides that, except as provided in § 1005.18(h)(2) and (3), the disclosure requirements of subpart A, as modified by § 1005.18, apply to prepaid accounts as defined in § 1005.2(b)(3), including government benefit accounts subject to § 1005.15, beginning April 1, 2019. This effective date applies to disclosures made available or provided to consumers electronically, orally by telephone, or in a form other than on pre-printed materials, such as disclosures printed on paper by a financial institution upon a consumer's request.</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Disclosures on prepaid account access devices and prepaid account packaging materials.</E> Section 1005.18(h)(2)(i) provides that the disclosure requirements of subpart A, as modified by § 1005.18, do not apply to any disclosures that are provided, or that would otherwise be required to be provided, on prepaid account access devices, or on, in, or with prepaid account packaging materials that were manufactured, printed, or otherwise produced in the normal course of business prior to April 1, 2019. This includes, for example, disclosures contained on or in packages for prepaid accounts sold at retail, or disclosures for payroll card accounts or government benefit accounts that are distributed to employees or benefits recipients in packages or envelopes. Disclosures on, in, or with <PRTPAGE P="354"/>access devices or packaging materials that are manufactured, printed, or otherwise produced on or after April 1, 2019 must comply with all the requirements of subpart A.</P>
                  <P>3. <E T="03">Form of notice to consumers.</E> A financial institution that is required to notify consumers of a change in terms and conditions pursuant to § 1005.18(h)(2)(ii) or (iii), or that otherwise provides updated initial disclosures as a result of § 1005.18(h)(1) taking effect, may provide the notice or disclosures either as a separate document or included in another notice or mailing that the consumer receives regarding the prepaid account to the extent permitted by other laws and regulations.</P>
                  <P>4. <E T="03">Ability to contact the consumer.</E> A financial institution that has not obtained the consumer's contact information is not required to comply with the requirements set forth in § 1005.18(h)(2)(ii) or (iii). A financial institution is able to contact the consumer when, for example, it has the consumer's mailing address or email address.</P>
                  <P>5. <E T="03">Closed and inactive prepaid accounts.</E> The requirements of § 1005.18(h)(2)(iii) do not apply to prepaid accounts that are closed or inactive, as defined by the financial institution. However, if an inactive account becomes active, the financial institution must comply with the requirements of § 1005.18(h)(2)(ii) within 30 days of the account becoming active again in order to avail itself of the timing requirements and accommodations set forth in § 1005.18(h)(2)(iii) and (iv).</P>
                  <P>6. <E T="03">Account information not available on April 1, 2019.</E> i. <E T="03">Electronic and written account transaction history.</E> A financial institution following the periodic statement alternative in § 1005.18(c) must make available 12 months of electronic account transaction history pursuant to § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) and must provide 24 months of written account transaction history upon request pursuant to § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii) beginning April 1, 2019. If, on April 1, 2019, the financial institution does not have readily accessible the data necessary to make available or provide the account histories for the required time periods, the financial institution may make available or provide such histories using the data for the time period it has until the financial institution has accumulated the data necessary to comply in full with the requirements set forth in § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) and (iii). For example, a financial institution that had been retaining only 60 days of account history before April 1, 2019 would provide 60 days of written account transaction history upon a consumer's request on April 1, 2019. If, on May 1, 2019, the consumer made another request for written account transaction history, the financial institution would be required to provide three months of account history. The financial institution must continue to provide as much account history as it has accumulated at the time of a consumer's request until it has accumulated 24 months of account history. Thus, all financial institutions must fully comply with the electronic account transaction history requirement set forth in § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) no later than April 1, 2020 and must fully comply with the written account transaction history requirement set forth in § 1005.18(c)(1)(iii) no later than April 1, 2021.</P>
                  <P>ii. <E T="03">Summary totals of fees.</E> A financial institution must display a summary total of the amount of all fees assessed by the financial institution on the consumer's prepaid account for the prior calendar month and for the calendar year to date pursuant to § 1005.18(c)(5) beginning April 1, 2019. If, on April 1, 2019, the financial institution does not have readily accessible the data necessary to calculate the summary totals of fees for the prior calendar month or the calendar year to date, the financial institution may provide the summary totals using the data it has until the financial institution has accumulated the data necessary to display the summary totals as required by § 1005.18(c)(5). That is, the financial institution would first display the monthly fee total beginning on May 1, 2019 for the month of April, and the year-to-date fee total beginning on April 1, 2019, provided the financial institution discloses that it is displaying the year-to-date total beginning on April 1, 2019 rather than for the entire calendar year 2019. On January 1, 2020, financial institutions must begin displaying year-to-date fee totals for calendar year 2020.</P>

                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">19(a)(1) Agreement</HD>
                  <P>1. <E T="03">Provisions contained in separate documents included.</E> Section 1005.19(a)(1) defines a prepaid account agreement, for purposes of § 1005.19, as the written document or documents evidencing the terms of the legal obligation, or the prospective legal obligation, between a prepaid account issuer and a consumer for a prepaid account. An agreement may consist of several documents that, taken together, define the legal obligation between the issuer and consumer.</P>
                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">19(a)(2) Amends</HD>
                  <P>1. <E T="03">Substantive changes.</E> A change to an agreement is substantive, and therefore is deemed an amendment of the agreement, if it alters the rights or obligations of the parties. Section 1005.19(a)(2) provides that any change in the fee information, as defined in § 1005.19(a)(3), is deemed to be substantive. Examples of other changes that generally would be considered substantive include:<PRTPAGE P="355"/>
                  </P>
                  <P>i. Addition or deletion of a provision giving the issuer or consumer a right under the agreement, such as a clause that allows an issuer to unilaterally change the terms of an agreement.</P>
                  <P>ii. Addition or deletion of a provision giving the issuer or consumer an obligation under the agreement, such as a clause requiring the consumer to pay an additional fee.</P>
                  <P>iii. Changes that may affect the cost of the prepaid account to the consumer, such as changes in a provision describing how the prepaid account's monthly fee will be calculated.</P>
                  <P>iv. Changes that may affect how the terms of the agreement are construed or applied, such as changes to a choice of law provision.</P>
                  <P>v. Changes that may affect the parties to whom the agreement may apply, such as changes to provisions regarding authorized users or assignment of the agreement.</P>
                  <P>vi. Changes to the corporate name of the issuer or program manager, or to the issuer's address or identifying number, such as its RSSD ID number or tax identification number.</P>
                  <P>vii. Changes to the list of names of other relevant parties, such as the employer for a payroll card program or the agency for a government benefit program. But see § 1005.19(b)(2)(ii) regarding the timing of submitting such changes to the Bureau.</P>
                  <P>viii. Changes to the name of the prepaid account program to which the agreement applies.</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Non-substantive changes.</E> Changes that generally would not be considered substantive include, for example:</P>
                  <P>i. Correction of typographical errors that do not affect the meaning of any terms of the agreement.</P>
                  <P>ii. Changes to the issuer's corporate logo or tagline.</P>
                  <P>iii. Changes to the format of the agreement, such as conversion to a booklet from a full-sheet format, changes in font, or changes in margins.</P>
                  <P>iv. Reordering sections of the agreement without affecting the meaning of any terms of the agreement.</P>
                  <P>v. Adding, removing, or modifying a table of contents or index.</P>
                  <P>vi. Changes to titles, headings, section numbers, or captions.</P>
                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">19(a)(4) Issuer</HD>
                  <P>1. <E T="03">Issuer.</E> Section 1005.19(a)(4) provides that, for purposes of § 1005.19, issuer or prepaid account issuer means the entity to which a consumer is legally obligated, or would be legally obligated, under the terms of a prepaid account agreement. For example, Bank X and Bank Y work together to issue prepaid accounts. A consumer that obtains a prepaid account issued pursuant to this arrangement between Bank X and Bank Y is subject to an agreement that states “This is an agreement between you, the consumer, and Bank X that governs the terms of your Bank Y Prepaid Account.” The prepaid account issuer in this example is Bank X, because the agreement creates a legally enforceable obligation between the consumer and Bank X. Bank X is the issuer even if the consumer applied for the prepaid account through a link on Bank Y's website and the cards prominently feature the Bank Y logo on the front of the card.</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Use of third-party service providers.</E> An issuer has a legal obligation to comply with the requirements of § 1005.19. However, an issuer generally may use a third-party service provider to satisfy its obligations under § 1005.19, provided that the issuer acts in accordance with regulatory guidance regarding use of third-party service providers and other applicable regulatory guidance. In some cases, an issuer may wish to arrange for the entity with which it partners to issue prepaid accounts to fulfill the requirements of § 1005.19 on the issuer's behalf. For example, Program Manager and Bank work together to issue prepaid accounts. Under the § 1005.19(a)(4) definition of issuer, Bank is the issuer of these prepaid accounts for purposes of § 1005.19. However, Program Manager services the prepaid accounts, including mailing to consumers account opening materials and making available to consumers their electronic account transaction history, pursuant to § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii). While Bank is responsible for ensuring compliance with § 1005.19, Bank may arrange for Program Manager (or another appropriate third-party service provider) to make submissions of prepaid account agreements to the Bureau under § 1005.19 on Bank's behalf. Bank must comply with regulatory guidance regarding use of third-party service providers and other applicable regulatory guidance.</P>
                  <P>3. <E T="03">Third-party websites.</E> As explained in comment 19(c)-2, if an issuer provides consumers with access to specific information about their individual accounts, such as making available to consumers their electronic account transaction history, pursuant to § 1005.18(c)(1)(ii), through a third-party website, the issuer is deemed to maintain that website for purposes of § 1005.19. Such a website is deemed to be maintained by the issuer for purposes of § 1005.19 even where, for example, an unaffiliated entity designs the website and owns and maintains the information technology infrastructure that supports the website, consumers with prepaid accounts from multiple issuers can access individual account information through the same website, and the website is not labeled, branded, or otherwise held out to the public as belonging to the issuer. A partner institution's website is an example of a third-party website that may be deemed to be maintained by the issuer for purposes of § 1005.19. <PRTPAGE P="356"/>For example, Program Manager and Bank work together to issue prepaid accounts. Under the § 1005.19(a)(4) definition of issuer, Bank is the issuer of these prepaid accounts for purposes of § 1005.19. Bank does not maintain a website specifically related to prepaid accounts. However, consumers can access information about their individual accounts, such as an electronic account transaction history, through a website maintained by Program Manager. Program Manager designs the website and owns and maintains the information technology infrastructure that supports the website. The website is branded and held out to the public as belonging to Program Manager. Because consumers can access information about their individual accounts through this website, the website is deemed to be maintained by Bank for purposes of § 1005.19. Bank therefore may comply with § 1005.19(c) or (d)(1) by ensuring that agreements offered by Bank are posted on Program Manager's website in accordance with § 1005.19(c) or (d)(1), respectively. Bank need not create and maintain a website branded and held out to the public as belonging to Bank in order to comply with § 1005.19(c) and (d) as long as Bank ensures that Program Manager's website complies with these sections.</P>
                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">19(a)(6) Offers to the General Public</HD>
                  <P>1. <E T="03">Prepaid accounts offered to limited groups.</E> An issuer is deemed to offer a prepaid account agreement to the general public even if the issuer markets, solicits applications for, or otherwise makes available prepaid accounts only to a limited group of persons. For example, an issuer may solicit only residents of a specific geographic location for a particular prepaid account; in this case, the agreement would be considered to be offered to the general public. Similarly, agreements for prepaid accounts issued by a credit union are considered to be offered to the general public even though such prepaid accounts are available only to credit union members.</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Prepaid account agreements not offered to the general public.</E> A prepaid account agreement is not offered to the general public when a consumer is offered the agreement only by virtue of the consumer's relationship with a third party. Examples of agreements not offered to the general public include agreements for payroll card accounts, government benefit accounts, or for prepaid accounts used to distribute student financial aid disbursements, or property and casualty insurance payouts, and other similar programs.</P>
                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">19(a)(7) Open Account</HD>
                  <P>1. <E T="03">Open account.</E> A prepaid account is an open account if (i) there is an outstanding balance in the account; (ii) the consumer can load more funds to the account even if the account does not currently hold a balance; or (iii) the consumer can access credit from a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.61, in connection with a prepaid account. Under this definition, an account that meets any of these criteria is considered to be open even if the account is deemed inactive by the issuer.</P>
                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">19(a)(8) Prepaid Account</HD>
                  <P>1. <E T="03">Prepaid account.</E> Section 1005.19(a)(7) provides that, for purposes of § 1005.19, the term prepaid account means a prepaid account as defined in § 1005.2(b)(3). Therefore, for purposes of § 1005.19, a prepaid account includes, among other things, a payroll card account as defined in § 1005.2(b)(3)(iii) and a government benefit account as defined in §§ 1005.2(b)(3)(iii) and 1005.15(a)(2).</P>
                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">19(b) Submission of Agreements to the Bureau</HD>
                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">19(b)(1) Submissions on a Rolling Basis</HD>
                  <P>1. <E T="03">Rolling submission requirement.</E> Section 1005.19(b)(1) requires issuers to send submissions to the Bureau no later than 30 days after offering, amending, or ceasing to offer any prepaid account agreement, as described in § 1005.19(b)(1)(ii) through (iv). For example, if on July 1 an issuer offers a prepaid account agreement that has not been previously submitted to the Bureau, it must submit that agreement to the Bureau by July 31 of the same year. Similarly, if on August 1 an issuer amends a prepaid account agreement previously submitted to the Bureau, and the change becomes effective on September 15, the issuer must submit the entire amended agreement as required by § 1005.19(b)(2)(i) by October 15 of the same year. Furthermore, if on December 31 an issuer ceases to offer a prepaid account agreement that was previously submitted to the Bureau, it must submit notification to the Bureau that it is withdrawing that agreement as required by § 1005.19(b)(3) by January 30 of the following year.</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Prepaid accounts offered in conjunction with multiple issuers.</E> If a program manager offers prepaid account agreements in conjunction with multiple issuers, each issuer must submit its own agreement to the Bureau. Alternatively, each issuer may use the program manager to submit the agreement on its behalf, in accordance with comment 19(a)(4)-2.</P>
                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">19(b)(2) Amended Agreements</HD>
                  <P>1. <E T="03">Change-in-terms notices not permissible.</E> Section 1005.19(b)(2)(i) requires that if an agreement previously submitted to the Bureau is amended, the issuer must submit the entire revised agreement to the Bureau. An issuer may not fulfill this requirement by <PRTPAGE P="357"/>submitting a change-in-terms or similar notice covering only the terms that have changed. Amendments must be integrated into the text of the agreement (or the optional addenda described in § 1005.19(b)(6)), not provided as separate riders.</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Updates to the list of names of other relevant parties to an agreement.</E> Section 1005.19(b)(2)(ii) permits an issuer to delay making a submission to the Bureau regarding a change in the list of other relevant parties to a particular agreement until the earlier of such time as the issuer is otherwise submitting an amended agreement or changes to other identifying information about the issuer and its submitted agreements pursuant to § 1005.19(b)(1)(i); or May 1 of each year, for any updates to the list of names of other relevant parties that occurred between the issuer's last submission of relevant party information for that agreement and April 1 of that year. Section 1005.19(b)(2)(ii) thus ensures that the Bureau has a list of names of other relevant parties for all submitted agreements that is up-to-date as of April 1 of each year. The following examples illustrate these requirements:</P>

                  <P>i. An issuer first submits to the Bureau a payroll card agreement, along with a list of names of the other relevant parties (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> employers) to that agreement, on May 1, 2019. On July 1, 2020, the issuer adds four new employers under the agreement. The issuer is not required to make a submission to the Bureau regarding the addition of other relevant parties to that agreement at that time.</P>
                  <P>ii. On January 1, 2020, a change to the payroll card agreement becomes effective reflecting a new feature and accompanying fee that the issuer has added to the program. The issuer is required, by January 31, 2020, to submit to the Bureau its entire revised agreement and an updated list of the names of other relevant parties to that agreement.</P>
                  <P>iii. If the issuer has not added any other employers to the agreement by April 1, 2020, the issuer is not required to submit to the Bureau an updated list of names of other relevant parties to that agreement, because the list it previously submitted to the Bureau remains current.</P>
                  <P>iv. If, however, on March 1, 2020, the issuer adds two new employers under the agreement but makes no other changes to the agreement, then as of April 1 there are new relevant parties to the agreement that the issuer has not submitted to the Bureau. The issuer is required, by May 1, 2020, to submit to the Bureau an updated list of names of other relevant parties to that agreement reflecting the two employers it added in March. Because the issuer has not made any other changes to the agreement since it was submitted in January, the issuer is not required to re-submit the agreement itself by May 1, 2020.<STARS/>
                  </P>
                  <HD SOURCE="HD3">19(b)(6) Form and Content of Agreements Submitted to the Bureau</HD>
                  <P>1. <E T="03">Agreements currently in effect.</E> Agreements submitted to the Bureau must contain the provisions of the agreement and fee information currently in effect. For example, on June 1, an issuer decides to decrease the out-of-network ATM withdrawal fee associated with one of the agreements it offers. The change in that fee will become effective on August 1. The issuer must submit and post the amended agreement with the decreased out-of-network ATM withdrawal fee to the Bureau by August 31 as required by § 1005.19(b)(2)(i) and (c).</P>
                  <P>2. <E T="03">Fee information variations do not constitute separate agreements.</E> Fee information that may vary from one consumer to another depending on the consumer's state of residence or other factors must be disclosed by setting forth all the possible variations. For example, an issuer offers a prepaid account with a monthly fee of $4.95 or $0 if the consumer regularly receives direct deposit to the prepaid account. The issuer must submit to the Bureau one agreement with fee information listing the possible monthly fees of $4.95 or $0 and including the explanation that the latter fee is dependent upon the consumer regularly receiving direct deposit.</P>
                  <P>3. <E T="03">Integrated agreement requirement.</E> Issuers may not submit provisions of the agreement or fee information in the form of change-in-terms notices or riders. The only addenda that may be submitted as part of an agreement are the optional fee information addenda described in § 1005.19(b)(6)(ii). Changes in provisions or fee information must be integrated into the body of the agreement or the optional fee information addenda. For example, it would be impermissible for an issuer to submit to the Bureau an agreement in the form of a terms and conditions document on January 1 and subsequently submit a change-in-terms notice to indicate amendments to the previously submitted agreement. Instead, the issuer must submit a document that integrates the changes made by each of the change-in-terms notices into the body of the original terms and conditions document and the optional addenda displaying variations in fee information.<STARS/>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> This part, known as Regulation F, is issued by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau). This subpart establishes procedures and criteria whereby states may apply to the Bureau for exemption of a class of debt collection practices within the applying state from the provisions of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (the Act) as provided in section 817 of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 1692o.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Application.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Any state may apply to the Bureau pursuant to the terms of this part for a determination that, under the laws of that state, any class of debt collection practices within that state is subject to requirements that are substantially similar to, or provide greater protection for consumers than, those imposed under sections 803 through 812 of the Act, and that there is adequate provision for state enforcement of such requirements. The application shall be in writing, addressed to the Bureau, signed by the Governor, Attorney General or state official having primary enforcement or responsibility under the state law which is applicable to the class of debt collection practices, and shall be supported by the documents specified in this subpart.</P>

            <P>The application shall be accompanied by the following, which may be submitted in paper or electronic form:</P>
            <P>(a) A copy of the full text of the state law that is claimed to contain requirements substantially similar to those imposed under sections 803 through 812 of the Act, or to provide greater protection to consumers than sections 803 through 812 of the Act, regarding the class of debt collection practices within that state.</P>
            <P>(b) A comparison of each provision of sections 803 through 812 of the Act with the corresponding provision of the state law, together with reasons supporting the claim that the corresponding provisions of the state law are substantially similar to or provide greater protection to consumers than provisions of sections 803 through 812 of the Act and an explanation as to why any differences between the state and Federal law are not inconsistent with the provisions of sections 803 through 812 of the Act and do not result in a diminution in the protection otherwise afforded consumers; and a statement that no other state laws (including administrative or judicial interpretations) are related to, or would have an effect upon, the state law that is being considered by the Bureau in making its determination.</P>
            <P>(c) A copy of the full text of the state law that provides for enforcement of the state law referred to in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

            <P>(d) A comparison of the provisions of the state law that provides for enforcement with the provisions of section 814 of the Act, together with reasons supporting the claim that such state law <PRTPAGE P="359"/>provides for administrative enforcement of the state law referred to in paragraph (a) of this section that is substantially similar to, or more extensive than, the enforcement provided under section 814 of the Act.</P>
            <P>(e) A statement identifying the office designated or to be designated to administer the state law referred to in paragraph (a) of this section, together with complete information regarding the fiscal arrangements for administrative enforcement (including the amount of funds available or to be provided), the number and qualifications of personnel engaged or to be engaged in enforcement, and a description of the procedures under which such state law is to be administratively enforced. The statement should also include reasons to support the claim that there is adequate provision for enforcement of such state law.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Criteria for determination.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The Bureau will consider the criteria set forth below, and any other relevant information, in determining whether the law of a state is substantially similar to, or provides greater protection to consumers than, the provisions of sections 803 through 812 of the Act regarding the class of debt collection practices within that state, and whether there is adequate provision for state enforcement of such law. In making that determination, the Bureau primarily will consider each provision of the state law in comparison with each corresponding provision in sections 803 through 812 of the Act, and not the state law as a whole in comparison with the Act as a whole.</P>
            <P>(a)(1) In order for provisions of state law to be substantially similar to, or provide greater protection to consumers than the provisions of sections 803 through 812 of the Act, the provisions of state law at least shall provide that:</P>
            <P>(i) Definitions and rules of construction, as applicable, import the same meaning and have the same application as those prescribed by sections 803 through 812 of the Act.</P>
            <P>(ii) Debt collectors provide all of the applicable notifications required by the provisions of sections 803 through 812 of the Act, with the content and in the terminology, form, and time periods prescribed by this part pursuant to sections 803 through 812; however, required references to state law may be substituted for the references to Federal law required in this part. Notification requirements under state law in additional circumstances or with additional detail that do not frustrate any of the purposes of the Act may be determined by the Bureau to be consistent with sections 803 through 812 of the Act;</P>
            <P>(iii) Debt collectors take all affirmative actions and abide by obligations substantially similar to, or more extensive than, those prescribed by sections 803 through 812 of the Act under substantially similar or more stringent conditions and within the same or more stringent time periods as are prescribed in sections 803 through 812 of the Act;</P>
            <P>(iv) Debt collectors abide by the same or more stringent prohibitions as are prescribed by sections 803 through 812 of the Act;</P>
            <P>(v) Obligations or responsibilities imposed on consumers are no more costly, lengthy, or burdensome relative to consumers exercising any of the rights or gaining the benefits of the protections provided in the state law than corresponding obligations or responsibilities imposed on consumers in sections 803 through 812 of the Act.</P>
            <P>(vi) Consumers' rights and protections are substantially similar to, or more favorable than, those provided by sections 803 through 812 of the Act under conditions or within time periods that are substantially similar to, or more favorable to consumers than, those prescribed by sections 803 through 812 of the Act.</P>
            <P>(2) Paragraph (a)(1) of this section is not to be construed as indicating that the Bureau would consider adversely any additional requirements of state law that are not inconsistent with the purpose of the Act or the requirements imposed under sections 803 through 812 of the Act.</P>

            <P>(b) In determining whether provisions for enforcement of the state law referred to in § 1006.3(a) of this part are adequate, consideration will be given to the extent to which, under state law, provision is made for administrative <PRTPAGE P="360"/>enforcement, including necessary facilities, personnel, and funding.</P>

            <P>If the Bureau determines on the basis of the information before it that, under the law of a state, a class of debt collection practices is subject to requirements substantially similar to, or that provide greater protection to consumers than, those imposed under sections 803 through 812 and section 814 of the Act, and that there is adequate provision for state enforcement, the Bureau will exempt the class of debt collection practices in that state from the requirements of sections 803 through 812 and section 814 of the Act in the following manner and subject to the following conditions:</P>
            <P>(a) Notice of the exemption shall be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> and the Bureau shall furnish a copy of such notice to the state official who made application for such exemption, to each Federal authority responsible for administrative enforcement of the requirements of sections 803 through 812 of the Act, and to the Attorney General of the United States. Any exemption granted shall be effective 90 days after the date of publication of such notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(b) The appropriate official of any state that receives an exemption shall inform the Bureau in writing within 30 days of any change in the state laws referred to in § 1006.3(a) and (c) of this part. The report of any such change shall contain copies of the full text of that change, together with statements setting forth the information and opinions regarding that change that are specified in § 1006.3(b) and (d). The appropriate official of any state that has received such an exemption also shall file with the Bureau from time to time such reports as the Bureau may require.</P>
            <P>(c) The Bureau shall inform the appropriate official of any state that receives such an exemption of any subsequent amendments of the Act or this part that might necessitate the amendment of state law for the exemption to continue.</P>
            <P>(d) No exemption shall extend to the civil liability provisions of section 813 of the Act. After an exemption is granted, the requirements of the applicable state law shall constitute the requirements of sections 803 through 812 of the Act, except to the extent such state law imposes requirements not imposed by the Act or this part.</P>

            <P>(b) If, after having afforded the state authority such opportunity to demonstrate or achieve compliance, the Bureau finds on the basis of the information before it that it still cannot make a favorable determination in connection with the application, the Bureau shall publish in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> a notice of its determination regarding the application and shall furnish a copy of such notice to the state official who made application for such exemption.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Revocation of exemption.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) The Bureau reserves the right to revoke any exemption granted under the provisions of this part, if at any time it determines that the state law does not, in fact, impose requirements <PRTPAGE P="361"/>that are substantially similar to, or that provide greater protection to applicants than, those imposed under sections 803 through 812 of the Act or that there is not, in fact, adequate provision for state enforcement.</P>
            <P>(b) Before revoking any such exemption, the Bureau shall notify the appropriate state official of the facts or conduct that, in the Bureau's opinion, warrant such revocation, and shall afford that state such opportunity as the Bureau deems appropriate in the circumstances to demonstrate or achieve compliance.</P>

            <P>(c) If, after having been afforded the opportunity to demonstrate or achieve compliance, the Bureau determines that the state has not done so, notice of the Bureau's intention to revoke such exemption shall be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> A period of time shall be allowed from the date of such publication for interested persons to submit written comments to the Bureau regarding the intention to revoke.</P>

            <P>(d) If such exemption is revoked, notice of such revocation shall be published by the Bureau in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> and a copy of such notice shall be furnished to the appropriate state official, to the Federal authorities responsible for enforcement of the requirements of the Act, and to the Attorney General of the United States. The revocation shall become effective, and the class of debt collection practices affected within that state shall become subject to the requirements of sections 803 through 812 of the Act, 90 days after the date of publication of the notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>

          <SUBJECT>Authority, purpose, and scope.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Authority.</E> This part, known as Regulation G, is issued by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection pursuant to the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008, title V of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (S.A.F.E. Act) (Pub. L. 110-289, 122 Stat. 2654, 12 U.S.C. 5101 <E T="03">et seq.,</E>) 12 U.S.C. 5512, 5581, 15 U.S.C. 1604(a), 1639b.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> This part implements the S.A.F.E. Act's Federal registration requirement for mortgage loan originators. The S.A.F.E. Act provides that the objectives of this registration include aggregating and improving the flow of information to and between regulators; providing increased accountability and tracking of mortgage loan originators; enhancing consumer protections; supporting anti-fraud measures; and providing consumers with easily accessible information at no charge regarding the employment history of, and publicly adjudicated disciplinary and enforcement actions against, mortgage loan originators.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Scope</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> This part applies to:</P>
          <P>(i) National banks, Federal branches and agencies of foreign banks, their operating subsidiaries (collectively referred to in this part as national banks), and their employees who act as mortgage loan originators;</P>
          <P>(ii) Member banks of the Federal Reserve System; their respective subsidiaries that are not functionally regulated within the meaning of section 5(c)(5) of the Bank Holding Company Act, as amended (12 U.S.C. 1844(c)(5)); branches and agencies of foreign banks; commercial lending companies owned or controlled by foreign banks (collectively referred to in this part as member banks); and their employees who act as mortgage loan originators;</P>

          <P>(iii) Insured state nonmember banks (including state-licensed insured <PRTPAGE P="362"/>branches of foreign banks), their subsidiaries (except brokers, dealers, persons providing insurance, investment companies, and investment advisers) (collectively referred to in this part as insured state nonmember banks), and employees of such banks or subsidiaries who act as mortgage loan originators;</P>
          <P>(iv) Savings associations, their operating subsidiaries (collectively referred to in this part as savings associations), and their employees who act as mortgage loan originators;</P>
          <P>(v) Farm Credit System lending institutions that actually originate residential mortgage loans pursuant to sections 1.9(3), 1.11 or 2.4(a) and (b) of the Farm Credit Act of 1971 (collectively referred to in this part as Farm Credit System institutions), and their employees who act as mortgage loan originators; and</P>
          <P>(vi) Any federally insured credit union and its employees, including volunteers, who act as mortgage loan originators. This part also applies to non-federally insured credit unions and their employees, including volunteers, who act as mortgage loan originators, subject to the conditions in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">De minimis exception.</E> (i) This part and the requirements of 12 U.S.C. 5103(a)(1)(A) and (2) of the S.A.F.E. Act do not apply to any employee of a national bank, member bank, insured state nonmember bank, savings association, Farm Credit System institution, or credit union who has never been registered or licensed through the Registry as a mortgage loan originator if during the past 12 months the employee acted as a mortgage loan originator for 5 or fewer residential mortgage loans.</P>
          <P>(ii) Prior to engaging in mortgage loan origination activity that exceeds the exception limit in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, an employee must register with the Registry pursuant to this part.</P>
          <P>(iii) <E T="03">Evasion.</E> National banks, member banks, insured state nonmember banks, savings associations, Farm Credit System institutions, and credit unions are prohibited from engaging in any act or practice to evade the limits of the <E T="03">de minimis</E> exception set forth in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">For non-federally insured credit unions.</E> A non-federally insured credit union in a state identified on the National Credit Union Administration's Web site (NCUA.gov) as one where the appropriate state supervisory authority has executed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the National Credit Union Administration may register under this rule provided that any Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry listing of the non-federally insured credit union and its employees contains a clear and conspicuous statement that the non-federally insured credit union is not insured by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund, and the state supervisory authority where the non-federally insured credit union is located maintains an agreement with the National Credit Union Administration for this registration process and oversight. If the state supervisory authority where the non-federally insured credit union is located fails to maintain such an agreement, the non-federally insured credit union and its employees in that state may not register or maintain registration under the Federal system. They instead must use the appropriate state licensing and registration system, or if the state does not have such a system, the licensing and registration system established by the Bureau for mortgage loan originators and their employees.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix A to Part 1007—Examples of Mortgage Loan Originator Activities</HD>
          <P>This appendix provides examples to aid in the understanding of activities that would cause an employee of a covered financial institution to fall within or outside the definition of mortgage loan originator. The examples in this appendix are not all-inclusive. They illustrate only the issue described and do not illustrate any other issues that may arise under this part. For purposes of the examples below, the term “loan” refers to a residential mortgage loan.</P>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Taking a loan application.</E> The following examples illustrate when an employee takes, or does not take, a loan application.</P>

          <P>(1) Taking an application includes: receiving information provided in connection with a request for a loan to be used to determine whether the consumer qualifies for a loan, even if the employee:<PRTPAGE P="368"/>
          </P>
          <P>(i) Has received the consumer's information indirectly in order to make an offer or negotiate a loan;</P>
          <P>(ii) Is not responsible for verifying information;</P>
          <P>(iii) Is inputting information into an online application or other automated system on behalf of the consumer; or</P>
          <P>(iv) Is not engaged in approval of the loan, including determining whether the consumer qualifies for the loan.</P>
          <P>(2) Taking an application does not include any of the following activities performed solely or in combination:</P>
          <P>(i) Contacting a consumer to verify the information in the loan application by obtaining documentation, such as tax returns or payroll receipts;</P>
          <P>(ii) Receiving a loan application through the mail and forwarding it, without review, to loan approval personnel;</P>
          <P>(iii) Assisting a consumer who is filling out an application by clarifying what type of information is necessary for the application or otherwise explaining the qualifications or criteria necessary to obtain a loan product;</P>
          <P>(iv) Describing the steps that a consumer would need to take to provide information to be used to determine whether the consumer qualifies for a loan or otherwise explaining the loan application process;</P>
          <P>(v) In response to an inquiry regarding a prequalified offer that a consumer has received from a covered financial institution, collecting only basic identifying information about the consumer and forwarding the consumer to a mortgage loan originator; or</P>
          <P>(vi) Receiving information in connection with a modification to the terms of an existing loan to a borrower as part of the covered financial institution's loss mitigation efforts when the borrower is reasonably likely to default.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Offering or negotiating terms of a loan.</E> The following examples are designed to illustrate when an employee offers or negotiates terms of a loan, and conversely, what does not constitute offering or negotiating terms of a loan.</P>
          <P>(1) Offering or negotiating the terms of a loan includes:</P>
          <P>(i) Presenting a loan offer to a consumer for acceptance, either verbally or in writing, including, but not limited to, providing a disclosure of the loan terms after application under the Truth in Lending Act, even if:</P>
          <P>(A) Further verification of information is necessary;</P>
          <P>(B) The offer is conditional;</P>
          <P>(C) Other individuals must complete the loan process; or</P>
          <P>(D) Only the rate approved by the covered financial institution's loan approval mechanism function for a specific loan product is communicated without authority to negotiate the rate.</P>
          <P>(ii) Responding to a consumer's request for a lower rate or lower points on a pending loan application by presenting to the consumer a revised loan offer, either verbally or in writing, that includes a lower interest rate or lower points than the original offer.</P>
          <P>(2) Offering or negotiating terms of a loan does not include solely or in combination:</P>

          <P>(i) Providing general explanations or descriptions in response to consumer queries regarding qualification for a specific loan product, such as explaining loan terminology (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> debt-to-income ratio); lending policies (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the loan-to-value ratio policy of the covered financial institution); or product-related services;</P>
          <P>(ii) In response to a consumer's request, informing a consumer of the loan rates that are publicly available, such as on the covered financial institution's Web site, for specific types of loan products without communicating to the consumer whether qualifications are met for that loan product;</P>
          <P>(iii) Collecting information about a consumer in order to provide the consumer with information on loan products for which the consumer generally may qualify, without presenting a specific loan offer to the consumer for acceptance, either verbally or in writing;</P>
          <P>(iv) Arranging the loan closing or other aspects of the loan process, including communicating with a consumer about those arrangements, provided that communication with the consumer only verifies loan terms already offered or negotiated;</P>
          <P>(v) Providing a consumer with information unrelated to loan terms, such as the best days of the month for scheduling loan closings at the covered financial institution;</P>
          <P>(vi) Making an underwriting decision about whether the consumer qualifies for a loan;</P>
          <P>(vii) Explaining or describing the steps or process that a consumer would need to take in order to obtain a loan offer, including qualifications or criteria that would need to be met without providing guidance specific to that consumer's circumstances; or</P>
          <P>(viii) Communicating on behalf of a mortgage loan originator that a written offer, including disclosures provided pursuant to the Truth in Lending Act, has been sent to a consumer without providing any details of that offer.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Offering or negotiating a loan for compensation or gain.</E> The following examples illustrate when an employee does or does not offer or negotiate terms of a loan “for compensation or gain.”</P>

          <P>(1) Offering or negotiating terms of a loan for compensation or gain includes engaging in any of the activities in paragraph (b)(1) of this appendix in the course of carrying out employment duties, even if the employee does not receive a referral fee or commission or other special compensation for the loan.<PRTPAGE P="369"/>
          </P>
          <P>(2) Offering or negotiating terms of a loan for compensation or gain does not include engaging in a seller-financed transaction for the employee's personal property that does not involve the covered financial institution.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Authority.</E> This part, known as Regulation H, is issued by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection to implement the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008, title V of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (S.A.F.E. Act) (Pub. L. 110-289, 122 Stat. 2654, 12 U.S.C. 5101 <E T="03">et seq.</E>).</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The purpose of this part is to enhance consumer protection and reduce fraud by directing states to adopt minimum uniform standards for the licensing and registration of residential mortgage loan originators and to participate in a nationwide mortgage licensing system and registry database of residential mortgage loan originators. Under the S.A.F.E. Act, if the Bureau determines that a state's loan origination licensing system does not meet the minimum requirements of the S.A.F.E. Act, the Bureau is charged with establishing and implementing a system for all loan originators in that state. Additionally, if at any time the Bureau determines that the nationwide mortgage licensing system and registry is failing to meet the S.A.F.E. Act's requirements, the Bureau is charged with establishing and maintaining a licensing and registry database for loan originators.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Organization.</E> The regulation is divided into subparts and appendices as follows:</P>
          <P>(1) Subpart A establishes the definitions applicable to this part.</P>

          <P>(2) Subpart B provides the minimum standards that a state must meet in licensing loan originators, including <PRTPAGE P="370"/>standards for whom a state must require to be licensed, and sets forth the Bureau's procedure for determining a state's compliance with the minimum standards.</P>
          <P>(3) Subpart C provides the requirements that the Bureau will apply in any state that the Bureau determines has not established a licensing and registration system in compliance with the minimum standards of the S.A.F.E. Act.</P>
          <P>(4) Subpart D provides minimum requirements for the administration of the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry.</P>
          <P>(5) Subpart E clarifies the Bureau's enforcement authority in states in which it operates a state licensing system.</P>
          <P>(6) Appendices A through D set forth examples to aid in the understanding and application of the regulations.</P>

Such information and material may be shared with all state and Federal regulatory officials with mortgage industry oversight authority without the loss of privilege or the loss of confidentiality protections provided by Federal and state laws.</P>
          <P>(b) Information or material that is subject to a privilege or confidentiality under paragraph (a) of this section shall not be subject to:</P>
          <P>(1) Disclosure under any Federal or state law governing the disclosure to the public of information held by an officer or an agency of the Federal Government or the respective state; or</P>
          <P>(2) Subpoena or discovery, or admission into evidence, in any private civil action or administrative process, unless with respect to any privilege held by the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry or by the Director with respect to such information or material, the person to whom such information or material pertains, waives, in whole or in part, in the discretion of such person, that privilege.</P>
          <P>(c) Any state law, including any state open record law, relating to the disclosure of confidential supervisory information or any information or material described in paragraph (a) of this section that is inconsistent with paragraph (a), shall be superseded by the requirements of such provision to the extent that state law provides less confidentiality or a weaker privilege.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Determination of noncompliance.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Evidence of compliance.</E> Any time a state enacts legislation that affects its compliance with the S.A.F.E. Act, it must notify the Bureau. Upon request from the Bureau, a state must provide evidence that it is in compliance with the requirements of the S.A.F.E.

            <EAR>Pt. 1008, App. A</EAR>
            <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix A to Part 1008—Examples of Mortgage Loan Originator Activities</HD>
            <P>This appendix provides examples to aid in the understanding of activities that would cause an individual to fall within or outside the definition of a mortgage loan originator under part 1008. The examples in this appendix are not all-inclusive. They illustrate only the issue described and do not illustrate any other issues that may arise. For purposes of the examples below, the term “loan” refers to a residential mortgage loan as defined in § 1008.23 of this part.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Taking a Loan Application.</E> Taking a residential mortgage loan application within the meaning of § 1008.103(c)(1) means receipt by an individual, for the purpose of facilitating a decision whether to extend an offer of loan terms to a borrower or prospective borrower, of an application as defined in § 1008.23 (a request in any form for an offer, or a response to a solicitation of an offer, of residential mortgage loan terms, and the information about the borrower or prospective borrower that is customary or necessary in a decision whether to make such an offer).</P>
            <P>(1) The following are examples to illustrate when an individual takes, or does not take, a loan application:</P>
            <P>(i) An individual “takes a residential mortgage loan application” even if the individual:</P>
            <P>(A) Has received the borrower or prospective borrower's request or information indirectly. Section 1008.103(c)(1) provides that an individual takes an application, whether he or she receives it “directly or indirectly” from the borrower or prospective borrower. This means that an individual who offers or negotiates residential mortgage loan terms for compensation or gain cannot avoid licensing requirements simply by having another person physically receive the application from the prospective borrower and then pass the application to the individual;</P>
            <P>(B) Is not responsible for verifying information. The fact that an individual who takes application information from a borrower or prospective borrower is not responsible for verifying that information—for example, the individual is a mortgage broker who collects and sends that information to a lender—does not mean that the individual is not taking an application;</P>
            <P>(C) Only inputs the information into an online application or other automated system; or</P>
            <P>(D) Is not involved in approval of the loan, including determining whether the consumer qualifies for the loan. Similar to an individual who is not responsible for verification, an individual can still “take a residential mortgage loan application” even if he or she is not ultimately responsible for approving the loan. A mortgage broker, for example, can take a residential mortgage loan application even though it is passed on to a lender for a decision on whether the borrower qualifies for the loan and for the ultimate loan approval.</P>
            <P>(ii) An individual does not take a loan application merely because the individual performs any of the following actions:</P>
            <P>(A) Receives a loan application through the mail and forwards it, without review, to loan approval personnel. The Bureau interprets the term “takes a residential mortgage loan application” to exclude an individual whose only role with respect to the application is physically handling a completed application form or transmitting a completed form to a lender on behalf of a borrower or prospective borrower. This interpretation is consistent with the definition of “loan originator” in section 1503(3) of the S.A.F.E. Act.</P>
            <P>(B) Assists a borrower or prospective borrower who is filling out an application by explaining the contents of the application and where particular borrower information is to be provided on the application;</P>
            <P>(C) Generally describes for a borrower or prospective borrower the loan application process without a discussion of particular loan products; or</P>
            <P>(D) In response to an inquiry regarding a prequalified offer that a borrower or prospective borrower has received from a lender, collects only basic identifying information about the borrower or prospective borrower on behalf of that lender.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Offering or Negotiating Terms of a Loan.</E> The following examples are designed to illustrate when an individual offers or negotiates terms of a loan within the meaning of § 1008.103(c)(2) and, conversely, what does not constitute offering or negotiating terms of a loan:</P>
            <P>(1) Offering or negotiating the terms of a loan includes:</P>
            <P>(i) Presenting for consideration by a borrower or prospective borrower particular loan terms, whether verbally, in writing, or otherwise, even if:</P>
            <P>(A) Further verification of information is necessary;</P>
            <P>(B) The offer is conditional;</P>
            <P>(C) Other individuals must complete the loan process;</P>
            <P>(D) The individual lacks authority to negotiate the interest rate or other loan terms; or</P>

            <P>(E) The individual lacks authority to bind the person that is the source of the prospective financing.<PRTPAGE P="381"/>
            </P>
            <P>(ii) Communicating directly or indirectly with a borrower or prospective borrower for the purpose of reaching a mutual understanding about prospective residential mortgage loan terms, including responding to a borrower or prospective borrower's request for a different rate or different fees on a pending loan application by presenting to the borrower or prospective borrower a revised loan offer, even if a mutual understanding is not subsequently achieved.</P>
            <P>(2) Offering or negotiating terms of a loan does not include any of the following activities:</P>

            <P>(i) Providing general explanations or descriptions in response to consumer queries, such as explaining loan terminology (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> debt-to-income ratio) or lending policies (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the loan-to-value ratio policy of the lender), or describing product-related services;</P>
            <P>(ii) Arranging the loan closing or other aspects of the loan process, including by communicating with a borrower or prospective borrower about those arrangements, provided that any communication that includes a discussion about loan terms only verifies terms already agreed to by the borrower or prospective borrower;</P>
            <P>(iii) Providing a borrower or prospective borrower with information unrelated to loan terms, such as the best days of the month for scheduling loan closings at the bank;</P>
            <P>(iv) Making an underwriting decision about whether the borrower or prospective borrower qualifies for a loan;</P>
            <P>(v) Explaining or describing the steps that a borrower or prospective borrower would need to take in order to obtain a loan offer, including providing general guidance about qualifications or criteria that would need to be met that is not specific to that borrower or prospective borrower's circumstances;</P>
            <P>(vi) Communicating on behalf of a mortgage loan originator that a written offer has been sent to a borrower or prospective borrower without providing any details of that offer; or</P>
            <P>(vii) Offering or negotiating loan terms solely through a third-party licensed loan originator, so long as the nonlicensed individual does not represent to the public that he or she can or will perform covered activities and does not communicate with the borrower or potential borrower. For example:</P>
            <P>(A) A seller who provides financing to a purchaser of a dwelling owned by that seller in which the offer and negotiation of loan terms with the borrower or prospective borrower is conducted exclusively by a third-party licensed loan originator;</P>
            <P>(B) An individual who works solely for a lender, when the individual offers loan terms exclusively to third-party licensed loan originators and not to borrowers or potential borrowers.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">For Compensation or Gain.</E> (1) An individual acts “for compensation or gain” within the meaning of § 1008.103(c)(2)(ii) if the individual receives or expects to receive in connection with the individual's activities anything of value, including, but not limited to, payment of a salary, bonus, or commission. The concept “anything of value” is interpreted broadly and is not limited only to payments that are contingent upon the closing of a loan.</P>
            <P>(2) An individual does not act “for compensation or gain” if the individual acts as a volunteer without receiving or expecting to receive anything of value in connection with the individual's activities.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix B to Part 1008—Engaging in the Business of a Loan Originator: Commercial Context and Habitualness</HD>
            <P>An individual who acts (or holds himself or herself out as acting) as a loan originator in a commercial context and with some degree of habitualness or repetition is considered to be “engage[d] in the business of a loan originator[.]” An individual who acts as a loan originator does so in a commercial context if the individual acts for the purpose of obtaining anything of value for himself or herself, or for an entity or individual for which the individual acts, rather than exclusively for public, charitable, or family purposes. The habitualness or repetition of the origination activities that is needed to “engage in the business of a loan originator” may be met either if the individual who acts as a loan originator does so with a degree of habitualness or repetition, or if the source of the prospective financing provides mortgage financing or performs other origination activities with a degree of habitualness or repetition. This appendix provides examples to aid in the understanding of activities that would not constitute engaging in the business of a loan originator, such that an individual is not required to obtain and maintain a state mortgage loan originator license. The examples in this appendix are not all-inclusive. They illustrate only the issue described and do not illustrate any other issues that may arise under part 1008. For purposes of the examples below, the term “loan” refers to a “residential mortgage loan” as defined in § 1008.23 of this part.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Not Engaged in the Business of a Mortgage Loan Originator.</E> The following examples illustrate when an individual generally does not “engage in the business of a loan originator”:</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix C to Part 1008—Independent Contractors and Loan Processor and Underwriter Activities That Require a State Mortgage Loan Originator License</HD>
            <P>The examples below are designed to aid in the understanding of loan processing or underwriting activities for which an individual is required to obtain a S.A.F.E. Act-compliant mortgage loan originator license. The examples in this appendix are not all-inclusive. They illustrate only the issue described and do not illustrate any other issues that may arise under part 1008. For purposes of the examples below, the term “loan” refers to a residential mortgage loan as defined in § 1008.23 of this part.</P>
            <P>(a) An individual who is a loan processor or underwriter who must obtain and maintain a state loan originator license includes:</P>
            <P>(1) Any individual who engages in the business of a loan originator, as defined in § 1008.103 of this part;</P>
            <P>(2) Any individual who performs clerical or support duties and who is an independent contractor, as those terms are defined in § 1008.23;</P>
            <P>(3) Any individual who collects, receives, distributes, or analyzes information in connection with the making of a credit decision and who is an independent contractor, as that term is defined in § 1008.23; and</P>
            <P>(4) Any individual who communicates with a consumer to obtain information necessary for making a credit decision and who is an independent contractor, as that term is defined in § 1008.23.</P>
            <P>(b) A state is not required to impose S.A.F.E. Act licensing requirements on any individual loan processor or underwriter who, for example:</P>
            <P>(1) Performs only clerical or support duties (i.e., the loan processor's or underwriter's activities do not include, e.g., offering or negotiating loan rates or terms, or counseling borrowers or prospective borrowers about loan rates or terms), and who performs those clerical or support duties at the direction of and subject to the supervision and instruction of an individual who either: Is licensed and registered in accordance with § 1008.103(a) (state licensing of loan originators); or is not required to be licensed because he or she is excluded from the licensing requirement pursuant to § 1008.103(e)(2) (time-share exclusion), (e)(5)(federally registered loan originator), (e)(6) (government employees exclusion), or (e)(7) (nonprofit exclusion).</P>
            <P>(2) Performs only clerical or support duties as an employee of a mortgage lender or mortgage brokerage firm, and who performs those duties at the direction of and subject to the supervision and instruction of an individual who is employed by the same employer and who is licensed in accordance with § 1008.103(a) (state licensing of loan originators).</P>
            <P>(3) Is an employee of a loan processing or underwriting company that provides loan processing or underwriting services to one or more mortgage lenders or mortgage brokerage firms under a contract between the loan processing or underwriting company and the mortgage lenders or mortgage brokerage firms, provided the employee performs only clerical or support duties and performs those duties only at the direction of and subject to the supervision and instruction of a licensed loan originator employee of the same loan processing and underwriting company.</P>

            <P>(4) Is an individual who does not otherwise perform the activities of a loan originator and is <E T="03">not</E> involved in the receipt, collection, distribution, or analysis of information common for the processing or underwriting of a residential mortgage loan, nor is in communication with the consumer to obtain such information.</P>

            <P>(c) In order to conclude that an individual who performs clerical or support duties is doing so at the direction of and subject to the supervision and instruction of a loan originator who is licensed or registered in accordance with § 1008.103 (or, as applicable, an individual who is excluded from the licensing and registration requirements under § 1008.103(e)(2), (e)(6), or (e)(7)), there must be an actual nexus between the licensed or registered loan originator's (or excluded individual's) direction, supervision, and instruction and the loan processor or underwriter's <PRTPAGE P="383"/>activities. This actual nexus must be more than a nominal relationship on an organizational chart. For example, there is an actual nexus when:</P>
            <P>(1) The supervisory licensed or registered loan originator assigns, authorizes, and monitors the loan processor or underwriter employee's performance of clerical and support duties.</P>
            <P>(2) The supervisory licensed or registered loan originator exercises traditional supervisory responsibilities, including, but not limited to, the training, mentoring, and evaluation of the loan processor or underwriter employee.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix D to Part 1008—Attorneys: Circumstances That Require a State Mortgage Loan Originator License</HD>
            <P>This appendix D clarifies the circumstances in which the S.A.F.E. Act requires a licensed attorney who engages in loan origination activities to obtain a state loan originator license and registration. This special category recognizes limited, heavily regulated activities that meet strict criteria that are different from the criteria for specific exemptions from the S.A.F.E. Act requirements and the exclusions set forth in the regulations and illustrated in other appendices of part 1008.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">S.A.F.E. Act-compliant licensing required.</E> An individual who is a licensed attorney is required to be licensed if the individual is engaged in the business of a loan originator as defined in § 1008.103 and such loan origination activities are not all of the following:</P>
            <P>(1) Considered by the state's court of last resort (or other state governing body responsible for regulating the practice of law) to be part of the authorized practice of law within the state;</P>
            <P>(2) Carried out within an attorney-client relationship; and</P>
            <P>(3) Accomplished by the attorney in compliance with all applicable laws, rules, ethics, and standards.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">S.A.F.E. Act-compliant licensing not required.</E> A licensed attorney performing activities that come within the definition of a loan originator is not required to be licensed, provided that such activities are:</P>
            <P>(1) Considered by the state's court of last resort (or other state governing body responsible for regulating the practice of law) to be part of the authorized practice of law within the state;</P>

          <P>This part, known as Regulation I, is issued by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection. This part applies to all depository institutions lacking Federal deposit insurance.

          <P>
            <E T="03">Lacking Federal deposit insurance</E> means the depository institution is neither an insured depository institution as defined in 12 U.S.C. 1813(c)(2), nor an insured credit union as defined in section 101 of the Federal Credit Union Act, 12 U.S.C. 1752.<PRTPAGE P="384"/>

For example, a notice would comply with the requirement if it conspicuously stated: “[Institution's name] is not federally insured. If it fails, the Federal Government does not guarantee that you will get your money back.” The disclosures required by this section must be clear and conspicuous and presented in a simple and easy to understand format, type size, and manner.</P>

            <P>Except in the case of an exempt transaction, a developer may not sell or lease lots in a subdivision, making use of any means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce, or of the mails, unless a Statement of Record is in effect in accordance with the provisions of this part. In non-exempt transactions, the developer must give each purchaser a printed Property Report, meeting the requirements of this part, in advance of the purchaser's signing of any contract or agreement for sale or lease. Information collection requirements contained in this part have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. 3501 <E T="03">et seq.</E> and have been assigned OMB Control No. 3170-0012.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Exemptions—general.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The exemptions available under §§ 1010.5 through 1010.16 are not applicable when the method of sale, lease or other disposition of land or an interest in land is adopted for the purpose of evasion of the Act.</P>
            <P>(b) With the exception of the sales or leases which are exempt under § 1010.5, the anti-fraud provisions of the Act (15 U.S.C. 1703(a)(2)) apply to exempt transactions. The anti-fraud provisions make it unlawful for a developer or agent to employ any device, scheme, or artifice to:</P>
            <P>(1) Defraud;</P>
            <P>(2) To obtain money or property by means of any untrue statement of a material fact, or</P>
            <P>(3) To omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made not misleading, with respect to any information pertinent to the lot or subdivision; or</P>
            <P>(4) To engage in any transaction, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon a purchaser.</P>
            <P>(c) The anti-fraud provisions of the Act require that certain representations be included in the contract in transactions which are not exempt under § 1010.5. Specifically, the Act requires that if a developer or agent represents that roads, sewers, water, gas or electric service or recreational amenities will be provided or completed by the developer, the contract must stipulate that the services or amenities will be provided or completed.</P>
            <P>(d) Eligibility for exemptions available under §§ 1010.5 through 1010.14 is self-determining. With the exception of the exemptions available under §§ 1010.15 and 1010.16, a developer is not required to file notice with or obtain the approval of the Director in order to take advantage of an exemption. If a developer elects to take advantage of an exemption, the developer is responsible for maintaining records to demonstrate that the requirements of the exemption have been met.</P>

            <P>(e) A developer may present evidence, or otherwise discuss, in an informal <PRTPAGE P="388"/>hearing before the Office of Supervision Examinations, the Bureau's position on the jurisdiction or non-exempt status of a particular subdivision.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Statutory exemptions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>A listing of the statutory exemptions is contained in 15 U.S.C. 1702. In accordance with 15 U.S.C. 1702(a)(2), if the sale involves a condominium or multi-unit construction, a presale clause conditioning the sale of a unit on a certain percentage of sales of other units is permissible if it is legally binding on the parties and is for a period not to exceed 180 days. However, the 180-day provision cannot extend the 2-year period for performance. The permissible 180 days is calculated from the date the first purchaser signs a sales contract in the project or, if a phased project, from the date the first purchaser signs the first sales contract in each phase.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Twelve lot exemption.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The sale of lots is exempt from the registration requirements of the Act if, beginning with the first sale after June 20, 1980, no more than twelve lots in the subdivision are sold in the subsequent twelve-month period. Thereafter, the sale of the first twelve lots is exempt from the registration requirements if no more than twelve lots were sold in each previous twelve month period which began with the anniversary date of the first sale after June 20, 1980.</P>
            <P>(b) A developer may apply to the Director to establish a different twelve month period for use in determining eligibility for the exemption and the Director may allow the change if it is for good cause and consistent with the purpose of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) In determining eligibility for this exemption, all lots sold or leased in the subdivision after June 20, 1980, are counted, whether or not the transactions are otherwise exempt.

            <P>(2) Each purchaser or purchaser's spouse makes a personal, on-the-lot inspection of the lot purchased prior to signing a contract.</P>
            <P>(b) For purposes of this exemption, interruptions such as roads, parks, small bodies of water or recreational facilities do not serve to break the contiguity of parts of a subdivision.</P>

            <P>(a) The sale of lots in a subdivision is exempt from the registration requirements of the Act if, since April 28, 1969, each lot in the subdivision has contained at least twenty acres. In determining eligibility for the exemption, easements for ingress and egress or public utilities are considered part of the total acreage of the lot if the purchaser retains ownership of the property affected by the easement.</P>

            <P>(2) In the promotion of the subdivision there must be no offers, by direct mail or telephone solicitation, of gifts, trips, dinners or use of similar promotional techniques to induce prospective purchasers to visit the subdivision or to purchase a lot.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Lot requirements.</E> (1) The lot must be located within a municipality or county where a unit of local government or the state specifies minimum standards in the following areas for the development of subdivision lots taking place within its boundaries:</P>
            <P>(i) Lot dimensions.</P>

            <P>(vi) Water supply.</P>
            <P>(vii) Sewage disposal.</P>
            <P>(2) Each lot sold under the exemption must be either zoned for single-family residences or, in the absence of a zoning ordinance, limited exclusively by enforceable covenants or restrictions to single-family residences. Manufactured homes, townhouses, and residences for one-to-four family use are considered single-family residences for purposes of this exemption provision.</P>

            <P>(3) The lot must be situated on a paved street or highway which has been built to standards established by the state or the unit of local government in which the subdivision is located. If the roads are to be public roads they must be acceptable to the unit of local government that will be responsible for maintenance. If the street or highway is not complete, the developer must post a bond or other surety acceptable to the municipality or county in the full amount of the cost of completing the street or highway to assure completion to local standards. For purposes of this exemption, <E T="03">paved</E> means concrete or pavement with a bituminous surface that is impervious to water, protects the base and is durable under the traffic load and maintenance contemplated.</P>
            <P>(4) The unit of local government or a homeowners association must have accepted or be obligated to accept the responsibility for maintaining the street or highway upon which the lot is situated. In any case in which a homeowners association has accepted or is obligated to accept maintenance responsibility, the developer must, prior to signing of a contract or agreement to purchase, provide the purchaser with a good faith written estimate of the cost of carrying out the responsibility over the first ten years of ownership.</P>
            <P>(5) At the time of closing, potable water, sanitary sewage disposal, and electricity must be extended to the lot or the unit of local government must be obligated to install the facilities within 180 days following closing. For subdivisions which will not have a central water or sewage disposal system, there must be assurances that an adequate potable water supply is available year-round and that the lot is approved for the installation of a septic tank.</P>
            <P>(6) The contract of sale must require delivery within 180 days after the signing of the sales contract of a warranty deed, which at the time of delivery is free from monetary liens and encumbrances. If a warranty deed is not commonly used in the jurisdiction where the lot is located, a deed or grant which warrants that the seller has not conveyed the lot to another person may be delivered in lieu of a warranty deed. The deed or grant used must warrant that the lot is free from encumbrances made by the seller or any other person claiming by, through, or under the seller.</P>
            <P>(7) At the time of closing, a title insurance binder or title opinion reflecting the condition of title must be in existence and issued or presented to the purchaser showing that, subject only to exceptions which are approved in writing by the purchaser at the time of closing, marketable title to the lot is vested in the seller.</P>

            <P>(1) The sale of lots in the subdivision after December 20, 1979, is restricted solely to residents of the state in which the subdivision is located unless the sale is exempt under § 1010.5, § 1010.11, or § 1010.13.</P>
            <P>(2) The purchaser or purchaser's spouse makes a personal on-the-lot inspection of the lot to be purchased before signing a contract.</P>
            <P>(3) Each contract:</P>
            <P>(i) Specifies the developer's and purchaser's responsibilities for providing and maintaining roads, water and sewer facilities and any existing or promised amenities;</P>
            <P>(ii) Contains a good faith estimate of the year in which the roads, water and sewer facilities and promised amenities will be completed; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Contains a non-waivable provision giving the purchaser the opportunity to revoke the contract until at least midnight of the seventh calendar day following the date the purchaser signed the contract. If the purchaser is entitled to a longer revocation period by operation of state law, that period becomes the Federal revocation period and the contract must reflect the requirements of the longer period.</P>
            <P>(4) The lot being sold is free and clear of all liens, encumbrances and adverse claims except the following:</P>
            <P>(i) Mortgages or deeds of trust which contain release provisions for the individual lot purchased if:</P>
            <P>(A) The contract of sale obligates the developer to deliver, within 180 days, a warranty deed (or its equivalent under local law), which at the time of delivery is free from any monetary liens or encumbrances; and</P>

            <P>(B) The purchaser's payments are deposited in an escrow account independent of the developer until a deed is delivered.<PRTPAGE P="391"/>
            </P>
            <P>(ii) Liens which are subordinate to the leasehold interest and do not affect the lessee's right to use or enjoy the lot.</P>
            <P>(iii) Property reservations which are for the purpose of bringing public services to the land being developed, such as easements for water and sewer lines.</P>
            <P>(iv) Taxes or assessments which constitute liens before they are due and payable if imposed by a state or other public body having authority to assess and tax property or by a property owners' association.</P>
            <P>(v) Beneficial property restrictions that are mutually enforceable by the lot owners in the subdivision. Restrictions, whether separately recorded or incorporated into individual deeds, must be applied uniformly to every lot or group of lots. To be considered beneficial and enforceable, any restriction or covenant that imposes an assessment on lot owners must apply to the developer on the same basis as other lot owners. Developers who maintain control of a subdivision through a Property Owners' Association, Architectural Control Committee, restrictive covenant or otherwise, shall transfer such control to the lot owners no later than when the developer ceases to own a majority of total lots in, or planned for, the subdivision. Relinquishment of developer control shall require affirmative action, usually in the form of an election based upon one vote per lot.</P>
            <P>(vi) Reservations contained in United States land patents and similar Federal grants or reservations.</P>
            <P>(5) Prior to the sale the developer discloses in a written statement to the purchaser all qualifying liens, reservations, taxes, assessments and restrictions applicable to the lot purchased. The developer must obtain a written receipt from the purchaser acknowledging that the statement required by this subparagraph was delivered to the purchaser.</P>

The estimates for unsold lots must be updated every two years or more frequently if the developer has reason to believe that significant cost increases have occurred. The dates on which the estimates were made must be included in the statement. The developer must obtain a written receipt from the purchaser acknowledging that the statement required by this subparagraph was delivered to the purchaser.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Intrastate Exemption Statement.</E> To satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (a)(5) and (6) of this section, an Intrastate Exemption Statement containing the information prescribed in each such paragraph shall be given to each purchaser. A State-approved disclosure document may be used to satisfy this requirement if all the information required by paragraphs (a)(5) and (6) of this section is included in this disclosure. In such a case, the developer must obtain a written receipt from the purchaser and comply with all other requirements of the exemption. To be acceptable for purposes of the exemption, the statement(s) given to purchasers must contain neither advertising nor promotion on behalf of the developer or subdivision nor references to the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection or the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. A sample Intrastate Exemption Statement is included in the exemption guidelines.</P>

            <P>(4) The purchaser or purchaser's spouse makes a personal on-the-lot inspection of the lot to be purchased <PRTPAGE P="392"/>prior to signing a contract or agreement.</P>
            <P>(5) Each contract:</P>

The estimates for unsold lots must be updated every two years, or more frequently if the developer has reason to believe that significant cost <PRTPAGE P="393"/>increases have occurred. The dates on which the estimates were made must be included in the statement.</P>
            <P>(8) The developer executes and gives to the purchaser a written instrument designating a person within the state of residence of the purchaser as the developer's agent for service of process. The developer must also acknowledge in writing that it submits to the legal jurisdiction of the state in which the purchaser or lessee resides.</P>
            <P>(9) The developer executes a written affirmation for each sale made under this exemption.

The basis for issuing a notice may be the conduct of the developer or agent, such as unlawful conduct or insolvency, or adverse information about the lots or real estate that should be disclosed to the purchasers.

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Eligibility requirements.</E> The sale of each lot must meet the following requirements to be eligible for this exemption.</P>
            <P>(1) The lot is sold “as is” with all advertised improvements and amenities completed and in the condition advertised.</P>

            <P>(4) At the time of closing, a title insurance binder or title opinion reflecting the condition of title must be issued to the purchaser showing that, subject only to exceptions approved in writing by the purchaser at the time of closing, marketable title is vested in the seller.</P>

The revocation provisions may not be limited or qualified in the contract or other document by requiring a specific type of notice or by requiring that notice be given at a specified place.</P>
            <P>(ii) Obligate the developer to deliver, within 180 days, a warranty deed (or its equivalent under local law) for the lot which at the time of delivery is free from any monetary liens or encumbrances.</P>
            <P>(6) The purchaser or purchaser's spouse makes a personal on-the-lot inspection of the lot to be purchased before signing a contract.</P>

This Statement will also contain the name, address and telephone number of the suppliers which would or could provide the foregoing services.</P>
            <P>(10) The lot sale must comply with the anti-fraud provisions of 12 CFR 1010.4(b) and (c) and the sales practices and standards in §§ 1011.10 through 1011.28.</P>

The Statement must be typed or printed in at least 10 point font. A copy of the acknowledgement will be maintained by the developer for three years and will be made available to ILSRP upon request. If the Statement is not delivered as required, the contract or agreement of sale may be revoked and a full refund paid, at the option of the purchaser, within two years of the signing date and the contract or agreement of sale will clearly provide this right. A sample format for the Statement is provided in section III of the appendix to this part: Sample Lot Information Statement and Sample Receipt.<PRTPAGE P="395"/>

The report will describe any changes in the information provided in the Request for the Multiple Site Subdivision Exemption or contain a statement that there are no changes.</P>

The basis for issuing a notice may be apparent omissions or misrepresentations in the documents submitted to the Director, the conduct of the developer or agent, such as unlawful conduct or insolvency, or adverse information about the real estate that should be disclosed to purchasers.

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Suspension of effective date by developer.</E> (1) A developer, or owner, may request that the effective date of its Statement of Record be suspended, provided there are no administrative proceedings pending against either of them at the time the request is submitted. The request must include any consolidations or amendments which have been made to the initial Statement of Record and may be submitted via the electronic means of submission described in § 1010.20(a). Forms for this purpose will be furnished by the Director upon request.</P>
            <P>(2) Upon acceptance by the Director, the effectiveness of the Statement of Record shall be suspended as of the date the request was executed by the developer or owner.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Initial Statement of Record.</E> (1) Except in the case of exempt transactions, an initial Statement of Record shall be filed, and an effective date issued, prior to selling or leasing any lot in a subdivision.</P>
            <P>(2) If a developer buys from another developer 100 or more lots from an existing registration, the new developer, or owner, may have to submit a new initial Statement of Record and receive an effective date covering the acquired lots prior to selling or leasing any of those lots.</P>
            <P>(3) Changes in principals due to a sale of stock in a corporation or changes in partners or joint venturers which are accomplished in accordance with the partnership or joint venture agreement but which do not cause a change in the title to the land in the subdivision may be submitted as an amendment.</P>

            <P>(4) Any initial Statement of Record must be accompanied by a fee, as specified in § 1010.35(b), based upon the number of lots sought to be registered.<PRTPAGE P="398"/>
            </P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Consolidated Statement of Record.</E> (1) If the developer intends to sell or lease additional lots as part of the same common promotional plan with lots already registered, a consolidated Statement of Record may be submitted for the additional lots. A fee, as specified in § 1010.35(b) and based on the number of additional lots, must accompany the submission. The additional lots may not be sold or leased until a new effective date is issued.</P>
            <P>(2) If the additional lots are simply the result of a replatting of lots previously registered and enumerated in the Property Report and do not include any additional land, the change may be made by an amendment. However, the amendment must be accompanied by a fee, as specified in § 1010.35(b), based on the number of additional lots.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Consolidated Statement of Record—Form.</E> A consolidated Statement of Record shall contain the elements listed in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section. Pages having no changes and documents in previous submissions which apply equally to the additional lots may be included by reference. However, the developer may, at its option, submit the entire format for an initial filing, including copies of previously submitted documents, to expedite the examination process.</P>
            <P>(1) Those pages of the Property Report portion and Additional Information and Documentation portion which contain changes which have occurred since the last effective submission, and</P>
            <P>(2) A recapitulation or listing of each of the section headings, and subheadings if necessary, of the Additional Information and Documentation portion. Each item of the listing shall contain a statement as to whether or not any change is made in the section; whether any new or additional information is being submitted and, if documentation is added by cross reference, the previous submission in which that documentation may be found, and</P>
            <P>(3) Documentation to support the additional lots (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> plat maps, topographic maps and general plan to reflect new lots, title information, permits for additional facilities, financial assurances of completion of additional facilities, financial statements) or updated or expanded documents in support of previous submissions, and</P>

            <P>(d) <E T="03">Consolidated Statement of Record amends prior Statement of Record.</E> A Consolidated Statement of Record shall contain all applicable information for all registered lots in the subdivision except those deleted pursuant to other provisions in these regulations. The resulting Property Report shall be used for all sales in the subdivision, except for those transactions which are exempt from the provisions of the Act or which have been granted an exempt status by the Director, unless the Director has specifically authorized the use of multiple Property Reports.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Initial Statement of Record—when prior approval to submit is required.</E> In those subdivisions where there is a disparity between the lots already registered and those sought to be registered because of location, terrain, proposed use of the lots or the amenities to be furnished or available, the developer may present a resume of the differences and request the Director's permission to file a separate initial Statement of Record for the additional lots. Upon consideration of the facts submitted, the Director may allow such a procedure.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Lots which have been deleted from registration.</E> Should the developer, for any reason, delete by amendment any registered lots from an effective Statement of Record, those lots must be reregistered by a consolidation and a new effective date issued, before they can be sold or leased. An appropriate fee must accompany the submission.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Lots sold to individual purchasers.</E> It is not necessary to delete from the registration those lots which have been sold to individual purchasers for their own use.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Suspension notice—prior to effective date.</E> (1) If it appears to the Director that a Statement of Record or an amendment is on its face incomplete or inaccurate in any material respect, the Director shall so advise the developer, by issuing a suspension notice, within a reasonable time after the filing of such materials but prior to the time the materials would otherwise be effective.<PRTPAGE P="400"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) A suspension notice issued pursuant to this subsection shall suspend the effective date of the Statement of Record or the amendment. It shall continue in effect until 30 days, or such earlier date as the Director may determine, after the necessary amendments are submitted which correct all deficiencies cited in the notice.</P>
            <P>(3) Upon receipt of a suspension notice, the developer has 15 days in which to request a hearing. If a hearing is requested, it shall be held within 20 days of the receipt of the request by the Director.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Suspension orders—subsequent to effective date.</E> (1) A notice of proceedings to suspend an effective Statement of Record may be issued to a developer if the Director has reasonable grounds to believe that an effective Statement of Record includes an untrue statement of a material fact, or omits a material fact required by the Act or rules and regulations, or omits a material fact which is necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. The Director may, after notice, and after opportunity for a hearing requested pursuant to § 1012.220 within 15 days of receipt of such notice, issue an order suspending the Statement of Record. In the event that a suspension order is issued, such order shall remain in effect until the developer has amended the Statement of Record or otherwise complied with the requirements of the order. When the developer has complied with the requirements of the order, the Director shall so declare and thereupon the suspension order shall cease to be effective.</P>
            <P>(2) If the Director undertakes an examination of a developer or its records to determine whether a suspension order should be issued, and the developer fails to cooperate with the Director or obstructs, or refuses to permit the Director to make such examination, the Director may issue an order suspending the Statement of Record. Such order shall remain in effect until the developer has complied with the requirements of the order. When the developer has complied with the requirements of the order, the Director shall so declare and thereupon the suspension order shall cease to be effective. In accordance with the procedure described in § 1012.235, a hearing may be requested.</P>
            <P>(3) Upon receipt of an amendment to an effective Statement of Record, the Director may issue an order suspending the Statement of Record until the amendment becomes effective if the Director has reasonable grounds to believe that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of purchasers. In accordance with the procedure described in § 1012.235, a hearing may be requested.</P>
            <P>(4) Suspension orders issued pursuant to this subsection shall operate to suspend the Statement of Record as of the date the order is either served on the developer or its registered agent or is delivered by certified or registered mail to the address of the developer or its authorized agent.</P>

            <SUBJECT>General instructions for completing the Statement of Record.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Paper and type.</E> The Statement of Record shall be on good quality, unglazed white or pastel paper. Letter size paper, approximately 8<FR>1/2</FR> × 11 inches in size, will be used for the Property Report portion, and either letter size paper, approximately 8<FR>1/2</FR> × 11 inches in size, or legal size paper, approximately 8<FR>1/2</FR> × 14 inches in size, will be used for the Additional Information and Documentation portion. Side margins shall be no less than 1 inch and no greater than 1<FR>1/2</FR> inches. Top and bottom margins shall be no less than 1 inch. In the preparation of the charts to be included in the Property Report, the developer may vary from the above <PRTPAGE P="401"/>margin requirements or print the charts lengthwise on the required size paper if such measures are necessary to make the charts readable. The Statement of Record shall be prepared in an easily readable, uniform font.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Numbering and dating.</E> Each page of the Statement of Record as submitted to ILSRP shall be numbered and shall include the date of typing or preparation in the lower right hand corner, except in the final printed version of the Property Report portion.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Signing.</E> The Statement of Record shall be signed by the senior executive officer of the developer or a designated agent.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Printing.</E> The Statement of Record and, insofar as practical, all papers and documents filed as a part thereof, shall be printed, lithographed, photocopied, typewritten or prepared by any similar process which, in the opinion of the Director, produces copies suitable for a permanent record. Irrespective of the process used, all copies of any such materials shall be clear and easily readable.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Headings, subheadings, captions, introductory paragraphs, warnings.</E> Property Report subject “headings” are those descriptive introductory words which appear immediately after section numbers 1010.106 through 1010.116 (<E T="03">e.g.</E> § 1010.108 has “General Information” and § 1010.111 has “Utilities”). Each such heading shall be printed in the Property Report in underlined capital letters and centered at the top of a new page. Section numbers shall not be printed in the Property Report. Property Report subheadings are those descriptive introductory words which appear in italics in the regulations at the beginning of paragraphs designated by paragraph letters (a), (b), (c) etc. An example of a subheading is “water” found immediately after the paragraph letter (a) in § 1010.111. These subheadings will be printed in the Property Report only if they are relevant to the subject subdivision. If printed these subheadings shall be capitalized and shall begin at the left hand margin of the page. Property Report “captions” are those descriptive introductory words which appear in italics in the Regulations at the beginning of paragraphs designated by numbers (1), (2), (3), etc. An example of such captions is “Sales Contract and Delivery of Deed” found immediately after the paragraph number “(1)” in § 1010.109(b). These captions are to be printed in the Property Report only if they are applicable to the subject subdivision. If printed, these captions shall be centered on the page from the side margins, and shall have only the first letter of each word capitalized. Headings and subheadings will be used in the Property Report in accordance with the sample page appearing in section IX of the appendix to this part. Introductory paragraphs will follow headings if they are applicable and necessary for a readable entry into the subject matters, but note, the introductory paragraphs for “Title to the Property and Land Use” are to be used in every case as provided in § 1010.109(a)(1). Subheadings and captions which do not apply to the subdivision should be omitted from the Property Report portion and answered “not applicable” in the Additional Information and Documentation portion, unless specifically required to be included elsewhere in these instructions. Warnings shall be printed substantially as they appear in the instructions in §§ 1010.105 through 1010.118. They shall be printed in capital letters and may be enclosed in a box. The paragraphs in the Property Report portion need not be numbered. A sample page is set forth in section IX of the appendix to this part: Sample Page for Statement of Record.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Language style.</E> All information given in the Property Report portion shall be stated in narrative form using plain, concise, everyday language which can be readily understood by purchasers who are unfamiliar with real estate transactions. Excessively long paragraphs should be avoided. Keep them as brief as possible. Use separate paragraphs for different points discussed. Disclose all pertinent facts. Potential consequences to a purchaser must be made clear even though not specifically asked for in the format and the instructions. In the Property Report the pronouns “you” and “your” shall generally be used in referring to <PRTPAGE P="402"/>the prospective purchaser and the pronouns “we,” “us,” and “our” shall generally be used in referring to the developer. The Director specifically reserves the right to require modification of the text when the narrative does not meet the standards of this section.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Format of the Additional Information and Documentation portion of the Statement of Record.</E> The supporting information and documentation required by these regulations shall be identified by affixing a tab on the right side of the cover sheet of the required information or documentation and by identifying on the tab the section number of the Statement of Record instructions to which the information or documentation corresponds. This information or documentation shall then be placed immediately after the page(s) on which the section number and answers for that section appear. If the data in a document is applicable to more than one section of instructions, the developer may substitute as a document in the second case a statement incorporating the earlier document. Deeds, title policies, subdivision plats or maps and other documentary information required to be contained in the Additional Information and Documentation portion of the Statement of Record need not be on the same size paper as the Statement of Record but, if larger, shall be folded to a size no larger than 8<FR>1/2</FR> × 14 inches. Supporting documents shall be inserted into the binding in such a manner as to permit them to be examined without the necessity of removing them from the binding. This may be accomplished by proper folding or through the use of envelopes.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Ordering.</E> The Statement of Record shall be filed with the Property Report portion on top, including any documents which may be required to be attached when delivered to the purchaser, followed by the Additional Information and Documentation portion.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Advertising and promotional material.</E> No advertising, or promotional material or statements which are self-serving on behalf of the developer or owner may be included in the Statement of Record or resulting Property Report.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Additional information.</E> (1) In addition to the information expressly required to be stated in the Statement of Record, there shall be added, and the Director may require, such further material information, documentation and certification as may be necessary in the public interest and for the protection of purchasers or necessary in order to make the statements not misleading in the light of circumstances under which they are made.</P>
            <P>(2) The instructions are not all inclusive. The developer shall include any other facts which would have a bearing upon the use by the purchaser of any of the facilities, services or amenities; which would cause or result in additional expenses to the purchaser; which would have an effect upon the use and enjoyment of the lot by the purchaser for the purpose for which it is sold or which would adversely affect the value of the lot.</P>
            <P>(k) <E T="03">Modification of format or content.</E> The Director may require or permit modification to the content and format of the Property Report to include additional information, to modify or omit required information, or to change the sequence or position of information when such changes are deemed to be in the public interest or for the protection of purchasers.</P>
            <P>(l) <E T="03">Required documentation.</E> Where the documentation required by the Statement of Record cannot be obtained, the Director may permit the best available alternative documentation to be substituted.</P>
            <P>(m) <E T="03">Final version of Property Report.</E> On the date that a Statement of Record becomes effective, the Property Report portion shall become the Property Report for the subject subdivision. The version of the Property Report delivered to prospective lot purchasers shall be verbatim to that found effective by the Director and shall have no covers, pictures, emblems, logograms or identifying insignia other than as required by these regulations. It shall meet the same standards as to grade of paper, type size, margins, style and color of print as those set herein for the Statement of Record, except where required otherwise by these regulations. However, the date of typing or preparation of the pages and the <PRTPAGE P="403"/>ILSRP number shall not appear in the final version. If the final version of the Property Report is commercially printed, or photocopied by a process which results in a commercial printing quality, and is bound on the left side, both sides of the pages may be used for printed material. If it is typed or photocopied by a process which does not result in a clear and legible product on both sides of the page or is bound at the top, printing shall be done on only one side of the page. If a Statement of Record is filed with the Bureau via electronic means pursuant to § 1010.20(a), the version of the Property Report delivered to prospective lot purchasers shall meet the same standards that apply under these regulations to a Statement of Record not filed with the Bureau via electronic means. One copy of the final version of the Property Report, in the exact form in which it is delivered to prospective lot purchasers, shall be sent to ILSRP Office within 20 days of the date on which the Statement of Record, amendment, or consolidation is allowed to become effective by the Director. If a Property Report in a foreign language is used as required by § 1011.25(g), a copy of that Property Report together with a copy of the translated documents shall be furnished the Director within 20 days of the date on which the advertising is first used. A Property Report prepared pursuant to these regulations shall not be distributed to potential lot purchasers until after the Statement of Record of which it is a part or any amendment to that Statement of Record has been made effective by the Director.</P>

            <P>(a) If the developer represents either orally or in writing that it will provide or complete roads or facilities for water, sewer, gas, electricity or recreational amenities, it must be contractually obligated to do so, and the obligation shall be clearly stated in the Property Report. While the developer may disclose relevant facts about completion, the obligation to complete cannot be conditioned, other than as permitted by 15 U.S.C. 1703(a)(2), and an estimated completion date (month and year) must be stated in the Property Report. However, a developer that has only tentative plans to complete may so state in the Property Report, provided that the statement clearly identifies conditions to which the completion of the facilities are subject and states that there are no guarantees the facilities will be completed.</P>
            <P>(b) If a party other than the developer is responsible for providing or completing roads or facilities for water, sewer, gas, electricity or recreational amenities, that entity shall be clearly identified in the Property Report under the categories described in § 1010.110, § 1010.111 or § 1010.114, as applicable. A statement shall be included in the proper section of the Property Report that the developer is not responsible for providing or completing the facility or amenity and can give no assurance that it will be completed or available for use.</P>

            <P>(iii) If there are restrictive covenants, whether recorded or unrecorded, the following statement shall be made: “A complete copy of these restrictions is available upon request.”</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Easements.</E> (i) Are there easements which may have an effect on the purchaser's building or lot use plans (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> large drainage easements along lot lines, high voltage electric transmission lines, pipe lines or drainage easements which encroach upon the building area of the lot or inhibit its use)?</P>
            <P>(ii) Is the subdivision subject to any type of flood control or flowage easements?</P>
            <P>(iii) If the answer to either (2)(i) or (2)(ii) is in the affirmative, identify the affected lots and state the effect upon the use of the lots.</P>

If they have not been recorded, is the description of the lots given in this Report legally adequate for the conveyance of land in the jurisdiction where the subdivision is located? If it is not, include a statement to the effect that the description of the lots is not legally adequate for the conveyance of the lots and that it will not be until the plat is recorded.</P>

For purposes of paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(C) of this section, the Director will consider the aggregate sales prices of only the lots yet to be sold, and may consider whether any additions to the subdivisions or reacquisitions of lots already sold would be likely to cause the dollar limits to be exceeded.</P>
            <P>(i) The aggregate sales prices of the lots yet to be sold in the subdivision has been reduced to less than $1,500,000.00, and that it will not exceed this amount through further additions to the subdivision, or through the reacquisition of lots already sold, and;</P>
            <P>(ii) The sales contract provides for delivery of a deed within 120 days of the date of the contract which conveys title free and clear of any mortgage or lien or the developer files an Assurance of Title Agreement with ILSRP, and;</P>

            <P>(iv) The developer then qualifies for exception (e)(3)(iii) or (iv) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) The Director may allow a developer, who has made sales prior to registration, to submit unaudited statements under the provisions of paragraph (j)(1)(i) of this section. The developer must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Director that the acceptance of unaudited statements would not be a detriment to the public interest or to the protection of purchasers.</P>

            <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) This subpart establishes procedures and criteria for certifying state land sale or lease disclosure programs and state land development standards programs. The purpose of State Certification is to lessen the administrative burden on the individual developer, arising where there are duplicative state and Federal registration and disclosure requirements, without affecting the level of protection given to the individual purchaser or lessee. If the Director determines that a state has adopted and is effectively administering a program that gives purchasers and lessees the same level of protection given to them by the Interstate Land Sales Registration Program, then the Director shall certify that state. Developers who accomplish an effective registration with a state in which the land is located after the Director has certified the state may satisfy the registration requirements of the Director by filing with the Director materials designated by agreement with certified states in lieu of the Federal Statement of Record and Property Report.</P>
            <P>(b) A state that is certified by the Director shall be known as the situs certified state for all land located within its borders.</P>
            <P>(c) After a developer is effectively registered with the Director through a certified state, the Director has the same authority over that developer as the Director has over developers who file directly with the Director. This includes the authority to subpoena information and to examine, evaluate and suspend a developer's registration under sections 1407(d) and (e) of the Act and § 1010.45(b)(1) and (b)(2) of these regulations.</P>
            <P>(d) The prohibitions against the use of the Property Report contained in § 1010.29 apply to state disclosure materials and substantive development standards. In addition, for purposes of this paragraph, references made to the Director, ILSRP and the Bureau in § 1010.29 will include a reference to the equivalent state officer or agency.</P>

            <P>(e) The Purchaser's Revocation Rights, Sales Practices and Standards rules contained in part 1011 of these regulations apply to developers who register with the Director through certified States. All of the rules in part 1011 apply, excepting the disclaimer statement in § 1011.50(a) which is modified to read as follows: “Obtain the Property Report or its equivalent, required by Federal and State law and read it before signing anything. No Federal or State agency has judged the <PRTPAGE P="432"/>merits or value, if any, of this property.”</P>
            <P>(f) Developers are obliged to pay filing fees as set forth in § 1010.35 of this part.</P>

            <P>(a) If the Director determines that a state qualifies for certification under this subpart, the Director shall so notify the state in writing. The state will be effectively certified under the section and as of the date specified in the notice.</P>
            <P>(b) If the Director determines that a state does not meet the standards for certification, the Director shall so notify the state in writing. The notice will specify particular changes in state law, regulations or administration that are needed to obtain certification. The Director shall not be bound in advance to certify a state that makes the suggested changes if other deficiencies become apparent at a later time.</P>

            <P>(c) The Director's final determination to accept or reject a State's Application for Certification of Land Sales Program shall be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(d) A state's certification will remain in effect until it is voluntarily suspended by the state or withdrawn by the Director. A state can voluntarily suspend its certification by notifying the Director in writing. The suspension will take effect as of the date and time specified in the notice to the Director, or upon receipt by the Director if no date is specified. The Director may withdraw certification as provided in § 1010.505.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Cooperation among certified states and between certified states and the Director.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) By filing an Application for Certification of State Land Sales Program pursuant to this subpart, a state agrees that, if it is certified by the Director, it will:</P>
            <P>(1) Accept for filing and allow to be distributed as the sole disclosure document, a disclosure document currently in effect in the situs certified state. Only those documents filed with the situs state after certification by the Director must automatically be accepted by other certified states;</P>
            <P>(2) Certify copies of all disclosure documents, amendments and consolidations filed with it by developers of land located within its borders for and as needed by developers required to submit certified copies to the Director and all other certified states. The certification shall indicate whether the documents are currently in effect. The certification should be in the format set forth in section XXIX of the appendix to this part: Form for Certification for Disclosure Documents.</P>
            <P>(3) Assist and cooperate with the Director and other certified states by requiring that developers of land within its borders amend disclosure documents if any change occurs in any representation of material fact required to be stated in the disclosure documents, including a change resulting from the developer's compliance with the requirements of the law in another certified state. The state shall require developers to send certified copies of the amended documents to the Director and requesting certified states. All amendments to such materials, which reflect changes in material facts regarding the subdivision, shall be submitted to the situs certified state authorities within 15 days of the date on which the developer knows, or should have known, of such change. Certified copies of the disclosure documents shall be submitted by the developer to the Director and the other certified states within 15 days after it becomes effective under the situs certified state laws.</P>
            <P>(4) Continue to effectively operate its Land Sales Program as that Program is described in the Application for Certification and as it was certified by the Director.</P>

            <P>(5) Assist and cooperate with the Director by monitoring the sales practices of developers registered with it directly or through another certified state, and by reporting to the Director any violations of the Act, including but not limited to the required contract provisions, revocation rights and anti-fraud provisions of 15 U.S.C. 1703, or the regulations.<PRTPAGE P="433"/>
            </P>
            <P>(b) A state required to accept the disclosure documents of another situs certified state pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, may, in its discretion, require the developer to furnish it with copies certified pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) No state shall be prevented from establishing substantive or disclosure requirements which exceed the Federal standard provided that such requirements are not in conflict with the Act or these regulations. For example, a certified state may impose additional disclosure requirements on developers of land located within its borders but may not impose additional disclosure requirements on developers whose disclosure documents it is required to accept pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section. However, a certified state may impose additional nondisclosure requirements on out of state developers even though the developer is registered in the certified state in which the land is located.</P>
            <P>(d) After a developer is effectively registered with a certified state through a situs certified state, either or both certified states may exercise full enforcement authorities and powers over that developer according to applicable law and regulations.</P>
            <P>(e) The Director shall cooperate with the certified states by offering a forum for nonbinding arbitration of disputes between two or more certified States arising out of the State Certification Program.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Withdrawal of state certification.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The Director shall periodically review the laws, regulations and administration thereof, of a certified state. If the Director finds that, taken as a whole, the laws, regulations or administration thereof, no longer meet the requirements of subpart C, then the Director may issue a notice to withdraw the certification of that state.</P>
            <P>(b) The notice of proceedings to withdraw a state's certification will be issued to the state by the Director pursuant to § 1012.236. The Director may, after notice and after an opportunity for a hearing, pursuant to § 1012.237, issue an order withdrawing certification. In the event that a withdrawal order is issued, the order shall remain in effect until the state has amended its laws, regulations or the administration thereof or has otherwise complied with the requirements of the order. When the state has complied with the requirements of the order, the Director shall so declare and the withdrawal order shall cease to be effective.</P>

            <P>(c) Withdrawal orders issued pursuant to this subsection will be effective as of the date the order is received by the state. The withdrawal order shall be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>

            <P>(a)(1) If the Director has certified a state under this subpart, the Director shall accept for filing disclosure materials or other acceptable documents which have been approved by the certified state within which the subdivision is located. Only those filings made by the developer with the state after the state was certified by the Director shall be automatically accepted by the Director.</P>
            <P>(2) Retroactive application of the effectiveness of state's certification to a specified date may be granted on a state-by-state basis, where the Director determines that retroactive application will not result in automatic Federal registration of any state filing that has not met the requirements of the certified state laws.</P>
            <P>(b) For a developer to be registered with the Director, the developer shall file with the Director a state certified copy of the Property Report or its equivalent, and any other documentation as stipulated in the Director's Notice of Certification to the state.</P>

            <P>(c) The documents and materials filed under paragraph (b) of this section will be automatically effective as the Federal Statement of Record and Property Report after these materials and the proper filing fee have been received by the Director.<PRTPAGE P="434"/>
            </P>
            <P>(d) The Director has authority pursuant to § 1010.45(b)(1) and (b)(2) to suspend individual filings which fail to meet the requirements of the certified state's law or regulations or the standards in the certification agreement whether or not the state agency has initiated a similar action.</P>
            <P>(e)(1) State accepted materials filed with the Director pursuant to this section must be amended to reflect any amendment to such materials made effective by the state. All amendments to such materials must be submitted to the Director within 15 days after becoming effective under the applicable state laws. Amendments are automatically effective upon their receipt by the Director and the provisions of § 1010.45(b)(1) and (2) apply to amendments filed under this section.</P>
            <P>(2) Amendments shall include or be accompanied by:</P>
            <P>(i) A letter from the developer giving a narrative statement fully explaining the purpose and significance of the amendment and referring to that section and page of the material which is being amended, and;</P>
            <P>(ii) A signed state acceptance certification substantially the same as that required by § 1010.504(a)(2).</P>
            <P>(f) If a certified state suspends the registration of a particular subdivision for any reason, the subdivision's Federal registration with the Director shall be automatically suspended as a result of the state action. No action need be taken by the Director to effect the suspension.</P>
            <P>(g) A state is certified only with regard to land located within the state borders. The Director is not required to accept filings which have been accepted by a certified state if the land which is the subject of the filing is not located within that certified state. For example, if State A is certified by the Director and State B is not, the Director is not required to accept filings from State B simply because State A accepts filings from State B.</P>

            <P>The developer has obtained a regulatory exemption from registration under the Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act. One requirement of that exemption is that you must receive this Statement prior to the time you sign an agreement (contract) to purchase a lot.</P>

            <P>(Under this heading the developer is to list the following information:)</P>
            <P>There are certain risks in purchasing real estate that you should be aware of. The following are some of those risks:</P>
            <P>The future value of land is uncertain and dependent upon many factors. Do not expect all land to automatically increase in value.</P>
            <P>Any value which your lot may have will be affected if roads, utilities and/or amenities cannot be completed or maintained.</P>
            <P>Any development will likely have some impact on the surrounding environment. Development which adversely affects the environment may cause governmental agencies to impose restriction on the use of the land.</P>
            <P>In the purchase of real estate, many technical requirements must be met to assure that you receive proper title and that you will be able to use the land for its intended purpose. Since this purchase involves a major expenditure of money, it is recommended that you seek professional advice before you obligate yourself.</P>
            <P>If adequate provisions have not been made for maintenance of the roads or if the land is not served by publicly maintained roads, you may have to maintain the roads at your expense.</P>
            <P>If the land is not served by a central sewage system and/or water system, you should contact the local authorities to determine whether a permit will be given for an on-site sewage disposal system and/or well and whether there is an adequate supply of water. You should also become familiar with the requirements for, and the cost of, obtaining electrical service to the lot.</P>

            <P>This road is maintained by Bottineau County with County funds. No improvements are planned at this time.</P>
            <P>ACCESS WITHIN THE SUBDIVISION.</P>
            <P>The roads within the subdivision will be located on rights of way dedicated to the public.</P>

            <P>We are responsible for constructing the interior roads. There will be no additional cost to you for this construction.<PRTPAGE P="440"/>
            </P>
            <P>WE HAVE NOT SET ASIDE ANY FUNDS IN AN ESCROW OR TRUST ACCOUNT OR MADE ANY OTHER FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS TO ASSURE COMPLETION OF THE ROADS, SO THERE IS NO ASSURANCE WE WILL BE ABLE TO COMPLETE THE ROADS.</P>
            <P>At present, the roads are under construction and do not provide access to the lots in Units 2 and 3 during wet weather. The succeeding chart describes their present condition and estimated completion dates.</P>

            <P>(4) Any subdivision will have an impact on the surrounding environment. Whether or not the impact is adverse and the degree of impact, will depend on the location, size, planning and extent of development. Subdivisions which adversely affect the environment may cause governmental agencies to impose restrictions on the use of the land. Changes in plant and animal life, air and water quality and noise levels may affect your use and enjoyment of your lot and your ability to sell it.</P>
            <P>(5) In the purchase of real estate, many technical requirements must be met to assure that you receive proper title. Since this purchase involves a major expenditure of money, it is recommended that you seek professional advice before you obligate yourself.</P>

            <P>The purpose of this subpart A is to elaborate on the revocation rights in 15 U.S.C. 1703, by enumerating certain conditions under which purchasers may exercise revocation rights.

            <P>All purchasers have the option to revoke a contract or lease with regard to a lot not exempt under §§ 1010.5 through 1010.11 and 1010.14 until midnight of the seventh day after the day that the purchaser signs a contract or lease. If a purchaser is entitled to a longer revocation period under state law, that period is deemed the Federal revocation period rather than the 7 days, and all contracts and agreements (including promissory notes) shall so state.</P>

            <P>(a) In accordance with 15 U.S.C. 1703(d)(3), the refund to the purchaser is calculated by subtracting from the amount described in 15 U.S.C. 1703(d)(3)(B), the greater of:</P>
            <P>(1) Fifteen percent of the purchase or lease price of the lot (excluding interest owed) at the time of the default or breach of contract or agreement; or</P>
            <P>(2) The amount of damages incurred by the seller or lessor due to the default or breach of contract.</P>

However, no damages may be specified in the contract or agreement, except a liquidated damages clause not exceeding 15 percent of the purchase price of the lot, excluding any interest owed.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Purchase price</E> means the cash sales price of the lot shown on the contract.</P>
            <P>(c) The contractual requirements of 15 U.S.C. 1703(d) do not apply to the sale of a lot for which, within 180 days after the signing of the sales contract, the purchaser receives a warranty deed or, where warranty deeds are not commonly used, its equivalent under state law.</P>

            <P>If a purchaser exercises rights under 15 U.S.C. 1703(b), (c), or (d), but cannot reconvey the lot in substantially similar condition, the developer may subtract from the amount paid by the purchaser, and otherwise due to the purchaser under 15 U.S.C. 1703, any diminished value in the lot caused by the acts of the purchaser.</P>

            <P>(a) The contractual covenant to provide or complete the services or amenities may be conditioned only upon grounds that are legally sufficient to establish impossibility of performance in the jurisdiction where the services or amenities are being provided or completed;<PRTPAGE P="445"/>
            </P>
            <P>(b) Contingencies such as acts of God, strikes, or material shortages are recognized as permissible to defer completion of services or amenities; and</P>
            <P>(c) In creating these contractual obligations developers have the option of incorporating by reference the Property Report in effect at the time of the sale or lease. If a developer chooses to incorporate the Property Report by reference, the effective date of the Property Report being included by reference must be specified in the contract of sale or lease.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Unlawful sales practices—regulatory provisions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>In selling, leasing or offering to sell or lease any lot in a subdivision it is an unlawful sales practice for any developer or agent, directly or indirectly, to:</P>
            <P>(a) Give the Property Report to a purchaser along with other materials when done in such a manner so as to conceal the Property Report from the purchaser.</P>
            <P>(b) Give a contract to a purchaser or encourage him to sign anything before delivery of the Property Report.</P>
            <P>(c) Refer to the Property Report or Offering Statement as anything other than a Property Report or Offering Statement.</P>
            <P>(d) Use any misleading practice, device or representation which would deny a purchaser any cancellation or refund rights or privileges granted the purchaser by the terms of a contract or any other document used by the developer as a sales inducement.</P>
            <P>(e) Refuse to deliver a Property Report to any person who exhibits an interest in buying or leasing a lot in the subdivision and requests a copy of the Property Report.</P>
            <P>(f) Use a Property Report, note, contract, deed or other document prepared in a language other than that in which the sales campaign is conducted, unless an accurate translation is attached to the document.</P>
            <P>(g) Deliberately fail to maintain a sufficient supply of restrictive covenants and financial statements or to deliver a copy to a purchaser upon request as required by §§ 1010.109(f), 1010.112(d), 1010.209(g), and 1010.212(i).</P>
            <P>(h) Use, as a sales inducement, any representation that any lot has good investment potential or will increase in value unless it can be established, in writing, that:</P>
            <P>(1) Comparable lots or parcels in the subdivision have, in fact, been resold by their owners on the open market at a profit, or;</P>
            <P>(2) There is a factual basis for the represented future increase in value and the factual basis is certain, and;</P>
            <P>(3) The sales price of the offered lot does not already reflect the anticipated increase in value due to any promised facilities or amenities. The burden of establishing the relevancy of any comparable sales and the certainty of the factual basis of the increase in value shall rest upon the developer.</P>
            <P>(i) Represent a lot as a homesite or building lot unless:</P>
            <P>(1) Potable water is available at a reasonable cost;</P>
            <P>(2) The lot is suitable for a septic tank operation or there is reasonable assurance that the lot can be served by a central sewage system;</P>
            <P>(3) The lot is legally accessible; and</P>
            <P>(4) The lot is free from periodic flooding.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Misleading sales practices.</SUBJECT>

            <P>Generally, promotional statements or material will be judged on the basis of the affirmative representations contained therein and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom, unless the contrary is affirmatively stated or appears in promotional material, or unless adequate safeguards have been provided by the seller to reasonably guarantee the occurrence of the thing inferred. For example, when a lot is represented as being sold by a warranty deed, the inference is that the seller can and will convey fee simple title free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, and defects except those which are disclosed in writing to the prospective purchaser prior to conveyance. The following advertising and promotional practices, while not all inclusive, are considered misleading, and are used to evaluate a developer's or agent's representations in determining possible violations of the Act or regulations.

          <SUBJECT>Authority, scope, purpose, and enforcement.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Authority.</E> The regulation in this part, known as Regulation M, is issued by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection to implement the consumer leasing provisions of the Truth in <PRTPAGE P="452"/>Lending Act, which is title I of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, as amended (15 U.S.C. 1601 <E T="03">et seq.</E>). Information collection requirements contained in this part have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. 3501 <E T="03">et seq.</E> and have been assigned OMB control number 3170-0006.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Scope and purpose.</E> This part applies to all persons that are lessors of personal property under consumer leases as those terms are defined in § 1013.2(e)(1) and (h), except persons excluded from coverage of this part by section 1029 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010, title X of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), Public Law 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376. The purpose of this part is:</P>
          <P>(1) To ensure that lessees of personal property receive meaningful disclosures that enable them to compare lease terms with other leases and, where appropriate, with credit transactions;</P>
          <P>(2) To limit the amount of balloon payments in consumer lease transactions; and</P>
          <P>(3) To provide for the accurate disclosure of lease terms in advertising.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Enforcement and liability.</E> Section 108 of the Act contains the administrative enforcement provisions. Sections 112, 130, 131, and 185 of the Act contain the liability provisions for failing to comply with the requirements of the Act and this part.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
          <P>For the purposes of this part the following definitions apply:</P>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Act</E> means the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1601 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) and the Consumer Leasing Act is Chapter 5 of the Truth in Lending Act.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Advertisement</E> means a commercial message in any medium that directly or indirectly promotes a consumer lease transaction.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Bureau</E> refers to the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Closed-end lease</E> means a consumer lease other than an open-end lease as defined in this section.</P>
          <P>(e)(1) <E T="03">Consumer lease</E> means a contract in the form of a bailment or lease for the use of personal property by a natural person primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, for a period exceeding four months and for a total contractual obligation not exceeding the applicable threshold amount, whether or not the lessee has the option to purchase or otherwise become the owner of the property at the expiration of the lease. The threshold amount is adjusted annually to reflect increases in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, as applicable. See the official commentary to this paragraph (e) for the threshold amount applicable to a specific consumer lease. Unless the context indicates otherwise, in this part “lease” means “consumer lease.”</P>
          <P>(2) The term does not include a lease that meets the definition of a credit sale in Regulation Z (12 CFR 226.2(a)). It also does not include a lease for agricultural, business, or commercial purposes or a lease made to an organization.</P>
          <P>(3) This part does not apply to a lease transaction of personal property which is incident to the lease of real property and which provides that:</P>
          <P>(i) The lessee has no liability for the value of the personal property at the end of the lease term except for abnormal wear and tear; and</P>
          <P>(ii) The lessee has no option to purchase the leased property.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Gross capitalized cost</E> means the amount agreed upon by the lessor and the lessee as the value of the leased property and any items that are capitalized or amortized during the lease term, including but not limited to taxes, insurance, service agreements, and any outstanding prior credit or lease balance. <E T="03">Capitalized cost reduction</E> means the total amount of any rebate, cash payment, net trade-in allowance, and noncash credit that reduces the gross capitalized cost. The <E T="03">adjusted capitalized cost</E> equals the gross capitalized cost less the capitalized cost reduction, and is the amount used by the lessor in calculating the base periodic payment.</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Lessee</E> means a natural person who enters into or is offered a consumer lease.</P>
          <P>(h) <E T="03">Lessor</E> means a person who regularly leases, offers to lease, or arranges for the lease of personal property under a consumer lease. A person who has <PRTPAGE P="453"/>leased, offered, or arranged to lease personal property more than five times in the preceding calendar year or more than five times in the current calendar year is subject to the Act and this part.</P>
          <P>(i) <E T="03">Open-end lease</E> means a consumer lease in which the lessee's liability at the end of the lease term is based on the difference between the residual value of the leased property and its realized value.</P>
          <P>(j) <E T="03">Organization</E> means a corporation, trust, estate, partnership, cooperative, association, or government entity or instrumentality.</P>

          <P>(1) The price received by the lessor for the leased property at disposition;</P>
          <P>(2) The highest offer for disposition of the leased property; or</P>
          <P>(3) The fair market value of the leased property at the end of the lease term.</P>
          <P>(n) <E T="03">Residual value</E> means the value of the leased property at the end of the lease term, as estimated or assigned at consummation by the lessor, used in calculating the base periodic payment.</P>
          <P>(o) <E T="03">Security interest</E> and <E T="03">security</E> mean any interest in property that secures the payment or performance of an obligation.</P>
          <P>(p) <E T="03">State</E> means any state, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and any territory or possession of the United States.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 1013.3</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>General disclosure requirements.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">General requirements.</E> A lessor shall make the disclosures required by § 1013.4, as applicable. The disclosures shall be made clearly and conspicuously in writing in a form the consumer may keep, in accordance with this section. The disclosures required by this part may be provided to the lessee in electronic form, subject to compliance with the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-Sign Act) (15 U.S.C. 7001 <E T="03">et seq.</E>). For an advertisement accessed by the consumer in electronic form, the disclosures required by § 1013.7 may be provided to the consumer in electronic form in the advertisement, without regard to the consumer consent or other provisions of the E-Sign Act.</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Form of disclosures.</E> The disclosures required by § 1013.4 shall be given to the lessee together in a dated statement that identifies the lessor and the lessee; the disclosures may be made either in a separate statement that identifies the consumer lease transaction or in the contract or other document evidencing the lease. Alternatively, the disclosures required to be segregated from other information under paragraph (a)(2) of this section may be provided in a separate dated statement that identifies the lease, and the other required disclosures may be provided in the lease contract or other document evidencing the lease. In a lease of multiple items, the property description required by § 1013.4(a) may be given in a separate statement that is included in the disclosure statement required by this paragraph.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Segregation of certain disclosures.</E> The following disclosures shall be segregated from other information and shall contain only directly related information: §§ 1013.4(b) through (f), (g)(2), (h)(3), (i)(1), (j), and (m)(1). The headings, content, and format for the disclosures referred to in this paragraph (a)(2) shall be provided in a manner substantially similar to the applicable model form in appendix A of this part.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Timing of disclosures.</E> A lessor shall provide the disclosures to the lessee prior to the consummation of a consumer lease.</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">Language of disclosures.</E> The disclosures required by § 1013.4 may be made in a language other than English provided that they are made available in English upon the lessee's request.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Additional information; nonsegregated disclosures.</E> Additional information may be provided with any disclosure not listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, but it shall not be stated, used, or placed so as to mislead or confuse the lessee or contradict, obscure, <PRTPAGE P="454"/>or detract attention from any disclosure required by this part.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Multiple lessors or lessees.</E> When a transaction involves more than one lessor, the disclosures required by this part may be made by one lessor on behalf of all the lessors. When a lease involves more than one lessee, the lessor may provide the disclosures to any lessee who is primarily liable on the lease.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Use of estimates.</E> If an amount or other item needed to comply with a required disclosure is unknown or unavailable after reasonable efforts have been made to ascertain the information, the lessor may use a reasonable estimate that is based on the best information available to the lessor, is clearly identified as an estimate, and is not used to circumvent or evade any disclosures required by this part.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Effect of subsequent occurrence.</E> If a required disclosure becomes inaccurate because of an event occurring after consummation, the inaccuracy is not a violation of this part.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Minor variations.</E> A lessor may disregard the effects of the following in making disclosures:</P>
          <P>(1) That payments must be collected in whole cents;</P>
          <P>(2) That dates of scheduled payments may be different because a scheduled date is not a business day;</P>
          <P>(3) That months have different numbers of days; and</P>
          <P>(4) That February 29 occurs in a leap year.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Content of disclosures.</SUBJECT>
          <P>For any consumer lease subject to this part, the lessor shall disclose the following information, as applicable:</P>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Description of property.</E> A brief description of the leased property sufficient to identify the property to the lessee and lessor.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Amount due at lease signing or delivery.</E> The total amount to be paid prior to or at consummation or by delivery, if delivery occurs after consummation, using the term “amount due at lease signing or delivery.” The lessor shall itemize each component by type and amount, including any refundable security deposit, advance monthly or other periodic payment, and capitalized cost reduction; and in motor vehicle leases, shall itemize how the amount due will be paid, by type and amount, including any net trade-in allowance, rebates, noncash credits, and cash payments in a format substantially similar to the model forms in appendix A of this part.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Payment schedule and total amount of periodic payments.</E> The number, amount, and due dates or periods of payments scheduled under the lease, and the total amount of the periodic payments.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Other charges.</E> The total amount of other charges payable to the lessor, itemized by type and amount, that are not included in the periodic payments. Such charges include the amount of any liability the lease imposes upon the lessee at the end of the lease term; the potential difference between the residual and realized values referred to in paragraph (k) of this section is excluded.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Total of payments.</E> The total of payments, with a description such as “the amount you will have paid by the end of the lease.” This amount is the sum of the amount due at lease signing (less any refundable amounts), the total amount of periodic payments (less any portion of the periodic payment paid at lease signing), and other charges under paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section. In an open-end lease, a description such as “you will owe an additional amount if the actual value of the vehicle is less than the residual value” shall accompany the disclosure.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Payment calculation.</E> In a motor vehicle lease, a mathematical progression of how the scheduled periodic payment is derived, in a format substantially similar to the applicable model form in appendix A of this part, which shall contain the following:</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Gross capitalized cost.</E> The gross capitalized cost, including a disclosure of the agreed upon value of the vehicle, a description such as “the agreed upon value of the vehicle [state the amount] and any items you pay for over the lease term (such as service contracts, insurance, and any outstanding prior credit or lease balance),” and a statement of the lessee's option to receive a separate written itemization of the gross capitalized cost. If requested by the lessee, the itemization shall be provided before consummation.<PRTPAGE P="455"/>
          </P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Capitalized cost reduction.</E> The capitalized cost reduction, with a description such as “the amount of any net trade-in allowance, rebate, noncash credit, or cash you pay that reduces the gross capitalized cost.”</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Adjusted capitalized cost.</E> The adjusted capitalized cost, with a description such as “the amount used in calculating your base [periodic] payment.”</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">Inconsistent state law.</E> A state law that is inconsistent with the requirements of the Act and this part is preempted to the extent of the inconsistency. If a lessor cannot comply with a state law without violating a provision of this part, the state law is inconsistent within the meaning of section 186(a) of the Act and is preempted, unless the state law gives greater protection and benefit to the consumer. A state, through an official having primary enforcement or interpretative responsibilities for the state consumer leasing law, may apply to the Bureau for a preemption determination.</P>

          <P>(ii) There is adequate provision for state enforcement.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Enforcement and liability.</E> After an exemption has been granted, the requirements of the applicable state law (except for additional requirements not imposed by Federal law) will constitute the requirements of the Act and this part. No exemption will extend to the civil liability provisions of sections 130, 131, and 185 of the Act.</P>

          <P>1. <E T="03">Official status.</E> The commentary in Supplement I is the vehicle by which the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection issues official interpretations of Regulation M (12 CFR part 1013). Good faith compliance with this commentary affords protection from liability under section 130(f) of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1640(f)). Section 130(f) protects lessors from civil liability for any act done or omitted in good faith in conformity with any interpretation issued by the Bureau.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Procedures for requesting interpretations.</E> Under appendix C of Regulation M, anyone may request an official interpretation. Interpretations that are adopted will be incorporated in this commentary following publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> No official interpretations are expected to be issued other than by means of this commentary.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Comment designations.</E> Each comment in the commentary is identified by a number and the regulatory section or paragraph that it interprets. The comments are designated with as much specificity as possible according to the particular regulatory provision addressed. For example, some of the comments to § 1013.4(f) are further divided by subparagraph, such as comment 4(f)(1)-1 and comment 4(f)(2)-1. In other cases, comments have more general application and are designated, for example, as comment 4(a)-1. This introduction may be cited as comments I-1 through I-4. An appendix may be cited as comment app. A-1.</P>
          <P>4. <E T="03">Illustrations.</E> Lists that appear in the commentary may be exhaustive or illustrative; the appropriate construction should be clear from the context. Illustrative lists are introduced by phrases such as “including,” “such as,” “to illustrate,” and “for example.”</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 1013.1—Authority, Scope, Purpose, and Enforcement</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Foreign applicability.</E> Regulation M applies to all persons (including branches of foreign banks or leasing companies located in the United States) that offer consumer leases to residents of any state (including foreign nationals) as defined in § 1013.2(p), except persons excluded from coverage of this part by section 1029 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010, title X of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Pub. L. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376. The regulation does not apply to a foreign branch of a U.S. bank or to a leasing company leasing to a U.S. citizen residing or visiting abroad or to a foreign national abroad.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 1013.2—Definitions</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">2(b) Advertisement</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Coverage.</E> The term advertisement includes messages inviting, offering, or otherwise generally announcing to prospective customers the availability of consumer leases, whether in visual, oral, print or electronic media. Examples include:</P>
          <P>i. Messages in newspapers, magazines, leaflets, catalogs, and fliers.</P>
          <P>ii. Messages on radio, television, and public address systems.</P>
          <P>iii. Direct mail literature.</P>
          <P>iv. Printed material on any interior or exterior sign or display, in any window display, in any point-of-transaction literature or price tag that is delivered or made available to a lessee or prospective lessee in any manner whatsoever.</P>
          <P>v. Telephone solicitations.</P>
          <P>vi. Online messages, such as those on the Internet.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Exclusions.</E> The term does not apply to the following:</P>
          <P>i. Direct personal contacts, including follow-up letters, cost estimates for individual lessees, or oral or written communications relating to the negotiation of a specific transaction.</P>
          <P>ii. Informational material distributed only to businesses.</P>
          <P>iii. Notices required by Federal or state law, if the law mandates that specific information be displayed and only the mandated information is included in the notice.</P>
          <P>iv. News articles controlled by the news medium.</P>
          <P>v. Market research or educational materials that do not solicit business.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Persons covered.</E> See the commentary to § 1013.7(a).</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">2(d) Closed-End Lease</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">General.</E> In closed-end leases, sometimes referred to as “walk-away” leases, the lessee is not responsible for the residual value of <PRTPAGE P="466"/>the leased property at the end of the lease term.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">2(e) Consumer Lease</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Primary purposes.</E> A lessor must determine in each case if the leased property will be used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. If a question exists as to the primary purpose for a lease, the fact that a lessor gives disclosures is not controlling on the question of whether the transaction is covered. The primary purpose of a lease is determined before or at consummation and a lessor need not provide Regulation M disclosures where there is a subsequent change in the primary use.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Period of time.</E> To be a consumer lease, the initial term of the lease must be more than four months. Thus, a lease of personal property for four months, three months or on a month-to-month or week-to-week basis (even though the lease actually extends beyond four months) is not a consumer lease and is not subject to the disclosure requirements of the regulation. However, a lease that imposes a penalty for not continuing the lease beyond four months is considered to have a term of more than four months. To illustrate:</P>
          <P>i. A three-month lease extended on a month-to-month basis and terminated after one year is not subject to the regulation.</P>
          <P>ii. A month-to-month lease with a penalty, such as the forfeiture of a security deposit for terminating before one year, is subject to the regulation.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Total contractual obligation.</E> The total contractual obligation is not necessarily the same as the total of payments disclosed under § 1013.4(e). The total contractual obligation includes nonrefundable amounts a lessee is contractually obligated to pay to the lessor, but excludes items such as:</P>
          <P>i. Residual value amounts or purchase-option prices;</P>
          <P>ii. Amounts collected by the lessor but paid to a third party, such as taxes, licenses, and registration fees.</P>
          <P>4. <E T="03">Credit sale.</E> The regulation does not cover a lease that meets the definition of a credit sale in Regulation Z, 12 CFR 226.2(a)(16), which is defined, in part, as a bailment or lease (unless terminable without penalty at any time by the consumer) under which the consumer:</P>
          <P>i. Agrees to pay as compensation for use a sum substantially equivalent to, or in excess of, the total value of the property and services involved; and</P>
          <P>ii. Will become (or has the option to become), for no additional consideration or for nominal consideration, the owner of the property upon compliance with the agreement.</P>
          <P>5. <E T="03">Agricultural purpose.</E> Agricultural purpose means a purpose related to the production, harvest, exhibition, marketing, transportation, processing, or manufacture of agricultural products by a natural person who cultivates, plants, propagates, or nurtures those agricultural products, including but not limited to the acquisition of personal property and services used primarily in farming. Agricultural products include horticultural, viticultural, and dairy products, livestock, wildlife, poultry, bees, forest products, fish and shellfish, and any products thereof, including processed and manufactured products, and any and all products raised or produced on farms and any processed or manufactured products thereof.</P>
          <P>6. <E T="03">Organization or other entity.</E> A consumer lease does not include a lease made to an organization such as a corporation or a government agency or instrumentality. Such a lease is not covered by the regulation even if the leased property is used (by an employee, for example) primarily for personal, family or household purposes, or is guaranteed by or subsequently assigned to a natural person.</P>
          <P>7. <E T="03">Leases of personal property incidental to a service.</E> The following leases of personal property are deemed incidental to a service and thus are not subject to the regulation:</P>
          <P>i. Home entertainment systems requiring the consumer to lease equipment that enables a television to receive the transmitted programming.</P>
          <P>ii. Security alarm systems requiring the installation of leased equipment intended to monitor unlawful entries into a home and in some cases to provide fire protection.</P>
          <P>iii. Propane gas service where the consumer must lease a propane tank to receive the service.</P>
          <P>8. <E T="03">Safe deposit boxes.</E> The lease of a safe deposit box is not a consumer lease under § 1013.2(e).</P>
          <P>9. <E T="03">Threshold amount.</E> A consumer lease is exempt from the requirements of this part if the total contractual obligation exceeds the threshold amount in effect at the time of consummation. The threshold amount in effect during a particular time period is the amount stated in comment 2(e)-11 for that period. The threshold amount is adjusted effective January 1 of each year by any annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) that was in effect on the preceding June 1. Comment 2(e)-11 will be amended to provide the threshold amount for the upcoming year after the annual percentage change in the CPI-W that was in effect on June 1 becomes available. Any increase in the threshold amount will be rounded to the nearest $100 increment. For example, if the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W would result in a $950 increase in the threshold amount, the threshold amount will be increased by $1,000. However, if the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W would result in a $949 increase in the threshold amount, the threshold amount will be increased by <PRTPAGE P="467"/>$900. If a consumer lease is exempt from the requirements of this part because the total contractual obligation exceeds the threshold amount in effect at the time of consummation, the lease remains exempt regardless of a subsequent increase in the threshold amount.</P>
          <P>10. <E T="03">No increase in the CPI-W.</E> If the CPI-W in effect on June 1 does not increase from the CPI-W in effect on June 1 of the previous year, the threshold amount effective the following January 1 through December 31 will not change from the previous year. When this occurs, for the years that follow, the threshold is calculated based on the annual percentage change in the CPI-W applied to the dollar amount that would have resulted, after rounding, if decreases and any subsequent increases in the CPI-W had been taken into account.</P>
          <P>i. <E T="03">Net increases.</E> If the resulting amount calculated, after rounding, is greater than the current threshold, then the threshold effective January 1 the following year will increase accordingly.</P>
          <P>ii. <E T="03">Net decreases.</E> If the resulting amount calculated, after rounding, is equal to or less than the current threshold, then the threshold effective January 1 the following year will not change, but future increases will be calculated based on the amount that would have resulted.</P>
          <P>11. <E T="03">Threshold.</E> For purposes of § 1013.2(e)(1), the threshold amount in effect during a particular period is the amount stated below for that period.</P>
          <P>i. Prior to July 21, 2011, the threshold amount is $25,000.</P>
          <P>ii. From July 21, 2011 through December 31, 2011, the threshold amount is $50,000.</P>
          <P>iii. From January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012, the threshold amount is $51,800.</P>
          <P>iv. From January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2013, the threshold amount is $53,000.</P>
          <P>v. From January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014, the threshold amount is $53,500.</P>
          <P>vi. From January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015, the threshold amount is $54,600.</P>
          <P>vii. From January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016, the threshold amount is $54,600.</P>
          <P>viii. From January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017, the threshold amount is $54,600.</P>
          <P>ix. From January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018, the threshold amount is $55,800.</P>
          <P>x. From January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019, the threshold amount is $57,200.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD2">2(h) Lessor</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Arranger of a lease.</E> To “arrange” for the lease of personal property means to provide or offer to provide a lease that is or will be extended by another person under a business or other relationship pursuant to which the person arranging the lease (a) receives or will receive a fee, compensation, or other consideration for the service or (b) has knowledge of the lease terms and participates in the preparation of the contract documents required in connection with the lease. To illustrate:</P>
          <P>i. An entity that, pursuant to a business relationship, completes the necessary lease agreement before forwarding it for execution to the leasing company (to whom the obligation is payable on its face) is “arranging” for the lease.</P>
          <P>ii. An entity that, without receiving a fee for the service, refers a customer to a leasing company that will prepare all relevant contract documents is not “arranging” for the lease.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Consideration.</E> The term “other consideration” as used in comment 2(h)-1 refers to an actual payment corresponding to a fee or similar compensation and not to intangible benefits, such as the advantage of increased business, which may flow from the relationship between the parties.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Assignees.</E> An assignee may be a lessor for purposes of the regulation in circumstances where the assignee has substantial involvement in the lease transaction. See cf. <E T="03">Ford Motor Credit Co.</E> v. <E T="03">Cenance,</E> 452 U.S. 155 (1981) (held that an assignee was a creditor for purposes of the pre-1980 Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z because of its substantial involvement in the credit transaction).</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD2">2(l) Personal Property</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Coverage.</E> Whether property is personal property depends on state or other applicable law. For example, a mobile home or houseboat may be considered personal property in one state but real property in another.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">2(m) Realized Value</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">General.</E> Realized value refers to either the retail or wholesale value of the leased property at early termination or at the end of the lease term. It is not a required disclosure. Realized value is relevant only to leases in which the lessee's liability at early termination or at the end of the lease term typically is based on the difference between the residual value (or the adjusted lease balance) of the leased property and its realized value.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Options.</E> Subject to the contract and to state or other applicable law, the lessor may calculate the realized value in determining <PRTPAGE P="468"/>the lessee's liability at the end of the lease term or at early termination in one of the three ways stated in § 1013.2(m). If the lessor sells the property prior to making the determination about liability, the price received for the property (or the fair market value) is the realized value. If the lessor does not sell the property prior to making that determination, the highest offer or the fair market value is the realized value.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Determination of realized value.</E> Disposition charges are not subtracted in determining the realized value but amounts attributable to taxes may be subtracted.</P>
          <P>4. <E T="03">Offers.</E> In determining the highest offer for disposition, the lessor may disregard offers that an offeror has withdrawn or is unable or unwilling to perform.</P>
          <P>5. <E T="03">Lessor's appraisal.</E> See commentary to § 1013.4(l).</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">2(o) Security Interest and Security</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Disclosable interests.</E> For purposes of disclosure, a security interest is an interest taken by the lessor to secure performance of the lessee's obligation. For example, if a bank that is not a lessor makes a loan to a leasing company and takes assignments of consumer leases generated by that company to secure the loan, the bank's security interest in the lessor's receivables is not a security interest for purposes of this part.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">General coverage.</E> An interest the lessor may have in leased property must be disclosed only if it is considered a security interest under state or other applicable law. The term includes, but is not limited to, security interests under the Uniform Commercial Code; real property mortgages, deeds of trust, and other consensual or confessed liens whether or not recorded; mechanic's, materialman's, artisan's, and other similar liens; vendor's liens in both real and personal property; liens on property arising by operation of law; and any interest in a lease when used to secure payment or performance of an obligation.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Insurance exception.</E> The lessor's right to insurance proceeds or unearned insurance premiums is not a security interest for purposes of this part.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 1013.3—General Disclosure Requirements</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">3(a) General Requirements</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Basis of disclosures.</E> Disclosures must reflect the terms of the legal obligation between the parties. For example:</P>
          <P>i. In a three-year lease with no penalty for termination after a one-year minimum term, disclosures are based on the full three-year term of the lease. The one-year minimum term is only relevant to the early termination provisions of §§ 1013.4 (g)(1), (k) and (l).</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Clear and conspicuous standard.</E> The clear and conspicuous standard requires that disclosures be reasonably understandable. For example, the disclosures must be presented in a way that does not obscure the relationship of the terms to each other; appendix A of this part contains model forms that meet this standard. In addition, although no minimum typesize is required, the disclosures must be legible, whether typewritten, handwritten, or printed by computer.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Multipurpose disclosure forms.</E> A lessor may use a multipurpose disclosure form provided the lessor is able to designate the specific disclosures applicable to a given transaction, consistent with the requirement that disclosures be clearly and conspicuously provided.</P>
          <P>4. <E T="03">Number of transactions.</E> Lessors have flexibility in handling lease transactions that may be viewed as multiple transactions. For example:</P>
          <P>i. When a lessor leases two items to the same lessee on the same day, the lessor may disclose the leases as either one or two lease transactions.</P>
          <P>ii. When a lessor sells insurance or other incidental services in connection with a lease, the lessor may disclose in one of two ways: As a single lease transaction (in which case Regulation M, not Regulation Z, disclosures are required) or as a lease transaction and a credit transaction.</P>
          <P>iii. When a lessor includes an outstanding lease or credit balance in a lease transaction, the lessor may disclose the outstanding balance as part of a single lease transaction (in which case Regulation M, not Regulation Z, disclosures are required) or as a lease transaction and a credit transaction.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">3(a)(1) Form of Disclosures</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Cross-references.</E> Lessors may include in the nonsegregated disclosures a cross-reference to items in the segregated disclosures rather than repeat those items. A lessor may include in the segregated disclosures numeric or alphabetic designations as cross-references to related information so long as such references do not obscure or detract from the segregated disclosures.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Identification of parties.</E> While disclosures must be made clearly and conspicuously, lessors are not required to use the word “lessor” and “lessee” to identify the parties to the lease transaction.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Lessor's address.</E> The lessor must be identified by name; an address (and telephone number) may be provided.</P>
          <P>4. <E T="03">Multiple lessors and lessees.</E> In transactions involving multiple lessors and multiple lessees, a single lessor may make all the disclosures to a single lessee as long as the disclosure statement identifies all the lessors and lessees.<PRTPAGE P="469"/>
          </P>
          <P>5. <E T="03">Lessee's signature.</E> The regulation does not require that the lessee sign the disclosure statement, whether disclosures are separately provided or are part of the lease contract. Nevertheless, to provide evidence that disclosures are given before a lessee becomes obligated on the lease transaction, the lessor may, for example, ask the lessee to sign the disclosure statement or an acknowledgement of receipt, may place disclosures that are included in the lease documents above the lessee's signature, or include instructions alerting a lessee to read the disclosures prior to signing the lease.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">3(a)(2) Segregation of Certain Disclosures</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Location.</E> The segregated disclosures referred to in § 1013.3(a)(2) may be provided on a separate document and the other required disclosures may be provided in the lease contract, so long as all disclosures are given at the same time. Alternatively, all disclosures may be provided in a separate document or in the lease contract.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Additional information among segregated disclosures.</E> The disclosures required to be segregated may contain only the information required or permitted to be included among the segregated disclosures.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Substantially similar.</E> See commentary to appendix A of this part.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">3(a)(3) Timing of Disclosures</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Consummation.</E> When a contractual relationship is created between the lessor and the lessee is a matter to be determined under state or other applicable law.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">3(b) Additional Information; Nonsegregated Disclosures</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">State law disclosures.</E> A lessor may include in the nonsegregated disclosures any state law disclosures that are not inconsistent with the Act and regulation under § 1013.9 as long as, in accordance with the standard set forth in § 1013.3(b) for additional information, the state law disclosures are not used or placed to mislead or confuse or detract from any disclosure required by the regulation.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">3(c) Multiple Lessors or Lessees</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Multiple lessors.</E> If a single lessor provides disclosures to a lessee on behalf of several lessors, all disclosures for the transaction must be given, even if the lessor making the disclosures would not otherwise have been obligated to make a particular disclosure.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">3(d) Use of Estimates</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Time of estimated disclosure.</E> The lessor may, after making a reasonable effort to obtain information, use estimates to make disclosures if necessary information is unknown or unavailable at the time the disclosures are made.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Basis of estimates.</E> Estimates must be made on the basis of the best information reasonably available at the time disclosures are made. The “reasonably available” standard requires that the lessor, acting in good faith, exercise due diligence in obtaining information. The lessor may rely on the representations of other parties. For example, the lessor might look to the consumer to determine the purpose for which leased property will be used, to insurance companies for the cost of insurance, or to an automobile manufacturer or dealer for the date of delivery. See commentary to § 1013.4(n) for estimating official fees and taxes.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Residual value of leased property at termination.</E> In an open-end lease where the lessee's liability at the end of the lease term is based on the residual value of the leased property as determined at consummation, the estimate of the residual value must be reasonable and based on the best information reasonably available to the lessor (see § 1013.4(m)). A lessor should generally use an accepted trade publication listing estimated current or future market prices for the leased property unless other information or a reasonable belief based on its experience provides the better information. For example:</P>
          <P>i. An automobile lessor offering a three-year open-end lease assigns a wholesale value to the vehicle at the end of the lease term. The lessor may disclose as an estimate a wholesale value derived from a generally accepted trade publication listing current wholesale values.</P>
          <P>ii. Same facts as above, except that the lessor discloses an estimated value derived by adjusting the residual value quoted in the trade publication because, in its experience, the trade publication values either understate or overstate the prices actually received in local used vehicle markets. The lessor may adjust estimated values quoted in trade publications if the lessor reasonably believes based on its experience that the values are understated or overstated.</P>
          <P>4. <E T="03">Retail or wholesale value.</E> The lessor may choose either a retail or a wholesale value in estimating the value of leased property at termination of an open-end lease provided the choice is consistent with the lessor's general practice when determining the value of the property at the end of the lease term. The lessor should indicate whether the value disclosed is a retail or wholesale value.</P>
          <P>5. <E T="03">Labeling estimates.</E> Generally, only the disclosure for which the exact information is unknown is labeled as an estimate. Nevertheless, when several disclosures are affected because of the unknown information, the lessor has the option of labeling as an estimate every affected disclosure or only the disclosure primarily affected.<PRTPAGE P="470"/>
          </P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">3(e) Effect of Subsequent Occurrence</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Subsequent occurrences.</E> Examples of subsequent occurrences include:</P>
          <P>i. An agreement between the lessee and lessor to change from a monthly to a weekly payment schedule.</P>
          <P>ii. An increase in official fees or taxes.</P>
          <P>iii. An increase in insurance premiums or coverage caused by a change in the law.</P>
          <P>iv. Late delivery of an automobile caused by a strike.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Redisclosure.</E> When a disclosure becomes inaccurate because of a subsequent occurrence, the lessor need not make new disclosures unless new disclosures are required under § 1013.5.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Lessee's failure to perform.</E> The lessor does not violate the regulation if a previously given disclosure becomes inaccurate when a lessee fails to perform obligations under the contract and a lessor takes actions that are necessary and proper in such circumstances to protect its interest. For example, the addition of insurance or a security interest by the lessor because the lessee has not performed obligations contracted for in the lease is not a violation of the regulation.</P>

          <P>2. <E T="03">Capitalized cost reduction.</E> A capitalized cost reduction is a payment in the nature of a downpayment on the leased property that reduces the amount to be capitalized over the term of the lease. This amount does not include any amounts included in a periodic payment paid at lease signing or delivery.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">“Negative” equity trade-in allowance.</E> If an amount owed on a prior lease or credit balance exceeds the agreed upon value of a trade-in, the difference is not reflected as a negative trade-in allowance under § 1013.4(b). The lessor may disclose the trade-in allowance as zero or not applicable, or may leave a blank line.</P>
          <P>4. <E T="03">Rebates.</E> Only rebates applied toward an amount due at lease signing or delivery are required to be disclosed under § 1013.4(b).</P>
          <P>5. <E T="03">Balance sheet approach.</E> In motor vehicle leases, the total for the column labeled “total amount due at lease signing or delivery” must equal the total for the column labeled “how the amount due at lease signing or delivery will be paid.”</P>
          <P>6. <E T="03">Amounts to be paid in cash.</E> The term cash is intended to include payments by check or other payment methods in addition to currency; however, a lessor may add a line item under the column “how the amount due at lease signing or delivery will be paid” for non-currency payments such as credit cards.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">4(c) Payment Schedule and Total Amount of Periodic Payments</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Periodic payments.</E> The phrase “number, amount, and due dates or periods of payments” requires the disclosure of all payments that are made at regular or irregular intervals and generally derived from rent, capitalized or amortized amounts such as depreciation, and other amounts that are collected by the lessor at the same interval(s), including, for example, taxes, maintenance, and insurance charges. Other periodic payments may, but need not, be disclosed under § 1013.4(c).</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">4(d) Other Charges</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Coverage.</E> Section 1013.4(d) requires the disclosure of charges that are anticipated by the parties incident to the normal operation of the lease agreement. If a lessor is unsure whether a particular fee is an “other charge,” the lessor may disclose the fee as such without violating § 1013.4(d) or the segregation rule under § 1013.3(a)(2).</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Excluded charges.</E> This section does not require disclosure of charges that are imposed when the lessee terminates early, fails to abide by, or modifies the terms of the existing lease agreement, such as charges for:</P>
          <P>i. Late payment.</P>
          <P>ii. Default.</P>
          <P>iii. Early termination.</P>
          <P>iv. Deferral of payments.</P>
          <P>v. Extension of the lease.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Third-party fees and charges.</E> Third-party fees or charges collected by the lessor on behalf of third parties, such as taxes, are not disclosed under § 1013.4(d).</P>
          <P>4. <E T="03">Relationship to other provisions.</E> The other charges mentioned in this paragraph are charges that are not required to be disclosed under some other provision of § 1013.4. To illustrate:</P>
          <P>i. The price of a mechanical breakdown protection (MBP) contract is sometimes disclosed as an “other charge.” Nevertheless, the price of MBP is sometimes reflected in the periodic payment disclosure under § 1013.4(c) or in states where MBP is regarded as insurance, the cost is be disclosed in accordance with § 1013.4(o).</P>
          <P>5. <E T="03">Lessee's liabilities at the end of the lease term.</E> Liabilities that the lessor imposes upon the lessee at the end of the scheduled lease term and that must be disclosed under § 1013.4(d) include disposition and “pick-up” charges.</P>
          <P>6. <E T="03">Optional “disposition” charges.</E> Disposition and similar charges that are anticipated by the parties as an incident to the normal <PRTPAGE P="471"/>operation of the lease agreement must be disclosed under § 1013.4(d). If, under a lease agreement, a lessee may return leased property to various locations, and the lessor charges a disposition fee depending upon the location chosen, under § 1013.4(d), the lessor must disclose the highest amount charged. In such circumstances, the lessor may also include a brief explanation of the fee structure in the segregated disclosure. For example, if no fee or a lower fee is imposed for returning a leased vehicle to the originating dealer as opposed to another location, that fact may be disclosed. By contrast, if the terms of the lease treat the return of the leased property to a location outside the lessor's service area as a default, the fee imposed is not disclosed as an “other charge,” although it may be required to be disclosed under § 1013.4(q).</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD2">4(f)(1) Gross Capitalized Cost</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Agreed upon value of the vehicle.</E> The agreed upon value of a motor vehicle includes the amount of capitalized items such as charges for vehicle accessories and options, and delivery or destination charges. The lessor may also include taxes and fees for title, licenses, and registration that are capitalized. Charges for service or maintenance contracts, insurance products, guaranteed automobile protection, or an outstanding balance on a prior lease or credit transaction are not included in the agreed upon value.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Itemization of the gross capitalized cost.</E> The lessor may choose to provide the itemization of the gross capitalized cost only on request or may provide the itemization as a matter of course. In the latter case, the lessor need not provide a statement of the lessee's option to receive an itemization. The gross capitalized cost must be itemized by type and amount. The lessor may include in the itemization an identification of the items and amounts of some or all of the items contained in the agreed upon value of the vehicle. The itemization must be provided at the same time as the other disclosures required by § 1013.4, but it may not be included among the segregated disclosures.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">4(f)(7) Total of Base Periodic Payments</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Accuracy of disclosure.</E> If the periodic payment calculation under § 1013.4(f) has been calculated correctly, the amount disclosed under § 1013.4(f)(7)—the total of base periodic payments—is correct for disclosure purposes even if that amount differs from the base periodic payment disclosed under § 1013.4(f)(9) multiplied by the number of lease payments disclosed under § 1013.4(f)(8), when the difference is due to rounding.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">4(f)(8) Lease Payments</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Lease Term.</E> The lease term may be disclosed among the segregated disclosures.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">4(g) Early Termination</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">4(g)(1) Conditions and Disclosure of Charges</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Reasonableness of charges.</E> See the commentary to § 1013.4(q).</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Description of the method.</E> Section 1013.4(g)(1) requires a full description of the method of determining an early termination charge. The lessor should attempt to provide consumers with clear and understandable descriptions of its early termination charges. Descriptions that are full, accurate, and not intended to be misleading will comply with § 1013.4(g)(1), even if the descriptions are complex. In providing a full description of an early termination method, a lessor may use the name of a generally accepted method of computing the unamortized cost portion (also known as the “adjusted lease balance”) of its early termination charges. For example, a lessor may state that the “constant yield” method will be utilized in obtaining the adjusted lease balance, but must specify how that figure, and any other term or figure, is used in computing the total early termination charge imposed upon the consumer. Additionally, if a lessor refers to a named method in this manner, the lessor must provide a written explanation of that method if requested by the consumer. The lessor has the option of providing the explanation as a matter of course in the lease documents or on a separate document.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Timing of written explanation of a named method.</E> While a lessor may provide an address or telephone number for the consumer to request a written explanation of the named method used to calculate the adjusted leased balance, if at consummation a consumer requests such an explanation, the lessor must provide a written explanation at that time. If a consumer requests an explanation after consummation, the lessor must <PRTPAGE P="472"/>provide a written explanation within a reasonable time after the request is made.</P>
          <P>4. <E T="03">Default.</E> When default is a condition for early termination of a lease, default charges must be disclosed under § 1013.4(g)(1). See the commentary to § 1013.4(q).</P>
          <P>5. <E T="03">Lessee's liability at early termination.</E> When the lessee is liable for the difference between the unamortized cost and the realized value at early termination, the method of determining the amount of the difference must be disclosed under § 1013.4(g)(1).</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">4(h) Maintenance Responsibilities</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Standards for wear and use.</E> No disclosure is required if a lessor does not set standards or impose charges for wear and use (such as excess mileage).</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">4(i) Purchase Option</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Mandatory disclosure of no purchase option.</E> Generally the lessor need only make the specific required disclosures that apply to a transaction. In the case of a purchase option disclosure, however, a lessor must disclose affirmatively that the lessee has no option to purchase the leased property if the purchase option is inapplicable.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Existence of purchase option.</E> Whether a purchase option exists under the lease is determined by state or other applicable law. The lessee's right to submit a bid to purchase property at termination of the lease is not an option to purchase under § 1013.4(i) if the lessor is not required to accept the lessee's bid and the lessee does not receive preferential treatment.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Purchase-option fee.</E> A purchase-option fee is disclosed under § 1013.4(i), not § 1013.4(d). The fee may be separately itemized or disclosed as part of the purchase-option price.</P>
          <P>4. <E T="03">Official fees and taxes.</E> Official fees such as those for taxes, licenses, and registration charged in connection with the exercise of a purchase option may be disclosed under § 1013.4(i) as part of the purchase-option price (with or without a reference to their inclusion in that price) or may be separately disclosed and itemized by category. Alternatively, a lessor may provide a statement indicating that the purchase-option price does not include fees for tags, taxes, and registration.</P>
          <P>5. <E T="03">Purchase-option price.</E> Lessors must disclose the purchase-option price as a sum certain or as a sum certain to be determined at a future date by reference to a readily available independent source. The reference should provide sufficient information so that the lessee will be able to determine the actual price when the option becomes available. Statements of a purchase price as the “negotiated price” or the “fair market value” do not comply with the requirements of § 1013.4(i).</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">4(j) Statement Referencing Nonsegregated Disclosures</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Content.</E> A lessor may delete inapplicable items from the disclosure. For example, if a lease contract does not include a security interest, the reference to a security interest may be omitted.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">4(l) Right of Appraisal</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Disclosure inapplicable.</E> The lessee does not have the right to an independent appraisal merely because the lessee is liable at the end of the lease term or at early termination for unreasonable wear or use. Thus, the disclosure under § 1013.4(l) does not apply. For example:</P>
          <P>i. The automobile lessor might expect a lessee to return an undented car with four good tires at the end of the lease term. Even though it may hold the lessee liable for the difference between a dented car with bald tires and the value of a car in reasonably good repair, the disclosure under § 1013.4(l) is not required.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Lessor's appraisal.</E> If the lessor obtains an appraisal of the leased property to determine its realized value, that appraisal does not suffice for purposes of section 183(c) of the Act; the lessor must disclose the lessee's right to an independent appraisal under § 1013.4(l).</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Retail or wholesale.</E> In providing the disclosures in § 1013.4(l), a lessor must indicate whether the wholesale or retail appraisal value will be used.</P>
          <P>4. <E T="03">Time restriction on appraisal.</E> The regulation does not specify a time period in which the lessee must exercise the appraisal right. The lessor may require a lessee to obtain the appraisal within a reasonable time after termination of the lease.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">4(m) Liability at End of Lease Term Based on Residual Value</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Open-end leases.</E> Section 1013.4(m) applies only to open-end leases.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Lessor's payment of attorney's fees.</E> Section 183(a) of the Act requires that the lessor pay the lessee's attorney's fees in all actions under § 1013.4(m), whether successful or not.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">4(m)(1) Rent and Other Charges</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">General.</E> This disclosure is intended to represent the cost of financing an open-end lease based on charges and fees that the lessor requires the lessee to pay. Examples of disclosable charges, in addition to the rent charge, include acquisition, disposition, or assignment fees. Charges imposed by a third party whose services are not required by the lessor (such as official fees and voluntary insurance) are not included in the § 1013.4(m)(1) disclosure.<PRTPAGE P="473"/>
          </P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">4(m)(2) Excess Liability</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Coverage.</E> The disclosure limiting the lessee's liability for the value of the leased property does not apply in the case of early termination.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Leases with a minimum term.</E> If a lease has an alternative minimum term, the disclosures governing the liability limitation are not applicable for the minimum term.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Charges not subject to rebuttable presumption.</E> The limitation on liability applies only to liability at the end of the lease term that is based on the difference between the residual value of the leased property and its realized value. The regulation does not preclude a lessor from recovering other charges from the lessee at the end of the lease term. Examples of such charges include:</P>
          <P>i. Disposition charges.</P>
          <P>ii. Excess mileage charges.</P>
          <P>iii. Late payment and default charges.</P>
          <P>iv. In simple-interest accounting leases, amount by which the unamortized cost exceeds the residual value because the lessee has not made timely payments.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">4(n) Fees and Taxes</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Treatment of certain taxes.</E> Taxes paid in connection with the lease are generally disclosed under § 1013.4(n), but there are exceptions. To illustrate:</P>
          <P>i. Taxes paid by lease signing or delivery are disclosed under § 1013.4(b) and § 1013.4(n).</P>
          <P>ii. Taxes that are part of the scheduled payments are reflected in the disclosure under § 1013.4(c), (f), and (n).</P>
          <P>iii. A tax payable by the lessor that is passed on to the consumer and is reflected in the lease documentation must be disclosed under § 1013.4(n). A tax payable by the lessor and absorbed as a cost of doing business need not be disclosed.</P>
          <P>iv. Taxes charged in connection with the exercise of a purchase option are disclosed under § 1013.4(i), not § 1013.4(n).</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Estimates.</E> In disclosing the total amount of fees and taxes under § 1013.4(n), lessors may need to base the disclosure on estimated tax rates or amounts and are afforded great flexibility in doing so. Where a rate is applied to the future value of leased property, lessors have flexibility in estimating that value, including, but not limited to, using the mathematical average of the agreed upon value and the residual value or published valuation guides; or a lessor could prepare estimates using the agreed upon value and disclose a reasonable estimate of the total fees and taxes. Lessors may include a statement that the actual total of fees and taxes may be higher or lower depending on the tax rates in effect or the value of the leased property at the time a fee or tax is assessed.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">4(o) Insurance</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Coverage.</E> If insurance is obtained through the lessor, information on the type and amount of insurance coverage (whether voluntary or required) as well as the cost, must be disclosed.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Lessor's insurance.</E> Insurance purchased by the lessor primarily for its own benefit, and absorbed as a business expense and not separately charged to the lessee, need not be disclosed under § 1013.4(o) even if it provides an incidental benefit to the lessee.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Mechanical breakdown protection and other products.</E> Whether products purchased in conjunction with a lease, such as mechanical breakdown protection (MBP) or guaranteed automobile protection (GAP), should be treated as insurance is determined by state or other applicable law. In states that do not treat MBP or GAP as insurance, § 1013.4(o) disclosures are not required. In such cases the lessor may, however, disclose this information in accordance with the additional information provision in § 1013.3(b). For MBP insurance contracts not capped by a dollar amount, lessors may describe coverage by referring to a limitation by mileage or time period, for example, by indicating that the mechanical breakdown contract insures parts of the automobile for up to 100,000 miles.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">4(p) Warranties or Guarantees</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Brief identification.</E> The statement identifying warranties may be brief and need not describe or list all warranties applicable to specific parts such as for air conditioning, radio, or tires in an automobile. For example, manufacturer's warranties may be identified simply by a reference to the standard manufacturer's warranty. If a lessor provides a comprehensive list of warranties that may not all apply, to comply with § 1013.4(p) the lessor must indicate which warranties apply or, alternatively, which warranties do not apply.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Warranty disclaimers.</E> Although a disclaimer of warranties is not required by the regulation, the lessor may give a disclaimer as additional information in accordance with § 1013.3(b).</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">State law.</E> Whether an express warranty or guaranty exists is determined by state or other law.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">4(q) Penalties and Other Charges for Delinquency</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Collection costs.</E> The automatic imposition of collection costs or attorney fees upon default must be disclosed under § 1013.4(q). Collection costs or attorney fees that are not imposed automatically, but are contingent upon expenditures in conjunction with a collection proceeding or upon the employment of an attorney to effect collection, need not be disclosed.<PRTPAGE P="474"/>
          </P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Charges for early termination.</E> When default is a condition for early termination of a lease, default charges must also be disclosed under § 1013.4(g)(1). The § 1013.4(q) and (g)(1) disclosures may, but need not, be combined. Examples of combined disclosures are provided in the model lease disclosure forms in appendix A.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Simple-interest leases.</E> In a simple-interest accounting lease, the additional rent charge that accrues on the lease balance when a periodic payment is made after the due date does not constitute a penalty or other charge for late payment. Similarly, continued accrual of the rent charge after termination of the lease because the lessee fails to return the leased property does not constitute a default charge. But in either case, if the additional charge accrues at a rate higher than the normal rent charge, the lessor must disclose the amount of or the method of determining the additional charge under § 1013.4(q).</P>
          <P>4. <E T="03">Extension charges.</E> Extension charges that exceed the rent charge in a simple-interest accounting lease or that are added separately are disclosed under § 1013.4(q).</P>
          <P>5. <E T="03">Reasonableness of charges.</E> Pursuant to section 183(b) of the Act, penalties or other charges for delinquency, default, or early termination may be specified in the lease but only in an amount that is reasonable in light of the anticipated or actual harm caused by the delinquency, default, or early termination, the difficulties of proof of loss, and the inconvenience or nonfeasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 1013.5—Renegotiations, Extensions, and Assumptions</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Coverage.</E> Section 1013.5 applies only to existing leases that are covered by the regulation. It does not apply to the renegotiation or extension of leases with an initial term of four months or less, because such leases are not covered by the definition of consumer lease in § 1013.2(e). Whether and when a lease is satisfied and replaced by a new lease is determined by state or other applicable law.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">5(a) Renegotiation</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Basis of disclosures.</E> Lessors have flexibility in making disclosures so long as they reflect the legal obligation under the renegotiated lease. For example, assume that a 24-month lease is replaced by a 36-month lease. The initial lease began on January 1, 1998, and was renegotiated and replaced on July 1, 1998, so that the new lease term ends on January 1, 2001.</P>
          <P>i. If the renegotiated lease covers the 36-month period beginning January 1, 1998, the new disclosures would reflect all payments made by the lessee on the initial lease and all payments on the renegotiated lease. In this example, since the renegotiated lease covers a 36-month period beginning January 1, 1998, the disclosures must reflect payments made since that date. On the model form, the “total of base periodic payments” disclosed under § 1013.4(f)(7) should reflect periodic payments to be made over the entire 36-month term. Payments received since January 1, 1998, are added as a new line item disclosed as “total of payments received” and are subtracted from the “total of base periodic payments” in calculating a new item disclosed as the “total of base periodic payments remaining.” For example, if 6 monthly payments of $300 were received since January 1, 1998, the disclosure form should include a “total of base periodic payments” line from which $1,800 is subtracted to arrive at the “total of base periodic payments remaining.” The remainder of the disclosures would not change.</P>
          <P>ii. If the renegotiated lease covers only the remaining 30 months, from July 1, 1998, to January 1, 2001, the disclosures would reflect only the charges incurred in connection with the renegotiation and the payments for the remaining period.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">5(b) Extension</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Time of extension disclosures.</E> If a consumer lease is extended for a specified term greater than six months, new disclosures are required at the time the extension is agreed upon. If the lease is extended on a month-to-month basis and the cumulative extensions exceed six months, new disclosures are required at the commencement of the seventh month and at the commencement of each seventh month thereafter for as long as the extensions continue. If a consumer lease is extended for terms of varying durations, one of which will exceed six months beyond the originally scheduled termination date of the lease, new disclosures are required at the commencement of the term that will exceed six months beyond the originally scheduled termination date.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Content of disclosures for month-to-month extensions.</E> The disclosures for a lease extended on a month-to-month basis for more than six months should reflect the month-to-month nature of the transaction.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Basis of disclosures.</E> The disclosures should be based on the extension period, including any upfront costs paid in connection with the extension. For example, assume that initially a lease ends on March 1, 1999. <PRTPAGE P="475"/>In January 1999, agreement is reached to extend the lease until October 1, 1999. The disclosure would include any extension fee paid in January and the periodic payments for the seven-month extension period beginning in March.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 1013.7—Advertising</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">7(a) General Rule</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Persons covered.</E> All “persons” must comply with the advertising provisions in this section, not just those that meet the definition of a lessor in § 1013.2(h). Thus, automobile dealers (to the extent they are not excluded from the Bureau's rulemaking authority by section 1029 of the Dodd-Frank Act), merchants, and others who are not themselves lessors must comply with the advertising provisions of the regulation if they advertise consumer lease transactions. Pursuant to section 184(b) of the Act, however, owners and personnel of the media in which an advertisement appears or through which it is disseminated are not subject to civil liability for violations under section 185(b) of the Act.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">“Usually and customarily.”</E> Section 1013.7(a) does not prohibit the advertising of a single item or the promotion of a new leasing program, but prohibits the advertising of terms that are not and will not be available. Thus, an advertisement may state terms that will be offered for only a limited period or terms that will become available at a future date.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Total contractual obligation of advertised lease.</E> Section 1013.7 applies to advertisements for consumer leases, as defined in § 1013.2(e). Under § 1013.2(e), a consumer lease is exempt from the requirements of this part if the total contractual obligation exceeds the threshold amount in effect at the time of consummation. See comment 2(e)-9. Accordingly, § 1013.7 does not apply to an advertisement for a specific consumer lease if the total contractual obligation for that lease exceeds the threshold amount in effect when the advertisement is made. If a lessor promotes multiple consumer leases in a single advertisement, the entire advertisement must comply with § 1013.7 unless all of the advertised leases are exempt under § 1013.2(e). For example:</P>
          <P>i. Assume that, in an advertisement, a lessor states that certain terms apply to a consumer lease for a specific automobile. The total contractual obligation of the advertised lease exceeds the threshold amount in effect when the advertisement is made. Although the advertisement does not refer to any other lease, some or all of the advertised terms for the exempt lease also apply to other leases offered by the lessor with total contractual obligations that do not exceed the applicable threshold amount. The advertisement is not required to comply with § 1013.7 because it refers only to an exempt lease.</P>
          <P>ii. Assume that, in an advertisement, a lessor states certain terms (such as the amount due at lease signing) that will apply to consumer leases for automobiles of a particular brand. However, the advertisement does not refer to a specific lease. The total contractual obligations of the leases for some of the automobiles will exceed the threshold amount in effect when the advertisement is made, but the total contractual obligations of the leases for other automobiles will not exceed the threshold. The entire advertisement must comply with § 1013.7 because it refers to terms for consumer leases that are not exempt.</P>
          <P>iii. Assume that, in a single advertisement, a lessor states that certain terms apply to consumer leases for two different automobiles. The total contractual obligation of the lease for the first automobile exceeds the threshold amount in effect when the advertisement is made, but the total contractual obligation of the lease for the second automobile does not exceed the threshold. The entire advertisement must comply with § 1013.7 because it refers to a consumer lease that is not exempt.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">7(b) Clear and Conspicuous Standard</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Standard.</E> The disclosures in an advertisement in any media must be reasonably understandable. For example, very fine print in a television advertisement or detailed and very rapidly stated information in a radio advertisement does not meet the clear and conspicuous standard if consumers cannot see and read or hear, and cannot comprehend, the information required to be disclosed.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">7(b)(1) Amount Due at Lease Signing or Delivery</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Itemization not required.</E> Only a total of amounts due at lease signing or delivery is required to be disclosed, not an itemization of its component parts. Such an itemization is provided in any transaction-specific disclosures provided under § 1013.4.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Prominence rule.</E> Except for a periodic payment, oral or written references to components of the total due at lease signing or delivery (for example, a reference to a capitalized cost reduction, where permitted) may not be more prominent than the disclosure of the total amount due at lease signing or delivery.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">7(b)(2) Advertisement of a Lease Rate</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Location of statement.</E> The notice required to accompany a percentage rate stated in an <PRTPAGE P="476"/>advertisement must be placed in close proximity to the rate without any other intervening language or symbols. For example, a lessor may not place an asterisk next to the rate and place the notice elsewhere in the advertisement. In addition, with the exception of the notice required by § 1013.4(s), the rate cannot be more prominent than any other § 1013.4 disclosure stated in the advertisement.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">7(c) Catalogs or Other Multi-Page Advertisements; Electronic Advertisements</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">General rule.</E> The multiple-page advertisements referred to in § 1013.7(c) are advertisements consisting of a series of numbered pages—for example, a supplement to a newspaper. A mailing comprising several separate flyers or pieces of promotional material in a single envelope is not a single multiple-page advertisement.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Cross references.</E> A catalog or other multiple-page advertisement or an electronic advertisement (such as an advertisement appearing on an internet Web site) is a single advertisement (requiring only one set of lease disclosures) if it contains a table, chart, or schedule with the disclosures required under § 1013.7(d)(2)(i) through (v). If one of the triggering terms listed in § 1013.7(d)(1) appears in a catalog, or in a multiple-page or electronic advertisement, it must clearly direct the consumer to the page or location where the table, chart, or schedule begins. For example, in an electronic advertisement, a term triggering additional disclosures may be accompanied by a link that directly connects the consumer to the additional information.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">7(d)(1) Triggering Terms</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Typical example.</E> When any triggering term appears in a lease advertisement, the additional terms enumerated in § 1013.7(d)(2)(i) through (v) must also appear. In a multi-lease advertisement, an example of one or more typical leases with a statement of all the terms applicable to each may be used. The examples must be labeled as such and must reflect representative lease terms that are made available by the lessor to consumers.</P>

          <P>1. <E T="03">Third-party fees that vary by state or locality.</E> The disclosure of a periodic payment or total amount due at lease signing or delivery may:</P>
          <P>i. Exclude third-party fees, such as taxes, licenses, and registration fees and disclose that fact; or</P>
          <P>ii. Provide a periodic payment or total that includes third-party fees based on a particular state or locality as long as that fact and the fact that fees may vary by state or locality are disclosed.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">7(e) Alternative Disclosures—Merchandise Tags</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Multiple-item leases.</E> Multiple-item leases that utilize merchandise tags requiring additional disclosures may use the alternate disclosure rule.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">7(f) Alternative Disclosures—Television or Radio Advertisements</HD>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">7(f)(1) Toll-Free Number or Print Advertisement</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Publication in general circulation.</E> A reference to a written advertisement appearing in a newspaper circulated nationally, for example, USA Today or the Wall Street Journal, may satisfy the general circulation requirement in § 1013.7(f)(1)(ii).</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Toll-free number, local or collect calls.</E> In complying with the disclosure requirements of § 1013.7(f)(1)(i), a lessor must provide a toll-free number for nonlocal calls made from an area code other than the one used in the lessor's dialing area. Alternatively, a lessor may provide any telephone number that allows a consumer to reverse the phone charges when calling for information.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Multi-purpose number.</E> When an advertised toll-free number responds with a recording, lease disclosures must be provided early in the sequence to ensure that the consumer receives the required disclosures. For example, in providing several dialing options—such as providing directions to the lessor's place of business—the option allowing the consumer to request lease disclosures should be provided early in the telephone message to ensure that the option to request disclosures is not obscured by other information.</P>
          <P>4. <E T="03">Statement accompanying toll free number.</E> Language must accompany a telephone and television number indicating that disclosures are available by calling the toll-free number, such as “call 1-(800) 000-0000 for details about costs and terms.”</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 1013.8—Record Retention</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Manner of retaining evidence.</E> A lessor must retain evidence of having performed required actions and of having made required disclosures. Such records may be retained in paper form, on microfilm, microfiche, or computer, or by any other method designed to reproduce records accurately. The lessor need retain only enough information to reconstruct the required disclosures or other records.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 1013.9—Relation to State Laws</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Exemptions granted.</E> The Bureau recognizes exemptions granted by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System prior to July 21, 2011, until and unless the Bureau makes and publishes any contrary determination. Effective October 1, 1982, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve <PRTPAGE P="477"/>System granted the following exemptions from portions of the Consumer Leasing Act:</P>
          <P>i. <E T="03">Maine.</E> Lease transactions subject to the Maine Consumer Credit Code and its implementing regulations are exempt from Chapters 2, 4, and 5 of the Federal act. (The exemption does not apply to transactions in which a federally chartered institution is a lessor.)</P>
          <P>ii. <E T="03">Oklahoma.</E> Lease transactions subject to the Oklahoma Consumer Credit Code are exempt from Chapters 2 and 5 of the Federal act. (The exemption does not apply to sections 132 through 135 of the Federal act, nor does it apply to transactions in which a federally chartered institution is a lessor.)</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Appendix A—Model Forms</HD>
          <P>1. <E T="03">Permissible changes.</E> Although use of the model forms is not required, lessors using them properly will be deemed to be in compliance with the regulation. Generally, lessors may make certain changes in the format or content of the forms and may delete any disclosures that are inapplicable to a transaction without losing the Act's protection from liability. For example, the model form based on monthly periodic payments may be modified for single-payment lease transactions or for quarterly or other regular or irregular periodic payments. The model form may also be modified to reflect that a transaction is an extension. The content, format, and headings for the segregated disclosures must be substantially similar to those contained in the model forms; therefore, any changes should be minimal. The changes to the model forms should not be so extensive as to affect the substance and the clarity of the disclosures.</P>
          <P>2. <E T="03">Examples of acceptable changes.</E>
          </P>
          <P>i. Using the first person, instead of the second person, in referring to the lessee.</P>
          <P>ii. Using “lessee,” “lessor,” or names instead of pronouns.</P>
          <P>iii. Rearranging the sequence of the nonsegregated disclosures.</P>
          <P>iv. Incorporating certain state “plain English” requirements.</P>
          <P>v. Deleting or blocking out inapplicable disclosures, filling in “N/A” (not applicable) or “0,” crossing out, leaving blanks, checking a box for applicable items, or circling applicable items (this should facilitate use of multipurpose standard forms).</P>
          <P>vi. Adding language or symbols to indicate estimates.</P>
          <P>vii. Adding numeric or alphabetic designations.</P>
          <P>viii. Rearranging the disclosures into vertical columns, except for § 1013.4(b) through (e) disclosures.</P>
          <P>ix. Using icons and other graphics.</P>
          <P>3. <E T="03">Model closed-end or net vehicle lease disclosure.</E> Model A-2 is designed for a closed-end or net vehicle lease. Under the “Early Termination and Default” provision a reference to the lessee's right to an independent appraisal of the leased vehicle under § 1013.4(l) is included for those closed-end leases in which the lessee's liability at early termination is based on the vehicle's realized value.</P>
          <P>4. <E T="03">Model furniture lease disclosures.</E> Model A-3 is a closed-end lease disclosure statement designed for a typical furniture lease. It does not include a disclosure of the appraisal right at early termination required under § 1013.4(l) because few closed-end furniture leases base the lessee's liability at early termination on the realized value of the leased property. The disclosure should be added if it is applicable.</P>

            <E T="03">Clear and prominent</E> means:</P>

          <P>(1) In textual communications, the required disclosures shall be easily readable; in a high degree of contrast from the immediate background on which it appears; in the same languages that are substantially used in the commercial communication; in a format so that the disclosure is distinct from other text, such as inside a border; in a distinct type style, such as bold; parallel to the base of the commercial communication, and, except as otherwise provided in this rule, each <PRTPAGE P="481"/>letter of the disclosure shall be, at a minimum, the larger of 12-point type or one-half the size of the largest letter or numeral used in the name of the advertised Web site or telephone number to which consumers are referred to receive information relating to any mortgage assistance relief service.

          <P>(3) In communications disseminated through video means, such as television or streaming video, the required disclosures shall appear simultaneously in the audio and visual parts of the commercial communication and be delivered in a manner consistent with paragraphs (1) and (2) of this definition.

            <P>(d) <E T="03">Color.</E> The model form must be printed on white or light color paper (such as cream) with black or other contrasting ink color. Spot color may be used to achieve visual interest, so long as the color contrast is distinctive and the color does not detract from the readability of the model form. Logos may also be printed in color.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Languages.</E> The model form may be translated into languages other than English.</P>

The information shall appear in minimum 8-point font as “rev. [month/year]” using either the name or number of the month, such as “rev. July 2009” or “rev. 7/09”.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">General instructions for the “What?” box.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(1) The bulleted list identifies the types of personal information that the institution collects and shares. All institutions must use the term “Social Security number” in the first bullet.</P>
            <P>(2) Institutions must use five (5) of the following terms to complete the bulleted list: Income; account balances; payment history; transaction history; transaction or loss history; credit history; credit scores; assets; investment experience; credit-based insurance scores; insurance claim history; medical information; overdraft history; purchase history; account transactions; risk tolerance; medical-related debts; credit card or other debt; mortgage rates and payments; retirement assets; checking account information; employment information; wire transfer instructions.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">General instructions for the disclosure table.</E> The left column lists reasons for sharing or using personal information. Each reason correlates to a specific legal provision described in paragraph C.2(d) of this Instruction. In the middle column, each institution must provide a “Yes” or “No” response that accurately reflects its information sharing policies and practices with respect to the reason listed on the left. In the right column, each institution must provide in each box one of the following three (3) responses, as applicable, that reflects whether a consumer can limit such sharing: “Yes” if it is required to or voluntarily provides an opt-out; “No” if it does not provide an opt-out; or “We don't share” if it answers “No” in the middle column. Only the sixth row (“For our affiliates to market to you”) may be omitted at the option of the institution. <E T="03">See</E> paragraph C.2(d)(6) of this Instruction.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Specific disclosures and corresponding legal provisions.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">For our everyday business purposes.</E> This reason incorporates sharing information under §§ 1016.14 and 1016.15 and with service providers pursuant to § 1016.13 of this part other than the purposes specified in paragraphs C.2(d)(2) or C.2(d)(3) of these Instructions.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">For our marketing purposes.</E> This reason incorporates sharing information with service providers by an institution for its own marketing pursuant to § 1016.13 of this part. An institution that shares for this reason may choose to provide an opt-out.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">For joint marketing with other financial companies.</E> This reason incorporates sharing information under joint marketing agreements between two or more financial institutions and with any service provider used in connection with such agreements pursuant to § 1016.13 of this part. An institution that shares for this reason may choose to provide an opt-out.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">For our affiliates' everyday business purposes—information about transactions and experiences.</E> This reason incorporates sharing information specified in sections 603(d)(2)(A)(i) and (ii) of the FCRA. An institution that shares for this reason may choose to provide an opt-out.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">For our affiliates' everyday business purposes—information about creditworthiness.</E> This reason incorporates sharing information pursuant to section 603(d)(2)(A)(iii) of the FCRA. An institution that shares for this reason must provide an opt-out.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">For our affiliates to market to you.</E> This reason incorporates sharing information specified in section 624 of the FCRA. This reason may be omitted from the disclosure table when: the institution does not have affiliates (or does not disclose personal information to its affiliates); the institution's affiliates do not use personal information in a manner that requires an opt-out; or the institution provides the affiliate marketing notice separately. Institutions that include this reason must provide an opt-out of indefinite duration. An institution that is required to provide an affiliate marketing opt-<PRTPAGE P="519"/>out, but does not include that opt-out in the model form under this part, must comply with section 624 of the FCRA and 12 CFR part 1022, subpart C, with respect to the initial notice and opt-out and any subsequent renewal notice and opt-out. An institution not required to provide an opt-out under this subparagraph may elect to include this reason in the model form.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">For nonaffiliates to market to you.</E> This reason incorporates sharing described in §§ 1016.7 and 1016.10(a) of this part. An institution that shares personal information for this reason must provide an opt-out.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">To limit our sharing:</E> A financial institution must include this section of the model form <E T="03">only</E> if it provides an opt-out. The word “choice” may be written in either the singular or plural, as appropriate. Institutions must select one or more of the applicable opt-out methods described: Telephone, such as by a toll-free number; a Web site; or use of a mail-in opt-out form. Institutions may include the words “toll-free” before telephone, as appropriate. An institution that allows consumers to opt out online must provide either a specific Web address that takes consumers directly to the opt-out page or a general Web address that provides a clear and conspicuous direct link to the opt-out page. The opt-out choices made available to the consumer who contacts the institution through these methods must correspond accurately to the “Yes” responses in the third column of the disclosure table. In the part titled “Please note,” institutions may insert a number that is 30 or greater in the space marked “[30].” Instructions on voluntary or state privacy law opt-out information are in paragraph C.2(g)(5) of these Instructions.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Questions box.</E> Customer service contact information must be inserted as appropriate, where [phone number] or [Web site] appear. Institutions may elect to provide either a phone number, such as a toll-free number, or a web address, or both. Institutions may include the words “toll-free” before the telephone number, as appropriate.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Mail-in opt-out form.</E> Financial institutions must include this mail-in form <E T="03">only</E> if they state in the “To limit our sharing” box that consumers can opt out by mail. The mail-in form must provide opt-out options that correspond accurately to the “Yes” responses in the third column in the disclosure table. Institutions that require customers to provide only name and address may omit the section identified as “[account #].” Institutions that require additional or different information, such as a random opt-out number or a truncated account number, to implement an opt-out election should modify the “[account #]” reference accordingly. This includes institutions that require customers with multiple accounts to identify each account to which the opt-out should apply. An institution must enter its opt-out mailing address: in the far right of this form (<E T="03">see</E> version 3); or below the form (<E T="03">see</E> version 4). The reverse side of the mail-in opt-out form must not include any content of the model form.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Joint accountholder.</E> Only institutions that provide their joint accountholders the choice to opt out for only one accountholder, in accordance with paragraph C.3(a)(5) of these Instructions, must include in the far left column of the mail-in form the following statement: “If you have a joint account, your choice(s) will apply to everyone on your account unless you mark below. Apply my choice(s) only to me.” The word “choice” may be written in either the singular or plural, as appropriate. Financial institutions that provide insurance products or services, provide this option, and elect to use the model form may substitute the word “policy” for “account” in this statement. Institutions that do not provide this option may eliminate this left column from the mail-in form.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">FCRA section 603(d)(2)(A)(iii) opt-out.</E> If the institution shares personal information pursuant to section 603(d)(2)(A)(iii) of the FCRA, it must include in the mail-in opt-out form the following statement: “ Do not share information about my creditworthiness with your affiliates for their everyday business purposes.”</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">FCRA section 624 opt-out.</E> If the institution incorporates section 624 of the FCRA in accord with paragraph C.2(d)(6) of these Instructions, it must include in the mail-in opt-out form the following statement: “ Do not allow your affiliates to use my personal information to market to me.”</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Nonaffiliate opt-out.</E> If the financial institution shares personal information pursuant to § 1016.10(a) of this part, it must include in the mail-in opt-out form the following statement: “ Do not share my personal information with nonaffiliates to market their products and services to me.”</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Additional opt-outs.</E> Financial institutions that use the disclosure table to provide opt-out options beyond those required by Federal law must provide those opt-outs in this section of the model form. A financial institution that chooses to offer an opt-out for its own marketing in the mail-in opt-out form must include one of the two following statements: “ Do not share my personal information to market to me.” <E T="03">or</E> “ Do not use my personal information to market to me.” A financial institution that chooses to offer an opt-out for joint marketing must include the following statement: “ Do not share my personal information with other financial institutions to jointly market to me.”</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Barcodes.</E> A financial institution may elect to include a barcode and/or “tagline” (an internal identifier) in 6-point font at the bottom of page one, as needed for information internal to the institution, so long as <PRTPAGE P="520"/>these do not interfere with the clarity or text of the form.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">3. Page Two</HD>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General Instructions for the Questions.</E> Certain of the Questions may be customized as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">“Who is providing this notice?”</E> This question may be omitted where only one financial institution provides the model form and that institution is clearly identified in the title on page one. Two or more financial institutions that jointly provide the model form must use this question to identify themselves as required by § 1016.9(f) of this part. Where the list of institutions exceeds four (4) lines, the institution must describe in the response to this question the general types of institutions jointly providing the notice and must separately identify those institutions, in minimum 8-point font, directly following the “Other important information” box, or, if that box is not included in the institution's form, directly following the “Definitions.” The list may appear in a multi-column format.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">“How does [name of financial institution] protect my personal information?”</E> The financial institution may only provide additional information pertaining to its safeguards practices following the designated response to this question. Such information may include information about the institution's use of cookies or other measures it uses to safeguard personal information. Institutions are limited to a maximum of 30 additional words.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">“How does [name of financial institution] collect my personal information?”</E> Institutions must use five (5) of the following terms to complete the bulleted list for this question: Open an account; deposit money; pay your bills; apply for a loan; use your credit or debit card; seek financial or tax advice; apply for insurance; pay insurance premiums; file an insurance claim; seek advice about your investments; buy securities from us; sell securities to us; direct us to buy securities; direct us to sell your securities; make deposits or withdrawals from your account; enter into an investment advisory contract; give us your income information; provide employment information; give us your employment history; tell us about your investment or retirement portfolio; tell us about your investment or retirement earnings; apply for financing; apply for a lease; provide account information; give us your contact information; pay us by check; give us your wage statements; provide your mortgage information; make a wire transfer; tell us who receives the money; tell us where to send the money; show your government-issued ID; show your driver's license; order a commodity futures or option trade.

            <P>(4) <E T="03">“Why can't I limit all sharing?”</E> Institutions that describe state privacy law provisions in the <E T="03">“Other important information”</E> box must use the bracketed sentence: “See below for more on your rights under state law.” Other institutions must omit this sentence.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">“What happens when I limit sharing for an account I hold jointly with someone else?”</E> Only financial institutions that provide opt-out options must use this question. Other institutions must omit this question. Institutions must choose one of the following two statements to respond to this question: “Your choices will apply to everyone on your account.” or “Your choices will apply to everyone on your account—unless you tell us otherwise.” Financial institutions that provide insurance products or services and elect to use the model form may substitute the word “policy” for “account” in these statements.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">General Instructions for the Definitions.</E> The financial institution must customize the space below the responses to the three definitions in this section. This specific information must be in italicized lettering to set off the information from the standardized definitions.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Affiliates.</E> As required by § 1016.6(a)(3) of this part, where [<E T="03">affiliate information</E>] appears, the financial institution must:</P>
            <P>(i) If it has no affiliates, state: “<E T="03">[name of financial institution] has no affiliates”;</E>
            </P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose, scope, and model forms and disclosures.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The purpose of this part is to implement the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). This part generally applies to persons that obtain and use information about consumers to determine the consumer's eligibility for products, services, or employment, share such information among affiliates, and furnish information to consumer reporting agencies.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Scope.</E> (1) [Reserved]</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Institutions covered.</E> (i) Except as otherwise provided in this part, this part applies to any person subject to the FCRA except for a person excluded from coverage of this part by section 1029 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010, title X of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Public Law 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376.</P>
            <P>(ii) For purposes of appendix B to this part, financial institutions as defined in section 509 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (12 U.S.C. 6809), may use the model notices in appendix B to this part to comply with the notice requirement in section 623(a)(7) of the FCRA (15 U.S.C. 1681s-2(a)(7)).</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Model forms and disclosures</E>—(1) <E T="03">Use.</E> Appendices D, H, I, K, L, M, and N contain model forms and disclosures. These appendices carry out the directive in FCRA that the Bureau prescribe such model forms and disclosures. Use or distribution of these model forms and disclosures, or substantially similar forms and disclosures, will constitute compliance with any section or subsection of the FCRA requiring that such forms and disclosures be used by or supplied to any person.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Definition. Substantially similar</E> means that all information in the Bureau's prescribed model is included in the document that is distributed, and that the document distributed is formatted in a way consistent with the format prescribed by the Bureau. The document that is distributed shall not include anything that interferes with, detracts from, or otherwise undermines the information contained in the Bureau's prescribed model. Until January 1, 2013, the model forms in appendices B, E, F, G, and H to 16 CFR part 698, as those appendices existed as of October 1, 2011, are deemed substantially similar to the corresponding model forms in appendices H, I, K, M, and N to this part, and the model forms in appendix H to 12 CFR part 222, as that appendix existed as of October 1, 2011, are deemed substantially similar to the corresponding model forms in appendix H to this part.</P>

            <P>For purposes of this part, unless explicitly stated otherwise:</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Act</E> means the FCRA (15 U.S.C. 1681 <E T="03">et seq.</E>).<PRTPAGE P="523"/>
            </P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Affiliate</E> means any company that is related by common ownership or common corporate control with another company.

            <P>(c) [Reserved]</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Common ownership or common corporate control</E> means a relationship between two companies under which:</P>
            <P>(1) One company has, with respect to the other company:</P>
            <P>(i) Ownership, control, or power to vote 25 percent or more of the outstanding shares of any class of voting security of a company, directly or indirectly, or acting through one or more other persons;</P>
            <P>(ii) Control in any manner over the election of a majority of the directors, trustees, or general partners (or individuals exercising similar functions) of a company; or</P>
            <P>(iii) The power to exercise, directly or indirectly, a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company, as determined by the applicable prudential regulator (as defined in 12 U.S.C. 5481(24)) (a credit union is presumed to have a controlling influence over the management or policies of a credit union service corporation if the credit union service corporation is 67% owned by credit unions) or, where there is no prudential regulator, by the Bureau; or</P>
            <P>(2) Any other person has, with respect to both companies, a relationship described in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (d)(1)(ii).</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Company</E> means any corporation, limited liability company, business trust, general or limited partnership, association, or similar organization.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Consumer</E> means an individual.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Identifying information</E> means any name or number that may be used, alone or in conjunction with any other information, to identify a specific person, including any:</P>
            <P>(1) Name, social security number, date of birth, official state or government issued driver's license or identification number, alien registration number, government passport number, employer or taxpayer identification number;</P>
            <P>(2) Unique biometric data, such as fingerprint, voice print, retina or iris image, or other unique physical representation;</P>
            <P>(3) Unique electronic identification number, address, or routing code; or</P>
            <P>(4) Telecommunication identifying information or access device (as defined in 18 U.S.C. 1029(e)).</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Identity theft</E> means a fraud committed or attempted using the identifying information of another person without authority.</P>
            <P>(i)(1) <E T="03">Identity theft report</E> means a report:</P>
            <P>(i) That alleges identity theft with as much specificity as the consumer can provide;</P>
            <P>(ii) That is a copy of an official, valid report filed by the consumer with a Federal, state, or local law enforcement agency, including the United States Postal Inspection Service, the filing of which subjects the person filing the report to criminal penalties relating to the filing of false information, if, in fact, the information in the report is false; and</P>
            <P>(iii) That may include additional information or documentation that an information furnisher or consumer reporting agency reasonably requests for the purpose of determining the validity of the alleged identity theft, provided that the information furnisher or consumer reporting agency:</P>
            <P>(A) Makes such request not later than fifteen days after the date of receipt of the copy of the report form identified in Paragraph (i)(1)(ii) of this section or the request by the consumer for the particular service, whichever shall be the later;</P>
            <P>(B) Makes any supplemental requests for information or documentation and final determination on the acceptance of the identity theft report within another fifteen days after its initial request for information or documentation; and</P>

            <P>(C) Shall have five days to make a final determination on the acceptance of the identity theft report, in the event that the consumer reporting agency or information furnisher receives any such additional information or documentation on the eleventh day or later within the fifteen day period <PRTPAGE P="524"/>set forth in Paragraph (i)(1)(iii)(B) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) Examples of the specificity referenced in Paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this section are provided for illustrative purposes only, as follows:</P>
            <P>(i) Specific dates relating to the identity theft such as when the loss or theft of personal information occurred or when the fraud(s) using the personal information occurred, and how the consumer discovered or otherwise learned of the theft.</P>
            <P>(ii) Identification information or any other information about the perpetrator, if known.</P>
            <P>(iii) Name(s) of information furnisher(s), account numbers, or other relevant account information related to the identity theft.</P>
            <P>(iv) Any other information known to the consumer about the identity theft.</P>
            <P>(3) Examples of when it would or would not be reasonable to request additional information or documentation referenced in Paragraph (i)(1)(iii) of this section are provided for illustrative purposes only, as follows:</P>
            <P>(i) A law enforcement report containing detailed information about the identity theft and the signature, badge number or other identification information of the individual law enforcement official taking the report should be sufficient on its face to support a victim's request. In this case, without an identifiable concern, such as an indication that the report was fraudulent, it would not be reasonable for an information furnisher or consumer reporting agency to request additional information or documentation.</P>

            <P>(ii) A consumer might provide a law enforcement report similar to the report in Paragraph (i)(1) of this section but certain important information such as the consumer's date of birth or Social Security number may be missing because the consumer chose not to provide it. The information furnisher or consumer reporting agency could accept this report, but it would be reasonable to require that the consumer provide the missing information. The Bureau's Identity Theft Affidavit is available on the Bureau's Web site (<E T="03">consumerfinance.gov/learnmore</E>). The version of this form developed by the Federal Trade Commission, available on the FTC's Web site (<E T="03">ftc.gov/idtheft</E>), remains valid and sufficient for this purpose.</P>
            <P>(iii) A consumer might provide a law enforcement report generated by an automated system with a simple allegation that an identity theft occurred to support a request for a tradeline block or cessation of information furnishing. In such a case, it would be reasonable for an information furnisher or consumer reporting agency to ask that the consumer fill out and have notarized the Bureau's Identity Theft Affidavit or a similar form and provide some form of identification documentation.</P>
            <P>(iv) A consumer might provide a law enforcement report generated by an automated system with a simple allegation that an identity theft occurred to support a request for an extended fraud alert. In this case, it would not be reasonable for a consumer reporting agency to require additional documentation or information, such as a notarized affidavit.</P>
            <P>(j) [Reserved]</P>
            <P>(k) <E T="03">Medical information</E> means:</P>
            <P>(1) Information or data, whether oral or recorded, in any form or medium, created by or derived from a health care provider or the consumer, that relates to:</P>

            <P>(ii) The provision of health care to an individual; or</P>
            <P>(iii) The payment for the provision of health care to an individual.</P>

            <P>(i) The age or gender of a consumer;</P>
            <P>(ii) Demographic information about the consumer, including a consumer's residence address or email address;</P>
            <P>(iii) Any other information about a consumer that does not relate to the physical, mental, or behavioral health or condition of a consumer, including the existence or value of any insurance policy; or</P>
            <P>(iv) Information that does not identify a specific consumer.</P>
            <P>(l) <E T="03">Person</E> means any individual, partnership, corporation, trust, estate cooperative, association, government or governmental subdivision or agency, or other entity.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Coverage.</E> Subpart C of this part applies to any person that uses information from its affiliates for the purpose of marketing solicitations, or provides information to its affiliates for that purpose, other than a person excluded from coverage of this part by section 1029 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010, title X of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Public Law 111-203, 124 Stat. 137.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For purposes of this subpart:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Clear and conspicuous.</E> The term “clear and conspicuous” means reasonably understandable and designed to call attention to the nature and significance of the information presented.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Concise</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> The term “concise” means a reasonably brief expression or statement.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Combination with other required disclosures.</E> A notice required by this subpart may be concise even if it is combined with other disclosures required or authorized by Federal or state law.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Eligibility information.</E> The term “eligibility information” means any information the communication of which would be a consumer report if the exclusions from the definition of “consumer report” in section 603(d)(2)(A) of the Act did not apply. Eligibility information does not include aggregate or blind data that does not contain personal identifiers such as account numbers, names, or addresses.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Pre-existing business relationship</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> The term “pre-existing business relationship” means a relationship between a person, or a person's licensed agent, and a consumer based on:</P>
            <P>(A) A financial contract between the person and the consumer which is in force on the date on which the consumer is sent a solicitation covered by this subpart;</P>
            <P>(B) The purchase, rental, or lease by the consumer of the person's goods or services, or a financial transaction (including holding an active account or a policy in force or having another continuing relationship) between the consumer and the person, during the 18-month period immediately preceding the date on which the consumer is sent a solicitation covered by this subpart; or</P>
            <P>(C) An inquiry or application by the consumer regarding a product or service offered by that person during the three-month period immediately preceding the date on which the consumer is sent a solicitation covered by this subpart.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Examples of pre-existing business relationships.</E> (A) If a consumer has a time deposit account, such as a certificate of deposit, at a financial institution that is currently in force, the financial institution has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and can use eligibility information it receives from its affiliates to make solicitations to the consumer about its products or services.</P>
            <P>(B) If a consumer obtained a certificate of deposit from a financial institution, but did not renew the certificate at maturity, the financial institution has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and can use eligibility information it receives from its affiliates to make solicitations to the consumer about its products or services for 18 months after the date of maturity of the certificate of deposit.</P>

            <P>(C) If a consumer obtains a mortgage, the mortgage lender has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer. If the mortgage lender sells the consumer's entire loan to an investor, the mortgage lender has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and can use eligibility information it receives from its affiliates to make solicitations to the consumer about its products or services for 18 months after the date it sells the loan, and the investor has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer upon purchasing the loan. If, however, the mortgage lender sells a fractional interest in the consumer's loan to an investor but also retains an ownership interest in the loan, the mortgage lender continues to have a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer, but the investor does <PRTPAGE P="526"/>not have a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer. If the mortgage lender retains ownership of the loan, but sells ownership of the servicing rights to the consumer's loan, the mortgage lender continues to have a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer. The purchaser of the servicing rights also has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer as of the date it purchases ownership of the servicing rights, but only if it collects payments from or otherwise deals directly with the consumer on a continuing basis.</P>
            <P>(D) If a consumer applies to a financial institution for a product or service that it offers, but does not obtain a product or service from or enter into a financial contract or transaction with the institution, the financial institution has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and can therefore use eligibility information it receives from an affiliate to make solicitations to the consumer about its products or services for three months after the date of the application.</P>
            <P>(E) If a consumer makes a telephone inquiry to a financial institution about its products or services and provides contact information to the institution, but does not obtain a product or service from or enter into a financial contract or transaction with the institution, the financial institution has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and can therefore use eligibility information it receives from an affiliate to make solicitations to the consumer about its products or services for three months after the date of the inquiry.</P>
            <P>(F) If a consumer makes an inquiry to a financial institution by email about its products or services, but does not obtain a product or service from or enter into a financial contract or transaction with the institution, the financial institution has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and can therefore use eligibility information it receives from an affiliate to make solicitations to the consumer about its products or services for three months after the date of the inquiry.</P>
            <P>(G) If a consumer has an existing relationship with a financial institution that is part of a group of affiliated companies, makes a telephone call to the centralized call center for the group of affiliated companies to inquire about products or services offered by the insurance affiliate, and provides contact information to the call center, the call constitutes an inquiry to the insurance affiliate that offers those products or services. The insurance affiliate has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and can therefore use eligibility information it receives from its affiliated financial institution to make solicitations to the consumer about its products or services for three months after the date of the inquiry.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Examples where no pre-existing business relationship is created.</E> (A) If a consumer makes a telephone call to a centralized call center for a group of affiliated companies to inquire about the consumer's existing account at a financial institution, the call does not constitute an inquiry to any affiliate other than the financial institution that holds the consumer's account and does not establish a pre-existing business relationship between the consumer and any affiliate of the account-holding financial institution.</P>
            <P>(B) If a consumer who has a deposit account with a financial institution makes a telephone call to an affiliate of the institution to ask about the affiliate's retail locations and hours, but does not make an inquiry about the affiliate's products or services, the call does not constitute an inquiry and does not establish a pre-existing business relationship between the consumer and the affiliate. Also, the affiliate's capture of the consumer's telephone number does not constitute an inquiry and does not establish a pre-existing business relationship between the consumer and the affiliate.</P>

            <P>(C) If a consumer makes a telephone call to a financial institution in response to an advertisement that offers a free promotional item to consumers who call a toll-free number, but the advertisement does not indicate that the financial institution's products or services will be marketed to consumers who call in response, the call does not <PRTPAGE P="527"/>create a pre-existing business relationship between the consumer and the financial institution because the consumer has not made an inquiry about a product or service offered by the institution, but has merely responded to an offer for a free promotional item.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Solicitation</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> The term “solicitation” means the marketing of a product or service initiated by a person to a particular consumer that is:</P>
            <P>(A) Based on eligibility information communicated to that person by its affiliate as described in this subpart; and</P>
            <P>(B) Intended to encourage the consumer to purchase or obtain such product or service.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Exclusion of marketing directed at the general public.</E> A solicitation does not include marketing communications that are directed at the general public. For example, television, general circulation magazine, and billboard advertisements do not constitute solicitations, even if those communications are intended to encourage consumers to purchase products and services from the person initiating the communications.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Examples of solicitations.</E> A solicitation would include, for example, a telemarketing call, direct mail, email, or other form of marketing communication directed to a particular consumer that is based on eligibility information received from an affiliate.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">You</E> means a person described in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1022.21</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Affiliate marketing opt-out and exceptions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Initial notice and opt-out requirement</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> You may not use eligibility information about a consumer that you receive from an affiliate to make a solicitation for marketing purposes to the consumer, unless:</P>
            <P>(i) It is clearly and conspicuously disclosed to the consumer in writing or, if the consumer agrees, electronically, in a concise notice that you may use eligibility information about that consumer received from an affiliate to make solicitations for marketing purposes to the consumer;</P>
            <P>(ii) The consumer is provided a reasonable opportunity and a reasonable and simple method to “opt out,” or prohibit you from using eligibility information to make solicitations for marketing purposes to the consumer; and</P>
            <P>(iii) The consumer has not opted out.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Example.</E> A consumer has a homeowner's insurance policy with an insurance company. The insurance company furnishes eligibility information about the consumer to its affiliated creditor. Based on that eligibility information, the creditor wants to make a solicitation to the consumer about its home equity loan products. The creditor does not have a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and none of the other exceptions apply. The creditor is prohibited from using eligibility information received from its insurance affiliate to make solicitations to the consumer about its home equity loan products unless the consumer is given a notice and opportunity to opt out and the consumer does not opt out.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Affiliates who may provide the notice.</E> The notice required by this paragraph must be provided:</P>
            <P>(i) By an affiliate that has or has previously had a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer; or</P>
            <P>(ii) As part of a joint notice from two or more members of an affiliated group of companies, provided that at least one of the affiliates on the joint notice has or has previously had a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Making solicitations</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> For purposes of this subpart, you make a solicitation for marketing purposes if:</P>
            <P>(i) You receive eligibility information from an affiliate;</P>
            <P>(ii) You use that eligibility information to do one or more of the following:</P>
            <P>(A) Identify the consumer or type of consumer to receive a solicitation;</P>
            <P>(B) Establish criteria used to select the consumer to receive a solicitation; or</P>
            <P>(C) Decide which of your products or services to market to the consumer or tailor your solicitation to that consumer; and</P>

            <P>(iii) As a result of your use of the eligibility information, the consumer is provided a solicitation.<PRTPAGE P="528"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Receiving eligibility information from an affiliate, including through a common database.</E> You may receive eligibility information from an affiliate in various ways, including when the affiliate places that information into a common database that you may access.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Receipt or use of eligibility information by your service provider.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, you receive or use an affiliate's eligibility information if a service provider acting on your behalf (whether an affiliate or a nonaffiliated third party) receives or uses that information in the manner described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii) of this section. All relevant facts and circumstances will determine whether a person is acting as your service provider when it receives or uses an affiliate's eligibility information in connection with marketing your products and services.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Use by an affiliate of its own eligibility information.</E> Unless you have used eligibility information that you receive from an affiliate in the manner described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, you do not make a solicitation subject to this subpart if your affiliate:</P>
            <P>(i) Uses its own eligibility information that it obtained in connection with a pre-existing business relationship it has or had with the consumer to market your products or services to the consumer; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Directs its service provider to use the affiliate's own eligibility information that it obtained in connection with a pre-existing business relationship it has or had with the consumer to market your products or services to the consumer, and you do not communicate directly with the service provider regarding that use.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Use of eligibility information by a service provider</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> You do not make a solicitation subject to subpart C of this part if a service provider (including an affiliated or third-party service provider that maintains or accesses a common database that you may access) receives eligibility information from your affiliate that your affiliate obtained in connection with a pre-existing business relationship it has or had with the consumer and uses that eligibility information to market your products or services to the consumer, so long as:</P>
            <P>(A) Your affiliate controls access to and use of its eligibility information by the service provider (including the right to establish the specific terms and conditions under which the service provider may use such information to market your products or services);</P>
            <P>(B) Your affiliate establishes specific terms and conditions under which the service provider may access and use the affiliate's eligibility information to market your products and services (or those of affiliates generally) to the consumer, such as the identity of the affiliated companies whose products or services may be marketed to the consumer by the service provider, the types of products or services of affiliated companies that may be marketed, and the number of times the consumer may receive marketing materials, and periodically evaluates the service provider's compliance with those terms and conditions;</P>
            <P>(C) Your affiliate requires the service provider to implement reasonable policies and procedures designed to ensure that the service provider uses the affiliate's eligibility information in accordance with the terms and conditions established by the affiliate relating to the marketing of your products or services;</P>
            <P>(D) Your affiliate is identified on or with the marketing materials provided to the consumer; and</P>
            <P>(E) You do not directly use your affiliate's eligibility information in the manner described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Writing requirements.</E> (A) The requirements of paragraphs (b)(5)(i)(A) and (C) of this section must be set forth in a written agreement between your affiliate and the service provider; and</P>
            <P>(B) The specific terms and conditions established by your affiliate as provided in paragraph (b)(5)(i)(B) of this section must be set forth in writing.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Examples of making solicitations.</E> (i) A consumer has a deposit account with a financial institution, which is affiliated with an insurance company. The insurance company receives eligibility information about the consumer from <PRTPAGE P="529"/>the financial institution. The insurance company uses that eligibility information to identify the consumer to receive a solicitation about insurance products, and, as a result, the insurance company provides a solicitation to the consumer about its insurance products. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the insurance company has made a solicitation to the consumer.</P>
            <P>(ii) The same facts as in the example in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, except that after using the eligibility information to identify the consumer to receive a solicitation about insurance products, the insurance company asks the financial institution to send the solicitation to the consumer and the financial institution does so. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the insurance company has made a solicitation to the consumer because it used eligibility information about the consumer that it received from an affiliate to identify the consumer to receive a solicitation about its products or services, and, as a result, a solicitation was provided to the consumer about the insurance company's products.</P>
            <P>(iii) The same facts as in the example in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, except that eligibility information about consumers that have deposit accounts with the financial institution is placed into a common database that all members of the affiliated group of companies may independently access and use. Without using the financial institution's eligibility information, the insurance company develops selection criteria and provides those criteria, marketing materials, and related instructions to the financial institution. The financial institution reviews eligibility information about its own consumers using the selection criteria provided by the insurance company to determine which consumers should receive the insurance company's marketing materials and sends marketing materials about the insurance company's products to those consumers. Even though the insurance company has received eligibility information through the common database as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, it did not use that information to identify consumers or establish selection criteria; instead, the financial institution used its own eligibility information. Therefore, pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, the insurance company has not made a solicitation to the consumer.</P>
            <P>(iv) The same facts as in the example in paragraph (b)(6)(iii) of this section, except that the financial institution provides the insurance company's criteria to the financial institution's service provider and directs the service provider to use the financial institution's eligibility information to identify financial institution consumers who meet the criteria and to send the insurance company's marketing materials to those consumers. The insurance company does not communicate directly with the service provider regarding the use of the financial institution's information to market its products to the financial institution's consumers. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, the insurance company has not made a solicitation to the consumer.</P>

            <P>(v) An affiliated group of companies includes a financial institution, an insurance company, and a service provider. Each affiliate in the group places information about its consumers into a common database. The service provider has access to all information in the common database. The financial institution controls access to and use of its eligibility information by the service provider. This control is set forth in a written agreement between the financial institution and the service provider. The written agreement also requires the service provider to establish reasonable policies and procedures designed to ensure that the service provider uses the financial institution's eligibility information in accordance with specific terms and conditions established by the financial institution relating to the marketing of the products and services of all affiliates, including the insurance company. In a separate written communication, the financial institution specifies the terms and conditions under which the service provider may use the financial institution's eligibility information to <PRTPAGE P="530"/>market the insurance company's products and services to the financial institution's consumers. The specific terms and conditions are: a list of affiliated companies (including the insurance company) whose products or services may be marketed to the financial institution's consumers by the service provider; the specific products or types of products that may be marketed to the financial institution's consumers by the service provider; the categories of eligibility information that may be used by the service provider in marketing products or services to the financial institution's consumers; the types or categories of the financial institution's consumers to whom the service provider may market products or services of financial institution affiliates; the number and/or types of marketing communications that the service provider may send to the financial institution's consumers; and the length of time during which the service provider may market the products or services of the financial institution's affiliates to its consumers. The financial institution periodically evaluates the service provider's compliance with these terms and conditions. The insurance company asks the service provider to market insurance products to certain consumers who have deposit accounts with the financial institution. Without using the financial institution's eligibility information, the insurance company develops selection criteria and provides those criteria, marketing materials, and related instructions to the service provider. The service provider uses the financial institution's eligibility information from the common database to identify the financial institution's consumers to whom insurance products will be marketed. When the insurance company's marketing materials are provided to the identified consumers, the name of the financial institution is displayed on the insurance marketing materials, an introductory letter that accompanies the marketing materials, an account statement that accompanies the marketing materials, or the envelope containing the marketing materials. The requirements of paragraph (b)(5) of this section have been satisfied, and the insurance company has not made a solicitation to the consumer.</P>
            <P>(vi) The same facts as in the example in paragraph (b)(6)(v) of this section, except that the terms and conditions permit the service provider to use the financial institution's eligibility information to market the products and services of other affiliates to the financial institution's consumers whenever the service provider deems it appropriate to do so. The service provider uses the financial institution's eligibility information in accordance with the discretion afforded to it by the terms and conditions. Because the terms and conditions are not specific, the requirements of paragraph (b)(5) of this section have not been satisfied.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Exceptions.</E> The provisions of this subpart do not apply to you if you use eligibility information that you receive from an affiliate:</P>
            <P>(1) To make a solicitation for marketing purposes to a consumer with whom you have a pre-existing business relationship;</P>
            <P>(2) To facilitate communications to an individual for whose benefit you provide employee benefit or other services pursuant to a contract with an employer related to and arising out of the current employment relationship or status of the individual as a participant or beneficiary of an employee benefit plan;</P>
            <P>(3) To perform services on behalf of an affiliate, except that this subparagraph shall not be construed as permitting you to send solicitations on behalf of an affiliate if the affiliate would not be permitted to send the solicitation as a result of the election of the consumer to opt out under this subpart;</P>
            <P>(4) In response to a communication about your products or services initiated by the consumer;</P>
            <P>(5) In response to an authorization or request by the consumer to receive solicitations; or</P>
            <P>(6) If your compliance with this subpart would prevent you from complying with any provision of state insurance laws pertaining to unfair discrimination in any state in which you are lawfully doing business.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Examples of exceptions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Example of the pre-existing business relationship <PRTPAGE P="531"/>exception.</E> A consumer has a deposit account with a financial institution. The consumer also has a relationship with the financial institution's securities affiliate for management of the consumer's securities portfolio. The financial institution receives eligibility information about the consumer from its securities affiliate and uses that information to make a solicitation to the consumer about the financial institution's wealth management services. The financial institution may make this solicitation even if the consumer has not been given a notice and opportunity to opt out because the financial institution has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Examples of service provider exception.</E> (i) A consumer has an insurance policy issued by an insurance company. The insurance company furnishes eligibility information about the consumer to its affiliated financial institution. Based on that eligibility information, the financial institution wants to make a solicitation to the consumer about its deposit products. The financial institution does not have a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and none of the other exceptions in paragraph (c) of this section apply. The consumer has been given an opt-out notice and has elected to opt out of receiving such solicitations. The financial institution asks a service provider to send the solicitation to the consumer on its behalf. The service provider may not send the solicitation on behalf of the financial institution because, as a result of the consumer's opt-out election, the financial institution is not permitted to make the solicitation.</P>
            <P>(ii) The same facts as in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, except the consumer has been given an opt-out notice, but has not elected to opt out. The financial institution asks a service provider to send the solicitation to the consumer on its behalf. The service provider may send the solicitation on behalf of the financial institution because, as a result of the consumer's not opting out, the financial institution is permitted to make the solicitation.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Examples of consumer-initiated communications.</E> (i) A consumer who has a deposit account with a financial institution initiates a communication with the financial institution's credit card affiliate to request information about a credit card. The credit card affiliate may use eligibility information about the consumer it obtains from the financial institution or any other affiliate to make solicitations regarding credit card products in response to the consumer-initiated communication.</P>
            <P>(ii) A consumer who has a deposit account with a financial institution contacts the institution to request information about how to save and invest for a child's college education without specifying the type of product in which the consumer may be interested. Information about a range of different products or services offered by the financial institution and one or more affiliates of the institution may be responsive to that communication. Such products or services may include the following: mutual funds offered by the institution's mutual fund affiliate; section 529 plans offered by the institution, its mutual fund affiliate, or another securities affiliate; or trust services offered by a different financial institution in the affiliated group. Any affiliate offering investment products or services that would be responsive to the consumer's request for information about saving and investing for a child's college education may use eligibility information to make solicitations to the consumer in response to this communication.</P>
            <P>(iii) A credit card issuer makes a marketing call to the consumer without using eligibility information received from an affiliate. The issuer leaves a voice-mail message that invites the consumer to call a toll-free number to apply for the issuer's credit card. If the consumer calls the toll-free number to inquire about the credit card, the call is a consumer-initiated communication about a product or service and the credit card issuer may now use eligibility information it receives from its affiliates to make solicitations to the consumer.</P>

            <P>(iv) A consumer calls a financial institution to ask about retail locations and hours, but does not request information about products or services. The institution may not use eligibility information it receives from an affiliate <PRTPAGE P="532"/>to make solicitations to the consumer about its products or services because the consumer-initiated communication does not relate to the financial institution's products or services. Thus, the use of eligibility information received from an affiliate would not be responsive to the communication and the exception does not apply.</P>
            <P>(v) A consumer calls a financial institution to ask about retail locations and hours. The customer service representative asks the consumer if there is a particular product or service about which the consumer is seeking information. The consumer responds that the consumer wants to stop in and find out about certificates of deposit. The customer service representative offers to provide that information by telephone and mail additional information and application materials to the consumer. The consumer agrees and provides or confirms contact information for receipt of the materials to be mailed. The financial institution may use eligibility information it receives from an affiliate to make solicitations to the consumer about certificates of deposit because such solicitations would respond to the consumer-initiated communication about products or services.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Examples of consumer authorization or request for solicitations.</E> (i) A consumer who obtains a mortgage from a mortgage lender authorizes or requests information about homeowner's insurance offered by the mortgage lender's insurance affiliate. Such authorization or request, whether given to the mortgage lender or to the insurance affiliate, would permit the insurance affiliate to use eligibility information about the consumer it obtains from the mortgage lender or any other affiliate to make solicitations to the consumer about homeowner's insurance.</P>
            <P>(ii) A consumer completes an online application to apply for a credit card from a credit card issuer. The issuer's online application contains a blank check box that the consumer may check to authorize or request information from the credit card issuer's affiliates. The consumer checks the box. The consumer has authorized or requested solicitations from the card issuer's affiliates.</P>
            <P>(iii) A consumer completes an online application to apply for a credit card from a credit card issuer. The issuer's online application contains a pre-selected check box indicating that the consumer authorizes or requests information from the issuer's affiliates. The consumer does not deselect the check box. The consumer has not authorized or requested solicitations from the card issuer's affiliates.</P>
            <P>(iv) The terms and conditions of a credit card account agreement contain preprinted boilerplate language stating that by applying to open an account the consumer authorizes or requests to receive solicitations from the credit card issuer's affiliates. The consumer has not authorized or requested solicitations from the card issuer's affiliates.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Relation to affiliate-sharing notice and opt-out.</E> Nothing in this subpart limits the responsibility of a person to comply with the notice and opt-out provisions of section 603(d)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act where applicable.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Scope of opt-out</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Except as otherwise provided in this section, the consumer's election to opt out prohibits any affiliate covered by the opt-out notice from using eligibility information received from another affiliate as described in the notice to make solicitations to the consumer.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Continuing relationship.</E> (i) <E T="03">In general.</E> If the consumer establishes a continuing relationship with you or your affiliate, an opt-out notice may apply to eligibility information obtained in connection with:</P>
            <P>(A) A single continuing relationship or multiple continuing relationships that the consumer establishes with you or your affiliates, including continuing relationships established subsequent to delivery of the opt-out notice, so long as the notice adequately describes the continuing relationships covered by the opt-out; or</P>

            <P>(B) Any other transaction between the consumer and you or your affiliates as described in the notice.<PRTPAGE P="533"/>
            </P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Examples of continuing relationships.</E> A consumer has a continuing relationship with you or your affiliate if the consumer:</P>
            <P>(A) Opens a deposit or investment account with you or your affiliate;</P>
            <P>(B) Obtains a loan for which you or your affiliate owns the servicing rights;</P>
            <P>(C) Purchases an insurance product from you or your affiliate;</P>
            <P>(D) Holds an investment product through you or your affiliate, such as when you act or your affiliate acts as a custodian for securities or for assets in an individual retirement arrangement;</P>
            <P>(E) Enters into an agreement or understanding with you or your affiliate whereby you or your affiliate undertakes to arrange or broker a home mortgage loan for the consumer;</P>
            <P>(F) Enters into a lease of personal property with you or your affiliate; or</P>
            <P>(G) Obtains financial, investment, or economic advisory services from you or your affiliate for a fee.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">No continuing relationship.</E> (i) <E T="03">In general.</E> If there is no continuing relationship between a consumer and you or your affiliate, and you or your affiliate obtain eligibility information about a consumer in connection with a transaction with the consumer, such as an isolated transaction or a credit application that is denied, an opt-out notice provided to the consumer only applies to eligibility information obtained in connection with that transaction.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Examples of isolated transactions.</E> An isolated transaction occurs if:</P>
            <P>(A) The consumer uses your or your affiliate's ATM to withdraw cash from an account at another financial institution; or</P>
            <P>(B) You or your affiliate sells the consumer a cashier's check or money order, airline tickets, travel insurance, or traveler's checks in isolated transactions.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Menu of alternatives.</E> A consumer may be given the opportunity to choose from a menu of alternatives when electing to prohibit solicitations, such as by electing to prohibit solicitations from certain types of affiliates covered by the opt-out notice but not other types of affiliates covered by the notice, electing to prohibit solicitations based on certain types of eligibility information but not other types of eligibility information, or electing to prohibit solicitations by certain methods of delivery but not other methods of delivery. However, one of the alternatives must allow the consumer to prohibit all solicitations from all of the affiliates that are covered by the notice.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Special rule for a notice following termination of all continuing relationships</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> A consumer must be given a new opt-out notice if, after all continuing relationships with you or your affiliate(s) are terminated, the consumer subsequently establishes another continuing relationship with you or your affiliate(s) and the consumer's eligibility information is to be used to make a solicitation. The new opt-out notice must apply, at a minimum, to eligibility information obtained in connection with the new continuing relationship. Consistent with paragraph (b) of this section, the consumer's decision not to opt out after receiving the new opt-out notice would not override a prior opt-out election by the consumer that applies to eligibility information obtained in connection with a terminated relationship, regardless of whether the new opt-out notice applies to eligibility information obtained in connection with the terminated relationship.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Example.</E> A consumer has a checking account with a financial institution that is part of an affiliated group. The consumer closes the checking account. One year after closing the checking account, the consumer opens a savings account with the same financial institution. The consumer must be given a new notice and opportunity to opt out before the financial institution's affiliates may make solicitations to the consumer using eligibility information obtained by the financial institution in connection with the new savings account relationship, regardless of whether the consumer opted out in connection with the checking account.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Duration of opt-out.</E> The election of a consumer to opt out must be effective for a period of at least five years (the “opt-out period”) beginning when the consumer's opt-out election is received and implemented, unless the <PRTPAGE P="534"/>consumer subsequently revokes the opt-out in writing or, if the consumer agrees, electronically. An opt-out period of more than five years may be established, including an opt-out period that does not expire unless revoked by the consumer.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Time of opt-out.</E> A consumer may opt out at any time.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Contents of opt-out notice</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> A notice must be clear, conspicuous, and concise, and must accurately disclose:</P>
            <P>(i) The name of the affiliate(s) providing the notice. If the notice is provided jointly by multiple affiliates and each affiliate shares a common name, such as “ABC,” then the notice may indicate that it is being provided by multiple companies with the ABC name or multiple companies in the ABC group or family of companies, for example, by stating that the notice is provided by “all of the ABC companies,” “the ABC banking, credit card, insurance, and securities companies,” or by listing the name of each affiliate providing the notice. But if the affiliates providing the joint notice do not all share a common name, then the notice must either separately identify each affiliate by name or identify each of the common names used by those affiliates, for example, by stating that the notice is provided by “all of the ABC and XYZ companies” or by “the ABC banking and credit card companies and the XYZ insurance companies;”</P>
            <P>(ii) A list of the affiliates or types of affiliates whose use of eligibility information is covered by the notice, which may include companies that become affiliates after the notice is provided to the consumer. If each affiliate covered by the notice shares a common name, such as “ABC,” then the notice may indicate that it applies to multiple companies with the ABC name or multiple companies in the ABC group or family of companies, for example, by stating that the notice is provided by “all of the ABC companies,” “the ABC banking, credit card, insurance, and securities companies,” or by listing the name of each affiliate providing the notice. But if the affiliates covered by the notice do not all share a common name, then the notice must either separately identify each covered affiliate by name or identify each of the common names used by those affiliates, for example, by stating that the notice applies to “all of the ABC and XYZ companies” or to “the ABC banking and credit card companies and the XYZ insurance companies;”</P>
            <P>(iii) A general description of the types of eligibility information that may be used to make solicitations to the consumer;</P>
            <P>(iv) That the consumer may elect to limit the use of eligibility information to make solicitations to the consumer;</P>
            <P>(v) That the consumer's election will apply for the specified period of time stated in the notice and, if applicable, that the consumer will be allowed to renew the election once that period expires;</P>
            <P>(vi) If the notice is provided to consumers who may have previously opted out, such as if a notice is provided to consumers annually, that the consumer who has chosen to limit solicitations does not need to act again until the consumer receives a renewal notice; and</P>
            <P>(vii) A reasonable and simple method for the consumer to opt out.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Joint relationships.</E> (i) If two or more consumers jointly obtain a product or service, a single opt-out notice may be provided to the joint consumers. Any of the joint consumers may exercise the right to opt out.</P>
            <P>(ii) The opt-out notice must explain how an opt-out direction by a joint consumer will be treated. An opt-out direction by a joint consumer may be treated as applying to all of the associated joint consumers, or each joint consumer may be permitted to opt out separately. If each joint consumer is permitted to opt out separately, one of the joint consumers must be permitted to opt out on behalf of all of the joint consumers and the joint consumers must be permitted to exercise their separate rights to opt out in a single response.</P>
            <P>(iii) It is impermissible to require <E T="03">all</E> joint consumers to opt out before implementing <E T="03">any</E> opt-out direction.<PRTPAGE P="535"/>
            </P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Alternative contents.</E> If the consumer is afforded a broader right to opt out of receiving marketing than is required by this subpart, the requirements of this section may be satisfied by providing the consumer with a clear, conspicuous, and concise notice that accurately discloses the consumer's opt-out rights.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Model notices.</E> Model notices are provided in appendix C of this part.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Coordinated and consolidated notices.</E> A notice required by this subpart may be coordinated and consolidated with any other notice or disclosure required to be issued under any other provision of law by the entity providing the notice, including but not limited to the notice described in section 603(d)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act privacy notice.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Equivalent notices.</E> A notice or other disclosure that is equivalent to the notice required by this subpart, and that is provided to a consumer together with disclosures required by any other provision of law, satisfies the requirements of this section.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Reasonable opportunity to opt out.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> You must not use eligibility information about a consumer that you receive from an affiliate to make a solicitation to the consumer about your products or services, unless the consumer is provided a reasonable opportunity to opt out, as required by § 1022.21(a)(1)(ii) of this part.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Examples of a reasonable opportunity to opt out.</E> The consumer is given a reasonable opportunity to opt out if:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">By mail.</E> The opt-out notice is mailed to the consumer. The consumer is given 30 days from the date the notice is mailed to elect to opt out by any reasonable means.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">By electronic means.</E> (i) The opt-out notice is provided electronically to the consumer, such as by posting the notice at a Web site at which the consumer has obtained a product or service. The consumer acknowledges receipt of the electronic notice. The consumer is given 30 days after the date the consumer acknowledges receipt to elect to opt out by any reasonable means.</P>
            <P>(ii) The opt-out notice is provided to the consumer by email where the consumer has agreed to receive disclosures by email from the person sending the notice. The consumer is given 30 days after the email is sent to elect to opt out by any reasonable means.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">At the time of an electronic transaction.</E> The opt-out notice is provided to the consumer at the time of an electronic transaction, such as a transaction conducted on a Web site. The consumer is required to decide, as a necessary part of proceeding with the transaction, whether to opt out before completing the transaction. There is a simple process that the consumer may use to opt out at that time using the same mechanism through which the transaction is conducted.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">At the time of an in-person transaction.</E> The opt-out notice is provided to the consumer in writing at the time of an in-person transaction. The consumer is required to decide, as a necessary part of proceeding with the transaction, whether to opt out before completing the transaction, and is not permitted to complete the transaction without making a choice. There is a simple process that the consumer may use during the course of the in-person transaction to opt out, such as completing a form that requires consumers to write a “yes” or “no” to indicate their opt-out preference or that requires the consumer to check one of two blank check boxes; one that allows consumers to indicate that they want to opt out and one that allows consumers to indicate that they do not want to opt out.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">By including in a privacy notice.</E> The opt-out notice is included in a Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act privacy notice. The consumer is allowed to exercise the opt-out within a reasonable period of time and in the same manner as the opt-out under that privacy notice.</P>

            <P>(i) The information is the type of information routinely used in making credit eligibility determinations, such as information relating to debts, expenses, income, benefits, assets, collateral, or the purpose of the loan, including the use of proceeds;</P>

            <P>(ii) The creditor uses the medical information in a manner and to an extent that is no less favorable than it would use comparable information that is not medical information in a credit transaction; and<PRTPAGE P="539"/>
            </P>
            <P>(iii) The creditor does not take the consumer's physical, mental, or behavioral health, condition or history, type of treatment, or prognosis into account as part of any such determination.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Examples</E>—(i) <E T="03">Examples of the types of information routinely used in making credit eligibility determinations.</E> Paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section permits a creditor, for example, to obtain and use information about:</P>
            <P>(A) The dollar amount, repayment terms, repayment history, and similar information regarding medical debts to calculate, measure, or verify the repayment ability of the consumer, the use of proceeds, or the terms for granting credit;</P>
            <P>(B) The value, condition, and lien status of a medical device that may serve as collateral to secure a loan;</P>
            <P>(C) The dollar amount and continued eligibility for disability income, workers' compensation income, or other benefits related to health or a medical condition that is relied on as a source of repayment; or</P>
            <P>(D) The identity of creditors to whom outstanding medical debts are owed in connection with an application for credit, including but not limited to, a transaction involving the consolidation of medical debts.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Examples of uses of medical information consistent with the exception.</E> (A) A consumer includes on an application for credit information about two $20,000 debts. One debt is to a hospital; the other debt is to a retailer. The creditor contacts the hospital and the retailer to verify the amount and payment status of the debts. The creditor learns that both debts are more than 90 days past due. Any two debts of this size that are more than 90 days past due would disqualify the consumer under the creditor's established underwriting criteria. The creditor denies the application on the basis that the consumer has a poor repayment history on outstanding debts. The creditor has used medical information in a manner and to an extent no less favorable than it would use comparable non-medical information.</P>
            <P>(B) A consumer indicates on an application for a $200,000 mortgage loan that she receives $15,000 in long-term disability income each year from her former employer and has no other income. Annual income of $15,000, regardless of source, would not be sufficient to support the requested amount of credit. The creditor denies the application on the basis that the projected debt-to-income ratio of the consumer does not meet the creditor's underwriting criteria. The creditor has used medical information in a manner and to an extent that is no less favorable than it would use comparable non-medical information.</P>
            <P>(C) A consumer includes on an application for a $10,000 home equity loan that he has a $50,000 debt to a medical facility that specializes in treating a potentially terminal disease. The creditor contacts the medical facility to verify the debt and obtain the repayment history and current status of the loan. The creditor learns that the debt is current. The applicant meets the income and other requirements of the creditor's underwriting guidelines. The creditor grants the application. The creditor has used medical information in accordance with the exception.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Examples of uses of medical information inconsistent with the exception.</E> (A) A consumer applies for $25,000 of credit and includes on the application information about a $50,000 debt to a hospital. The creditor contacts the hospital to verify the amount and payment status of the debt, and learns that the debt is current and that the consumer has no delinquencies in her repayment history. If the existing debt were instead owed to a retail department store, the creditor would approve the application and extend credit based on the amount and repayment history of the outstanding debt. The creditor, however, denies the application because the consumer is indebted to a hospital. The creditor has used medical information, here the identity of the medical creditor, in a manner and to an extent that is less favorable than it would use comparable non-medical information.</P>

            <P>(B) A consumer meets with a loan officer of a creditor to apply for a mortgage loan. While filling out the loan application, the consumer informs the loan officer orally that she has a potentially terminal disease. The consumer <PRTPAGE P="540"/>meets the creditor's established requirements for the requested mortgage loan. The loan officer recommends to the credit committee that the consumer be denied credit because the consumer has that disease. The credit committee follows the loan officer's recommendation and denies the application because the consumer has a potentially terminal disease. The creditor has used medical information in a manner inconsistent with the exception by taking into account the consumer's physical, mental, or behavioral health, condition, or history, type of treatment, or prognosis as part of a determination of eligibility or continued eligibility for credit.</P>
            <P>(C) A consumer who has an apparent medical condition, such as a consumer who uses a wheelchair or an oxygen tank, meets with a loan officer to apply for a home equity loan. The consumer meets the creditor's established requirements for the requested home equity loan and the creditor typically does not require consumers to obtain a debt cancellation contract, debt suspension agreement, or credit insurance product in connection with such loans. However, based on the consumer's apparent medical condition, the loan officer recommends to the credit committee that credit be extended to the consumer only if the consumer obtains a debt cancellation contract, debt suspension agreement, or credit insurance product from a nonaffiliated third party. The credit committee agrees with the loan officer's recommendation. The loan officer informs the consumer that the consumer must obtain a debt cancellation contract, debt suspension agreement, or credit insurance product from a nonaffiliated third party to qualify for the loan. The consumer obtains one of these products and the creditor approves the loan. The creditor has used medical information in a manner inconsistent with the exception by taking into account the consumer's physical, mental, or behavioral health, condition, or history, type of treatment, or prognosis in setting conditions on the consumer's eligibility for credit.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Specific exceptions for obtaining and using medical information</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> A creditor may obtain and use medical information pertaining to a consumer in connection with any determination of the consumer's eligibility, or continued eligibility, for credit:</P>
            <P>(i) To determine whether the use of a power of attorney or legal representative that is triggered by a medical condition or event is necessary and appropriate or whether the consumer has the legal capacity to contract when a person seeks to exercise a power of attorney or act as legal representative for a consumer based on an asserted medical condition or event;</P>
            <P>(ii) To comply with applicable requirements of local, state, or Federal laws;</P>
            <P>(iii) To determine, at the consumer's request, whether the consumer qualifies for a legally permissible special credit program or credit-related assistance program that is:</P>
            <P>(A) Designed to meet the special needs of consumers with medical conditions; and</P>
            <P>(B) Established and administered pursuant to a written plan that:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Identifies the class of persons that the program is designed to benefit; and</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Sets forth the procedures and standards for extending credit or providing other credit-related assistance under the program;</P>
            <P>(iv) To the extent necessary for purposes of fraud prevention or detection;</P>
            <P>(v) In the case of credit for the purpose of financing medical products or services, to determine and verify the medical purpose of a loan and the use of proceeds;</P>
            <P>(vi) Consistent with safe and sound practices, if the consumer or the consumer's legal representative specifically requests that the creditor use medical information in determining the consumer's eligibility, or continued eligibility, for credit, to accommodate the consumer's particular circumstances, and such request is documented by the creditor;</P>
            <P>(vii) Consistent with safe and sound practices, to determine whether the provisions of a forbearance practice or program that is triggered by a medical condition or event apply to a consumer;</P>

            <P>(viii) To determine the consumer's eligibility for, the triggering of, or the <PRTPAGE P="541"/>reactivation of a debt cancellation contract or debt suspension agreement if a medical condition or event is a triggering event for the provision of benefits under the contract or agreement; or</P>
            <P>(ix) To determine the consumer's eligibility for, the triggering of, or the reactivation of a credit insurance product if a medical condition or event is a triggering event for the provision of benefits under the product.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Example of determining eligibility for a special credit program or credit assistance program.</E> A not-for-profit organization establishes a credit assistance program pursuant to a written plan that is designed to assist disabled veterans in purchasing homes by subsidizing the down payment for the home purchase mortgage loans of qualifying veterans. The organization works through mortgage lenders and requires mortgage lenders to obtain medical information about the disability of any consumer that seeks to qualify for the program, use that information to verify the consumer's eligibility for the program, and forward that information to the organization. A consumer who is a veteran applies to a creditor for a home purchase mortgage loan. The creditor informs the consumer about the credit assistance program for disabled veterans and the consumer seeks to qualify for the program. Assuming that the program complies with all applicable law, including applicable fair lending laws, the creditor may obtain and use medical information about the medical condition and disability, if any, of the consumer to determine whether the consumer qualifies for the credit assistance program.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Examples of verifying the medical purpose of the loan or the use of proceeds.</E> (i) If a consumer applies for $10,000 of credit for the purpose of financing vision correction surgery, the creditor may verify with the surgeon that the procedure will be performed. If the surgeon reports that surgery will not be performed on the consumer, the creditor may use that medical information to deny the consumer's application for credit, because the loan would not be used for the stated purpose.</P>
            <P>(ii) If a consumer applies for $10,000 of credit for the purpose of financing cosmetic surgery, the creditor may confirm the cost of the procedure with the surgeon. If the surgeon reports that the cost of the procedure is $5,000, the creditor may use that medical information to offer the consumer only $5,000 of credit.</P>
            <P>(iii) A creditor has an established medical loan program for financing particular elective surgical procedures. The creditor receives a loan application from a consumer requesting $10,000 of credit under the established loan program for an elective surgical procedure. The consumer indicates on the application that the purpose of the loan is to finance an elective surgical procedure not eligible for funding under the guidelines of the established loan program. The creditor may deny the consumer's application because the purpose of the loan is not for a particular procedure funded by the established loan program.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Examples of obtaining and using medical information at the request of the consumer.</E> (i) If a consumer applies for a loan and specifically requests that the creditor consider the consumer's medical disability at the relevant time as an explanation for adverse payment history information in his credit report, the creditor may consider such medical information in evaluating the consumer's willingness and ability to repay the requested loan to accommodate the consumer's particular circumstances, consistent with safe and sound practices. The creditor may also decline to consider such medical information to accommodate the consumer, but may evaluate the consumer's application in accordance with its otherwise applicable underwriting criteria. The creditor may not deny the consumer's application or otherwise treat the consumer less favorably because the consumer specifically requested a medical accommodation, if the creditor would have extended the credit or treated the consumer more favorably under the creditor's otherwise applicable underwriting criteria.</P>

            <P>(ii) If a consumer applies for a loan by telephone and explains that his income has been and will continue to be interrupted on account of a medical condition and that he expects to repay the loan by liquidating assets, the <PRTPAGE P="542"/>creditor may, but is not required to, evaluate the application using the sale of assets as the primary source of repayment, consistent with safe and sound practices, provided that the creditor documents the consumer's request by recording the oral conversation or making a notation of the request in the consumer's file.</P>
            <P>(iii) If a consumer applies for a loan and the application form provides a space where the consumer may provide any other information or special circumstances, whether medical or non-medical, that the consumer would like the creditor to consider in evaluating the consumer's application, the creditor may use medical information provided by the consumer in that space on that application to accommodate the consumer's application for credit, consistent with safe and sound practices, or may disregard that information.</P>
            <P>(iv) If a consumer specifically requests that the creditor use medical information in determining the consumer's eligibility, or continued eligibility, for credit and provides the creditor with medical information for that purpose, and the creditor determines that it needs additional information regarding the consumer's circumstances, the creditor may request, obtain, and use additional medical information about the consumer as necessary to verify the information provided by the consumer or to determine whether to make an accommodation for the consumer. The consumer may decline to provide additional information, withdraw the request for an accommodation, and have the application considered under the creditor's otherwise applicable underwriting criteria.</P>
            <P>(v) If a consumer completes and signs a credit application that is not for medical purpose credit and the application contains boilerplate language that routinely requests medical information from the consumer or that indicates that by applying for credit the consumer authorizes or consents to the creditor obtaining and using medical information in connection with a determination of the consumer's eligibility, or continued eligibility, for credit, the consumer has not specifically requested that the creditor obtain and use medical information to accommodate the consumer's particular circumstances.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Example of a forbearance practice or program.</E> After an appropriate safety and soundness review, a creditor institutes a program that allows consumers who are or will be hospitalized to defer payments as needed for up to three months, without penalty, if the credit account has been open for more than one year and has not previously been in default, and the consumer provides confirming documentation at an appropriate time. A consumer is hospitalized and does not pay her bill for a particular month. This consumer has had a credit account with the creditor for more than one year and has not previously been in default. The creditor attempts to contact the consumer and speaks with the consumer's adult child, who is not the consumer's legal representative. The adult child informs the creditor that the consumer is hospitalized and is unable to pay the bill at that time. The creditor defers payments for up to three months, without penalty, for the hospitalized consumer and sends the consumer a letter confirming this practice and the date on which the next payment will be due. The creditor has obtained and used medical information to determine whether the provisions of a medically-triggered forbearance practice or program apply to a consumer.</P>

            <P>(3) Complete its investigation of the dispute and report the results of the investigation to the consumer before the expiration of the period under section 611(a)(1) of the FCRA (15 U.S.C. 1681i(a)(1)) within which a consumer reporting agency would be required to complete its action if the consumer had elected to dispute the information under that section; and</P>
            <P>(4) If the investigation finds that the information reported was inaccurate, promptly notify each consumer reporting agency to which the furnisher provided inaccurate information of that determination and provide to the consumer reporting agency any correction to that information that is necessary to make the information provided by the furnisher accurate.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Frivolous or irrelevant disputes.</E> (1) A furnisher is not required to investigate a direct dispute if the furnisher has reasonably determined that the dispute is frivolous or irrelevant. A dispute qualifies as frivolous or irrelevant if:</P>
            <P>(i) The consumer did not provide sufficient information to investigate the disputed information as required by paragraph (d) of this section;</P>
            <P>(ii) The direct dispute is substantially the same as a dispute previously submitted by or on behalf of the consumer, either directly to the furnisher or through a consumer reporting agency, with respect to which the furnisher has already satisfied the applicable requirements of the Act or this section; provided, however, that a direct dispute is not substantially the same as a dispute previously submitted if the dispute includes information listed in paragraph (d) of this section that had not previously been provided to the furnisher; or</P>

            <P>(iii) The furnisher is not required to investigate the direct dispute because one or more of the exceptions listed in paragraph (b) of this section applies.<PRTPAGE P="546"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Notice of determination.</E> Upon making a determination that a dispute is frivolous or irrelevant, the furnisher must notify the consumer of the determination not later than five business days after making the determination, by mail or, if authorized by the consumer for that purpose, by any other means available to the furnisher.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Contents of notice of determination that a dispute is frivolous or irrelevant.</E> A notice of determination that a dispute is frivolous or irrelevant must include the reasons for such determination and identify any information required to investigate the disputed information, which notice may consist of a standardized form describing the general nature of such information.</P>

            <SUBJECT>General requirements for risk-based pricing notices.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, a person must provide to a consumer a notice (“risk-based pricing notice”) in the form and manner required by this subpart if the person both:</P>
            <P>(1) Uses a consumer report in connection with an application for, or a grant, extension, or other provision of, credit to that consumer that is primarily for personal, family, or household purposes; and</P>
            <P>(2) Based in whole or in part on the consumer report, grants, extends, or otherwise provides credit to that consumer on material terms that are materially less favorable than the most favorable material terms available to a substantial proportion of consumers from or through that person.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Determining which consumers must receive a notice.</E> A person may determine whether paragraph (a) of this section applies by directly comparing the material terms offered to each consumer and the material terms offered to other consumers for a specific type of credit product. For purposes of this <PRTPAGE P="549"/>section, a “specific type of credit product” means one or more credit products with similar features that are designed for similar purposes. Examples of a specific type of credit product include student loans, unsecured credit cards, secured credit cards, new automobile loans, used automobile loans, fixed-rate mortgage loans, and variable-rate mortgage loans. As an alternative to making this direct comparison, a person may make the determination by using one of the following methods:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Credit score proxy method</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> A person that sets the material terms of credit granted, extended, or otherwise provided to a consumer, based in whole or in part on a credit score, may comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section by:</P>
            <P>(A) Determining the credit score (hereafter referred to as the “cutoff score”) that represents the point at which approximately 40 percent of the consumers to whom it grants, extends, or provides credit have higher credit scores and approximately 60 percent of the consumers to whom it grants, extends, or provides credit have lower credit scores; and</P>
            <P>(B) Providing a risk-based pricing notice to each consumer to whom it grants, extends, or provides credit whose credit score is lower than the cutoff score.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Alternative to the 40/60 cutoff score determination.</E> In the case of credit that has been granted, extended, or provided on the most favorable material terms to more than 40 percent of consumers, a person may, at its option, set its cutoff score at a point at which the approximate percentage of consumers who historically have been granted, extended, or provided credit on material terms other than the most favorable terms would receive risk-based pricing notices under this section.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Determining the cutoff score</E>—(A) <E T="03">Sampling approach.</E> A person that currently uses risk-based pricing with respect to the credit products it offers must calculate the cutoff score by considering the credit scores of all or a representative sample of the consumers to whom it has granted, extended, or provided credit for a specific type of credit product.</P>
            <P>(B) <E T="03">Secondary source approach in limited circumstances.</E> A person that is a new entrant into the credit business, introduces new credit products, or starts to use risk-based pricing with respect to the credit products it currently offers may initially determine the cutoff score based on information derived from appropriate market research or relevant third-party sources for a specific type of credit product, such as research or data from companies that develop credit scores. A person that acquires a credit portfolio as a result of a merger or acquisition may determine the cutoff score based on information from the party which it acquired, with which it merged, or from which it acquired the portfolio.</P>
            <P>(C) <E T="03">Recalculation of cutoff scores.</E> A person using the credit score proxy method must recalculate its cutoff score(s) no less than every two years in the manner described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(A) of this section. A person using the credit score proxy method using market research, third-party data, or information from a party which it acquired, with which it merged, or from which it acquired the portfolio as permitted by paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(B) of this section generally must calculate a cutoff score(s) based on the scores of its own consumers in the manner described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(A) of this section within one year after it begins using a cutoff score derived from market research, third-party data, or information from a party which it acquired, with which it merged, or from which it acquired the portfolio. If such a person does not grant, extend, or provide credit to new consumers during that one-year period such that it lacks sufficient data with which to recalculate a cutoff score based on the credit scores of its own consumers, the person may continue to use a cutoff score derived from market research, third-party data, or information from a party which it acquired, with which it merged, or from which it acquired the portfolio as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(B) until it obtains sufficient data on which to base the recalculation. However, the person must recalculate its cutoff score(s) in the <PRTPAGE P="550"/>manner described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(A) of this section within two years, if it has granted, extended, or provided credit to some new consumers during that two-year period.</P>
            <P>(D) <E T="03">Use of two or more credit scores.</E> A person that generally uses two or more credit scores in setting the material terms of credit granted, extended, or provided to a consumer must determine the cutoff score using the same method the person uses to evaluate multiple scores when making credit decisions. These evaluation methods may include, but are not limited to, selecting the low, median, high, most recent, or average credit score of each consumer to whom it grants, extends, or provides credit. If a person that uses two or more credit scores does not consistently use the same method for evaluating multiple credit scores (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> if the person sometimes chooses the median score and other times calculates the average score), the person must determine the cutoff score using a reasonable means. In such cases, use of any one of the methods that the person regularly uses or the average credit score of each consumer to whom it grants, extends, or provides credit is deemed to be a reasonable means of calculating the cutoff score.</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Credit score not available.</E> For purposes of this section, a person using the credit score proxy method who grants, extends, or provides credit to a consumer for whom a credit score is not available must assume that the consumer receives credit on material terms that are materially less favorable than the most favorable credit terms offered to a substantial proportion of consumers from or through that person and must provide a risk-based pricing notice to the consumer.</P>
            <P>(v) <E T="03">Examples.</E> (A) A credit card issuer engages in risk-based pricing and the annual percentage rates it offers to consumers are based in whole or in part on a credit score. The credit card issuer takes a representative sample of the credit scores of consumers to whom it issued credit cards within the preceding three months. The credit card issuer determines that approximately 40 percent of the sampled consumers have a credit score at or above 720 (on a scale of 350 to 850) and approximately 60 percent of the sampled consumers have a credit score below 720. Thus, the card issuer selects 720 as its cutoff score. A consumer applies to the credit card issuer for a credit card. The card issuer obtains a credit score for the consumer. The consumer's credit score is 700. Since the consumer's 700 credit score falls below the 720 cutoff score, the credit card issuer must provide a risk-based pricing notice to the consumer.</P>
            <P>(B) A credit card issuer engages in risk-based pricing, and the annual percentage rates it offers to consumers are based in whole or in part on a credit score. The credit card issuer takes a representative sample of the consumers to whom it issued credit cards over the preceding six months. The credit card issuer determines that approximately 80 percent of the sampled consumers received credit at its lowest annual percentage rate, and 20 percent received credit at a higher annual percentage rate. Approximately 80 percent of the sampled consumers have a credit score at or above 750 (on a scale of 350 to 850), and 20 percent have a credit score below 750. Thus, the card issuer selects 750 as its cutoff score. A consumer applies to the credit card issuer for a credit card. The card issuer obtains a credit score for the consumer. The consumer's credit score is 740. Since the consumer's 740 credit score falls below the 750 cutoff score, the credit card issuer must provide a risk-based pricing notice to the consumer.</P>
            <P>(C) An auto lender engages in risk-based pricing, obtains credit scores from one of the nationwide consumer reporting agencies, and uses the credit score proxy method to determine which consumers must receive a risk-based pricing notice. A consumer applies to the auto lender for credit to finance the purchase of an automobile. A credit score about that consumer is not available from the consumer reporting agency from which the lender obtains credit scores. The lender nevertheless grants, extends, or provides credit to the consumer. The lender must provide a risk-based pricing notice to the consumer.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Tiered pricing method</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> A person that sets the material terms of credit granted, extended, or provided to a consumer by placing the <PRTPAGE P="551"/>consumer within one of a discrete number of pricing tiers for a specific type of credit product, based in whole or in part on a consumer report, may comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section by providing a risk-based pricing notice to each consumer who is not placed within the top pricing tier or tiers, as described below.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Four or fewer pricing tiers.</E> If a person using the tiered pricing method has four or fewer pricing tiers, the person complies with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section by providing a risk-based pricing notice to each consumer to whom it grants, extends, or provides credit who does not qualify for the top tier (that is, the lowest-priced tier). For example, a person that uses a tiered pricing structure with annual percentage rates of 8, 10, 12, and 14 percent would provide the risk-based pricing notice to each consumer to whom it grants, extends, or provides credit at annual percentage rates of 10, 12, and 14 percent.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Five or more pricing tiers.</E> If a person using the tiered pricing method has five or more pricing tiers, the person complies with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section by providing a risk-based pricing notice to each consumer to whom it grants, extends, or provides credit who does not qualify for the top two tiers (that is, the two lowest-priced tiers) and any other tier that, together with the top tiers, comprise no less than the top 30 percent but no more than the top 40 percent of the total number of tiers. Each consumer placed within the remaining tiers must receive a risk-based pricing notice. For example, if a person has nine pricing tiers, the top three tiers (that is, the three lowest-priced tiers) comprise no less than the top 30 percent but no more than the top 40 percent of the tiers. Therefore, a person using this method would provide a risk-based pricing notice to each consumer to whom it grants, extends, or provides credit who is placed within the bottom six tiers.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Application to credit card issuers</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> A credit card issuer subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section may use one of the methods set forth in paragraph (b) of this section to identify consumers to whom it must provide a risk-based pricing notice. Alternatively, a credit card issuer may satisfy its obligations under paragraph (a) of this section by providing a risk-based pricing notice to a consumer when:</P>
            <P>(i) A consumer applies for a credit card either in connection with an application program, such as a direct-mail offer or a take-one application, or in response to a solicitation under 12 CFR 1026.60, and more than a single possible purchase annual percentage rate may apply under the program or solicitation; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Based in whole or in part on a consumer report, the credit card issuer provides a credit card to the consumer with an annual percentage rate referenced in § 1022.71(n)(1)(ii) that is greater than the lowest annual percentage rate referenced in § 1022.71(n)(1)(ii) available in connection with the application or solicitation.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">No requirement to compare different offers.</E> A credit card issuer is not subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section and is not required to provide a risk-based pricing notice to a consumer if:</P>
            <P>(i) The consumer applies for a credit card for which the card issuer provides a single annual percentage rate referenced in § 1022.71(n)(1)(ii), excluding a temporary initial rate that is lower than the rate that will apply after the temporary rate expires and a penalty rate that will apply upon the occurrence of one or more specific events, such as a late payment or an extension of credit that exceeds the credit limit; or</P>
            <P>(ii) The credit card issuer offers the consumer the lowest annual percentage rate referenced in § 1022.71(n)(1)(ii) available under the credit card offer for which the consumer applied, even if a lower annual percentage rate referenced in § 1022.71(n)(1)(ii) is available under a different credit card offer issued by the card issuer.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Examples.</E> (i) A credit card issuer sends a solicitation to the consumer that discloses several possible purchase annual percentage rates that may apply, such as 10, 12, or 14 percent, or a range of purchase annual percentage <PRTPAGE P="552"/>rates from 10 to 14 percent. The consumer applies for a credit card in response to the solicitation. The card issuer provides a credit card to the consumer with a purchase annual percentage rate of 12 percent based in whole or in part on a consumer report. Unless an exception applies under § 1022.74, the card issuer may satisfy its obligations under paragraph (a) of this section by providing a risk-based pricing notice to the consumer because the consumer received credit at a purchase annual percentage rate greater than the lowest purchase annual percentage rate available under that solicitation.</P>
            <P>(ii) The same facts as in the example in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, except that the card issuer provides a credit card to the consumer at a purchase annual percentage rate of 10 percent. The card issuer is not required to provide a risk-based pricing notice to the consumer even if, under a different credit card solicitation, that consumer or other consumers might qualify for a purchase annual percentage rate of 8 percent.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Account review</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, a person is subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section and must provide a risk-based pricing notice to a consumer in the form and manner required by this subpart if the person:</P>
            <P>(i) Uses a consumer report in connection with a review of credit that has been extended to the consumer; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Based in whole or in part on the consumer report, increases the annual percentage rate (the annual percentage rate referenced in § 1022.71(n)(1)(ii) in the case of a credit card).</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Example.</E> A credit card issuer periodically obtains consumer reports for the purpose of reviewing the terms of credit it has extended to consumers in connection with credit cards. As a result of this review, the credit card issuer increases the purchase annual percentage rate applicable to a consumer's credit card based in whole or in part on information in a consumer report. The credit card issuer is subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section and must provide a risk-based pricing notice to the consumer.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Application for specific terms</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> A person is not required to provide a risk-based pricing notice to the consumer under § 1022.72(a) or (c) if the consumer applies for specific material terms and is granted those terms, unless those terms were specified by the person using a consumer report after the consumer applied for or requested credit and after the person obtained the consumer report. For purposes of this section, “specific material terms” means a single material term, or set of material terms, such as an annual percentage rate of 10 percent, and not a range of alternatives, such as an annual percentage rate that may be 8, 10, or 12 percent, or between 8 and 12 percent.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Example.</E> A consumer receives a firm offer of credit from a credit card issuer. The terms of the firm offer are based in whole or in part on information from a consumer report that the credit card issuer obtained under the FCRA's firm offer of credit provisions. The solicitation offers the consumer a credit card with a single purchase annual percentage rate of 12 percent. The consumer applies for and receives a credit card with an annual percentage rate of 12 percent. Other customers with the same credit card have a purchase annual percentage rate of 10 percent. The exception applies because the consumer applied for specific material terms and was granted those terms. Although the credit card issuer specified the annual percentage rate in the firm offer of credit based in whole or in part on a consumer report, the credit card issuer specified that material term <E T="03">before,</E> not <E T="03">after,</E> the consumer applied for or requested credit.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Adverse action notice.</E> A person is not required to provide a risk-based pricing notice to the consumer under § 1022.72(a), (c), or (d) if the person provides an adverse action notice to the consumer under section 615(a) of the FCRA.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Prescreened solicitations</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> A person is not required to provide a risk-based pricing notice to the consumer under § 1022.72(a) or (c) if the person:</P>
            <P>(i) Obtains a consumer report that is a prescreened list as described in section 604(c)(2) of the FCRA; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Uses the consumer report for the purpose of making a firm offer of credit to the consumer.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">More favorable material terms.</E> This exception applies to any firm offer of credit offered by a person to a consumer, even if the person makes other firm offers of credit to other consumers on more favorable material terms.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Example.</E> A credit card issuer obtains two prescreened lists from a consumer reporting agency. One list includes consumers with high credit scores. The other list includes consumers with low credit scores. The issuer mails a firm offer of credit to the high credit score consumers with a single purchase annual percentage rate of 10 percent. The issuer also mails a firm offer of credit to the low credit score consumers with a single purchase annual percentage rate of 14 percent. The credit card issuer is not required to provide a risk-based pricing notice to the low credit score consumers who receive the 14 percent offer because use of a consumer report to make a firm offer of credit does not trigger the risk-based pricing notice requirement.<PRTPAGE P="556"/>

Use of a graph or statement obtained from the person providing the credit score that meets the requirements of this paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(E) is deemed to comply with this requirement;</P>

The notice may, at the person's option, include more than one credit score, along with the additional information specified in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section for each credit score disclosed.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Examples.</E> (A) A person that uses consumer reports to set the material terms of mortgage credit granted, extended, or provided to consumers regularly requests credit scores from several consumer reporting agencies and uses the low score when determining the material terms it will offer to the consumer.

            <SUBJECT>Rules of construction.</SUBJECT>
            <P>For purposes of this subpart, the following rules of construction apply:</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">One notice per credit extension.</E> A consumer is entitled to no more than one risk-based pricing notice under § 1022.72(a) or (c), or one notice under § 1022.74(d), (e), or (f), for each grant, extension, or other provision of credit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, even if a consumer has previously received a risk-based pricing notice in connection with a grant, extension, or other provision of credit, another risk-based pricing notice is required if the conditions set forth in § 1022.72(d) have been met.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Multi-party transactions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Initial creditor.</E> The person to whom a credit obligation is initially payable must provide the risk-based pricing notice described in § 1022.72(a) or (c), or satisfy the requirements for and provide the notice required under one of the exceptions in § 1022.74(d), (e), or (f), even if that person immediately assigns the credit agreement to a third party and is not the source of funding for the credit.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Purchasers or assignees.</E> A purchaser or assignee of a credit contract with a consumer is not subject to the requirements of this subpart and is not <PRTPAGE P="560"/>required to provide the risk-based pricing notice described in § 1022.72(a) or (c), or satisfy the requirements for and provide the notice required under one of the exceptions in § 1022.74(d), (e), or (f).</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Example.</E> A consumer obtains credit to finance the purchase of an automobile. If a bank or finance company is the person to whom the loan obligation is initially payable, the bank or finance company must provide the risk-based pricing notice to the consumer (or satisfy the requirements for and provide the notice required under one of the exceptions noted above) based on the terms offered by that bank or finance company only. The auto dealer has no duty to provide a risk-based pricing notice to the consumer. However, the bank or finance company may comply with this rule if the auto dealer has agreed to provide notices to consumers before consummation pursuant to an arrangement with the bank or finance company, as permitted under § 1022.73(c).</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Multiple consumers</E>—(1) <E T="03">Risk-based pricing notices.</E> In a transaction involving two or more consumers who are granted, extended, or otherwise provided credit, a person must provide a notice to each consumer to satisfy the requirements of § 1022.72(a) or (c). Whether the consumers have the same address or not, the person must provide a separate notice to each consumer if a notice includes a credit score(s). Each separate notice that includes a credit score(s) must contain only the credit score(s) of the consumer to whom the notice is provided, and not the credit score(s) of the other consumer. If the consumers have the same address, and the notice does not include a credit score(s), a person may satisfy the requirements by providing a single notice addressed to both consumers.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Credit score disclosure notices.</E> In a transaction involving two or more consumers who are granted, extended, or otherwise provided credit, a person must provide a separate notice to each consumer to satisfy the exceptions in § 1022.74(d), (e), or (f). Whether the consumers have the same address or not, the person must provide a separate notice to each consumer. Each separate notice must contain only the credit score(s) of the consumer to whom the notice is provided, and not the credit score(s) of the other consumer.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Examples.</E> (i) Two consumers jointly apply for credit with a creditor. The creditor obtains credit scores on both consumers. Based in part on the credit scores, the creditor grants credit to the consumers on material terms that are materially less favorable than the most favorable terms available to other consumers from the creditor. The creditor provides risk-based pricing notices to satisfy its obligations under this subpart. The creditor must provide a separate risk-based pricing notice to each consumer whether the consumers have the same address or not. Each risk-based pricing notice must contain only the credit score(s) of the consumer to whom the notice is provided.</P>
            <P>(ii) Two consumers jointly apply for credit with a creditor. The two consumers reside at the same address. The creditor obtains credit scores on each of the two consumer applicants. The creditor grants credit to the consumers. The creditor provides credit score disclosure notices to satisfy its obligations under this subpart. Even though the two consumers reside at the same address, the creditor must provide a separate credit score disclosure notice to each of the consumers. Each notice must contain only the credit score of the consumer to whom the notice is provided.</P>

            <P>(i) Can form a reasonable belief that the consumer report relates to the consumer about whom the user requested the report;</P>
            <P>(ii) Establishes a continuing relationship with the consumer; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Regularly and in the ordinary course of business furnishes information to the consumer reporting agency from which the notice of address discrepancy relating to the consumer was obtained.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Examples of confirmation methods.</E> The user may reasonably confirm an address is accurate by:</P>
            <P>(i) Verifying the address with the consumer about whom it has requested the report;</P>
            <P>(ii) Reviewing its own records to verify the address of the consumer;</P>
            <P>(iii) Verifying the address through third-party sources; or</P>

XYZ's conduct is a circumvention or evasion of treatment as a consumer reporting agency that compiles and maintains files on consumers on a nationwide basis, and thus violates this section.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Circumvention through reorganization by regional operations.</E> PDQ Inc. is a consumer reporting agency that compiles and maintains files on consumers on a nationwide basis. It restructures its operations so that corporate affiliates separately assemble and maintain all information on consumers residing in each state. PDQ continues to operate as a consumer reporting agency but ceases to comply with the FCRA obligations of a consumer reporting agency that compiles and maintains files on consumers on a nationwide basis, asserting that it no longer meets the definition found in FCRA section 603(p), because it no longer operates on a nationwide basis. PDQ's conduct is a circumvention or evasion of treatment as a consumer reporting agency that compiles and maintains files on consumers on a nationwide basis, and thus violates this section.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Circumvention by a newly formed entity.</E> Smith Co. is a new entrant in the marketplace for consumer reports that bear on a consumer's credit worthiness, standing and capacity. Smith Co. organizes itself into two affiliated companies: Smith Credit Co. and Smith Public Records Co. Smith Credit Co. assembles and maintains credit account information from persons who furnish that information regularly and in the ordinary course of business on consumers residing nationwide. Smith Public Records Co. assembles and maintains public record information on consumers nationwide. Neither Smith Co. nor its affiliated organizations comply with FCRA obligations of consumer reporting agencies that compile and maintain files on consumers on a nationwide basis. Smith Co.'s conduct is a circumvention or evasion of treatment as a consumer reporting agency that compiles and maintains files on consumers on a nationwide basis, and thus violates this section.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Bona fide, arm's length transaction with unaffiliated party.</E> Foster Ltd. is a consumer reporting agency that compiles and maintains files on consumers on a nationwide basis. Foster Ltd. sells its public record information business to an unaffiliated company in a bona fide, arm's length transaction. Foster Ltd. ceases to assemble, evaluate and maintain public record information on consumers residing nationwide, and ceases to offer reports containing public record information. Foster Ltd.'s conduct is not a circumvention or evasion of treatment as a consumer reporting agency that compiles and <PRTPAGE P="571"/>maintains files on consumers on a nationwide basis. Foster Ltd.'s conduct does not violate this part.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Limitation on applicability.</E> Any person who is otherwise in violation of paragraph (a) of this section shall be deemed to be in compliance with this part if such person is in compliance with all obligations imposed upon consumer reporting agencies that compile and maintain files on consumers on a nationwide basis under the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. 1681 <E T="03">et seq.</E>

            <P>a. Although use of the model notices is not required, a financial institution that is subject to section 623(a)(7) of the FCRA shall be deemed to be in compliance with the notice requirement in section 623(a)(7) of the FCRA if the institution properly uses the model notices in this appendix (as applicable).</P>
            <P>b. A financial institution may use Model Notice B-1 if the institution provides the notice prior to furnishing negative information to a nationwide consumer reporting agency.</P>
            <P>c. A financial institution may use Model Notice B-2 if the institution provides the notice after furnishing negative information to a nationwide consumer reporting agency.</P>
            <P>d. Financial institutions may make certain changes to the language or format of the model notices without losing the safe harbor from liability provided by the model notices. The changes to the model notices may not be so extensive as to affect the substance, clarity, or meaningful sequence of the language in the model notices. Financial institutions making such extensive revisions will lose the safe harbor from liability that this appendix provides. Acceptable changes include, for example,</P>
            <P>1. Rearranging the order of the references to “late payment(s),” or “missed payment(s).”</P>
            <P>2. Pluralizing the terms “credit bureau,” “credit report,” and “account.”</P>
            <P>3. Specifying the particular type of account on which information may be furnished, such as “credit card account.”</P>
            <P>4. Rearranging in Model Notice B-1 the phrases “information about your account” and “to credit bureaus” such that it would read “We may report to credit bureaus information about your account.”</P>

            <P>a. Although use of the model forms is not required, use of the model forms in this appendix (as applicable) complies with the requirement in section 624 of the Act for clear, conspicuous, and concise notices.</P>
            <P>b. Certain changes may be made to the language or format of the model forms without losing the protection from liability afforded by use of the model forms. These changes may not be so extensive as to affect the substance, clarity, or meaningful sequence of the language in the model forms. Persons making such extensive revisions will lose the safe harbor that this appendix provides. Acceptable changes include, for example:</P>
            <P>1. Rearranging the order of the references to “your income,” “your account history,” and “your credit score.”</P>
            <P>2. Substituting other types of information for “income,” “account history,” or “credit score” for accuracy, such as “payment history,” “credit history,” “payoff status,” or “claims history.”</P>
            <P>3. Substituting a clearer and more accurate description of the affiliates providing or covered by the notice for phrases such as “the [ABC] group of companies,” including without limitation a statement that the entity providing the notice recently purchased the consumer's account.</P>
            <P>4. Substituting other types of affiliates covered by the notice for “credit card,” “insurance,” or “securities” affiliates.</P>
            <P>5. Omitting items that are not accurate or applicable. For example, if a person does not limit the duration of the opt-out period, the notice may omit information about the renewal notice.</P>
            <P>6. Adding a statement informing consumers how much time they have to opt out before shared eligibility information may be used to make solicitations to them.</P>
            <P>7. Adding a statement that the consumer may exercise the right to opt out at any time.</P>

            <P>8. Adding the following statement, if accurate: “If you previously opted out, you do not need to do so again.”<PRTPAGE P="572"/>
            </P>

            <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix E to Part 1022—Interagency Guidelines Concerning the Accuracy and Integrity of Information Furnished to Consumer Reporting Agencies</HD>

            <P>The Bureau encourages voluntary furnishing of information to consumer reporting agencies. Section 1022.42 of this part requires each furnisher to establish and implement reasonable written policies and procedures concerning the accuracy and integrity of the information it furnishes to consumer reporting agencies. Under § 1022.42(b) of this <PRTPAGE P="578"/>part, a furnisher must consider the guidelines set forth below in developing its policies and procedures. In establishing these policies and procedures, a furnisher may include any of its existing policies and procedures that are relevant and appropriate. Section 1022.42(c) requires each furnisher to review its policies and procedures periodically and update them as necessary to ensure their continued effectiveness.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Nature, Scope, and Objectives of Policies and Procedures</HD>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Nature and Scope.</E> Section 1022.42(a) of this part requires that a furnisher's policies and procedures be appropriate to the nature, size, complexity, and scope of the furnisher's activities. In developing its policies and procedures, a furnisher should consider, for example:</P>
            <P>(1) The types of business activities in which the furnisher engages;</P>
            <P>(2) The nature and frequency of the information the furnisher provides to consumer reporting agencies; and</P>
            <P>(3) The technology used by the furnisher to furnish information to consumer reporting agencies.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Objectives.</E> A furnisher's policies and procedures should be reasonably designed to promote the following objectives:</P>
            <P>(1) To furnish information about accounts or other relationships with a consumer that is accurate, such that the furnished information:</P>
            <P>(i) Identifies the appropriate consumer;</P>
            <P>(ii) Reflects the terms of and liability for those accounts or other relationships; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Reflects the consumer's performance and other conduct with respect to the account or other relationship;</P>
            <P>(2) To furnish information about accounts or other relationships with a consumer that has integrity, such that the furnished information:</P>
            <P>(i) Is substantiated by the furnisher's records at the time it is furnished;</P>
            <P>(ii) Is furnished in a form and manner that is designed to minimize the likelihood that the information may be incorrectly reflected in a consumer report; thus, the furnished information should:</P>
            <P>(A) Include appropriate identifying information about the consumer to whom it pertains; and</P>
            <P>(B) Be furnished in a standardized and clearly understandable form and manner and with a date specifying the time period to which the information pertains; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Includes the credit limit, if applicable and in the furnisher's possession;</P>
            <P>(3) To conduct reasonable investigations of consumer disputes and take appropriate actions based on the outcome of such investigations; and</P>
            <P>(4) To update the information it furnishes as necessary to reflect the current status of the consumer's account or other relationship, including, for example:</P>
            <P>(i) Any transfer of an account (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> by sale or assignment for collection) to a third party; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Any cure of the consumer's failure to abide by the terms of the account or other relationship.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Establishing and Implementing Policies and Procedures</HD>
            <P>In establishing and implementing its policies and procedures, a furnisher should:</P>
            <P>(a) Identify practices or activities of the furnisher that can compromise the accuracy or integrity of information furnished to consumer reporting agencies, such as by:</P>
            <P>(1) Reviewing its existing practices and activities, including the technological means and other methods it uses to furnish information to consumer reporting agencies and the frequency and timing of its furnishing of information;</P>
            <P>(2) Reviewing its historical records relating to accuracy or integrity or to disputes; reviewing other information relating to the accuracy or integrity of information provided by the furnisher to consumer reporting agencies; and considering the types of errors, omissions, or other problems that may have affected the accuracy or integrity of information it has furnished about consumers to consumer reporting agencies;</P>
            <P>(3) Considering any feedback received from consumer reporting agencies, consumers, or other appropriate parties;</P>
            <P>(4) Obtaining feedback from the furnisher's staff; and</P>
            <P>(5) Considering the potential impact of the furnisher's policies and procedures on consumers.</P>
            <P>(b) Evaluate the effectiveness of existing policies and procedures of the furnisher regarding the accuracy and integrity of information furnished to consumer reporting agencies; consider whether new, additional, or different policies and procedures are necessary; and consider whether implementation of existing policies and procedures should be modified to enhance the accuracy and integrity of information about consumers furnished to consumer reporting agencies.</P>

            <P>(c) Evaluate the effectiveness of specific methods (including technological means) the furnisher uses to provide information to consumer reporting agencies; how those methods may affect the accuracy and integrity of the information it provides to consumer reporting agencies; and whether new, additional, or different methods (including technological means) should be used to provide information to consumer reporting agencies to enhance the accuracy and integrity of that information.<PRTPAGE P="579"/>
            </P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Specific Components of Policies and Procedures</HD>
            <P>In developing its policies and procedures, a furnisher should address the following, as appropriate:</P>
            <P>(a) Establishing and implementing a system for furnishing information about consumers to consumer reporting agencies that is appropriate to the nature, size, complexity, and scope of the furnisher's business operations.</P>

            <EAR>Pt. 1022, App. H</EAR>
            <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix H to Part 1022—Model Forms for Risk-Based Pricing and Credit Score Disclosure Exception Notices</HD>
            <P>1. This appendix contains four model forms for risk-based pricing notices and three model forms for use in connection with the credit score disclosure exceptions. Each of the model forms is designated for use in a particular set of circumstances as indicated by the title of that model form.</P>
            <P>2. Model form H-1 is for use in complying with the general risk-based pricing notice requirements in Sec. 1022.72 if a credit score is not used in setting the material terms of credit. Model form H-2 is for risk-based pricing notices given in connection with account review if a credit score is not used in increasing the annual percentage rate. Model form H-3 is for use in connection with the credit score disclosure exception for loans secured by residential real property. Model form H-4 is for use in connection with the credit score disclosure exception for loans that are not secured by residential real property. Model form H-5 is for use in connection with the credit score disclosure exception when no credit score is available for a consumer. Model form H-6 is for use in complying with the general risk-based pricing notice requirements in Sec. 1022.72 if a credit score is used in setting the material terms of credit. Model form H-7 is for risk-based pricing notices given in connection with account review if a credit score is used in increasing the annual percentage rate. All forms contained in this appendix are models; their use is optional.</P>

            <P>3. A person may change the forms by rearranging the format or by making technical modifications to the language of the forms, in each case without modifying the substance of the disclosures. Any such rearrangement or modification of the language <PRTPAGE P="580"/>of the model forms may not be so extensive as to materially affect the substance, clarity, comprehensibility, or meaningful sequence of the forms. Persons making revisions with that effect will lose the benefit of the safe harbor for appropriate use of appendix H model forms. A person is not required to conduct consumer testing when rearranging the format of the model forms.</P>
            <P>a. Acceptable changes include, for example:</P>
            <P>i. Corrections or updates to telephone numbers, mailing addresses, or Web site addresses that may change over time.</P>
            <P>ii. The addition of graphics or icons, such as the person's corporate logo.</P>
            <P>iii. Alteration of the shading or color contained in the model forms.</P>
            <P>iv. Use of a different form of graphical presentation to depict the distribution of credit scores.</P>
            <P>v. Substitution of the words “credit” and “creditor” or “finance” and “finance company” for the terms “loan” and “lender.”</P>
            <P>vi. Including pre-printed lists of the sources of consumer reports or consumer reporting agencies in a “check-the-box” format.</P>
            <P>vii. Including the name of the consumer, transaction identification numbers, a date, and other information that will assist in identifying the transaction to which the form pertains.</P>
            <P>viii. Including the name of an agent, such as an auto dealer or other party, when providing the “Name of the Entity Providing the Notice.”</P>

            <P>ix. Until January 1, 2013, substituting “For more information about credit reports and your rights under Federal law, visit the Federal Reserve Board's Web site at <E T="03">www.federalreserve.gov,</E> or the Federal Trade Commission's Web site at <E T="03">www.ftc.gov.</E>” for “For more information about credit reports and your rights under Federal law, visit the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Web site at <E T="03">www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore.</E>”</P>
            <P>b. Unacceptable changes include, for example:</P>
            <P>i. Providing model forms on register receipts or interspersed with other disclosures.</P>
            <P>ii. Eliminating empty lines and extra spaces between sentences within the same section.</P>
            <P>4. If a person uses an appropriate appendix H model form, or modifies a form in accordance with the above instructions, that person shall be deemed to be acting in compliance with the provisions of § 1022.73 or § 1022.74, as applicable, of this part. It is intended that appropriate use of Model Form H-3 also will comply with the disclosure that may be required under section 609(g) of the FCRA. Optional language in model forms H-6 and H-7 may be used to direct the consumer to the entity (which may be a consumer reporting agency or the creditor itself, for a proprietary score that meets the definition of a credit score) that provided the credit score for any questions about the credit score, along with the entity's contact information. Creditors may use or not use the additional language without losing the safe harbor, since the language is optional.</P>
            <P>H-1 Model form for risk-based pricing notice.</P>
            <P>H-2 Model form for account review risk-based pricing notice.</P>
            <P>H-3 Model form for credit score disclosure exception for credit secured by one to four units of residential real property.</P>
            <P>H-4 Model form for credit score disclosure exception for loans not secured by residential real property.</P>
            <P>H-5 Model form for credit score disclosure exception for loans where credit score is not available.</P>
            <P>H-6 Model form for risk-based pricing notice with credit score information.</P>
            <P>H-7 Model form for account review risk-based pricing notice with credit score information.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Rule, regulation or interpretation.</E> (1) For purposes of sections 19(a) and (b) of RESPA (12 U.S.C. 2617(a) and (b)), only the following constitute a rule, regulation or interpretation of the Bureau:</P>
            <P>(i) All provisions, including appendices and supplements, of this part. Any other document referred to in this part is not incorporated in this part unless it is specifically set out in this part;</P>
            <P>(ii) Any other document that is published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> by the Bureau and states that it is an “interpretation,” “interpretive rule,” “commentary,” or a “statement of policy” for purposes of section 19(a) of RESPA. Except in unusual circumstances, interpretations will not be issued separately but will be incorporated in an official interpretation to this part, which will be amended periodically.</P>

            <P>(2) A “rule, regulation, or interpretation thereof by the Bureau” for purposes of section 19(b) of RESPA (12 U.S.C. 2617(b)) shall not include the special information booklet prescribed <PRTPAGE P="622"/>by the Bureau or any other statement or issuance, whether oral or written, by an officer or representative of the Bureau, letter or memorandum by the Director, General Counsel, or other officer or employee of the Bureau, preamble to a regulation or other issuance of the Bureau, Public Guidance Document, report to Congress, pleading, affidavit or other document in litigation, pamphlet, handbook, guide, telegraphic communication, explanation, instructions to forms, speech or other material of any nature which is not specifically included in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Coverage of RESPA.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> RESPA and this part apply to federally related mortgage loans, except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Exemptions.</E> (1) [Reserved]</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Business purpose loans.</E> An extension of credit primarily for a business, commercial, or agricultural purpose, as defined by 12 CFR 1026.3(a)(1) of Regulation Z. Persons may rely on Regulation Z in determining whether the exemption applies.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Temporary financing.</E> Temporary financing, such as a construction loan. The exemption for temporary financing does not apply to a loan made to finance construction of 1- to 4-family residential property if the loan is used as, or may be converted to, permanent financing by the same lender or is used to finance transfer of title to the first user. If a lender issues a commitment for permanent financing, with or without conditions, the loan is covered by this part. Any construction loan for new or rehabilitated 1- to 4-family residential property, other than a loan to a <E T="03">bona fide</E> builder (a person who regularly constructs 1- to 4-family residential structures for sale or lease), is subject to this part if its term is for two years or more. A “bridge loan” or “swing loan” in which a lender takes a security interest in otherwise covered 1- to 4-family residential property is not covered by RESPA and this part.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Vacant land.</E> Any loan secured by vacant or unimproved property, unless within two years from the date of the settlement of the loan, a structure or a manufactured home will be constructed or placed on the real property using the loan proceeds. If a loan for a structure or manufactured home to be placed on vacant or unimproved property will be secured by a lien on that property, the transaction is covered by this part.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Assumption without lender approval.</E> Any assumption in which the lender does not have the right expressly to approve a subsequent person as the borrower on an existing federally related mortgage loan. Any assumption in which the lender's permission is both required and obtained is covered by RESPA and this part, whether or not the lender charges a fee for the assumption.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Loan conversions.</E> Any conversion of a federally related mortgage loan to different terms that are consistent with provisions of the original mortgage instrument, as long as a new note is not required, even if the lender charges an additional fee for the conversion.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Secondary market transactions.</E> A bona fide transfer of a loan obligation in the secondary market is not covered by RESPA and this part, except with respect to RESPA (12 U.S.C. 2605) and subpart C of this part (§§ 1024.30-1024.41). In determining what constitutes a <E T="03">bona fide</E> transfer, the Bureau will consider the real source of funding and the real interest of the funding lender. Mortgage broker transactions that are table-funded are not secondary market transactions. Neither the creation of a dealer loan or dealer consumer credit contract, nor the first assignment of such loan or contract to a lender, is a secondary market transaction (see § 1024.2).</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Relation to State laws.</E> (1) State laws that are inconsistent with RESPA or this part are preempted to the extent of the inconsistency. However, RESPA and these regulations do not <PRTPAGE P="623"/>annul, alter, affect, or exempt any person subject to their provisions from complying with the laws of any State with respect to settlement practices, except to the extent of the inconsistency.</P>
            <P>(2) Upon request by any person, the Bureau is authorized to determine if inconsistencies with State law exist; in doing so, the Bureau shall consult with appropriate Federal agencies.</P>
            <P>(i) The Bureau may not determine that a State law or regulation is inconsistent with any provision of RESPA or this part, if the Bureau determines that such law or regulation gives greater protection to the consumer.</P>
            <P>(ii) In determining whether provisions of State law or regulations concerning affiliated business arrangements are inconsistent with RESPA or this part, the Bureau may not construe those provisions that impose more stringent limitations on affiliated business arrangements as inconsistent with RESPA so long as they give more protection to consumers and/or competition.</P>

            <P>(3) Any person may request the Bureau to determine whether an inconsistency exists by submitting to the address established by the Bureau to request an official interpretation, a copy of the State law in question, any other law or judicial or administrative opinion that implements, interprets or applies the relevant provision, and an explanation of the possible inconsistency. A determination by the Bureau that an inconsistency with State law exists will be made by publication of a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> “Law” as used in this section includes regulations and any enactment which has the force and effect of law and is issued by a State or any political subdivision of a State.</P>
            <P>(4) A specific preemption of conflicting State laws regarding notices and disclosures of mortgage servicing transfers is set forth in § 1024.33(d).</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Partial exemptions for certain mortgage loans.</E> Sections 1024.6, 1024.7, 1024.8, 1024.10, and 1024.33(a) do not apply to a federally related mortgage loan:</P>
            <P>(1) That is subject to the special disclosure requirements for certain consumer credit transactions secured by real property set forth in Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.19(e), (f), and (g); or</P>

            <SUBJECT>Special information booklet at time of loan application.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Lender to provide special information booklet.</E> Subject to the exceptions set forth in this paragraph, the lender shall provide a copy of the special information booklet to a person from whom the lender receives, or for whom the lender prepares, a written application for a federally related mortgage loan. When two or more persons apply together for a loan, the lender is in compliance if the lender provides a copy of the booklet to one of the persons applying.</P>
            <P>(1) The lender shall provide the special information booklet by delivering it or placing it in the mail to the applicant not later than three business days (as that term is defined in § 1024.2) after the application is received or prepared. However, if the lender denies the borrower's application for credit before the end of the three-business-day period, then the lender need not provide the booklet to the borrower. If a borrower uses a mortgage broker, the mortgage broker shall distribute the special information booklet and the lender need not do so. The intent of this provision is that the applicant receive the special information booklet at the earliest possible date.</P>
            <P>(2) In the case of a federally related mortgage loan involving an open-ended credit plan, as defined in Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.2(a)(20), a lender or mortgage broker that provides the borrower with a copy of the brochure entitled “When Your Home is On the Line: What You Should Know About Home Equity Lines of Credit”, or any successor brochure issued by the Bureau, is deemed to be in compliance with this section.</P>

            <P>(3) In the categories of transactions set forth at the end of this paragraph, <PRTPAGE P="624"/>the lender or mortgage broker does not have to provide the booklet to the borrower. Under the authority of section 19(a) of RESPA (12 U.S.C. 2617(a)), the Bureau may issue a revised or separate special information booklet that deals with these transactions, or the Bureau may choose to endorse the forms or booklets of other Federal agencies. In such an event, the requirements for delivery by lenders and the availability of the booklet or alternate materials for these transactions will be set forth in a Notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> This paragraph shall apply to the following transactions:</P>
            <P>(i) Refinancing transactions;</P>
            <P>(ii) Closed-end loans, as defined in 12 CFR 1026.2(a)(10) of Regulation Z, when the lender takes a subordinate lien;</P>
            <P>(iii) Reverse mortgages; and</P>
            <P>(iv) Any other federally related mortgage loan whose purpose is not the purchase of a 1- to 4-family residential property.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Revision.</E> The Bureau may from time to time revise the special information booklet, publishing a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Reproduction.</E> The special information booklet may be reproduced in any form, provided that no change is made other than as provided under paragraph (d) of this section. The special information booklet may not be made a part of a larger document for purposes of distribution under RESPA and this section. Any color, size and quality of paper, type of print, and method of reproduction may be used so long as the booklet is clearly legible.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Permissible changes.</E> (1) No changes to, deletions from, or additions to the special information booklet currently prescribed by the Bureau shall be made other than the permissible changes specified in paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section or changes as otherwise approved in writing by the Bureau in accordance with the procedures described in this paragraph (d). A request to the Bureau for approval of any changes other than the permissible changes specified in paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section shall be submitted in writing to the address indicated in the definition of <E T="03">Public Guidance Documents</E> in § 1024.2, stating the reasons why the applicant believes such changes, deletions, or additions are necessary.</P>
            <P>(2) The cover of the booklet may be in any form and may contain any drawings, pictures, or artwork, provided that the words “settlement costs” are used in the title. Names, addresses and telephone numbers of the lender or others and similar information may appear on the cover, but no discussion of the matters covered in the booklet shall appear on the cover.</P>
            <P>(3) The special information booklet may be translated into languages other than English.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Lender to provide.</E> (1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (a), (b), or (h) of this section, not later than 3 business days after a lender receives an application, or information sufficient to complete an application, the lender must provide the applicant with a GFE. In the case of dealer loans, the lender must either provide the GFE or ensure that the dealer provides the GFE.</P>
            <P>(2) The lender must provide the GFE to the loan applicant by hand delivery, by placing it in the mail, or, if the applicant agrees, by fax, email, or other electronic means.</P>
            <P>(3) The lender is not required to provide the applicant with a GFE if, before the end of the 3-business-day period:</P>

            <P>(4) The lender is not permitted to charge, as a condition for providing a GFE, any fee for an appraisal, inspection, or other similar settlement service. The lender may, at its option, charge a fee limited to the cost of a credit report. The lender may not charge additional fees until after the applicant has received the GFE and indicated an intention to proceed with the loan covered by that GFE. If the GFE is mailed to the applicant, the applicant is considered to have received the GFE 3 calendar days after it is mailed, not including Sundays and the legal public holidays specified in 5 U.S.C. 6103(a).<PRTPAGE P="625"/>
            </P>
            <P>(5) The lender may at any time collect from the loan applicant any information that it requires in addition to the required application information. However, the lender is not permitted to require, as a condition for providing a GFE, that an applicant submit supplemental documentation to verify the information provided on the application.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Mortgage broker to provide.</E> (1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (a), (b), or (h) of this section, either the lender or the mortgage broker must provide a GFE not later than 3 business days after a mortgage broker receives either an application or information sufficient to complete an application. The lender is responsible for ascertaining whether the GFE has been provided. If the mortgage broker has provided a GFE, the lender is not required to provide an additional GFE.</P>
            <P>(2) The mortgage broker must provide the GFE by hand delivery, by placing it in the mail, or, if the applicant agrees, by fax, email, or other electronic means.</P>
            <P>(3) The mortgage broker is not required to provide the applicant with a GFE if, before the end of the 3-business-day period:</P>

            <P>(ii) The applicant withdraws the application.</P>
            <P>(4) The mortgage broker is not permitted to charge, as a condition for providing a GFE, any fee for an appraisal, inspection, or other similar settlement service. The mortgage broker may, at its option, charge a fee limited to the cost of a credit report. The mortgage broker may not charge additional fees until after the applicant has received the GFE and indicated an intention to proceed with the loan covered by that GFE.

            <P>(5) The mortgage broker may at any time collect from the loan applicant any information that it requires in addition to the required application information. However, the mortgage broker is not permitted to require, as a condition for providing a GFE, that an applicant submit supplemental documentation to verify the information provided on the application.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Availability of GFE terms.</E> Except as provided in this paragraph, the estimate of the charges and terms for all settlement services must be available for at least 10 business days from when the GFE is provided, but it may remain available longer, if the loan originator extends the period of availability. The estimate for the following charges are excepted from this requirement: the interest rate, charges and terms dependent upon the interest rate, which includes the charge or credit for the interest rate chosen, the adjusted origination charges, and per diem interest.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Content and form of GFE.</E> The GFE form is set out in appendix C to this part. The loan originator must prepare the GFE in accordance with the requirements of this section and the Instructions in appendix C to this part. The instructions in appendix C to this part allow for flexibility in the preparation and distribution of the GFE in hard copy and electronic format.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Tolerances for amounts included on GFE.</E> (1) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, the actual charges at settlement may not exceed the amounts included on the GFE for:</P>

            </P>
            <P>(3) The amounts charged for all other settlement services included on the GFE may change at settlement.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Binding GFE.</E> The loan originator is bound, within the tolerances provided in paragraph (e) of this section, to the settlement charges and terms listed on the GFE provided to the borrower, unless a revised GFE is provided prior to settlement consistent with this paragraph (f) or the GFE expires in accordance with paragraph (f)(4) of this section. If a loan originator provides a revised GFE consistent with this paragraph, the loan originator must document the reason that a revised GFE was provided. Loan originators must retain documentation of any reason for providing a revised GFE for no less than 3 years after settlement.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Changed circumstances affecting settlement costs.</E> If changed circumstances result in increased costs for any settlement services such that the charges at settlement would exceed the tolerances for those charges, the loan originator may provide a revised GFE to the borrower. If a revised GFE is to be provided, the loan originator must do so within 3 business days of receiving information sufficient to establish changed circumstances. The revised GFE may increase charges for services listed on the GFE only to the extent that the changed circumstances actually resulted in higher charges.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Changed circumstances affecting loan.</E> If changed circumstances result in a change in the borrower's eligibility for the specific loan terms identified in the GFE, the loan originator may provide a revised GFE to the borrower. If a revised GFE is to be provided, the loan originator must do so within 3 business days of receiving information sufficient to establish changed circumstances. The revised GFE may increase charges for services listed on the GFE only to the extent that the changed circumstances affecting the loan actually resulted in higher charges.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Borrower-requested changes.</E> If a borrower requests changes to the federally related mortgage loan identified in the GFE that change the settlement charges or the terms of the loan, the loan originator may provide a revised GFE to the borrower. If a revised GFE is to be provided, the loan originator must do so within three business days of the borrower's request. The revised GFE may increase charges for services listed on the GFE only to the extent that the borrower-requested changes to the mortgage loan identified on the GFE actually resulted in higher charges.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Expiration of GFE.</E> If a borrower does not express an intent to continue with an application within 10 business days after the GFE is provided, or such longer time specified by the loan originator pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, the loan originator is no longer bound by the GFE.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Interest rate-dependent charges and terms.</E> If the interest rate has not been locked, or a locked interest rate has expired, the charge or credit for the interest rate chosen, the adjusted origination charges, per diem interest, and loan terms related to the interest rate may change. When the interest rate is later locked, a revised GFE must be provided showing the revised interest rate-dependent charges and terms. The loan originator must provide the revised GFE within 3 business days of the interest rate being locked or, for an expired interest rate, re-locked. All other charges and terms must remain the same as on the original GFE, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">New construction home purchases.</E> In transactions involving new construction home purchases, where settlement is anticipated to occur more than 60 calendar days from the time a GFE is provided, the loan originator may provide the GFE to the borrower with a clear and conspicuous disclosure stating that at any time up until 60 calendar days prior to closing, the loan originator may issue a revised GFE. If no such separate disclosure is provided, the loan originator cannot issue a revised GFE, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">GFE is not a loan commitment.</E> Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to require a loan originator to make a loan to a particular borrower. The loan originator is not required to provide a GFE if the loan originator does not have available a loan for which the borrower is eligible.<PRTPAGE P="627"/>
            </P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Open-end lines of credit (home-equity plans) under Truth in Lending Act.</E> In the case of a federally related mortgage loan involving an open-end line of credit (home-equity plan) covered under the Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z, a lender or mortgage broker that provides the borrower with the disclosures required by 12 CFR 1026.40 of Regulation Z at the time the borrower applies for such loan shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this section.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Violations of section 5 of RESPA (12 U.S.C. 2604).</E> A loan originator that violates the requirements of this section shall be deemed to have violated section 5 of RESPA. If any charges at settlement exceed the charges listed on the GFE by more than the permitted tolerances, the loan originator may cure the tolerance violation by reimbursing to the borrower the amount by which the tolerance was exceeded, at settlement or within 30 calendar days after settlement. A borrower will be deemed to have received timely reimbursement if the loan originator delivers or places the payment in the mail within 30 calendar days after settlement.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Use by settlement agent.</E> The settlement agent shall use the HUD-1 settlement statement in every settlement involving a federally related mortgage loan in which there is a borrower and a seller. For transactions in which there is a borrower and no seller, such as refinancing loans or subordinate lien loans, the HUD-1 may be utilized by using the borrower's side of the HUD-1 statement. Alternatively, the form HUD-1A may be used for these transactions. The HUD-1 or HUD-1A may be modified as permitted under this part. Either the HUD-1 or the HUD-1A, as appropriate, shall be used for every RESPA-covered transaction, unless its use is specifically exempted. The use of the HUD-1 or HUD-1A is exempted for open-end lines of credit (home-equity plans) covered by the Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z.</P>

All origination services performed by or on behalf of the loan originator must be included in the loan originator's own charge. Administrative and processing services related to title services must be included in the title underwriter's or title agent's own charge. The amount stated on the HUD-1 or HUD-1A for any itemized service cannot exceed the amount actually received by the settlement service provider for that itemized service, unless the charge is an average charge in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>

The total amounts paid by borrowers and sellers for a settlement service based on the use of an average charge may not exceed the total amounts paid to the providers of that service for the particular class of transactions.</P>

            <P>(A) A period of time as determined by the settlement service provider, but not less than 30 calendar days and not more than 6 months;</P>
            <P>(B) A geographic area as determined by the settlement service provider; and</P>

            <P>(C) A type of loan as determined by the settlement service provider.<PRTPAGE P="628"/>
            </P>
            <P>(iii) A settlement service provider may use an average charge in the same class of transactions for which the charge was calculated. If the settlement service provider uses the average charge for any transaction in the class, the settlement service provider must use the same average charge in every transaction within that class for which a GFE was provided.</P>
            <P>(iv) The use of an average charge is not permitted for any settlement service if the charge for the service is based on the loan amount or property value. For example, an average charge may not be used for transfer taxes, interest charges, reserves or escrow, or any type of insurance, including mortgage insurance, title insurance, or hazard insurance.</P>
            <P>(v) The settlement service provider must retain all documentation used to calculate the average charge for a particular class of transactions for at least 3 years after any settlement for which that average charge was used.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Violations of section 4 of RESPA (12 U.S.C. 2603).</E> A violation of any of the requirements of this section will be deemed to be a violation of section 4 of RESPA. An inadvertent or technical error in completing the HUD-1 or HUD-1A shall not be deemed a violation of section 4 of RESPA if a revised HUD-1 or HUD-1A is provided in accordance with the requirements of this section within 30 calendar days after settlement.</P>

            <P>(2) The name, address, and other information regarding the lender and settlement agent may be printed in sections F and H, respectively.</P>
            <P>(3) Reproduction of the HUD-1 must conform to the terminology, sequence, and numbering of line items as presented in lines 100-1400. However, blank lines or items listed in lines 100-1400 that are not used locally or in connection with mortgages by the lender may be deleted, except for the following: Lines 100, 120, 200, 220, 300, 301, 302, 303, 400, 420, 500, 520, 600, 601, 602, 603, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1100, 1200, 1300, and 1400.

The number of a deleted item shall not be used for a substitute or new item, but the number of a blank space on the HUD-1 may be used for a substitute or new item.</P>
            <P>(4) Charges not listed on the HUD-1, but that are customary locally or pursuant to the lender's practice, may be inserted in blank spaces. Where existing blank spaces on the HUD-1 are insufficient, additional lines and spaces may be added and numbered in sequence with spaces on the HUD-1.</P>

            <P>(5) The following variations in layout and format are within the discretion of persons reproducing the HUD-1 and do not require prior Bureau approval: Size of pages; tint or color of pages; size and style of type or print; vertical spacing between lines or provision for additional horizontal space on lines (for example, to provide sufficient space for recording time periods used in prorations); printing of the HUD-1 contents on separate pages, on the front and back of a single page, or on one continuous page; use of multicopy tear-out sets; printing on rolls for computer purposes; reorganization of sections B through I, when necessary to accommodate computer printing; and manner of placement of the HUD number, but not the OMB approval number, neither of which may be deleted. The expiration date associated with the OMB number listed on the form may be deleted. Any changes in the HUD number or OMB approval number may be announced by notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> rather than by amendment of this part.</P>

            <P>(8) The HUD-1 may be translated into languages other than English.</P>

            <P>(9) An additional page may be attached to the HUD-1 for the purpose of including customary recitals and information used locally in real estate settlements; for example, breakdown of <PRTPAGE P="629"/>payoff figures, a breakdown of the borrower's total monthly mortgage payments, check disbursements, a statement indicating receipt of funds, applicable special stipulations between buyer and seller, and the date funds are transferred. If space permits, such information may be added at the end of the HUD-1.</P>
            <P>(10) As required by HUD/FHA in FHA-insured loans.</P>

            <P>(c) <E T="03">Written approval.</E> Any other deviation in the HUD-1 or HUD-1A forms is permissible only upon receipt of written approval of the Bureau; provided, however, that notwithstanding contrary instructions in this section or appendix A of this part, reproducing the HUD-1 or HUD-1A forms with the Bureau's OMB approval number displayed in place of HUD's OMB approval number does not require the written approval of the Bureau. A request to the Bureau for approval shall be submitted in writing to the address indicated in the definition of <E T="03">Public Guidance Documents</E> in § 1024.2 and shall state the reasons why the applicant believes such deviation is needed.

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Inspection one day prior to settlement upon request by the borrower.</E> The settlement agent shall permit the borrower to inspect the HUD-1 or HUD-1A settlement statement, completed to set forth those items that are known to the settlement agent at the time of inspection, during the business day immediately preceding settlement. Items related only to the seller's transaction may be omitted from the HUD-1.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Delivery.</E> The settlement agent shall provide a completed HUD-1 or HUD-1A to the borrower, the seller (if there is one), the lender (if the lender is not the settlement agent), and/or their agents. When the borrower's and seller's copies of the HUD-1 or HUD-1A differ as permitted by the instructions in appendix A to this part, both copies shall be provided to the lender (if the lender is not the settlement agent). The settlement agent shall deliver the completed HUD-1 or HUD-1A at or before the settlement, except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.</P>

            <P>(e) <E T="03">Recordkeeping.</E> The lender shall retain each completed HUD-1 or HUD-1A and related documents for five years after settlement, unless the lender disposes of its interest in the mortgage and does not service the mortgage. In that case, the lender shall provide its copy of the HUD-1 or HUD-1A to the owner or servicer of the mortgage as a part of the transfer of the loan file. Such owner or servicer shall retain the HUD-1 or HUD-1A for the remainder of the five-year period. The Bureau shall have the right to inspect or require copies of records covered by this paragraph (e).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Prohibition against kickbacks and unearned fees.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Section 8 violation.</E> Any violation of this section is a violation of section 8 of RESPA (12 U.S.C. 2607).</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">No referral fees.</E> No person shall give and no person shall accept any fee, kickback or other thing of value pursuant to any agreement or understanding, oral or otherwise, that business incident to or part of a settlement service involving a federally related mortgage loan shall be referred to any person. Any referral of a settlement service is not a compensable service, except as set forth in § 1024.14(g)(1). A company may not pay any other company or the employees of any other company for the referral of settlement service business.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">No split of charges except for actual services performed.</E> No person shall give and no person shall accept any portion, split, or percentage of any charge made or received for the rendering of a settlement service in connection with a transaction involving a federally related mortgage loan other than for services actually performed. A charge by a person for which no or nominal services are performed or for which duplicative fees are charged is an unearned fee and violates this section. The source of the payment does not determine whether or not a service is compensable. Nor may the prohibitions of this part be avoided by creating an arrangement wherein the purchaser of services splits the fee.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Thing of value.</E> This term is broadly defined in section 3(2) of RESPA (12 U.S.C. 2602(2)). It includes, without limitation, monies, things, discounts, salaries, commissions, fees, duplicate payments of a charge, stock, dividends, distributions of partnership profits, franchise royalties, credits representing monies that may be paid at a future date, the opportunity to participate in a money-making program, retained or increased earnings, increased equity in a parent or subsidiary entity, special bank deposits or accounts, special or unusual banking terms, services of all types at special or free rates, sales or rentals at special prices or rates, lease or rental payments based in whole or in part on the amount of business referred, trips and payment of another person's expenses, or reduction in credit against an existing obligation. The term “payment” is used throughout §§ 1024.14 and 1024.15 as synonymous with the giving or receiving of any “thing of value” and does not require transfer of money.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Agreement or understanding.</E> An agreement or understanding for the referral of business incident to or part of a settlement service need not be written or verbalized but may be established by a practice, pattern or course of conduct. When a thing of value is received repeatedly and is connected in any way with the volume or value of the business referred, the receipt of the thing of value is evidence that it is made pursuant to an agreement or understanding for the referral of business.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Referral.</E> (1) A referral includes any oral or written action directed to a person which has the effect of affirmatively influencing the selection by any person of a provider of a settlement service or business incident to or part of a settlement service when such person will pay for such settlement service or business incident thereto or pay <PRTPAGE P="631"/>a charge attributable in whole or in part to such settlement service or business.</P>
            <P>(2) A referral also occurs whenever a person paying for a settlement service or business incident thereto is required to use (see § 1024.2, “required use”) a particular provider of a settlement service or business incident thereto.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Fees, salaries, compensation, or other payments.</E> (1) Section 8 of RESPA permits:</P>
            <P>(i) A payment to an attorney at law for services actually rendered;</P>
            <P>(ii) A payment by a title company to its duly appointed agent for services actually performed in the issuance of a policy of title insurance;</P>
            <P>(iii) A payment by a lender to its duly appointed agent or contractor for services actually performed in the origination, processing, or funding of a loan;</P>
            <P>(iv) A payment to any person of a <E T="03">bona fide</E> salary or compensation or other payment for goods or facilities actually furnished or for services actually performed;</P>
            <P>(v) A payment pursuant to cooperative brokerage and referral arrangements or agreements between real estate agents and real estate brokers. (The statutory exemption restated in this paragraph refers only to fee divisions within real estate brokerage arrangements when all parties are acting in a real estate brokerage capacity, and has no applicability to any fee arrangements between real estate brokers and mortgage brokers or between mortgage brokers.);</P>
            <P>(vi) Normal promotional and educational activities that are not conditioned on the referral of business and that do not involve the defraying of expenses that otherwise would be incurred by persons in a position to refer settlement services or business incident thereto; or</P>
            <P>(vii) An employer's payment to its own employees for any referral activities.</P>

            <P>(2) The Bureau may investigate high prices to see if they are the result of a referral fee or a split of a fee. If the payment of a thing of value bears no reasonable relationship to the market value of the goods or services provided, then the excess is not for services or goods actually performed or provided. These facts may be used as evidence of a violation of section 8 and may serve as a basis for a RESPA investigation. High prices standing alone are not proof of a RESPA violation. The value of a referral (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the value of any additional business obtained thereby) is not to be taken into account in determining whether the payment exceeds the reasonable value of such goods, facilities or services. The fact that the transfer of the thing of value does not result in an increase in any charge made by the person giving the thing of value is irrelevant in determining whether the act is prohibited.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Multiple services.</E> When a person in a position to refer settlement service business, such as an attorney, mortgage lender, real estate broker or agent, or developer or builder, receives a payment for providing additional settlement services as part of a real estate transaction, such payment must be for services that are actual, necessary and distinct from the primary services provided by such person. For example, for an attorney of the buyer or seller to receive compensation as a title agent, the attorney must perform core title agent services (for which liability arises) separate from attorney services, including the evaluation of the title search to determine the insurability of the title, the clearance of underwriting objections, the actual issuance of the policy or policies on behalf of the title insurance company, and, where customary, issuance of the title commitment, and the conducting of the title search and closing.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Recordkeeping.</E> Any documents provided pursuant to this section shall be retained for five (5) years from the date of execution.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Appendix B of this part.</E> Illustrations in appendix B of this part demonstrate some of the requirements of this section.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 1024.15</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Affiliated business arrangements.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> An affiliated business arrangement is defined in section 3(7) of RESPA (12 U.S.C. 2602(7)).</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Violation and exemption.</E> An affiliated business arrangement is not a violation of section 8 of RESPA (12 U.S.C. <PRTPAGE P="632"/>2607) and of § 1024.14 if the conditions set forth in this section are satisfied. Paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall not apply to the extent it is inconsistent with section 8(c)(4)(A) of RESPA (12 U.S.C. 2607(c)(4)(A)).</P>
            <P>(1) The person making each referral has provided to each person whose business is referred a written disclosure, in the format of the Affiliated Business Arrangement Disclosure Statement set forth in appendix D of this part, of the nature of the relationship (explaining the ownership and financial interest) between the provider of settlement services (or business incident thereto) and the person making the referral and of an estimated charge or range of charges generally made by such provider (which describes the charge using the same terminology, as far as practical, as section L of the HUD-1 settlement statement). The disclosures must be provided on a separate piece of paper no later than the time of each referral or, if the lender requires use of a particular provider, the time of loan application, except that:</P>
            <P>(i) Where a lender makes the referral to a borrower, the condition contained in paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be satisfied at the time that the good faith estimate or a statement under § 1024.7(d) is provided; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Whenever an attorney or law firm requires a client to use a particular title insurance agent, the attorney or law firm shall provide the disclosures no later than the time the attorney or law firm is engaged by the client.</P>

            <P>(iii) Failure to comply with the disclosure requirements of this section may be overcome if the person making a referral can prove by a preponderance of the evidence that procedures reasonably adopted to result in compliance with these conditions have been maintained and that any failure to comply with these conditions was unintentional and the result of a <E T="03">bona fide</E> error. An error of legal judgment with respect to a person's obligations under RESPA is not a <E T="03">bona fide</E> error. Administrative and judicial interpretations of section 130(c) of the Truth in Lending Act shall not be binding interpretations of the preceding sentence or section 8(d)(3) of RESPA (12 U.S.C. 2607(d)(3)).</P>
            <P>(2) No person making a referral has required (as defined in § 1024.2, “required use”) any person to use any particular provider of settlement services or business incident thereto, except if such person is a lender, for requiring a buyer, borrower or seller to pay for the services of an attorney, credit reporting agency, or real estate appraiser chosen by the lender to represent the lender's interest in a real estate transaction, or except if such person is an attorney or law firm for arranging for issuance of a title insurance policy for a client, directly as agent or through a separate corporate title insurance agency that may be operated as an adjunct to the law practice of the attorney or law firm, as part of representation of that client in a real estate transaction.</P>
            <P>(3) The only thing of value that is received from the arrangement other than payments listed in § 1024.14(g) is a return on an ownership interest or franchise relationship.</P>
            <P>(i) In an affiliated business arrangement:</P>
            <P>(A) <E T="03">Bona fide</E> dividends, and capital or equity distributions, related to ownership interest or franchise relationship, between entities in an affiliate relationship, are permissible; and</P>
            <P>(B) <E T="03">Bona fide</E> business loans, advances, and capital or equity contributions between entities in an affiliate relationship (in any direction), are not prohibited—so long as they are for ordinary business purposes and are not fees for the referral of settlement service business or unearned fees.</P>
            <P>(ii) A return on an ownership interest does not include:</P>
            <P>(A) Any payment which has as a basis of calculation no apparent business motive other than distinguishing among recipients of payments on the basis of the amount of their actual, estimated or anticipated referrals;</P>
            <P>(B) Any payment which varies according to the relative amount of referrals by the different recipients of similar payments; or</P>

            <P>(C) A payment based on an ownership, partnership or joint venture share which has been adjusted on the basis of <PRTPAGE P="633"/>previous relative referrals by recipients of similar payments.</P>

            <P>(iii) Neither the mere labeling of a thing of value, nor the fact that it may be calculated pursuant to a corporate or partnership organizational document or a franchise agreement, will determine whether it is a <E T="03">bona fide</E> return on an ownership interest or franchise relationship. Whether a thing of value is such a return will be determined by analyzing facts and circumstances on a case by case basis.</P>
            <P>(iv) A return on franchise relationship may be a payment to or from a franchisee but it does not include any payment which is not based on the franchise agreement, nor any payment which varies according to the number or amount of referrals by the franchisor or franchisee or which is based on a franchise agreement which has been adjusted on the basis of a previous number or amount of referrals by the franchiser or franchisees. A franchise agreement may not be constructed to insulate against kickbacks or referral fees.</P>

            <P>

            <SUBJECT>Escrow accounts.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> This section sets out the requirements for an escrow account that a lender establishes in connection with a federally related mortgage loan. It sets limits for escrow accounts using calculations based on monthly payments and disbursements within a calendar year. If an escrow account involves biweekly or any other payment period, the requirements in this section shall be modified accordingly. A Public <PRTPAGE P="634"/>Guidance Document entitled “Biweekly Payments—Example” provides examples of biweekly accounting and a Public Guidance Document entitled “Annual Escrow Account Disclosure Statement—Example” provides examples of a 3-year accounting cycle that may be used in accordance with paragraph (c)(9) of this section. A Public Guidance Document entitled “Consumer Disclosure for Voluntary Escrow Account Payments” provides a model disclosure format that originators and servicers are encouraged, but not required, to provide to consumers when the originator or servicer anticipates a substantial increase in disbursements from the escrow account after the first year of the loan. The disclosures in that model format may be combined with or included in the Initial Escrow Account Statement required in § 1024.17(g).</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> As used in this section:</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Aggregate (or) composite analysis,</E> hereafter called <E T="03">aggregate analysis,</E> means an accounting method a servicer uses in conducting an escrow account analysis by computing the sufficiency of escrow account funds by analyzing the account as a whole. Appendix E to this part sets forth examples of aggregate escrow account analyses.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Annual escrow account statement</E> means a statement containing all of the information set forth in § 1024.17(i). As noted in § 1024.17(i), a servicer shall submit an annual escrow account statement to the borrower within 30 calendar days of the end of the escrow account computation year, after conducting an escrow account analysis.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Cushion or reserve</E> (hereafter cushion) means funds that a servicer may require a borrower to pay into an escrow account to cover unanticipated disbursements or disbursements made before the borrower's payments are available in the account, as limited by § 1024.17(c).</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Deficiency</E> is the amount of a negative balance in an escrow account. As noted in § 1024.17(f), if a servicer advances funds for a borrower, then the servicer must perform an escrow account analysis before seeking repayment of the deficiency.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Delivery</E> means the placing of a document in the United States mail, first-class postage paid, addressed to the last known address of the recipient. Hand delivery also constitutes delivery.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Disbursement date</E> means the date on which the servicer actually pays an escrow item from the escrow account.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Escrow account</E> means any account that a servicer establishes or controls on behalf of a borrower to pay taxes, insurance premiums (including flood insurance), or other charges with respect to a federally related mortgage loan, including charges that the borrower and servicer have voluntarily agreed that the servicer should collect and pay. The definition encompasses any account established for this purpose, including a “trust account”, “reserve account”, “impound account”, or other term in different localities. An “escrow account” includes any arrangement where the servicer adds a portion of the borrower's payments to principal and subsequently deducts from principal the disbursements for escrow account items. For purposes of this section, the term “escrow account” excludes any account that is under the borrower's total control.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Escrow account analysis</E> means the accounting that a servicer conducts in the form of a trial running balance for an escrow account to:</P>
            <P>(1) Determine the appropriate target balances;</P>
            <P>(2) Compute the borrower's monthly payments for the next escrow account computation year and any deposits needed to establish or maintain the account; and</P>
            <P>(3) Determine whether shortages, surpluses or deficiencies exist.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Escrow account computation year</E> is a 12-month period that a servicer establishes for the escrow account beginning with the borrower's initial payment date. The term includes each 12-month period thereafter, unless a servicer chooses to issue a short year statement under the conditions stated in § 1024.17(i)(4).</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Escrow account item</E> or <E T="03">separate item</E> means any separate expenditure category, such as “taxes” or “insurance”, <PRTPAGE P="635"/>for which funds are collected in the escrow account for disbursement. An escrow account item with installment payments, such as local property taxes, remains one escrow account item regardless of multiple disbursement dates to the tax authority.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Initial escrow account statement</E> means the first disclosure statement that the servicer delivers to the borrower concerning the borrower's escrow account. The initial escrow account statement shall meet the requirements of § 1024.17(g) and be in substantially the format set forth in § 1024.17(h).</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Installment payment</E> means one of two or more payments payable on an escrow account item during an escrow account computation year. An example of an installment payment is where a jurisdiction bills quarterly for taxes.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Payment due date</E> means the date each month when the borrower's monthly payment to an escrow account is due to the servicer. The initial payment date is the borrower's first payment due date to an escrow account.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Penalty</E> means a late charge imposed by the payee for paying after the disbursement is due. It does not include any additional charge or fee imposed by the payee associated with choosing installment payments as opposed to annual payments or for choosing one installment plan over another.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Pre-accrual</E> is a practice some servicers use to require borrowers to deposit funds, needed for disbursement and maintenance of a cushion, in the escrow account some period before the disbursement date. Pre-accrual is subject to the limitations of § 1024.17(c).</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Shortage</E> means an amount by which a current escrow account balance falls short of the target balance at the time of escrow analysis.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Single-item analysis</E> means an accounting method servicers use in conducting an escrow account analysis by computing the sufficiency of escrow account funds by considering each escrow item separately. Appendix E to this part sets forth examples of single-item analysis.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Submission</E> (of an escrow account statement) means the delivery of the statement.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Surplus</E> means an amount by which the current escrow account balance exceeds the target balance for the account.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">System of recordkeeping</E> means the servicer's method of keeping information that reflects the facts relating to that servicer's handling of the borrower's escrow account, including, but not limited to, the payment of amounts from the escrow account and the submission of initial and annual escrow account statements to borrowers.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Target balance</E> means the estimated month end balance in an escrow account that is just sufficient to cover the remaining disbursements from the escrow account in the escrow account computation year, taking into account the remaining scheduled periodic payments, and a cushion, if any.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Trial running balance</E> means the accounting process that derives the target balances over the course of an escrow account computation year. Section 1024.17(d) provides a description of the steps involved in performing a trial running balance.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Limits on payments to escrow accounts.</E> (1) A lender or servicer (hereafter servicer) shall not require a borrower to deposit into any escrow account, created in connection with a federally related mortgage loan, more than the following amounts:</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Charges at settlement or upon creation of an escrow account.</E> At the time a servicer creates an escrow account for a borrower, the servicer may charge the borrower an amount sufficient to pay the charges respecting the mortgaged property, such as taxes and insurance, which are attributable to the period from the date such payment(s) were last paid until the initial payment date. The “amount sufficient to pay” is computed so that the lowest month end target balance projected for the escrow account computation year is zero (-0-) (see Step 2 in appendix E to this part). In addition, the servicer may charge the borrower a cushion that shall be no greater than one-sixth (<FR>1/6</FR>) of the estimated total annual payments from the escrow account.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Charges during the life of the escrow account.</E> Throughout the life of an escrow account, the servicer may charge the borrower a monthly sum equal to one-twelfth (<FR>1/12</FR>) of the total annual escrow payments which the <PRTPAGE P="636"/>servicer reasonably anticipates paying from the account. In addition, the servicer may add an amount to maintain a cushion no greater than one-sixth (<FR>1/6</FR>) of the estimated total annual payments from the account. However, if a servicer determines through an escrow account analysis that there is a shortage or deficiency, the servicer may require the borrower to pay additional deposits to make up the shortage or eliminate the deficiency, subject to the limitations set forth in § 1024.17(f).</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Escrow analysis at creation of escrow account.</E> Before establishing an escrow account, the servicer must conduct an escrow account analysis to determine the amount the borrower must deposit into the escrow account (subject to the limitations of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section), and the amount of the borrower's periodic payments into the escrow account (subject to the limitations of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section). In conducting the escrow account analysis, the servicer must estimate the disbursement amounts according to paragraph (c)(7) of this section. Pursuant to paragraph (k) of this section, the servicer must use a date on or before the deadline to avoid a penalty as the disbursement date for the escrow item and comply with any other requirements of paragraph (k) of this section. Upon completing the initial escrow account analysis, the servicer must prepare and deliver an initial escrow account statement to the borrower, as set forth in paragraph (g) of this section. The servicer must use the escrow account analysis to determine whether a surplus, shortage, or deficiency exists and must make any adjustments to the account pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Subsequent escrow account analyses.</E> For each escrow account, the servicer must conduct an escrow account analysis at the completion of the escrow account computation year to determine the borrower's monthly escrow account payments for the next computation year, subject to the limitations of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. In conducting the escrow account analysis, the servicer must estimate the disbursement amounts according to paragraph (c)(7) of this section. Pursuant to paragraph (k) of this section, the servicer must use a date on or before the deadline to avoid a penalty as the disbursement date for the escrow item and comply with any other requirements of paragraph (k) of this section. The servicer must use the escrow account analysis to determine whether a surplus, shortage, or deficiency exists, and must make any adjustments to the account pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section. Upon completing an escrow account analysis, the servicer must prepare and submit an annual escrow account statement to the borrower, as set forth in paragraph (i) of this section.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Aggregate accounting required.</E> All servicers must use the aggregate accounting method in conducting escrow account analyses.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Cushion.</E> The cushion must be no greater than one-sixth (<FR>1/6</FR>) of the estimated total annual disbursements from the escrow account.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Restrictions on pre-accrual.</E> A servicer must not practice pre-accrual.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Servicer estimates of disbursement amounts.</E> To conduct an escrow account analysis, the servicer shall estimate the amount of escrow account items to be disbursed. If the servicer knows the charge for an escrow item in the next computation year, then the servicer shall use that amount in estimating disbursement amounts. If the charge is unknown to the servicer, the servicer may base the estimate on the preceding year's charge, or the preceding year's charge as modified by an amount not exceeding the most recent year's change in the national Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers (CPI, all items). In cases of unassessed new construction, the servicer may base an estimate on the assessment of comparable residential property in the market area.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Provisions in federally related mortgage documents.</E> The servicer must examine the federally related mortgage loan documents to determine the applicable cushion for each escrow account. If any such documents provide for lower cushion limits, then the terms of the loan documents apply. Where the terms of any such documents allow greater payments to an escrow account <PRTPAGE P="637"/>than allowed by this section, then this section controls the applicable limits. Where such documents do not specifically establish an escrow account, whether a servicer may establish an escrow account for the loan is a matter for determination by other Federal or State law. If such documents are silent on the escrow account limits and a servicer establishes an escrow account under other Federal or State law, then the limitations of this section apply unless applicable Federal or State law provides for a lower amount. If such documents provide for escrow accounts up to the RESPA limits, then the servicer may require the maximum amounts consistent with this section, unless an applicable Federal or State law sets a lesser amount.</P>
            <P>(9) <E T="03">Assessments for periods longer than one year.</E> Some escrow account items may be billed for periods longer than one year. For example, servicers may need to collect flood insurance or water purification escrow funds for payment every three years. In such cases, the servicer shall estimate the borrower's payments for a full cycle of disbursements. For a flood insurance premium payable every 3 years, the servicer shall collect the payments reflecting 36 equal monthly amounts. For two out of the three years, however, the account balance may not reach its low monthly balance because the low point will be on a three-year cycle, as compared to an annual one. The annual escrow account statement shall explain this situation (see example in the Public Guidance Document entitled “Annual Escrow Account Disclosure Statement—Example”, available in accordance with § 1024.3).</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Methods of escrow account analysis.</E> (1) The following sets forth the steps servicers must use to determine whether their use of aggregate analysis conforms with the limitations in § 1024.17(c)(1). The steps set forth in this section result in maximum limits. Servicers may use accounting procedures that result in lower target balances. In particular, servicers may use a cushion less than the permissible cushion or no cushion at all. This section does not require the use of a cushion.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Aggregate analysis.</E> (i) In conducting the escrow account analysis using aggregate analysis, the target balances may not exceed the balances computed according to the following arithmetic operations:</P>
            <P>(A) The servicer first projects a trial balance for the account as a whole over the next computation year (a trial running balance). In doing so the servicer assumes that it will make estimated disbursements on or before the earlier of the deadline to take advantage of discounts, if available, or the deadline to avoid a penalty. The servicer does not use pre-accrual on these disbursement dates. The servicer also assumes that the borrower will make monthly payments equal to one-twelfth of the estimated total annual escrow account disbursements.</P>
            <P>(B) The servicer then examines the monthly trial balances and adds to the first monthly balance an amount just sufficient to bring the lowest monthly trial balance to zero, and adjusts all other monthly balances accordingly.</P>
            <P>(C) The servicer then adds to the monthly balances the permissible cushion. The cushion is two months of the borrower's escrow payments to the servicer or a lesser amount specified by state law or the mortgage document (net of any increases or decreases because of prior year shortages or surpluses, respectively).</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Lowest monthly balance.</E> Under aggregate analysis, the lowest monthly target balance for the account shall be less than or equal to one-sixth of the estimated total annual escrow account disbursements or a lesser amount specified by state law or the mortgage document. The target balances that the servicer derives using these steps yield the maximum limit for the escrow account. Appendix E to this part illustrates these steps.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Transfer of servicing.</E> (1) If the new servicer changes either the monthly payment amount or the accounting method used by the transferor (old) servicer, then the new servicer shall provide the borrower with an initial escrow account statement within 60 days of the date of servicing transfer.</P>

            <P>(i) Where a new servicer provides an initial escrow account statement upon the transfer of servicing, the new <PRTPAGE P="638"/>servicer shall use the effective date of the transfer of servicing to establish the new escrow account computation year.</P>
            <P>(ii) Where the new servicer retains the monthly payments and accounting method used by the transferor servicer, then the new servicer may continue to use the escrow account computation year established by the transferor servicer or may choose to establish a different computation year using a short-year statement. At the completion of the escrow account computation year or any short year, the new servicer shall perform an escrow analysis and provide the borrower with an annual escrow account statement.</P>
            <P>(2) The new servicer shall treat shortages, surpluses and deficiencies in the transferred escrow account according to the procedures set forth in § 1024.17(f).</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Shortages, surpluses, and deficiencies requirements</E>—(1) <E T="03">Escrow account analysis.</E> For each escrow account, the servicer shall conduct an escrow account analysis to determine whether a surplus, shortage or deficiency exists.</P>
            <P>(i) As noted in § 1024.17(c)(2) and (3), the servicer shall conduct an escrow account analysis upon establishing an escrow account and at completion of the escrow account computation year.</P>
            <P>(ii) The servicer may conduct an escrow account analysis at other times during the escrow computation year. If a servicer advances funds in paying a disbursement, which is not the result of a borrower's payment default under the underlying mortgage document, then the servicer shall conduct an escrow account analysis to determine the extent of the deficiency before seeking repayment of the funds from the borrower under this paragraph (f).</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Surpluses.</E> (i) If an escrow account analysis discloses a surplus, the servicer shall, within 30 days from the date of the analysis, refund the surplus to the borrower if the surplus is greater than or equal to 50 dollars ($50). If the surplus is less than 50 dollars ($50), the servicer may refund such amount to the borrower, or credit such amount against the next year's escrow payments.</P>
            <P>(ii) These provisions regarding surpluses apply if the borrower is current at the time of the escrow account analysis. A borrower is current if the servicer receives the borrower's payments within 30 days of the payment due date. If the servicer does not receive the borrower's payment within 30 days of the payment due date, then the servicer may retain the surplus in the escrow account pursuant to the terms of the federally related mortgage loan documents.</P>
            <P>(iii) After an initial or annual escrow analysis has been performed, the servicer and the borrower may enter into a voluntary agreement for the forthcoming escrow accounting year for the borrower to deposit funds into the escrow account for that year greater than the limits established under paragraph (c) of this section. Such an agreement shall cover only one escrow accounting year, but a new voluntary agreement may be entered into after the next escrow analysis is performed. The voluntary agreement may not alter how surpluses are to be treated when the next escrow analysis is performed at the end of the escrow accounting year covered by the voluntary agreement.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Shortages.</E> (i) If an escrow account analysis discloses a shortage of less than one month's escrow account payment, then the servicer has three possible courses of action:</P>
            <P>(A) The servicer may allow a shortage to exist and do nothing to change it;</P>
            <P>(B) The servicer may require the borrower to repay the shortage amount within 30 days; or</P>
            <P>(C) The servicer may require the borrower to repay the shortage amount in equal monthly payments over at least a 12-month period.</P>
            <P>(ii) If an escrow account analysis discloses a shortage that is greater than or equal to one month's escrow account payment, then the servicer has two possible courses of action:</P>
            <P>(A) The servicer may allow a shortage to exist and do nothing to change it; or</P>
            <P>(B) The servicer may require the borrower to repay the shortage in equal monthly payments over at least a 12-month period.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Deficiency.</E> If the escrow account analysis confirms a deficiency, then <PRTPAGE P="639"/>the servicer may require the borrower to pay additional monthly deposits to the account to eliminate the deficiency.</P>
            <P>(i) If the deficiency is less than one month's escrow account payment, then the servicer:</P>
            <P>(A) May allow the deficiency to exist and do nothing to change it;</P>
            <P>(B) May require the borrower to repay the deficiency within 30 days; or</P>
            <P>(C) May require the borrower to repay the deficiency in 2 or more equal monthly payments.</P>
            <P>(ii) If the deficiency is greater than or equal to 1 month's escrow payment, the servicer may allow the deficiency to exist and do nothing to change it or may require the borrower to repay the deficiency in two or more equal monthly payments.</P>
            <P>(iii) These provisions regarding deficiencies apply if the borrower is current at the time of the escrow account analysis. A borrower is current if the servicer receives the borrower's payments within 30 days of the payment due date. If the servicer does not receive the borrower's payment within 30 days of the payment due date, then the servicer may recover the deficiency pursuant to the terms of the federally related mortgage loan documents.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Notice of shortage or deficiency in escrow account.</E> The servicer shall notify the borrower at least once during the escrow account computation year if there is a shortage or deficiency in the escrow account. The notice may be part of the annual escrow account statement or it may be a separate document.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Initial escrow account statement</E>—(1) <E T="03">Submission at settlement, or within 45 calendar days of settlement.</E> As noted in § 1024.17(c)(2), the servicer shall conduct an escrow account analysis before establishing an escrow account to determine the amount the borrower shall deposit into the escrow account, subject to the limitations of § 1024.17(c)(1)(i). After conducting the escrow account analysis for each escrow account, the servicer shall submit an initial escrow account statement to the borrower at settlement or within 45 calendar days of settlement for escrow accounts that are established as a condition of the loan.</P>
            <P>(i) The initial escrow account statement shall include the amount of the borrower's monthly mortgage payment and the portion of the monthly payment going into the escrow account and shall itemize the estimated taxes, insurance premiums, and other charges that the servicer reasonably anticipates to be paid from the escrow account during the escrow account computation year and the anticipated disbursement dates of those charges. The initial escrow account statement shall indicate the amount that the servicer selects as a cushion. The statement shall include a trial running balance for the account.</P>
            <P>(ii) Pursuant to § 1024.17(h)(2), the servicer may incorporate the initial escrow account statement into the HUD-1 or HUD-1A settlement statement. If the servicer does not incorporate the initial escrow account statement into the HUD-1 or HUD-1A settlement statement, then the servicer shall submit the initial escrow account statement to the borrower as a separate document.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Time of submission of initial escrow account statement for an escrow account established after settlement.</E> For escrow accounts established after settlement (and which are not a condition of the loan), a servicer shall submit an initial escrow account statement to a borrower within 45 calendar days of the date of establishment of the escrow account.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Format for initial escrow account statement.</E> (1) The format and a completed example for an initial escrow account statement are set out in Public Guidance Documents entitled “Initial Escrow Account Disclosure Statement—Format” and “Initial Escrow Account Disclosure Statement—Example,” available in accordance with the direction in the definition of <E T="03">Public Guidance Documents</E> in § 1024.2.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Incorporation of initial escrow account statement into HUD-1 or HUD-1A settlement statement.</E> Pursuant to § 1024.9(a)(11), a servicer may add the initial escrow account statement to the HUD-1 or HUD-1A settlement statement. The servicer may include the initial escrow account statement in the basic text or may attach the initial <PRTPAGE P="640"/>escrow account statement as an additional page to the HUD-1 or HUD-1A settlement statement.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Identification of payees.</E> The initial escrow account statement need not identify a specific payee by name if it provides sufficient information to identify the use of the funds. For example, appropriate entries include: county taxes, hazard insurance, condominium dues, <E T="03">etc.</E> If a particular payee, such as a taxing body, receives more than one payment during the escrow account computation year, the statement shall indicate each payment and disbursement date. If there are several taxing authorities or insurers, the statement shall identify each taxing body or insurer (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> “City Taxes”, “School Taxes”, “Hazard Insurance”, or “Flood Insurance,” <E T="03">etc.</E>).</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Annual escrow account statements.</E> For each escrow account, a servicer shall submit an annual escrow account statement to the borrower within 30 days of the completion of the escrow account computation year. The servicer shall also submit to the borrower the previous year's projection or initial escrow account statement. The servicer shall conduct an escrow account analysis before submitting an annual escrow account statement to the borrower.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Contents of annual escrow account statement.</E> The annual escrow account statement shall provide an account history, reflecting the activity in the escrow account during the escrow account computation year, and a projection of the activity in the account for the next year. In preparing the statement, the servicer may assume scheduled payments and disbursements will be made for the final 2 months of the escrow account computation year. The annual escrow account statement must include, at a minimum, the following (the items in paragraphs (i)(1)(i) through (i)(1)(iv) must be clearly itemized):</P>
            <P>(i) The amount of the borrower's current monthly mortgage payment and the portion of the monthly payment going into the escrow account;</P>
            <P>(ii) The amount of the past year's monthly mortgage payment and the portion of the monthly payment that went into the escrow account;</P>
            <P>(iii) The total amount paid into the escrow account during the past computation year;</P>
            <P>(iv) The total amount paid out of the escrow account during the same period for taxes, insurance premiums, and other charges (as separately identified);</P>
            <P>(v) The balance in the escrow account at the end of the period;</P>
            <P>(vi) An explanation of how any surplus is being handled by the servicer;</P>
            <P>(vii) An explanation of how any shortage or deficiency is to be paid by the borrower; and</P>
            <P>(viii) If applicable, the reason(s) why the estimated low monthly balance was not reached, as indicated by noting differences between the most recent account history and last year's projection. Public Guidance Documents entitled “Annual Escrow Account Disclosure Statement—Format” and “Annual Escrow Account Disclosure Statement—Example” set forth an acceptable format and methodology for conveying this information.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">No annual statements in the case of default, foreclosure, or bankruptcy.</E> This paragraph (i)(2) contains an exemption from the provisions of § 1024.17(i)(1). If at the time the servicer conducts the escrow account analysis the borrower is more than 30 days overdue, then the servicer is exempt from the requirements of submitting an annual escrow account statement to the borrower under § 1024.17(i). This exemption also applies in situations where the servicer has brought an action for foreclosure under the underlying federally related mortgage loan, or where the borrower is in bankruptcy proceedings. If the servicer does not issue an annual statement pursuant to this exemption and the loan subsequently is reinstated or otherwise becomes current, the servicer shall provide a history of the account since the last annual statement (which may be longer than 1 year) within 90 days of the date the account became current.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Delivery with other material.</E> The servicer may deliver the annual escrow account statement to the borrower with other statements or materials, including the Substitute 1098, which is provided for Federal income tax purposes.<PRTPAGE P="641"/>
            </P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Short year statements.</E> A servicer may issue a short year annual escrow account statement (“short year statement”) to change one escrow account computation year to another. By using a short year statement a servicer may adjust its production schedule or alter the escrow account computation year for the escrow account.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Effect of short year statement.</E> The short year statement shall end the “escrow account computation year” for the escrow account and establish the beginning date of the new escrow account computation year. The servicer shall deliver the short year statement to the borrower within 60 days from the end of the short year.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Short year statement upon servicing transfer.</E> Upon the transfer of servicing, the transferor (old) servicer shall submit a short year statement to the borrower within 60 days of the effective date of transfer.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Short year statement upon loan payoff.</E> If a borrower pays off a federally related mortgage loan during the escrow account computation year, the servicer shall submit a short year statement to the borrower within 60 days after receiving the payoff funds.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Formats for annual escrow account statement.</E> The formats and completed examples for annual escrow account statements using single-item analysis (pre-rule accounts) and aggregate analysis are set out in Public Guidance Documents entitled “Annual Escrow Account Disclosure Statement—Format” and “Annual Escrow Account Disclosure Statement—Example”.</P>
            <P>(k) <E T="03">Timely payments.</E> (1) If the terms of any federally related mortgage loan require the borrower to make payments to an escrow account, the servicer must pay the disbursements in a timely manner, that is, on or before the deadline to avoid a penalty, as long as the borrower's payment is not more than 30 days overdue.</P>
            <P>(2) The servicer must advance funds to make disbursements in a timely manner as long as the borrower's payment is not more than 30 days overdue. Upon advancing funds to pay a disbursement, the servicer may seek repayment from the borrower for the deficiency pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
            <P>(3) For the payment of property taxes from the escrow account, if a taxing jurisdiction offers a servicer a choice between annual and installment disbursements, the servicer must also comply with this paragraph (k)(3). If the taxing jurisdiction neither offers a discount for disbursements on a lump sum annual basis nor imposes any additional charge or fee for installment disbursements, the servicer must make disbursements on an installment basis. If, however, the taxing jurisdiction offers a discount for disbursements on a lump sum annual basis or imposes any additional charge or fee for installment disbursements, the servicer may, at the servicer's discretion (but is not required by RESPA to), make lump sum annual disbursements in order to take advantage of the discount for the borrower or avoid the additional charge or fee for installments, as long as such method of disbursement complies with paragraphs (k)(1) and (k)(2) of this section. The Bureau encourages, but does not require, the servicer to follow the preference of the borrower, if such preference is known to the servicer.</P>
            <P>(4) Notwithstanding paragraph (k)(3) of this section, a servicer and borrower may mutually agree, on an individual case basis, to a different disbursement basis (installment or annual) or disbursement date for property taxes from that required under paragraph (k)(3) of this section, so long as the agreement meets the requirements of paragraphs (k)(1) and (k)(2) of this section. The borrower must voluntarily agree; neither loan approval nor any term of the loan may be conditioned on the borrower's agreeing to a different disbursement basis or disbursement date.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Timely payment of hazard insurance</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (k)(5)(iii) of this section, with respect to a borrower whose mortgage payment is more than 30 days overdue, but who has established an escrow account for the payment for hazard insurance, as defined in § 1024.31, a servicer may not purchase force-placed insurance, as that term is defined in § 1024.37(a), unless a servicer is unable to disburse funds from the borrower's escrow account to ensure that the borrower's hazard insurance premium charges are paid in a timely manner.<PRTPAGE P="642"/>
            </P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Inability to disburse funds</E>—(A) <E T="03">When inability exists.</E> A servicer is considered unable to disburse funds from a borrower's escrow account to ensure that the borrower's hazard insurance premiums are paid in a timely manner only if the servicer has a reasonable basis to believe either that the borrower's hazard insurance has been canceled (or was not renewed) for reasons other than nonpayment of premium charges or that the borrower's property is vacant.</P>
            <P>(B) <E T="03">When inability does not exist.</E> A servicer shall not be considered unable to disburse funds from the borrower's escrow account because the escrow account contains insufficient funds for paying hazard insurance premium charges.</P>
            <P>(C) <E T="03">Recoupment of advances.</E> If a servicer advances funds to an escrow account to ensure that the borrower's hazard insurance premium charges are paid in a timely manner, a servicer may seek repayment from the borrower for the funds the servicer advanced, unless otherwise prohibited by applicable law.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Small servicers.</E> Notwithstanding paragraphs (k)(5)(i) and (k)(5)(ii)(B) of this section and subject to the requirements in § 1024.37, a servicer that qualifies as a small servicer pursuant to 12 CFR 1026.41(e)(4) may purchase force-placed insurance and charge the cost of that insurance to the borrower if the cost to the borrower of the force-placed insurance is less than the amount the small servicer would need to disburse from the borrower's escrow account to ensure that the borrower's hazard insurance premium charges were paid in a timely manner.</P>
            <P>(l) <E T="03">Discretionary payments.</E> Any borrower's discretionary payment (such as credit life or disability insurance) made as part of a monthly mortgage payment is to be noted on the initial and annual statements. If a discretionary payment is established or terminated during the escrow account computation year, this change should be noted on the next annual statement. A discretionary payment is not part of the escrow account unless the payment is required by the lender, in accordance with the definition of “settlement service” in § 1024.2, or the servicer chooses to place the discretionary payment in the escrow account. If a servicer has not established an escrow account for a federally related mortgage loan and only receives payments for discretionary items, this section is not applicable.</P>

            <P>(i) The servicer has confirmed the successor in interest's identity and ownership interest in the property;</P>
            <P>(ii) Unless the successor in interest assumes the mortgage loan obligation under State law, the successor in interest is not liable for the mortgage debt and cannot be required to use the successor in interest's assets to pay the mortgage debt, except that the lender has a security interest in the property and a right to foreclose on the property, when permitted by law and authorized under the mortgage loan contract;</P>

            <P>(C) Informs the successor in interest that there is no time limit to return the acknowledgment but that the servicer will not begin sending such notices and communications to the confirmed successor in interest until the acknowledgment is returned; and</P>
            <P>(v) Whether or not the successor in interest executes the acknowledgment described in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section, the successor in interest is entitled to submit notices of error under § 1024.35, requests for information under § 1024.36, and requests for a payoff statement under § 1026.36 with respect to the mortgage loan account, with a brief explanation of those rights and how to exercise them, including appropriate address information.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Effect of failure to execute acknowledgment.</E> If, upon confirmation, a servicer provides a confirmed successor in interest who is not liable on the mortgage loan obligation with a written notice and acknowledgment form in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the servicer is not required to provide to the confirmed successor in interest any written disclosure required by § 1024.17, § 1024.33, § 1024.34, § 1024.37, or § 1024.39 or to comply with the live contact requirements in § 1024.39(a) with respect to the confirmed successor in interest until the confirmed successor in interest either <PRTPAGE P="646"/>assumes the mortgage loan obligation under State law or executes an acknowledgment that complies with paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section and provides it to the servicer.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Additional copies of acknowledgment form.</E> If a servicer provides a confirmed successor in interest with a written notice and acknowledgment form in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the servicer must make additional copies of the written notice and acknowledgment form available to the confirmed successor in interest upon written or oral request.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Multiple notices unnecessary.</E> Except as required by § 1024.36, a servicer is not required to provide to a confirmed successor in interest any written disclosure required by § 1024.17, § 1024.33, § 1024.34, § 1024.37, or § 1024.39(b) if the servicer is providing the same specific disclosure to another borrower on the account.

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Servicing disclosure statement.</E> Within three days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) after a person applies for a reverse mortgage transaction, the lender, mortgage broker who anticipates using table funding, or dealer in a first-lien dealer loan shall provide to the person a servicing disclosure statement that states whether the servicing of the mortgage loan may be assigned, sold, or transferred to any other person at any time. Appendix MS-1 of this part contains a model form for the disclosures required under this paragraph (a). If a person who applies for a reverse mortgage transaction is denied credit within the three-day period, a servicing disclosure statement is not required to be delivered.</P>

The notice must contain the information described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. Appendix MS-2 of this part contains a model form for the disclosures required under this paragraph (b).</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Certain transfers excluded.</E> (i) The following transfers are not assignments, sales, or transfers of mortgage loan servicing for purposes of this section if there is no change in the payee, address to which payment must be delivered, account number, or amount of payment due:</P>

            <P>(B) A transfer that results from mergers or acquisitions of servicers or subservicers;</P>
            <P>(C) A transfer that occurs between master servicers without changing the subservicer;</P>
            <P>(ii) The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is not required to provide to the borrower a notice of transfer where a mortgage insured under the National Housing Act is assigned to the FHA.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Time of notice</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) and (iii) of this section, the transferor servicer shall provide the notice of transfer to the borrower not less than 15 days before the effective date of the transfer of the servicing of the mortgage loan. The transferee servicer shall provide the notice of transfer to the borrower not more than 15 days after the effective date of the transfer. The transferor and transferee servicers may provide a single notice, in which case the notice shall be provided not less than 15 days before the effective date of the transfer of the servicing of the mortgage loan.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Extended time.</E> The notice of transfer shall be provided to the borrower by the transferor servicer or the transferee servicer not more than 30 days after the effective date of the transfer of the servicing of the mortgage loan in any case in which the transfer of servicing is preceded by:</P>
            <P>(A) Termination of the contract for servicing the loan for cause;</P>

            <P>(B) Commencement of proceedings for bankruptcy of the servicer;<PRTPAGE P="647"/>
            </P>
            <P>(C) Commencement of proceedings by the FDIC for conservatorship or receivership of the servicer or an entity that owns or controls the servicer; or</P>
            <P>(D) Commencement of proceedings by the NCUA for appointment of a conservator or liquidating agent of the servicer or an entity that owns or controls the servicer.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Notice provided at settlement.</E> Notices of transfer provided at settlement by the transferor servicer and transferee servicer, whether as separate notices or as a combined notice, satisfy the timing requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Contents of notice.</E> The notices of transfer shall include the following information:</P>

            <P>(ii) The name, address, and a collect call or toll-free telephone number for an employee or department of the transferee servicer that can be contacted by the borrower to obtain answers to servicing transfer inquiries;</P>
            <P>(iii) The name, address, and a collect call or toll-free telephone number for an employee or department of the transferor servicer that can be contacted by the borrower to obtain answers to servicing transfer inquiries;</P>
            <P>(iv) The date on which the transferor servicer will cease to accept payments relating to the loan and the date on which the transferee servicer will begin to accept such payments. These dates shall either be the same or consecutive days;</P>
            <P>(v) Whether the transfer will affect the terms or the continued availability of mortgage life or disability insurance, or any other type of optional insurance, and any action the borrower must take to maintain such coverage; and</P>

            <P>(c) <E T="03">Borrower payments during transfer of servicing</E>—(1) <E T="03">Payments not considered late.</E> During the 60-day period beginning on the effective date of transfer of the servicing of any mortgage loan, if the transferor servicer (rather than the transferee servicer that should properly receive payment on the loan) receives payment on or before the applicable due date (including any grace period allowed under the mortgage loan instruments), a payment may not be treated as late for any purpose.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Treatment of payments.</E> Beginning on the effective date of transfer of the servicing of any mortgage loan, with respect to payments received incorrectly by the transferor servicer (rather than the transferee servicer that should properly receive the payment on the loan), the transferor servicer shall promptly either:</P>
            <P>(i) Transfer the payment to the transferee servicer for application to a borrower's mortgage loan account, or</P>
            <P>(ii) Return the payment to the person that made the payment and notify such person of the proper recipient of the payment.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Preemption of State laws.</E> A lender who makes a mortgage loan or a servicer shall be considered to have complied with the provisions of any State law or regulation requiring notice to a borrower at the time of application for a loan or transfer of servicing of a loan if the lender or servicer complies with the requirements of this section. Any State law requiring notice to the borrower at the time of application or at the time of transfer of servicing of the loan is preempted, and there shall be no additional borrower disclosure requirements. Provisions of State law, such as those requiring additional notices to insurance companies or taxing authorities, are not preempted by section 6 of RESPA or this section, and this additional information may be added to a notice provided under this section, if permitted under State law.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Timely escrow disbursements required.</E> If the terms of a mortgage loan require the borrower to make payments to the servicer of the mortgage loan for deposit into an escrow account to pay taxes, insurance premiums, and other charges for the mortgaged property, the servicer shall make payments <PRTPAGE P="648"/>from the escrow account in a timely manner, that is, on or before the deadline to avoid a penalty, as governed by the requirements in § 1024.17(k).</P>

            <P>(2) <E T="03">Servicer may credit funds to a new escrow account.</E> Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, if the borrower agrees, a servicer may credit any amounts remaining in an escrow account that is within the servicer's control to an escrow account for a new mortgage loan as of the date of the settlement of the new mortgage loan if the new mortgage loan is provided to the borrower by a lender that:</P>
            <P>(i) Was also the lender to whom the prior mortgage loan was initially payable;</P>

            <SUBJECT>Error resolution procedures.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Notice of error.</E> A servicer shall comply with the requirements of this section for any written notice from the borrower that asserts an error and that includes the name of the borrower, information that enables the servicer to identify the borrower's mortgage loan account, and the error the borrower believes has occurred. A notice on a payment coupon or other payment form supplied by the servicer need not be treated by the servicer as a notice of error. A qualified written request that asserts an error relating to the servicing of a mortgage loan is a notice of error for purposes of this section, and a servicer must comply with all requirements applicable to a notice of error with respect to such qualified written request.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Scope of error resolution.</E> For purposes of this section, the term “error” refers to the following categories of covered errors:</P>
            <P>(1) Failure to accept a payment that conforms to the servicer's written requirements for the borrower to follow in making payments.</P>
            <P>(2) Failure to apply an accepted payment to principal, interest, escrow, or other charges under the terms of the mortgage loan and applicable law.</P>
            <P>(3) Failure to credit a payment to a borrower's mortgage loan account as of the date of receipt in violation of 12 CFR 1026.36(c)(1).</P>
            <P>(4) Failure to pay taxes, insurance premiums, or other charges, including charges that the borrower and servicer have voluntarily agreed that the servicer should collect and pay, in a timely manner as required by § 1024.34(a), or to refund an escrow account balance as required by § 1024.34(b).</P>
            <P>(5) Imposition of a fee or charge that the servicer lacks a reasonable basis to impose upon the borrower.</P>
            <P>(6) Failure to provide an accurate payoff balance amount upon a borrower's request in violation of section 12 CFR 1026.36(c)(3).</P>
            <P>(7) Failure to provide accurate information to a borrower regarding loss mitigation options and foreclosure, as required by § 1024.39.</P>
            <P>(8) Failure to transfer accurately and timely information relating to the servicing of a borrower's mortgage loan account to a transferee servicer.</P>
            <P>(9) Making the first notice or filing required by applicable law for any judicial or non-judicial foreclosure process in violation of § 1024.41(f) or (j).</P>
            <P>(10) Moving for foreclosure judgment or order of sale, or conducting a foreclosure sale in violation of § 1024.41(g) or (j).</P>
            <P>(11) Any other error relating to the servicing of a borrower's mortgage loan.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Contact information for borrowers to assert errors.</E> A servicer may, by written notice provided to a borrower, establish an address that a borrower must use to submit a notice of error in accordance with the procedures in this section. The notice shall include a statement that the borrower must use the established address to assert an error. If a servicer designates a specific address for receiving notices of error, the servicer shall designate the same <PRTPAGE P="649"/>address for receiving information requests pursuant to § 1024.36(b). A servicer shall provide a written notice to a borrower before any change in the address used for receiving a notice of error. A servicer that designates an address for receipt of notices of error must post the designated address on any Web site maintained by the servicer if the Web site lists any contact address for the servicer.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Acknowledgment of receipt.</E> Within five days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) of a servicer receiving a notice of error from a borrower, the servicer shall provide to the borrower a written response acknowledging receipt of the notice of error.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Response to notice of error</E>—(1) <E T="03">Investigation and response requirements</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> Except as provided in paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, a servicer must respond to a notice of error by either:</P>
            <P>(A) Correcting the error or errors identified by the borrower and providing the borrower with a written notification of the correction, the effective date of the correction, and contact information, including a telephone number, for further assistance; or</P>
            <P>(B) Conducting a reasonable investigation and providing the borrower with a written notification that includes a statement that the servicer has determined that no error occurred, a statement of the reason or reasons for this determination, a statement of the borrower's right to request documents relied upon by the servicer in reaching its determination, information regarding how the borrower can request such documents, and contact information, including a telephone number, for further assistance.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Different or additional error.</E> If during a reasonable investigation of a notice of error, a servicer concludes that errors occurred other than, or in addition to, the error or errors alleged by the borrower, the servicer shall correct all such additional errors and provide the borrower with a written notification that describes the errors the servicer identified, the action taken to correct the errors, the effective date of the correction, and contact information, including a telephone number, for further assistance.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Requesting information from borrower.</E> A servicer may request supporting documentation from a borrower in connection with the investigation of an asserted error, but may not:</P>
            <P>(i) Require a borrower to provide such information as a condition of investigating an asserted error; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Determine that no error occurred because the borrower failed to provide any requested information without conducting a reasonable investigation pursuant to paragraph (e)(1)(i)(B) of this section.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Time limits</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> A servicer must comply with the requirements of paragraph (e)(1) of this section:</P>
            <P>(A) Not later than seven days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) after the servicer receives the notice of error for errors asserted under paragraph (b)(6) of this section.</P>
            <P>(B) Prior to the date of a foreclosure sale or within 30 days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) after the servicer receives the notice of error, whichever is earlier, for errors asserted under paragraphs (b)(9) and (10) of this section.</P>
            <P>(C) For all other asserted errors, not later than 30 days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) after the servicer receives the applicable notice of error.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Extension of time limit.</E> For asserted errors governed by the time limit set forth in paragraph (e)(3)(i)(C) of this section, a servicer may extend the time period for responding by an additional 15 days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) if, before the end of the 30-day period, the servicer notifies the borrower of the extension and the reasons for the extension in writing. A servicer may not extend the time period for responding to errors asserted under paragraph (b)(6), (9), or (10) of this section.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Copies of documentation.</E> A servicer shall provide to the borrower, at no charge, copies of documents and information relied upon by the servicer in making its determination that no error occurred within 15 days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and <PRTPAGE P="650"/>Sundays) of receiving the borrower's request for such documents. A servicer is not required to provide documents relied upon that constitute confidential, proprietary or privileged information. If a servicer withholds documents relied upon because it has determined that such documents constitute confidential, proprietary or privileged information, the servicer must notify the borrower of its determination in writing within 15 days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) of receipt of the borrower's request for such documents.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Omissions in responses to requests for documentation.</E> In its response to a request for documentation under paragraph (e)(4) of this section, a servicer may omit location and contact information and personal financial information (other than information about the terms, status, and payment history of the mortgage loan) if:</P>
            <P>(i) The information pertains to a potential or confirmed successor in interest who is not the requester; or</P>
            <P>(ii) The requester is a confirmed successor in interest and the information pertains to any borrower who is not the requester.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Alternative compliance</E>—(1) <E T="03">Early correction.</E> A servicer is not required to comply with paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section if the servicer corrects the error or errors asserted by the borrower and notifies the borrower of that correction in writing within five days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) of receiving the notice of error.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Error asserted before foreclosure sale.</E> A servicer is not required to comply with the requirements of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section for errors asserted under paragraph (b)(9) or (10) of this section if the servicer receives the applicable notice of an error seven or fewer days before a foreclosure sale. For any such notice of error, a servicer shall make a good faith attempt to respond to the borrower, orally or in writing, and either correct the error or state the reason the servicer has determined that no error has occurred.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Requirements not applicable</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> A servicer is not required to comply with the requirements of paragraphs (d), (e), and (i) of this section if the servicer reasonably determines that any of the following apply:</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Duplicative notice of error.</E> The asserted error is substantially the same as an error previously asserted by the borrower for which the servicer has previously complied with its obligation to respond pursuant to paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, unless the borrower provides new and material information to support the asserted error. New and material information means information that was not reviewed by the servicer in connection with investigating a prior notice of the same error and is reasonably likely to change the servicer's prior determination about the error.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Overbroad notice of error.</E> The notice of error is overbroad. A notice of error is overbroad if the servicer cannot reasonably determine from the notice of error the specific error that the borrower asserts has occurred on a borrower's account. To the extent a servicer can reasonably identify a valid assertion of an error in a notice of error that is otherwise overbroad, the servicer shall comply with the requirements of paragraphs (d), (e) and (i) of this section with respect to that asserted error.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Untimely notice of error.</E> A notice of error is delivered to the servicer more than one year after:</P>
            <P>(A) Servicing for the mortgage loan that is the subject of the asserted error was transferred from the servicer receiving the notice of error to a transferee servicer; or</P>
            <P>(B) The mortgage loan is discharged.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Notice to borrower.</E> If a servicer determines that, pursuant to this paragraph (g), the servicer is not required to comply with the requirements of paragraphs (d), (e), and (i) of this section, the servicer shall notify the borrower of its determination in writing not later than five days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) after making such determination. The notice to the borrower shall set forth the basis under paragraph (g)(1) of this section upon which the servicer has made such determination.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Payment requirements prohibited.</E> A servicer shall not charge a fee, or require a borrower to make any payment <PRTPAGE P="651"/>that may be owed on a borrower's account, as a condition of responding to a notice of error.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Effect on servicer remedies</E>—(1) <E T="03">Adverse information.</E> After receipt of a notice of error, a servicer may not, for 60 days, furnish adverse information to any consumer reporting agency regarding any payment that is the subject of the notice of error.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Remedies permitted.</E> Except as set forth in this section with respect to an assertion of error under paragraph (b)(9) or (10) of this section, nothing in this section shall limit or restrict a lender or servicer from pursuing any remedy it has under applicable law, including initiating foreclosure or proceeding with a foreclosure sale.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Requests for information.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Information request.</E> A servicer shall comply with the requirements of this section for any written request for information from a borrower that includes the name of the borrower, information that enables the servicer to identify the borrower's mortgage loan account, and states the information the borrower is requesting with respect to the borrower's mortgage loan. A request on a payment coupon or other payment form supplied by the servicer need not be treated by the servicer as a request for information. A request for a payoff balance need not be treated by the servicer as a request for information. A qualified written request that requests information relating to the servicing of the mortgage loan is a request for information for purposes of this section, and a servicer must comply with all requirements applicable to a request for information with respect to such qualified written request.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Contact information for borrowers to request information.</E> A servicer may, by written notice provided to a borrower, establish an address that a borrower must use to request information in accordance with the procedures in this section. The notice shall include a statement that the borrower must use the established address to request information. If a servicer designates a specific address for receiving information requests, a servicer shall designate the same address for receiving notices of error pursuant to § 1024.35(c). A servicer shall provide a written notice to a borrower before any change in the address used for receiving an information request. A servicer that designates an address for receipt of information requests must post the designated address on any Web site maintained by the servicer if the Web site lists any contact address for the servicer.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Acknowledgment of receipt.</E> Within five days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) of a servicer receiving an information request from a borrower, the servicer shall provide to the borrower a written response acknowledging receipt of the information request.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Response to information request</E>—(1) <E T="03">Investigation and response requirements.</E> Except as provided in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, a servicer must respond to an information request by either:</P>

            <P>(ii) Conducting a reasonable search for the requested information and providing the borrower with a written notification that states that the servicer has determined that the requested information is not available to the servicer, provides the basis for the servicer's determination, and provides contact information, including a telephone number, for further assistance.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Time limits</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> A servicer must comply with the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section:</P>
            <P>(A) Not later than 10 days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) after the servicer receives an information request for the identity of, and address or other relevant contact information for, the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan; and</P>
            <P>(B) For all other requests for information, not later than 30 days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) after the servicer receives the information request.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Extension of time limit.</E> For requests for information governed by the <PRTPAGE P="652"/>time limit set forth in paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B) of this section, a servicer may extend the time period for responding by an additional 15 days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) if, before the end of the 30-day period, the servicer notifies the borrower of the extension and the reasons for the extension in writing. A servicer may not extend the time period for requests for information governed by paragraph (d)(2)(i)(A) of this section.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Omissions in responses to requests.</E> In its response to a request for information, a servicer may omit location and contact information and personal financial information (other than information about the terms, status, and payment history of the mortgage loan) if:</P>
            <P>(i) The information pertains to a potential or confirmed successor in interest who is not the requester; or</P>
            <P>(ii) The requester is a confirmed successor and the information pertains to any borrower who is not the requester.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Alternative compliance.</E> A servicer is not required to comply with paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section if the servicer provides the borrower with the information requested and contact information, including a telephone number, for further assistance in writing within five days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) of receiving an information request.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Requirements not applicable</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> A servicer is not required to comply with the requirements of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section if the servicer reasonably determines that any of the following apply:</P>

            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Irrelevant information.</E> The information requested is not directly related to the borrower's mortgage loan account.</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Overbroad or unduly burdensome information request.</E> The information request is overbroad or unduly burdensome. An information request is overbroad if a borrower requests that the servicer provide an unreasonable volume of documents or information to a borrower. An information request is unduly burdensome if a diligent servicer could not respond to the information request without either exceeding the maximum time limit permitted by paragraph (d)(2) of this section or incurring costs (or dedicating resources) that would be unreasonable in light of the circumstances. To the extent a servicer can reasonably identify a valid information request in a submission that is otherwise overbroad or unduly burdensome, the servicer shall comply with the requirements of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section with respect to that requested information.</P>
            <P>(v) <E T="03">Untimely information request.</E> The information request is delivered to a servicer more than one year after:</P>
            <P>(A) Servicing for the mortgage loan that is the subject of the information request was transferred from the servicer receiving the request for information to a transferee servicer; or</P>
            <P>(B) The mortgage loan is discharged.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Notice to borrower.</E> If a servicer determines that, pursuant to this paragraph (f), the servicer is not required to comply with the requirements of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, the servicer shall notify the borrower of its determination in writing not later than five days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) after making such determination. The notice to the borrower shall set forth the basis under paragraph (f)(1) of this section upon which the servicer has made such determination.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Payment requirement limitations</E>—(1) <E T="03">Fees prohibited.</E> Except as set forth in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, a servicer shall not charge a fee, or require a borrower to make any payment that may be owed on a borrower's account, as a condition of responding to an information request.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Fee permitted.</E> Nothing in this section shall prohibit a servicer from charging a fee for providing a beneficiary notice under applicable State <PRTPAGE P="653"/>law, if such a fee is not otherwise prohibited by applicable law.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Servicer remedies.</E> Nothing in this section shall prohibit a servicer from furnishing adverse information to any consumer reporting agency or pursuing any of its remedies, including initiating foreclosure or proceeding with a foreclosure sale, allowed by the underlying mortgage loan instruments, during the time period that response to an information request notice is outstanding.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Potential successors in interest.</E> (1) With respect to any written request from a person that indicates that the person may be a successor in interest and that includes the name of the transferor borrower from whom the person received an ownership interest and information that enables the servicer to identify the mortgage loan account, a servicer shall respond by providing the potential successor in interest with a written description of the documents the servicer reasonably requires to confirm the person's identity and ownership interest in the property and contact information, including a telephone number, for further assistance. With respect to the written request, a servicer shall treat the potential successor in interest as a borrower for purposes of the requirements of paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) If a written request under paragraph (i)(1) of this section does not provide sufficient information to enable the servicer to identify the documents the servicer reasonably requires to confirm the person's identity and ownership interest in the property, the servicer may provide a response that includes examples of documents typically accepted to establish identity and ownership interest in a property; indicates that the person may obtain a more individualized description of required documents by providing additional information; specifies what additional information is required to enable the servicer to identify the required documents; and provides contact information, including a telephone number, for further assistance. A servicer's response under this paragraph (i)(2) must otherwise comply with the requirements of paragraph (i)(1). Notwithstanding paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section, if a potential successor in interest subsequently provides orally or in writing the required information specified by the servicer pursuant to this paragraph (i)(2), the servicer must treat the new information, together with the original request, as a new, non-duplicative request under paragraph (i)(1), received as of the date the required information was received, and must respond accordingly.</P>
            <P>(3) In responding to a request under paragraph (i)(1) of this section prior to confirmation, the servicer is not required to provide any information other than the information specified in paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this section. In responding to a written request under paragraph (i)(1) that requests other information, the servicer must indicate that the potential successor in interest may resubmit any request for information once confirmed as a successor in interest.</P>
            <P>(4) If a servicer has established an address that a borrower must use to request information pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, a servicer must comply with the requirements of paragraph (i)(1) of this section only for requests received at the established address.</P>

            <P>(3) If a borrower contacts the personnel assigned to the borrower as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and does not immediately receive a live response from such personnel, ensure that the servicer can provide a live response in a timely manner.</P>

            <P>(1) Provide the borrower with accurate information about:</P>
            <P>(i) Loss mitigation options available to the borrower from the owner or assignee of the borrower's mortgage loan;</P>
            <P>(ii) Actions the borrower must take to be evaluated for such loss mitigation options, including actions the borrower must take to submit a complete loss mitigation application, as defined in § 1024.41, and, if applicable, actions the borrower must take to appeal the servicer's determination to deny a borrower's loss mitigation application for any trial or permanent loan modification program offered by the servicer;</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Enforcement and limitations.</E> A borrower may enforce the provisions of this section pursuant to section 6(f) of RESPA (12 U.S.C. 2605(f)). Nothing in § 1024.41 imposes a duty on a servicer to provide any borrower with any specific loss mitigation option. Nothing in § 1024.41 should be construed to create a right for a borrower to enforce the terms of any agreement between a servicer and the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan, including with respect to the evaluation for, or offer of, any loss mitigation option or to eliminate any such right that may exist pursuant to applicable law.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Receipt of a loss mitigation application</E>—(1) <E T="03">Complete loss mitigation application.</E> A complete loss mitigation application means an application in connection with which a servicer has received all the information that the servicer requires from a borrower in evaluating applications for the loss mitigation options available to the borrower. A servicer shall exercise reasonable diligence in obtaining documents and information to complete a loss mitigation application.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Review of loss mitigation application submission</E>—(i) <E T="03">Requirements.</E> If a servicer receives a loss mitigation application 45 days or more before a foreclosure sale, a servicer shall:</P>
            <P>(A) Promptly upon receipt of a loss mitigation application, review the loss mitigation application to determine if the loss mitigation application is complete; and</P>
            <P>(B) Notify the borrower in writing within 5 days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) after receiving the loss mitigation application that the servicer acknowledges receipt of the loss mitigation application and that the servicer has determined that the loss mitigation application is either complete or incomplete. If a loss mitigation application is incomplete, the notice shall state the additional documents and information the borrower must submit to make the loss mitigation application complete and the applicable date pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. The notice to the borrower shall include a statement that the borrower should consider contacting servicers of any other mortgage loans secured by the same property to discuss available loss mitigation options.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Time period disclosure.</E> The notice required pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section must include a reasonable date by which the borrower should submit the documents and information necessary to make the loss mitigation application complete.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Determining protections.</E> To the extent a determination of whether protections under this section apply to a borrower is made on the basis of the number of days between when a complete loss mitigation application is received and when a foreclosure sale occurs, such determination shall be made as of the date a complete loss mitigation application is received.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Evaluation of loss mitigation applications</E>—(1) <E T="03">Complete loss mitigation application.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, if a servicer receives a complete loss mitigation application more than 37 days before a foreclosure sale, then, within 30 days of receiving the complete loss mitigation application, a servicer shall:</P>
            <P>(i) Evaluate the borrower for all loss mitigation options available to the borrower; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Provide the borrower with a notice in writing stating the servicer's determination of which loss mitigation options, if any, it will offer to the borrower on behalf of the owner or assignee of the mortgage. The servicer shall include in this notice the amount of time the borrower has to accept or reject an offer of a loss mitigation program as provided for in paragraph (e) of this section, if applicable, and a notification, if applicable, that the borrower has the right to appeal the denial of any loan modification option as well as the amount of time the borrower has to file such an appeal and any requirements for making an appeal, as provided for in paragraph (h) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Incomplete loss mitigation application evaluation</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> Except as set forth in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii) and <PRTPAGE P="663"/>(iii) of this section, a servicer shall not evade the requirement to evaluate a complete loss mitigation application for all loss mitigation options available to the borrower by offering a loss mitigation option based upon an evaluation of any information provided by a borrower in connection with an incomplete loss mitigation application.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Reasonable time.</E> Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, if a servicer has exercised reasonable diligence in obtaining documents and information to complete a loss mitigation application, but a loss mitigation application remains incomplete for a significant period of time under the circumstances without further progress by a borrower to make the loss mitigation application complete, a servicer may, in its discretion, evaluate an incomplete loss mitigation application and offer a borrower a loss mitigation option. Any such evaluation and offer is not subject to the requirements of this section and shall not constitute an evaluation of a single complete loss mitigation application for purposes of paragraph (i) of this section.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Short-term loss mitigation options.</E> Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, a servicer may offer a short-term payment forbearance program or a short-term repayment plan to a borrower based upon an evaluation of an incomplete loss mitigation application. Promptly after offering a payment forbearance program or a repayment plan under this paragraph (c)(2)(iii), unless the borrower has rejected the offer, the servicer must provide the borrower a written notice stating the specific payment terms and duration of the program or plan, that the servicer offered the program or plan based on an evaluation of an incomplete application, that other loss mitigation options may be available, and that the borrower has the option to submit a complete loss mitigation application to receive an evaluation for all loss mitigation options available to the borrower regardless of whether the borrower accepts the program or plan. A servicer shall not make the first notice or filing required by applicable law for any judicial or non-judicial foreclosure process, and shall not move for foreclosure judgment or order of sale or conduct a foreclosure sale, if a borrower is performing pursuant to the terms of a payment forbearance program or repayment plan offered pursuant to this paragraph (c)(2)(iii). A servicer may offer a short-term payment forbearance program in conjunction with a short-term repayment plan pursuant to this paragraph (c)(2)(iii).</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Facially complete application.</E> A loss mitigation application shall be considered facially complete when a borrower submits all the missing documents and information as stated in the notice required under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section, when no additional information is requested in such notice, or once the servicer is required to provide the borrower a written notice pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section. If the servicer later discovers that additional information or corrections to a previously submitted document are required to complete the application, the servicer must promptly request the missing information or corrected documents and treat the application as complete for the purposes of paragraphs (f)(2) and (g) of this section until the borrower is given a reasonable opportunity to complete the application. If the borrower completes the application within this period, the application shall be considered complete as of the date it first became facially complete, for the purposes of paragraphs (d), (e), (f)(2), (g), and (h) of this section, and as of the date the application was actually complete for the purposes of this paragraph (c). A servicer that complies with this paragraph (c)(2)(iv) will be deemed to have fulfilled its obligation to provide an accurate notice under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Notice of complete application.</E> (i) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, within 5 days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) after receiving a borrower's complete loss mitigation application, a servicer shall provide the borrower a written notice that sets forth the following information:</P>
            <P>(A) That the loss mitigation application is complete;</P>

            <P>(B) The date the servicer received the complete application;<PRTPAGE P="664"/>
            </P>
            <P>(C) That the servicer expects to complete its evaluation within 30 days of the date it received the complete application;</P>
            <P>(D) That the borrower is entitled to certain foreclosure protections because the servicer has received the complete application, and, as applicable, either:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) If the servicer has not made the first notice or filing required by applicable law for any judicial or non-judicial foreclosure process, that the servicer cannot make the first notice or filing required to commence or initiate the foreclosure process under applicable law before evaluating the borrower's complete application; or</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) If the servicer has made the first notice or filing required by applicable law for any judicial or non-judicial foreclosure process, that the servicer has begun the foreclosure process, and that the servicer cannot conduct a foreclosure sale before evaluating the borrower's complete application;</P>
            <P>(E) That the servicer may need additional information at a later date to evaluate the application, in which case the servicer will request that information from the borrower and give the borrower a reasonable opportunity to submit it, the evaluation process may take longer, and the foreclosure protections could end if the servicer does not receive the information as requested; and</P>
            <P>(F) That the borrower may be entitled to additional protections under State or Federal law.</P>
            <P>(ii) A servicer is not required to provide a notice pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section if:</P>
            <P>(A) The servicer has already provided the borrower a notice under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section informing the borrower that the application is complete and the servicer has not subsequently requested additional information or a corrected version of a previously submitted document from the borrower pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section;</P>
            <P>(B) The application was not complete or facially complete more than 37 days before a foreclosure sale; or</P>
            <P>(C) The servicer has already provided the borrower a notice regarding the application under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Information not in the borrower's control</E>—(i) <E T="03">Reasonable diligence.</E> If a servicer requires documents or information not in the borrower's control to determine which loss mitigation options, if any, it will offer to the borrower, the servicer must exercise reasonable diligence in obtaining such documents or information.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Effect in case of delay.</E> (A)(<E T="03">1</E>) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(A)(<E T="03">2</E>) of this section, a servicer must not deny a complete loss mitigation application solely because the servicer lacks required documents or information not in the borrower's control.</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) If a servicer has exercised reasonable diligence to obtain required documents or information from a party other than the borrower or the servicer, but the servicer has been unable to obtain such documents or information for a significant period of time following the 30-day period identified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and the servicer, in accordance with applicable requirements established by the owner or assignee of the borrower's mortgage loan, is unable to determine which loss mitigation options, if any, it will offer the borrower without such documents or information, the servicer may deny the application and provide the borrower with a written notice in accordance with paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section. When providing the written notice in accordance with paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the servicer must also provide the borrower with a copy of the written notice required by paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(B) of this section.</P>
            <P>(B) If a servicer is unable to make a determination within the 30-day period identified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section as to which loss mitigation options, if any, it will offer to the borrower because the servicer lacks required documents or information from a party other than the borrower or the servicer, the servicer must, within such 30-day period or promptly thereafter, provide the borrower a written notice, informing the borrower:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) That the servicer has not received documents or information not in the <PRTPAGE P="665"/>borrower's control that the servicer requires to determine which loss mitigation options, if any, it will offer to the borrower on behalf of the owner or assignee of the mortgage;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Of the specific documents or information that the servicer lacks;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) That the servicer has requested such documents or information; and</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) That the servicer will complete its evaluation of the borrower for all available loss mitigation options promptly upon receiving the documents or information.</P>

            <P>(C) If a servicer must provide a notice required by paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(B) of this section, the servicer must not provide the borrower a written notice pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section until the servicer receives the required documents or information referenced in paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(B)(<E T="03">2</E>) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(A)(<E T="03">2</E>) of this section. Upon receiving such required documents or information, the servicer must promptly provide the borrower with the written notice pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Denial of loan modification options.</E> If a borrower's complete loss mitigation application is denied for any trial or permanent loan modification option available to the borrower pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, a servicer shall state in the notice sent to the borrower pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section the specific reason or reasons for the servicer's determination for each such trial or permanent loan modification option and, if applicable, that the borrower was not evaluated on other criteria.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Borrower response</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Subject to paragraphs (e)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section, if a complete loss mitigation application is received 90 days or more before a foreclosure sale, a servicer may require that a borrower accept or reject an offer of a loss mitigation option no earlier than 14 days after the servicer provides the offer of a loss mitigation option to the borrower. If a complete loss mitigation application is received less than 90 days before a foreclosure sale, but more than 37 days before a foreclosure sale, a servicer may require that a borrower accept or reject an offer of a loss mitigation option no earlier than 7 days after the servicer provides the offer of a loss mitigation option to the borrower.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Rejection</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> Except as set forth in paragraphs (e)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section, a servicer may deem a borrower that has not accepted an offer of a loss mitigation option within the deadline established pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section to have rejected the offer of a loss mitigation option.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Trial Loan Modification Plan.</E> A borrower who does not satisfy the servicer's requirements for accepting a trial loan modification plan, but submits the payments that would be owed pursuant to any such plan within the deadline established pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section, shall be provided a reasonable period of time to fulfill any remaining requirements of the servicer for acceptance of the trial loan modification plan beyond the deadline established pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Interaction with appeal process.</E> If a borrower makes an appeal pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section, the borrower's deadline for accepting a loss mitigation option offered pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section shall be extended until 14 days after the servicer provides the notice required pursuant to paragraph (h)(4) of this section.</P>

            <P>(i) The servicer has sent the borrower a notice pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section that the borrower is not eligible for any loss mitigation option and the appeal process in paragraph (h) of this section is not applicable, the borrower has not requested an appeal within the applicable time period for requesting an appeal, or the borrower's appeal has been denied;</P>
            <P>(ii) The borrower rejects all loss mitigation options offered by the servicer; or</P>
            <P>(iii) The borrower fails to perform under an agreement on a loss mitigation option.</P>

            <P>(i) <E T="03">Duplicative requests.</E> A servicer must comply with the requirements of this section for a borrower's loss mitigation application, unless the servicer has previously complied with the requirements of this section for a complete loss mitigation application submitted by the borrower and the borrower has been delinquent at all times since submitting the prior complete application.</P>

            <P>(k) <E T="03">Servicing transfers</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general</E>—(i) <E T="03">Timing of compliance.</E> Except as provided in paragraphs (k)(2) through (4) of this section, if a transferee servicer <PRTPAGE P="667"/>acquires the servicing of a mortgage loan for which a loss mitigation application is pending as of the transfer date, the transferee servicer must comply with the requirements of this section for that loss mitigation application within the timeframes that were applicable to the transferor servicer based on the date the transferor servicer received the loss mitigation application. All rights and protections under paragraphs (c) through (h) of this section to which a borrower was entitled before a transfer continue to apply notwithstanding the transfer.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Transfer date defined.</E> For purposes of this paragraph (k), the transfer date is the date on which the transferee servicer will begin accepting payments relating to the mortgage loan, as disclosed on the notice of transfer of loan servicing pursuant to § 1024.33(b)(4)(iv).</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Acknowledgment notices</E>—(i) <E T="03">Transferee servicer timeframes.</E> If a transferee servicer acquires the servicing of a mortgage loan for which the period to provide the notice required by paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section has not expired as of the transfer date and the transferor servicer has not provided such notice, the transferee servicer must provide the notice within 10 days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) of the transfer date.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Prohibitions.</E> A transferee servicer that must provide the notice required by paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section under this paragraph (k)(2):</P>

For purposes of paragraph (f)(2) of this section, a borrower who submits a complete loss mitigation application on or before the reasonable date disclosed to the borrower pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section shall be treated as having done so during the pre-foreclosure review period set forth in paragraph (f)(1) of this section.</P>
            <P>(B) Shall comply with paragraphs (c), (d), and (g) of this section if the borrower submits a complete loss mitigation application to the transferee or transferor servicer 37 or fewer days before the foreclosure sale but on or before the reasonable date disclosed to the borrower pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Complete loss mitigation applications pending at transfer.</E> If a transferee servicer acquires the servicing of a mortgage loan for which a complete loss mitigation application is pending as of the transfer date, the transferee servicer must comply with the applicable requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) and (4) of this section within 30 days of the transfer date.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Applications subject to appeal process.</E> If a transferee servicer acquires the servicing of a mortgage loan for which an appeal of a transferor servicer's determination pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section has not been resolved by the transferor servicer as of the transfer date or is timely filed after the transfer date, the transferee servicer must make a determination on the appeal if it is able to do so or, if it is unable to do so, must treat the appeal as a pending complete loss mitigation application.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Determining appeal.</E> If a transferee servicer is required under this paragraph (k)(4) to make a determination on an appeal, the transferee servicer must complete the determination and provide the notice required by paragraph (h)(4) of this section within 30 days of the transfer date or 30 days of the date the borrower made the appeal, whichever is later.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Servicer unable to determine appeal.</E> A transferee servicer that is required to treat a borrower's appeal as a pending complete loss mitigation application under this paragraph (k)(4) must comply with the requirements of this section for such application, including evaluating the borrower for all loss mitigation options available to the borrower from the transferee servicer. For purposes of paragraph (c) or (k)(3) of this section, as applicable, such a pending complete loss mitigation application shall be considered complete as of the date the appeal was received by the transferor servicer or the transferee servicer, whichever occurs first. For purposes of paragraphs (e) through <PRTPAGE P="668"/>(h) of this section, the transferee servicer must treat such a pending complete loss mitigation application as facially complete under paragraph (c)(2)(iv) as of the date it was first facially complete or complete, as applicable, with respect to the transferor servicer.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Pending loss mitigation offers.</E> A transfer does not affect a borrower's ability to accept or reject a loss mitigation option offered under paragraph (c) or (h) of this section. If a transferee servicer acquires the servicing of a mortgage loan for which the borrower's time period under paragraph (e) or (h) of this section for accepting or rejecting a loss mitigation option offered by the transferor servicer has not expired as of the transfer date, the transferee servicer must allow the borrower to accept or reject the offer during the unexpired balance of the applicable time period.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix A to Part 1024—Instructions for Completing HUD-1 and HUD-1a Settlement Statements; Sample HUD-1 and HUD-1a Statements</HD>
            <P>The following are instructions for completing the HUD-1 settlement statement, required under section 4 of RESPA and 12 CFR part 1024 (Regulation X) of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) regulations. This form is to be used as a statement of actual charges and adjustments paid by the borrower and the seller, to be given to the parties in connection with the settlement. The instructions for completion of the HUD-1 are primarily for the benefit of the settlement agents who prepare the statements and need not be transmitted to the parties as an integral part of the HUD-1. There is no objection to the use of the HUD-1 in transactions in which its use is not legally required. Refer to the definitions section of the regulations (12 CFR 1024.2) for specific definitions of many of the terms that are used in these instructions.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">General Instructions</HD>
            <P>Information and amounts may be filled in by typewriter, hand printing, computer printing, or any other method producing clear and legible results. Refer to the Bureau's regulations (Regulation X) regarding rules applicable to reproduction of the HUD-1 for the purpose of including customary recitals and information used locally in settlements; for example, a breakdown of payoff figures, a breakdown of the Borrower's total monthly mortgage payments, check disbursements, a statement indicating receipt of funds, applicable special stipulations between Borrower and Seller, and the date funds are transferred.</P>
            <P>The settlement agent shall complete the HUD-1 to itemize all charges imposed upon the Borrower and the Seller by the loan originator and all sales commissions, whether to be paid at settlement or outside of settlement, and any other charges which either the Borrower or the Seller will pay at settlement. Charges for loan origination and title services should not be itemized except as provided in these instructions. For each separately identified settlement service in connection with the transaction, the name of the person ultimately receiving the payment must be shown together with the total amount paid to such person. Items paid to and retained by a loan originator are disclosed as required in the instructions for lines in the 800-series of the HUD-1 (and for per diem interest, in the 900-series of the HUD-1).</P>
            <P>As a general rule, charges that are paid for by the seller must be shown in the seller's column on page 2 of the HUD-1 (unless paid outside closing), and charges that are paid for by the borrower must be shown in the borrower's column (unless paid outside closing). However, in order to promote comparability between the charges on the GFE and the charges on the HUD-1, if a seller pays for a charge that was included on the GFE, the charge should be listed in the borrower's column on page 2 of the HUD-1. That charge should also be offset by listing a credit in that amount to the borrower on lines 204-209 on page 1 of the HUD-1, and by a charge to the seller in lines 506-509 on page 1 of the HUD-1. If a loan originator (other than for no-cost loans), real estate agent, other settlement service provider, or other person pays for a charge that was included on the GFE, the charge should be listed in the borrower's column on page 2 of the HUD-1, with an offsetting credit reported on page 1 of the HUD-1, identifying the party paying the charge.</P>

            <P>Charges paid outside of settlement by the borrower, seller, loan originator, real estate agent, or any other person, must be included on the HUD-1 but marked “P.O.C.” for “Paid Outside of Closing” (settlement) and must not be included in computing totals. However, indirect payments from a lender to a mortgage broker may not be disclosed as P.O.C., and must be included as a credit on Line 802. P.O.C. items must not be placed in the Borrower or Seller columns, but rather <PRTPAGE P="669"/>on the appropriate line outside the columns. The settlement agent must indicate whether P.O.C. items are paid for by the Borrower, Seller, or some other party by marking the items paid for by whoever made the payment as “P.O.C.” with the party making the payment identified in parentheses, such as “P.O.C. (borrower)” or “P.O.C. (seller)”.</P>
            <P>In the case of “no cost” loans where “no cost” encompasses third party fees as well as the upfront payment to the loan originator, the third party services covered by the “no cost” provisions must be itemized and listed in the borrower's column on the HUD-1/1A with the charge for the third party service. These itemized charges must be offset with a negative adjusted origination charge on Line 803 and recorded in the columns.</P>
            <P>Blank lines are provided in section L for any additional settlement charges. Blank lines are also provided for additional insertions in sections J and K. The names of the recipients of the settlement charges in section L and the names of the recipients of adjustments described in section J or K should be included on the blank lines.</P>
            <P>Lines and columns in section J which relate to the Borrower's transaction may be left blank on the copy of the HUD-1 which will be furnished to the Seller. Lines and columns in section K which relate to the Seller's transaction may be left blank on the copy of the HUD-1 which will be furnished to the Borrower.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Line Item Instructions</HD>
            <P>Instructions for completing the individual items on the HUD-1 follow.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section A.</E> This section requires no entry of information.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section B.</E> Check appropriate loan type and complete the remaining items as applicable.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section C.</E> This section provides a notice regarding settlement costs and requires no additional entry of information.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Sections D and E.</E> Fill in the names and current mailing addresses and zip codes of the Borrower and the Seller. Where there is more than one Borrower or Seller, the name and address of each one is required. Use a supplementary page if needed to list multiple Borrowers or Sellers.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section F.</E> Fill in the name, current mailing address and zip code of the Lender.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section G.</E> The street address of the property being sold should be listed. If there is no street address, a brief legal description or other location of the property should be inserted. In all cases give the zip code of the property.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section H.</E> Fill in name, address, zip code and telephone number of settlement agent, and address and zip code of “place of settlement.”</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section I.</E> Fill in date of settlement.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section J. Summary of Borrower's Transaction.</E> Line 101 is for the contract sales price of the property being sold, excluding the price of any items of tangible personal property if Borrower and Seller have agreed to a separate price for such items.</P>

            <P>Line 102 is for the sales price of any items of tangible personal property excluded from Line 101. Personal property could include such items as carpets, drapes, stoves, refrigerators, <E T="03">etc.</E> What constitutes personal property varies from State to State. Manufactured homes are not considered personal property for this purpose.</P>
            <P>Line 103 is used to record the total charges to Borrower detailed in section L and totaled on Line 1400.</P>
            <P>Lines 104 and 105 are for additional amounts owed by the Borrower, such as charges that were not listed on the GFE or items paid by the Seller prior to settlement but reimbursed by the Borrower at settlement. For example, the balance in the Seller's reserve account held in connection with an existing loan, if assigned to the Borrower in a loan assumption case, will be entered here. These lines will also be used when a tenant in the property being sold has not yet paid the rent, which the Borrower will collect, for a period of time prior to the settlement. The lines will also be used to indicate the treatment for any tenant security deposit. The Seller will be credited on Lines 404-405.</P>
            <P>Lines 106 through 112 are for items which the Seller had paid in advance, and for which the Borrower must therefore reimburse the Seller. Examples of items for which adjustments will be made may include taxes and assessments paid in advance for an entire year or other period, when settlement occurs prior to the expiration of the year or other period for which they were paid. Additional examples include flood and hazard insurance premiums, if the Borrower is being substituted as an insured under the same policy; mortgage insurance in loan assumption cases; planned unit development or condominium association assessments paid in advance; fuel or other supplies on hand, purchased by the Seller, which the Borrower will use when Borrower takes possession of the property; and ground rent paid in advance.</P>
            <P>Line 120 is for the total of Lines 101 through 112.</P>
            <P>Line 201 is for any amount paid against the sales price prior to settlement.</P>

            <P>Line 202 is for the amount of the new loan made by the Lender when a loan to finance construction of a new structure constructed for sale is used as or converted to a loan to finance purchase. Line 202 should also be used for the amount of the first user loan, when a loan to purchase a manufactured home for resale is converted to a loan to finance purchase by the first user. For other loans covered by 12 CFR part 1024 (Regulation X) which finance construction of a new <PRTPAGE P="670"/>structure or purchase of a manufactured home, list the sales price of the land on Line 104, the construction cost or purchase price of manufactured home on Line 105 (Line 101 would be left blank in this instance) and amount of the loan on Line 202. The remainder of the form should be completed taking into account adjustments and charges related to the temporary financing and permanent financing and which are known at the date of settlement. For reverse mortgage transactions, the amount disclosed on Line 202 is the initial principal limit.</P>
            <P>Line 203 is used for cases in which the Borrower is assuming or taking title subject to an existing loan or lien on the property.</P>
            <P>Lines 204-209 are used for other items paid by or on behalf of the Borrower. Lines 204-209 should be used to indicate any financing arrangements or other new loan not listed in Line 202. For example, if the Borrower is using a second mortgage or note to finance part of the purchase price, whether from the same lender, another lender or the Seller, insert the principal amount of the loan with a brief explanation on Lines 204-209. Lines 204-209 should also be used where the Borrower receives a credit from the Seller for closing costs, including seller-paid GFE charges. They may also be used in cases in which a Seller (typically a builder) is making an “allowance” to the Borrower for items that the Borrower is to purchase separately. For reverse mortgages, the amount of any initial draw at settlement is disclosed on Line 204.</P>
            <P>Lines 210 through 219 are for items which have not yet been paid, and which the Borrower is expected to pay, but which are attributable in part to a period of time prior to the settlement. In jurisdictions in which taxes are paid late in the tax year, most cases will show the proration of taxes in these lines. Other examples include utilities used but not paid for by the Seller, rent collected in advance by the Seller from a tenant for a period extending beyond the settlement date, and interest on loan assumptions.</P>
            <P>Line 220 is for the total of Lines 201 through 219.</P>
            <P>Lines 301 and 302 are summary lines for the Borrower. Enter total in Line 120 on Line 301. Enter total in Line 220 on Line 302.</P>
            <P>Line 303 must indicate either the cash required from the Borrower at settlement (the usual case in a purchase transaction), or cash payable to the Borrower at settlement (if, for example, the Borrower's earnest money exceeds the Borrower's cash obligations in the transaction or there is a cash-out refinance). Subtract Line 302 from Line 301 and enter the amount of cash due to or from the Borrower at settlement on Line 303. The appropriate box should be checked. If the Borrower's earnest money is applied toward the charge for a settlement service, the amount so applied should not be included on Line 303 but instead should be shown on the appropriate line for the settlement service, marked “P.O.C. (Borrower)”, and must not be included in computing totals.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section K. Summary of Seller's Transaction.</E> Instructions for the use of Lines 101 and 102 and 104-112 above, apply also to Lines 401-412. Line 420 is for the total of Lines 401 through 412.</P>
            <P>Line 501 is used if the Seller's real estate broker or other party who is not the settlement agent has received and holds a deposit against the sales price (earnest money) which exceeds the fee or commission owed to that party. If that party will render the excess deposit directly to the Seller, rather than through the settlement agent, the amount of excess deposit should be entered on Line 501 and the amount of the total deposit (including commissions) should be entered on Line 201.</P>
            <P>Line 502 is used to record the total charges to the Seller detailed in section L and totaled on Line 1400.</P>
            <P>Line 503 is used if the Borrower is assuming or taking title subject to existing liens which are to be deducted from sales price.</P>
            <P>Lines 504 and 505 are used for the amounts (including any accrued interest) of any first and/or second loans which will be paid as part of the settlement.</P>
            <P>Line 506 is used for deposits paid by the Borrower to the Seller or other party who is not the settlement agent. Enter the amount of the deposit in Line 201 on Line 506 unless Line 501 is used or the party who is not the settlement agent transfers all or part of the deposit to the settlement agent, in which case the settlement agent will note in parentheses on Line 507 the amount of the deposit that is being disbursed as proceeds and enter in the column for Line 506 the amount retained by the above-described party for settlement services. If the settlement agent holds the deposit, insert a note in Line 507 which indicates that the deposit is being disbursed as proceeds.</P>

            <P>Lines 506 through 509 may be used to list additional liens which must be paid off through the settlement to clear title to the property. Other Seller obligations should be shown on Lines 506-509, including charges that were disclosed on the GFE but that are actually being paid for by the Seller. These Lines may also be used to indicate funds to be held by the settlement agent for the payment of either repairs, or water, fuel, or other utility bills that cannot be prorated between the parties at settlement because the amounts used by the Seller prior to settlement are not yet known. Subsequent disclosure of the actual amount of these post-settlement items to be paid from settlement funds is optional.

            <P>Line 603 must indicate either the cash required to be paid to the Seller at settlement (the usual case in a purchase transaction), or the cash payable by the Seller at settlement. Subtract Line 602 from Line 601 and enter the amount of cash due to or from the Seller at settlement on Line 603. The appropriate box should be checked.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section L. Settlement Charges.</HD>
            <P>Line 700 is used to enter the sales commission charged by the sales agent or real estate broker.</P>
            <P>Lines 701-702 are to be used to state the split of the commission where the settlement agent disburses portions of the commission to two or more sales agents or real estate brokers.</P>
            <P>Line 703 is used to enter the amount of sales commission disbursed at settlement. If the sales agent or real estate broker is retaining a part of the deposit against the sales price (earnest money) to apply towards the sales agent's or real estate broker's commission, include in Line 703 only that part of the commission being disbursed at settlement and insert a note on Line 704 indicating the amount the sales agent or real estate broker is retaining as a “P.O.C.” item.</P>
            <P>Line 704 may be used for additional charges made by the sales agent or real estate broker, or for a sales commission charged to the Borrower, which will be disbursed by the settlement agent.</P>
            <P>Line 801 is used to record “Our origination charge,” which includes all charges received by the loan originator, except any charge for the specific interest rate chosen (points). This number must not be listed in either the buyer's or seller's column. The amount shown in Line 801 must include any amounts received for origination services, including administrative and processing services, performed by or on behalf of the loan originator.</P>
            <P>Line 802 is used to record “Your credit or charge (points) for the specific interest rate chosen,” which states the charge or credit adjustment as applied to “Our origination charge,” if applicable. This number must not be listed in either column or shown on page one of the HUD-1.</P>
            <P>For a mortgage broker originating a loan in its own name, the amount shown on Line 802 will be the difference between the initial loan amount and the total payment to the mortgage broker from the lender. The total payment to the mortgage broker will be the sum of the price paid for the loan by the lender and any other payments to the mortgage broker from the lender, including any payments based on the loan amount or loan terms, and any flat rate payments. For a mortgage broker originating a loan in another entity's name, the amount shown on Line 802 will be the sum of all payments to the mortgage broker from the lender, including any payments based on the loan amount or loan terms, and any flat rate payments.</P>
            <P>In either case, when the amount paid to the mortgage broker exceeds the initial loan amount, there is a credit to the borrower and it is entered as a negative amount. When the initial loan amount exceeds the amount paid to the mortgage broker, there is a charge to the borrower and it is entered as a positive amount. For a lender, the amount shown on Line 802 may include any credit or charge (points) to the Borrower.</P>
            <P>Line 803 is used to record “Your adjusted origination charges,” which states the net amount of the loan origination charges, the sum of the amounts shown in Lines 801 and 802. This amount must be listed in the columns as either a positive number (for example, where the origination charge shown in Line 801 exceeds any credit for the interest rate shown in Line 802 or where there is an origination charge in Line 801 and a charge for the interest rate (points) is shown on Line 802) or as a negative number (for example, where the credit for the interest rate shown in Line 802 exceeds the origination charges shown in Line 801).</P>
            <P>In the case of “no cost” loans, where “no cost” refers only to the loan originator's fees, the amounts shown in Lines 801 and 802 should offset, so that the charge shown on Line 803 is zero. Where “no cost” includes third party settlement services, the credit shown in Line 802 will more than offset the amount shown in Line 801. The amount shown in Line 803 will be a negative number to offset the settlement charges paid indirectly through the loan originator.</P>
            <P>Lines 804-808 may be used to record each of the “Required services that we select.” Each settlement service provider must be identified by name and the amount paid recorded either inside the columns or as paid to the provider outside closing (“P.O.C.”), as described in the General Instructions.</P>
            <P>Line 804 is used to record the appraisal fee.</P>
            <P>Line 805 is used to record the fee for all credit reports.</P>
            <P>Line 806 is used to record the fee for any tax service.</P>
            <P>Line 807 is used to record any flood certification fee.</P>

            <P>Lines 808 and additional sequentially numbered lines, as needed, are used to record other third party services required by the loan originator. These Lines may also be used to record other required disclosures from the loan originator. Any such disclosures must be listed outside the columns.<PRTPAGE P="672"/>
            </P>

            <P>Lines 901-904. This series is used to record the items which the Lender requires to be paid at the time of settlement, but which are not necessarily paid to the lender (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> FHA mortgage insurance premium), other than reserves collected by the Lender and recorded in the 1000-series.</P>
            <P>Line 901 is used if interest is collected at settlement for a part of a month or other period between settlement and the date from which interest will be collected with the first regular monthly payment. Enter that amount here and include the per diem charges. If such interest is not collected until the first regular monthly payment, no entry should be made on Line 901.</P>
            <P>Line 902 is used for mortgage insurance premiums due and payable at settlement, including any monthly amounts due at settlement and any upfront mortgage insurance premium, but not including any reserves collected by the Lender and recorded in the 1000-series. If a lump sum mortgage insurance premium paid at settlement is included on Line 902, a note should indicate that the premium is for the life of the loan.</P>
            <P>Line 903 is used for homeowner's insurance premiums that the Lender requires to be paid at the time of settlement, except reserves collected by the Lender and recorded in the 1000-series.</P>
            <P>Lines 904 and additional sequentially numbered lines are used to list additional items required by the Lender (except for reserves collected by the Lender and recorded in the 1000-series), including premiums for flood or other insurance. These lines are also used to list amounts paid at settlement for insurance not required by the Lender.</P>

            <P>Lines 1000-1007. This series is used for amounts collected by the Lender from the Borrower and held in an account for the future payment of the obligations listed as they fall due. Include the time period (number of months) and the monthly assessment. In many jurisdictions this is referred to as an “escrow”, “impound”, or “trust” account. In addition to the property taxes and insurance listed, some Lenders may require reserves for flood insurance, condominium owners' association assessments, <E T="03">etc.</E> The amount in line 1001 must be listed in the columns, and the itemizations in lines 1002 through 1007 must be listed outside the columns.</P>
            <P>After itemizing individual deposits in the 1000 series, the servicer shall make an adjustment based on aggregate accounting. This adjustment equals the difference between the deposit required under aggregate accounting and the sum of the itemized deposits. The computation steps for aggregate accounting are set out in 12 CFR 1024.17(d). The adjustment will always be a negative number or zero (-0-), except for amounts due to rounding. The settlement agent shall enter the aggregate adjustment amount outside the columns on a final line of the 1000 series of the HUD-1 or HUD-1A statement. Appendix E to this part sets out an example of aggregate analysis.</P>
            <P>Lines 1100-1108. This series covers title charges and charges by attorneys and closing or settlement agents. The title charges include a variety of services performed by title companies or others, and include fees directly related to the transfer of title (title examination, title search, document preparation), fees for title insurance, and fees for conducting the closing. The legal charges include fees for attorneys representing the lender, seller, or borrower, and any attorney preparing title work. The series also includes any settlement, notary, and delivery fees related to the services covered in this series. Disbursements to third parties must be broken out in the appropriate lines or in blank lines in the series, and amounts paid to these third parties must be shown outside of the columns if included in Line 1101. Charges not included in Line 1101 must be listed in the columns.</P>
            <P>Line 1101 is used to record the total for the category of “Title services and lender's title insurance.” This amount must be listed in the columns.</P>
            <P>Line 1102 is used to record the settlement or closing fee.</P>

            <P>Lines 1200-1206. This series covers government recording and transfer charges. Charges paid by the borrower must be listed in the columns as described for lines 1201 and 1203, with itemizations shown outside the columns. Any amounts that are charged to the seller and that were not included on the Good Faith Estimate must be listed in the columns.<PRTPAGE P="673"/>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Comparison of Good Faith Estimate (GFE) and HUD-1/1A Charges</HD>
            <P>The HUD-1/1-A is a statement of actual charges and adjustments. The comparison chart on page 3 of the HUD-1 must be prepared using the exact information and amounts for the services that were purchased or provided as part of the transaction, as that information and those amounts are shown on the GFE and in the HUD-1. If a service that was listed on the GFE was not obtained in connection with the transaction, pages 1 and 2 of the HUD-1 should not include any amount for that service, and the estimate on the GFE of the charge for the service should not be included in any amounts shown on the comparison chart on Page 3 of the HUD-1. The comparison chart is comprised of three sections: “Charges That Cannot Increase,” “Charges That Cannot Increase More Than 10%,” and “Charges That Can Change”.</P>
            <P>“Charges That Cannot Increase.” The amounts shown in Blocks 1 and 2, in Line A, and in Block 8 on the borrower's GFE must be entered in the appropriate line in the Good Faith Estimate column. The amounts shown on Lines 801, 802, 803 and 1203 of the HUD-1/1A must be entered in the corresponding line in the HUD-1/1A column. The HUD-1/1A column must include any amounts shown on page 2 of the HUD-1 in the column as paid for by the borrower, plus any amounts that are shown as P.O.C. by or on behalf of the borrower. If there is a credit in Block 2 of the GFE or Line 802 of the HUD-1/1A, the credit should be entered as a negative number.</P>
            <P>“Charges That Cannot Increase More Than 10%.” A description of each charge included in Blocks 3 and 7 on the borrower's GFE must be entered on separate lines in this section, with the amount shown on the borrower's GFE for each charge entered in the corresponding line in the Good Faith Estimate column. For each charge included in Blocks 4, 5 and 6 on the borrower's GFE for which the loan originator selected the provider or for which the borrower selected a provider identified by the loan originator, a description must be entered on a separate line in this section, with the amount shown on the borrower's GFE for each charge entered in the corresponding line in the Good Faith Estimate column. The loan originator must identify any third party settlement services for which the borrower selected a provider other than one identified by the loan originator so that the settlement agent can include those charges in the appropriate category. Additional lines may be added if necessary. The amounts shown on the HUD-1/1A for each line must be entered in the HUD-1/1A column next to the corresponding charge from the GFE, along with the appropriate HUD-1/1A line number. The HUD-1/1A column must include any amounts shown on page 2 of the HUD-1 in the column as paid for by the borrower, plus any amounts that are shown as P.O.C. by or on behalf of the borrower.</P>
            <P>The amounts shown in the Good Faith Estimate and HUD-1/1A columns for this section must be separately totaled and entered in the designated line. If the total for the HUD-1/1A column is greater than the total for the Good Faith Estimate column, then the amount of the increase must be entered both as a dollar amount and as a percentage increase in the appropriate line.</P>

            <P>“Charges That Can Change.” The amounts shown in Blocks 9, 10 and 11 on the borrower's GFE must be entered in the appropriate lines in the Good Faith Estimate column. Any third party settlement services for which the borrower selected a provider other than one identified by the loan originator must also be included in this section. The amounts shown on the HUD-1/1A for each charge in this section must be entered in the corresponding line in the HUD-1/1A column, along with the appropriate HUD-1/1A line number. The HUD-1/1A column must include any amounts shown on page 2 of the HUD-1 in the column as paid for by the borrower, plus any amounts that are shown as P.O.C. <PRTPAGE P="674"/>by or on behalf of the borrower. Additional lines may be added if necessary.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Loan Terms</HD>
            <P>This section must be completed in accordance with the information and instructions provided by the lender. The lender must provide this information in a format that permits the settlement agent to simply enter the necessary information in the appropriate spaces, without the settlement agent having to refer to the loan documents themselves. For reverse mortgages, the initial monthly amount owed for principal, interest, and any mortgage insurance must read “N/A” and the loan term is disclosed as “N/A” when the loan term is conditioned upon the occurrence of a specified event, such as the death of the borrower or the borrower no longer occupying the property for a certain period of time. Additionally, for reverse mortgages the question “Even if you make payments on time, can your loan balance rise?” must be answered as “Yes” and the maximum amount disclosed as “Unknown.”</P>
            <P>For reverse mortgages that establish an arrangement for the payment of property taxes, homeowner's insurance, or other recurring charges through draws from the principal limit, the second box in the “Total monthly amount owed including escrow payments” section must be checked. The blank following the first $ must be completed with “0” and an asterisk, and all items that will be paid using draws from the principal limit, such as for property taxes, must also be indicated. An asterisk must also be placed in this section with the following statement: “Paid by or through draws from the principal limit.” Reverse mortgage transactions are not considered to be balloon transactions for the purposes of the loan terms disclosed on page 3 of the HUD-1.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Instructions for Completing HUD-1A</HD>
            <NOTE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
              <P>The HUD-1A is an optional form that may be used for refinancing and subordinate-lien federally related mortgage loans, as well as for any other one-party transaction that does not involve the transfer of title to residential real property. The HUD-1 form may also be used for such transactions, by utilizing the borrower's side of the HUD-1 and following the relevant parts of the instructions as set forth above. The use of either the HUD-1 or HUD-1A is not mandatory for open-end lines of credit (home-equity plans), as long as the provisions of Regulation Z are followed.</P>
            </NOTE>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>
            <P>The HUD-1A settlement statement is to be used as a statement of actual charges and adjustments to be given to the borrower at settlement, as defined in this part. The instructions for completion of the HUD-1A are for the benefit of the settlement agent who prepares the statement; the instructions are not a part of the statement and need not be transmitted to the borrower. There is no objection to using the HUD-1A in transactions in which it is not required, and its use in open-end lines of credit transactions (home-equity plans) is encouraged. It may not be used as a substitute for a HUD-1 in any transaction that has a seller.</P>
            <P>Refer to the “definitions” section (§ 1024.2) of 12 CFR part 1024 (Regulation X) for specific definitions of terms used in these instructions.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">General Instructions</HD>
            <P>Information and amounts may be filled in by typewriter, hand printing, computer printing, or any other method producing clear and legible results. Refer to 12 CFR 1024.9 regarding rules for reproduction of the HUD-1A. Additional pages may be attached to the HUD-1A for the inclusion of customary recitals and information used locally for settlements or if there are insufficient lines on the HUD-1A. The settlement agent shall complete the HUD-1A in accordance with the instructions for the HUD-1 to the extent possible, including the instructions for disclosing items paid outside closing and for no cost loans.</P>
            <P>Blank lines are provided in section L for any additional settlement charges. Blank lines are also provided in section M for recipients of all or portions of the loan proceeds. The names of the recipients of the settlement charges in section L and the names of the recipients of the loan proceeds in section M should be set forth on the blank lines.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Line-Item Instructions</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Page 1</HD>
            <P>The identification information at the top of the HUD-1A should be completed as follows: The borrower's name and address is entered in the space provided. If the property securing the loan is different from the borrower's address, the address or other location information on the property should be entered in the space provided. The loan number is the lender's identification number for the loan. The settlement date is the date of settlement in accordance with 12 CFR 1024.2, not the end of any applicable rescission period. The name and address of the lender should be entered in the space provided.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section L. Settlement Charges.</E> This section of the HUD-1A is similar to section L of the HUD-1, with minor changes or omissions, including deletion of lines 700 through 704, relating to real estate broker commissions. The instructions for section L in the HUD-1 should be followed insofar as possible. Inapplicable charges should be ignored, as should any instructions regarding seller items.<PRTPAGE P="675"/>
            </P>
            <P>Line 1400 in the HUD-1A is for the total settlement charges charged to the borrower. Enter this total on line 1601. This total should include section L amounts from additional pages, if any are attached to this HUD-1A.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section M. Disbursement to Others.</E> This section is used to list payees, other than the borrower, of all or portions of the loan proceeds (including the lender, if the loan is paying off a prior loan made by the same lender), when the payee will be paid directly out of the settlement proceeds. It is not used to list payees of settlement charges, nor to list funds disbursed directly to the borrower, even if the lender knows the borrower's intended use of the funds.</P>
            <P>For example, in a refinancing transaction, the loan proceeds are used to pay off an existing loan. The name of the lender for the loan being paid off and the pay-off balance would be entered in section M. In a home improvement transaction when the proceeds are to be paid to the home improvement contractor, the name of the contractor and the amount paid to the contractor would be entered in section M. In a consolidation loan, or when part of the loan proceeds is used to pay off other creditors, the name of each creditor and the amount paid to that creditor would be entered in section M. If the proceeds are to be given directly to the borrower and the borrower will use the proceeds to pay off existing obligations, this would not be reflected in section M.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Section N. Net Settlement.</E> Line 1600 normally sets forth the principal amount of the loan as it appears on the related note for this loan. In the event this form is used for an open-ended home equity line whose approved amount is greater than the initial amount advanced at settlement, the amount shown on Line 1600 will be the loan amount advanced at settlement. Line 1601 is used for all settlement charges that both are included in the totals for lines 1400 and 1602, and are not financed as part of the principal amount of the loan. This is the amount normally received by the lender from the borrower at settlement, which would occur when some or all of the settlement charges were paid in cash by the borrower at settlement, instead of being financed as part of the principal amount of the loan. Failure to include any such amount in line 1601 will result in an error in the amount calculated on line 1604. Items paid outside of closing (P.O.C.) should not be included in Line 1601.</P>
            <P>Line 1602 is the total amount from line 1400.</P>
            <P>Line 1603 is the total amount from line 1520.</P>
            <P>Line 1604 is the amount disbursed to the borrower. This is determined by adding together the amounts for lines 1600 and 1601, and then subtracting any amounts listed on lines 1602 and 1603.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Page 2</HD>
            <P>This section of the HUD-1A is similar to page 3 of the HUD-1. The instructions for page 3 of the HUD-1 should be followed insofar as possible. The HUD-1/1A Column should include any amounts shown on page 1 of the HUD-1A in the column as paid for by the borrower, plus any amounts that are shown as P.O.C. by the borrower. Inapplicable charges should be ignored.</P>

            <P>The following illustrations provide additional guidance on the meaning and coverage of the provisions of RESPA. Other provisions of Federal or state law may also be applicable to the practices and payments discussed in the following illustrations.</P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Facts:</E> A, a provider of settlement services, provides settlement services at abnormally low rates or at no charge at all to B, a builder, in connection with a subdivision being developed by B. B agrees to refer purchasers of the completed homes in the subdivision to A for the purchase of settlement services in connection with the sale of individual lots by B.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Comments:</E> The rendering of services by A to B at little or no charge constitutes a thing of value given by A to B in return for the referral of settlement services business, and both A and B are in violation of section 8 of RESPA.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Facts:</E> B, a lender, encourages persons who receive federally related mortgage loans from it to employ A, an attorney, to perform title searches and related settlement services in connection with their transaction. B and A have an understanding that in return for the referral of this business A provides legal services to B or B's officers or employees at abnormally low rates or for no charge.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Comments:</E> Both A and B are in violation of section 8 of RESPA. Similarly, if an attorney gives a portion of his or her fees to another attorney, a lender, a real estate broker or any other provider of settlement services, who had referred prospective clients to the attorney, section 8 would be violated by both persons.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Facts:</E> A, a real estate broker, obtains all necessary licenses under state law to act as a title insurance agent. A refers individuals who are purchasing homes in transactions in which A participates as a broker to B, an unaffiliated title company, for the purchase of title insurance services. A performs minimal, if any, title services in connection with the issuance of the title insurance policy (such as placing an application with the title company). B pays A a commission (or A retains a portion of the title insurance premium) for the transactions or alternatively B receives a portion of the premium paid directly from the purchaser.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Comments:</E> The payment of a commission or portion of the title insurance premium by B to A, or receipt of a portion of the payment for title insurance under circumstances where no substantial services are being performed by A, is a violation of section 8 of RESPA. It makes no difference whether the payment comes from B or the purchaser. The amount of the payment must bear a reasonable relationship to the services rendered. Here A really is being compensated for a referral of business to B.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Facts:</E> A is an attorney who, as a part of his legal representation of clients in residential real estate transactions, orders and reviews title insurance policies for his clients. A enters into a contract with B, a title company, to be an agent of B under a program set up by B. Under the agreement, A agrees to prepare and forward title insurance applications to B, to re-examine the preliminary title commitment for accuracy and if he chooses to attempt to clear exceptions to the title policy before closing. A agrees to assume liability for waiving certain exceptions to title, but never exercises this authority. B performs the necessary title search and examination work, determines insurability of title, prepares documents containing substantive information in title commitments, handles closings for A's clients and issues title policies. A receives a fee from his client for legal services and an additional fee for his title agent “services” from the client's title insurance premium to B.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Comments:</E> A and B are violating section 8 of RESPA. Here, A's clients are being double billed because the work A performs as a “title agent” is that which he already performs for his client in his capacity as an attorney. For A to receive a separate payment as a title agent, A must perform necessary core title work and may not contract out the work. To receive additional compensation as a title agent for this transaction, A must provide his client with core title agent services for which he assumes liability, and which includes at a minimum, the evaluation of the title search to determine insurability of the title, and the issuance of a title commitment where customary, the clearance of underwriting objections, and the actual issuance of the policy or policies on behalf of the title company. A may not be compensated for the mere re-examination of work performed by B. Here, A is not performing these services and may not be compensated as a title agent under section 8(c)(1)(B). Referral fees or splits of fees may not be disguised as title agent commissions when the core title agent work is not performed. Further, because B created the program and gave A the opportunity to collect fees (a thing of value) in exchange for the referral of settlement service business, it has violated section 8 of RESPA.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Facts:</E> A, a “mortgage originator,” receives loan applications, funds the loans with its own money or with a wholesale line of credit for which A is liable, and closes the loans in A's own name. Subsequently, B, a mortgage lender, purchases the loans and compensates A for the value of the loans, as well as for any mortgage servicing rights.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Comments:</E> Compensation for the sale of a mortgage loan and servicing rights constitutes a secondary market transaction, <PRTPAGE P="682"/>rather than a referral fee, and is beyond the scope of section 8 of RESPA. For purposes of section 8, in determining whether a <E T="03">bona fide</E> transfer of the loan obligation has taken place, the Bureau examines the real source of funding, and the real interest of the named settlement lender.</P>
            <P>6. <E T="03">Facts.</E> A, a credit reporting company, places a facsimile transmission machine (FAX) in the office of B, a mortgage lender, so that B can easily transmit requests for credit reports and A can respond. A supplies the FAX machine at no cost or at a reduced rental rate based on the number of credit reports ordered.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Comments:</E> Either situation violates section 8 of RESPA. The FAX machine is a thing of value that A provides in exchange for the referral of business from B. Copying machines, computer terminals, printers, or other like items which have general use to the recipient and which are given in exchange for referrals of business also violate RESPA.</P>
            <P>7. <E T="03">Facts:</E> A, a real estate broker, refers title business to B, a company that is a licensed title agent for C, a title insurance company. A owns more than 1% of B. B performs the title search and examination, makes determinations of insurability, issues the commitment, clears underwriting objections, and issues a policy of title insurance on behalf of C, for which C pays B a commission. B pays annual dividends to its owners, including A, based on the relative amount of business each of its owners refers to B.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Comments:</E> The facts involve an affiliated business arrangement. The payment of a commission by C to B is not a violation of section 8 of RESPA if the amount of the commission constitutes reasonable compensation for the services performed by B for C. The payment of a dividend or the giving of any other thing of value by B to A that is based on the amount of business referred to B by A does not meet the affiliated business agreement exemption provisions and such actions violate section 8. Similarly, if the amount of stock held by A in B (or, if B were a partnership, the distribution of partnership profits by B to A) varies based on the amount of business referred or expected to be referred, or if B retained any funds for subsequent distribution to A where such funds were generally in proportion to the amount of business A referred to B relative to the amount referred by other owners, such arrangements would violate section 8. The exemption for controlled business arrangements would not be available because the payments here would not be considered returns on ownership interests. Further, the required disclosure of the affiliated business arrangement and estimated charges have not been provided.</P>
            <P>8. <E T="03">Facts:</E> Same as illustration 7, but B pays annual dividends in proportion to the amount of stock held by its owners, including A, and the distribution of annual dividends is not based on the amount of business referred or expected to be referred.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Comments:</E> If A and B meet the requirements of the affiliated business arrangement exemption there is not a violation of RESPA. Since the payment is a return on ownership interests, A and B will be exempt from section 8 if (1) A also did not require anyone to use the services of B, and (2) A disclosed its ownership interest in B on a separate disclosure form and provided an estimate of B's charges to each person referred by A to B (see appendix D of this part), and (3) B makes no payment (nor is there any other thing of value exchanged) to A other than dividends.</P>
            <P>9. <E T="03">Facts:</E> A, a franchisor for franchised real estate brokers, owns B, a provider of settlement services. C, a franchisee of A, refers business to B.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Comments:</E> This is an affiliated business arrangement. A, B and C will all be exempt from section 8 if C discloses its franchise relationship with the owner of B on a separate disclosure form and provides an estimate of B's charges to each person referred to B (see appendix D of this part) and C does not require anyone to use B's services and A gives no thing a value to C under the franchise agreement (such as an adjusted level of franchise payment based on the referrals), and B makes no payments to A other than dividends representing a return on ownership interest (rather than, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> an adjusted level of payment being based on the referrals). Nor may B pay C anything of value for the referral.</P>
            <P>10. <E T="03">Facts:</E> A is a real estate broker who refers business to its affiliate title company B. A makes all required written disclosures to the homebuyer of the arrangement and estimated charges and the homebuyer is not required to use B. B refers or contracts out business to C who does all the title work and splits the fee with B. B passes its fee to A in the form of dividends, a return on ownership interest.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Comments:</E> The relationship between A and B is an affiliated business arrangement. However, the affiliated business arrangement exemption does not provide exemption between an affiliated entity, B, and a third party, C. Here, B is a mere “shell” and provides no substantive services for its portion of the fee. The arrangement between B and C would be in violation of section 8(a) and (b). Even if B had an affiliate relationship with C, the required exemption criteria have not been met and the relationship would be subject to section 8.</P>
            <P>11. <E T="03">Facts:</E> A, a mortgage lender is affiliated with B, a title company, and C, an escrow company and offers consumers a package of mortgage title and escrow services at a discount from the prices at which such services <PRTPAGE P="683"/>would be sold if purchased separately. Neither A, B, nor C requires consumers to purchase the services of their sister companies and each company sells such services separately and as part of the package. A also pays its employees (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> loan officers, secretaries, <E T="03">etc.</E>) a bonus for each loan, title insurance or closing that A's employees generate for A, B, or C respectively. A pays such employee bonuses out of its own funds and receives no payments or reimbursements for such bonuses from B or C. At or before the time that customers are told by A or its employees about the services offered by B and C and/or the package of services that is available, the customers are provided with an affiliated business disclosure form.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Comments:</E> A's selling of a package of settlement services at a discount to a settlement service purchaser does not violate section 8 of RESPA. A's employees are making appropriate affiliated business disclosures and since the services are available separately and as part of a package, there is not “required use” of the additional services. A's payments of bonuses to its employees for the referral of business to A or A's affiliates, B and C, are exempt from section 8 under § 1024.14(g)(1). However, if B or C reimbursed A for any bonuses that A paid to its employees for referring business to B or C, such reimbursements would violate section 8. Similarly, if B or C paid bonuses to A's employees directly for generating business for them, such payments would violate section 8.</P>
            <P>12. <E T="03">Facts.</E> A is a mortgage broker who provides origination services to submit a loan to a lender for approval. The mortgage broker charges the borrower a uniform fee for the total origination services, as well as a direct up-front charge for reimbursement of credit reporting, appraisal services, or similar charges.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Comment.</E> The mortgage broker's fee must be reflected in the Good Faith Estimate and on the HUD-1 Settlement Statement. Other charges which are paid for by the borrower and paid in advance are listed as P.O.C. on the HUD-1 Settlement Statement, and reflect the actual provider charge for such services.</P>
            <P>13. <E T="03">Facts.</E> A is a dealer in home improvements who has established funding arrangements with several lenders. Customers for home improvements receive a proposed contract from A. The proposal requires that customers both execute forms authorizing a credit check and employment verification, and frequently, execute a dealer consumer credit contract secured by a lien on the customer's (borrower's) 1- to 4-family residential property. Simultaneously with the completion and certification of the home improvement work, the note is assigned by the dealer to a funding lender.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Comments.</E> The loan that is assigned to the funding lender is a loan covered by RESPA, when a lien is placed on the borrower's 1- to 4-family residential structure. The dealer loan or consumer credit contract originated by a dealer is also a RESPA-covered transaction, except when the dealer is not a “creditor” under the definition of “federally related mortgage loan” in § 1024.2. The lender to whom the loan will be assigned is responsible for assuring that the lender or the dealer delivers to the borrower a Good Faith Estimate of closing costs consistent with Regulation X, and that the HUD-1 or HUD-1A Settlement Statement is used in conjunction with the settlement of the loan to be assigned. A dealer who, under § 1024.2, is covered by RESPA as a creditor is responsible for the Good Faith Estimate of Closing Costs and the use of the appropriate settlement statement in connection with the loan.</P>

            <EAR>Pt. 1024, App. C</EAR>
            <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix C to Part 1024—Instructions for Completing Good Faith Estimate (GFE) Form</HD>
            <P>The following are instructions for completing the GFE required under section 5 of RESPA and 12 CFR 1024.7 of the Bureau regulations. The standardized form set forth in this Appendix is the required GFE form and must be provided exactly as specified; provided, however, preparers may replace HUD's OMB approval number listed on the form with the Bureau's OMB approval number when they reproduce the GFE form. The instructions for completion of the GFE are primarily for the benefit of the loan originator who prepares the form and need not be transmitted to the borrower(s) as an integral part of the GFE. The required standardized GFE form must be prepared completely and accurately. A separate GFE must be provided for each loan where a transaction will involve more than one mortgage loan.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">General Instructions</HD>
            <P>The loan originator preparing the GFE may fill in information and amounts on the form by typewriter, hand printing, computer printing, or any other method producing clear and legible results. Under these instructions, the “form” refers to the required standardized GFE form. Although the standardized GFE is a prescribed form, Blocks 3, 6, and 11 on page 2 may be adapted for use in particular loan situations, so that additional lines may be inserted there, and unused lines may be deleted.</P>

            <P>All fees for categories of charges shall be disclosed in U.S. dollar and cent amounts.<PRTPAGE P="684"/>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Page 1</HD>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Top of the Form</E>—The loan originator must enter its name, business address, telephone number, and email address, if any, on the top of the form, along with the applicant's name, the address or location of the property for which financing is sought, and the date of the GFE.</P>
            <P>“<E T="03">Purpose.”</E>—This section describes the general purpose of the GFE as well as additional information available to the applicant.</P>
            <P>“<E T="03">Shopping for your loan.”</E>—This section requires no loan originator action.</P>
            <P>“<E T="03">Important dates.”</E>—This section briefly states important deadlines after which the loan terms that are the subject of the GFE may not be available to the applicant. In Line 1, the loan originator must state the date and, if necessary, time until which the interest rate for the GFE will be available. In Line 2, the loan originator must state the date until which the estimate of all other settlement charges for the GFE will be available. This date must be at least 10 business days from the date of the GFE. In Line 3, the loan originator must state how many calendar days within which the applicant must go to settlement once the interest rate is locked. In Line 4, the loan originator must state how many calendar days prior to settlement the interest rate would have to be locked, if applicable.</P>
            <P>“<E T="03">Summary of your loan</E>.”—In this section, for all loans the loan originator must fill in, where indicated:</P>
            <P>(i) The initial loan amount;</P>
            <P>(ii) The loan term; and</P>
            <P>(iii) The initial interest rate.</P>
            <P>For reverse mortgage transactions:</P>
            <P>(i) The initial loan amount disclosed on the GFE is the amount of the initial principal limit of the loan;</P>
            <P>(ii) The loan term is disclosed as “N/A” when the loan term is conditioned upon the occurrence of a specified event, such as the death of the borrower or the borrower no longer occupying the property for a certain period of time; and</P>
            <P>(iii) The initial interest rate is the interest rate indicated on the legal obligation.</P>
            <P>The loan originator must fill in the initial monthly amount owed for principal, interest, and any mortgage insurance. The amount shown must be the greater of: (1) The required monthly payment for principal and interest for the first regularly scheduled payment, plus any monthly mortgage insurance payment; or (2) the accrued interest for the first regularly scheduled payment, plus any monthly mortgage insurance payment. For reverse mortgage transactions where there are no regular payment periods, the loan originator must disclose “Not Applicable” or “N/A” for the initial monthly amount owed for principal, interest, and any mortgage insurance.</P>
            <P>The loan originator must indicate whether the interest rate can rise, and, if it can, must insert the maximum rate to which it can rise over the life of the loan. The loan originator must also indicate the period of time after which the interest rate can first change.</P>
            <P>The loan originator must indicate whether the loan balance can rise even if the borrower makes payments on time, for example in the case of a loan with negative amortization. If it can, the loan originator must insert the maximum amount to which the loan balance can rise over the life of the loan. For Federal, State, local, or tribal housing programs that provide payment assistance, any repayment of such program assistance should be excluded from consideration in completing this item. If the loan balance will increase only because escrow items are being paid through the loan balance, the loan originator is not required to check the box indicating that the loan balance can rise. For reverse mortgage transactions, the loan originator must indicate that the loan balance can rise even if the borrower makes payments on time and the maximum amount to which the loan balance can rise must be disclosed as “Unknown.”</P>
            <P>The loan originator must indicate whether the monthly amount owed for principal, interest, and any mortgage insurance can rise even if the borrower makes payments on time. If the monthly amount owed can rise even if the borrower makes payments on time, the loan originator must indicate the period of time after which the monthly amount owed can first change, the maximum amount to which the monthly amount owed can rise at the time of the first change, and the maximum amount to which the monthly amount owed can rise over the life of the loan. The amount used for the monthly amount owed must be the greater of: (1) The required monthly payment for principal and interest for that month, plus any monthly mortgage insurance payment; or (2) the accrued interest for that month, plus any monthly mortgage insurance payment. For reverse mortgage transactions, the loan originator must disclose that the monthly amount owed for principal, interest, and any mortgage insurance cannot rise.</P>
            <P>The loan originator must indicate whether the loan includes a prepayment penalty, and, if so, the maximum amount that it could be.</P>
            <P>The loan originator must indicate whether the loan requires a balloon payment and, if so, the amount of the payment and in how many years it will be due. Reverse mortgage transactions are not considered to be balloon transactions for the purposes of this disclosure on the GFE.</P>
            <P>“<E T="03">Escrow account information.</E>”—The loan originator must indicate whether the loan includes an escrow account for property <PRTPAGE P="685"/>taxes and other financial obligations. The amount shown in the “Summary of your loan” section for “Your initial monthly amount owed for principal, interest, and any mortgage insurance” must be entered in the space for the monthly amount owed in this section. For reverse mortgage transactions where the lender will establish an arrangement to pay for such items as property taxes and homeowner's insurance through draws from the principal limit, the loan originator must indicate that an escrow account is included and the amount shown in this section must be disclosed as 'N/A.'</P>
            <P>“<E T="03">Summary of your settlement charges.</E>”—On this line, the loan originator must state the Adjusted Origination Charges from subtotal A of page 2, the Charges for All Other Settlement Services from subtotal B of page 2, and the Total Estimated Settlement Charges from the bottom of page 2.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Page 2</HD>
            <P>“<E T="03">Understanding your estimated settlement charges.</E>”—This section details 11 settlement cost categories and amounts associated with the mortgage loan. For purposes of determining whether a tolerance has been met, the amount on the GFE should be compared with the total of any amounts shown on the HUD-1 in the borrower's column and any amounts paid outside closing by or on behalf of the borrower.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">“Your Adjusted Origination Charges”</HD>
            <P>Block 1, “<E T="03">Our origination charge.</E>”—The loan originator must state here all charges that all loan originators involved in this transaction will receive, except for any charge for the specific interest rate chosen (points). A loan originator may not separately charge any additional fees for getting this loan, including for application, processing, or underwriting. The amount stated in Block 1 is subject to zero tolerance, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> the amount may not increase at settlement.</P>
            <P>Block 2, “<E T="03">Your credit or charge (points) for the specific interest rate chosen.</E>”—For transactions involving mortgage brokers, the mortgage broker must indicate through check boxes whether there is a credit to the borrower for the interest rate chosen on the loan, the interest rate, and the amount of the credit, or whether there is an additional charge (points) to the borrower for the interest rate chosen on the loan, the interest rate, and the amount of that charge. Only one of the boxes may be checked; a credit and charge cannot occur together in the same transaction.</P>
            <P>For transactions without a mortgage broker, the lender may choose not to separately disclose in this block any credit or charge for the interest rate chosen on the loan; however, if this block does not include any positive or negative figure, the lender must check the first box to indicate that “The credit or charge for the interest rate you have chosen” is included in “Our origination charge” above (see Block 1 instructions above), must insert the interest rate, and must also insert “0” in Block 2. Only one of the boxes may be checked; a credit and charge cannot occur together in the same transaction.</P>

            <P>For a mortgage broker, the credit or charge for the specific interest rate chosen is the net payment to the mortgage broker from the lender (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the sum of all payments to the mortgage broker from the lender, including payments based on the loan amount, a flat rate, or any other computation, and in a table funded transaction, the loan amount less the price paid for the loan by the lender). When the net payment to the mortgage broker from the lender is positive, there is a credit to the borrower and it is entered as a negative amount in Block 2 of the GFE. When the net payment to the mortgage broker from the lender is negative, there is a charge to the borrower and it is entered as a positive amount in Block 2 of the GFE. If there is no net payment (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the credit or charge for the specific interest rate chosen is zero), the mortgage broker must insert '0' in Block 2 and may check either the box indicating there is a credit of '0' or the box indicating there is a charge of '0.'</P>

            <P>The amount stated in Block 2 is subject to zero tolerance while the interest rate is locked, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> any credit for the interest rate chosen cannot decrease in absolute value terms and any charge for the interest rate chosen cannot increase. (<E T="04">Note:</E> An increase in the credit is allowed since this increase is a reduction in cost to the borrower. A decrease in the credit is not allowed since it is an increase in cost to the borrower.)</P>
            <P>Line A, “<E T="03">Your Adjusted Origination Charges.</E>”—The loan originator must add the numbers in Blocks 1 and 2 and enter this subtotal at highlighted Line A. The subtotal at Line A will be a negative number if there is a credit in Block 2 that exceeds the charge in Block 1. The amount stated in Line A is subject to zero tolerance while the interest rate is locked.</P>

            <P>In the case of “no cost” loans, where “no cost” refers only to the loan originator's fees, Line A must show a zero charge as the adjusted origination charge. In the case of “no cost” loans where “no cost” encompasses third party fees as well as the upfront payment to the loan originator, all of the third party fees listed in Block 3 through Block 11 to be paid for by the loan originator (or borrower, if any) must be itemized and listed on the GFE. The credit for the interest rate chosen must be large enough that the total for Line A will result in a negative number to cover the third party fees.<PRTPAGE P="686"/>
            </P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">“Your Charges for All Other Settlement Services”</HD>
            <P>There is a 10 percent tolerance applied to the sum of the prices of each service listed in Block 3, Block 4, Block 5, Block 6, and Block 7, where the loan originator requires the use of a particular provider or the borrower uses a provider selected or identified by the loan originator. Any services in Block 4, Block 5, or Block 6 for which the borrower selects a provider other than one identified by the loan originator are not subject to any tolerance and, at settlement, would not be included in the sum of the charges on which the 10 percent tolerance is based. Where a loan originator permits a borrower to shop for third party settlement services, the loan originator must provide the borrower with a written list of settlement services providers at the time of the GFE, on a separate sheet of paper.</P>
            <P>Block 3, “<E T="03">Required services that we select.</E>”—In this block, the loan originator must identify each third party settlement service required and selected by the loan originator (excluding title services), along with the estimated price to be paid to the provider of each service. Examples of such third party settlement services might include provision of credit reports, appraisals, flood checks, tax services, and any upfront mortgage insurance premium. The loan originator must identify the specific required services and provide an estimate of the price of each service. Loan originators are also required to add the individual charges disclosed in this block and place that total in the column of this block. The charge shown in this block is subject to an overall 10 percent tolerance as described above.</P>
            <P>Block 4, “<E T="03">Title services and lender's title insurance.</E>”—In this block, the loan originator must state the estimated total charge for third party settlement service providers for all closing services, regardless of whether the providers are selected or paid for by the borrower, seller, or loan originator. The loan originator must also include any lender's title insurance premiums, when required, regardless of whether the provider is selected or paid for by the borrower, seller, or loan originator. All fees for title searches, examinations, and endorsements, for example, would be included in this total. The charge shown in this block is subject to an overall 10 percent tolerance as described above.</P>
            <P>Block 5, “<E T="03">Owner's title insurance.</E>”—In this block, for all purchase transactions the loan originator must provide an estimate of the charge for the owner's title insurance and related endorsements, regardless of whether the providers are selected or paid for by the borrower, seller, or loan originator. For non-purchase transactions, the loan originator may enter “NA” or “Not Applicable” in this Block. The charge shown in this block is subject to an overall 10 percent tolerance as described above.</P>
            <P>Block 6, “<E T="03">Required services that you can shop for.</E>”—In this block, the loan originator must identify each third party settlement service required by the loan originator where the borrower is permitted to shop for and select the settlement service provider (excluding title services), along with the estimated charge to be paid to the provider of each service. The loan originator must identify the specific required services (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> survey, pest inspection) and provide an estimate of the charge of each service. The loan originator must also add the individual charges disclosed in this block and place the total in the column of this block. The charge shown in this block is subject to an overall 10 percent tolerance as described above.</P>
            <P>Block 7, “<E T="03">Government recording charge.</E>”—In this block, the loan originator must estimate the State and local government fees for recording the loan and title documents that can be expected to be charged at settlement.

            <P>Block 8, “<E T="03">Transfer taxes.</E>”—In this block, the loan originator must estimate the sum of all State and local government fees on mortgages and home sales that can be expected to be charged at settlement, based upon the proposed loan amount or sales price and on the property address. A zero tolerance applies to the sum of these estimated fees.</P>
            <P>Block 9, “<E T="03">Initial deposit for your escrow account.</E>”—In this block, the loan originator must estimate the amount that it will require the borrower to place into a reserve or escrow account at settlement to be applied to recurring charges for property taxes, homeowner's and other similar insurance, mortgage insurance, and other periodic charges. The loan originator must indicate through check boxes if the reserve or escrow account will cover future payments for all tax, all hazard insurance, and other obligations that the loan originator requires to be paid as they fall due. If the reserve or escrow account includes some, but not all, property taxes or hazard insurance, or if it includes mortgage insurance, the loan originator should check “other” and then list the items included.</P>
            <P>Block 10, “<E T="03">Daily interest charges.</E>”—In this block, the loan originator must estimate the total amount that will be due at settlement for the daily interest on the loan from the date of settlement until the first day of the first period covered by scheduled mortgage payments.

            </P>
            <P>Block 11, “<E T="03">Homeowner's insurance.</E>”—The loan originator must estimate in this block the total amount of the premiums for any hazard insurance policy and other similar insurance, such as fire or flood insurance that must be purchased at or before settlement to meet the loan originator's requirements. The loan originator must also separately indicate the nature of each type of insurance required along with the charges. To the extent a loan originator requires that such insurance be part of an escrow account, the amount of the initial escrow deposit must be included in Block 9.</P>
            <P>Line B, “<E T="03">Your Charges for All Other Settlement Services.</E>”—The loan originator must add the numbers in Blocks 3 through 11 and enter this subtotal in the column at highlighted Line B.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">“Instructions”</HD>
            <P>“<E T="03">Understanding which charges can change at settlement.</E>”—This section informs the applicant about which categories of settlement charges can increase at closing, and by how much, and which categories of settlement charges cannot increase at closing. This section requires no loan originator action.</P>
            <P>“<E T="03">Using the tradeoff table.</E>”—This section is designed to make borrowers aware of the relationship between their total estimated settlement charges on one hand, and the interest rate and resulting monthly payment on the other hand. The loan originator must complete the left hand column using the loan amount, interest rate, monthly payment figure, and the total estimated settlement charges from page 1 of the GFE. The loan originator, at its option, may provide the borrower with the same information for two alternative loans, one with a higher interest rate, if available, and one with a lower interest rate, if available, from the loan originator. The loan originator should list in the tradeoff table only alternative loans for which it would presently issue a GFE based on the same information the loan originator considered in issuing this GFE. The alternative loans must use the same loan amount and be otherwise identical to the loan in the GFE. The alternative loans must have, for example, the identical number of payment periods; the same margin, index, and adjustment schedule if the loans are adjustable rate mortgages; and the same requirements for prepayment penalty and balloon payments. If the loan originator fills in the tradeoff table, the loan originator must show the borrower the loan amount, alternative interest rate, alternative monthly payment, the change in the monthly payment from the loan in this GFE to the alternative loan, the change in the total settlement charges from the loan in this GFE to the alternative loan, and the total settlement charges for the alternative loan. If these options are available, an applicant may request a new GFE, and a new GFE must be provided by the loan originator.</P>
            <P>“<E T="03">Using the shopping chart.</E>”—This chart is a shopping tool to be provided by the loan originator for the borrower to complete, in order to compare GFEs.</P>
            <P>“<E T="03">If your loan is sold in the future.</E>”—This section requires no loan originator action.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HED">Supplement I to Part 1024—Official Bureau Interpretations</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Introduction</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Official status.</E> This commentary is the primary vehicle by which the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection issues official interpretations of Regulation X. Good faith compliance with this commentary affords protection from liability under section 19(b) of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA), 12 U.S.C. 2617(b).</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Requests for official interpretations.</E> A request for an official interpretation shall be in writing and addressed to the Associate Director, Research, Markets, and Regulations, Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, 1700 G Street NW., Washington, DC 20552. A request shall contain a complete statement of all relevant facts concerning the issue, including copies of all pertinent documents. Except in unusual circumstances, such official interpretations will not be issued separately but will be incorporated in the official commentary to this part, which will be amended periodically. No official interpretations will be issued approving financial institutions' forms or statements. This restriction does not apply to forms or statements whose use is required or sanctioned by a government agency.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Unofficial oral interpretations.</E> Unofficial oral interpretations may be provided at the discretion of Bureau staff. Written requests for such interpretations should be sent to the address set forth for official interpretations. Unofficial oral interpretations provide no protection under section 19(b) of RESPA. Ordinarily, staff will not issue unofficial oral interpretations on matters adequately covered by this part or the official Bureau interpretations.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Rules of construction.</E> (a) Lists that appear in the commentary may be exhaustive or illustrative; the appropriate construction should be clear from the context. In most cases, illustrative lists are introduced by phrases such as “including, but not limited to,” “among other things,” “for example,” or “such as.”</P>
            <P>(b) Throughout the commentary, reference to “this section” or “this paragraph” means the section or paragraph in the regulation that is the subject of the comment.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Comment designations.</E> Each comment in the commentary is identified by a number and the regulatory section or paragraph that the comment interprets. The comments are designated with as much specificity as possible according to the particular regulatory provision addressed. For example, some of the comments to § 1024.37(c)(1) are further divided by subparagraph, such as comment 37(c)(1)(i)-1. In other cases, comments have more general application and are designated, for example, as comment 40(a)-1. This introduction may be cited as comments I-1 through I-5.</P>

State laws that give greater protection to consumers are not inconsistent with and are not preempted by RESPA or Regulation X. In addition, nothing in RESPA or Regulation X should be construed to preempt the entire field of regulation of the practices covered by RESPA or Regulation X, including the regulations in Subpart C with respect to mortgage servicers or mortgage servicing.</P>

            <P>i. A borrower notifies a servicer that the borrower has cancelled the hazard insurance coverage, and the servicer has not received <PRTPAGE P="697"/>notification of other hazard insurance coverage.</P>
            <P>ii. A servicer receives a notification of cancellation or non-renewal from the borrower's insurance company before payment is due on the borrower's hazard insurance.</P>
            <P>iii. A servicer does not receive a payment notice by the expiration date of the borrower's hazard insurance policy.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">17(k)(5)(ii)(C) Recoupment for advances.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Month-to-month advances.</E> A servicer that advances the premium payment to be disbursed from an escrow account may advance the payment on a month-to-month basis, if permitted by State or other applicable law and accepted by the borrower's hazard insurance company.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Subpart C—Mortgage Servicing</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">§ 1024.30—Scope</HD>
            <P>
              <E T="03">30(b) Exemptions.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Exemption for Farm Credit System institutions.</E> Pursuant to 12 CFR 617.7000, certain servicers may be considered “qualified lenders” only with respect to loans discounted or pledged pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 2015(b)(1). To the extent a servicer, as defined in RESPA, services a mortgage loan that has not been discounted or pledged pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 2015(b)(1), and is not subject to the requirements set forth in 12 CFR 617, the servicer may be required to comply with the requirements of §§ 1024.38 through 41 with respect to that mortgage loan.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Paragraph 30(c)(2).</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Principal residence.</E> If a property ceases to be a borrower's principal residence, the procedures set forth in §§ 1024.39 through 1024.41 do not apply to a mortgage loan secured by that property. Determination of principal residence status will depend on the specific facts and circumstances regarding the property and applicable State law. For example, a vacant property may still be a borrower's principal residence.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">30(d) Successors in interest.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Treatment of confirmed successors in interest.</E> Under § 1024.30(d), a confirmed successor in interest must be considered a borrower for purposes of this subpart and § 1024.17, regardless of whether the successor in interest assumes the mortgage loan obligation under State law. For example, if a servicer receives a loss mitigation application from a confirmed successor in interest, the servicer must review and evaluate the application and notify the confirmed successor in interest in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 1024.41 if the property is the confirmed successor in interest's principal residence and the procedures set forth in § 1024.41 are otherwise applicable. Treatment of a confirmed successor in interest as a borrower for purposes of this subpart and § 1024.17 does not affect whether the confirmed successor in interest is subject to the contractual obligations of the mortgage loan agreement, which is determined by applicable State law. 2Communications in compliance with this part to a confirmed successor in interest as defined in § 1024.31 do not violate section 805(b) of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) because consumer for purposes of FDCPA section 805 includes any person who meets the definition in this part of confirmed successor in interest.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Assumption of the mortgage loan obligation.</E> A servicer may not require a confirmed successor in interest to assume the mortgage loan obligation under State law to be considered a borrower for purposes of § 1024.17 and this subpart. If a successor in interest assumes a mortgage loan obligation under State law or is otherwise liable on the mortgage loan obligation, the protections that the successor in interest enjoys under this part are not limited to the protections that apply under § 1024.30(d) to a confirmed successor in interest.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Treatment of transferor borrowers.</E> Even after a servicer's confirmation of a successor in interest, the servicer is still required to comply with all applicable requirements of this subpart with respect to the transferor borrower.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">§ 1024.31—Definitions</HD>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Delinquency.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Length of delinquency.</E> A borrower's delinquency begins on the date an amount sufficient to cover a periodic payment of principal, interest, and, if applicable, escrow becomes due and unpaid, and lasts until such time as no periodic payment is due and unpaid, even if the borrower is afforded a period after the due date to pay before the servicer assesses a late fee.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Application of funds.</E> If a servicer applies payments to the oldest outstanding periodic payment, a payment by a delinquent borrower advances the date the borrower's delinquency began. For example, assume a borrower's mortgage loan obligation provides that a periodic payment sufficient to cover principal, interest, and escrow is due on the first of each month. The borrower fails to make a payment on January 1 or on any day in January, and on January 31 the borrower is 30 days delinquent. On February 3, the borrower makes a periodic payment. The servicer applies the payment it received on February 3 to the outstanding January payment. On February 4, the borrower is three days delinquent.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Payment tolerance.</E> For any given billing cycle for which a borrower's payment is less than the periodic payment due, if a servicer chooses not to treat a borrower as delinquent for purposes of any section of this subpart, that borrower is not delinquent as defined in § 1024.31.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Creditor's contract rights.</E> This subpart does not prevent a creditor from exercising a <PRTPAGE P="698"/>right provided by a mortgage loan contract to accelerate payment for a breach of that contract. Failure to pay the amount due after the creditor accelerates the mortgage loan obligation in accordance with the mortgage loan contract would begin or continue delinquency.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Loss mitigation application.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Borrower's representative.</E> A loss mitigation application is deemed to be submitted by a borrower if the loss mitigation application is submitted by an agent of the borrower. Servicers may undertake reasonable procedures to determine if a person that claims to be an agent of a borrower has authority from the borrower to act on the borrower's behalf.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Loss mitigation option.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Types of loss mitigation options.</E> Loss mitigation options include temporary and long-term relief, including options that allow borrowers who are behind on their mortgage payments to remain in their homes or to leave their homes without a foreclosure, such as, without limitation, refinancing, trial or permanent modification, repayment of the amount owed over an extended period of time, forbearance of future payments, short-sale, deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, and loss mitigation programs sponsored by a locality, a State, or the Federal government.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Available through the servicer.</E> A loss mitigation option available through the servicer refers to an option for which a borrower may apply, even if the borrower ultimately does not qualify for such option.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Qualified written request.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. A qualified written request is a written notice a borrower provides to request a servicer either correct an error relating to the servicing of a mortgage loan or to request information relating to the servicing of the mortgage loan. A qualified written request is not required to include both types of requests. For example, a qualified written request may request information relating to the servicing of a mortgage loan but not assert that an error relating to the servicing of a loan has occurred.</P>
            <P>2. A qualified written request is just one form that a written notice of error or information request may take. Thus, the error resolution and information request requirements in §§ 1024.35 and 1024.36 apply as set forth in those sections irrespective of whether the servicer receives a qualified written request.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Service provider.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. Service providers may include attorneys retained to represent a servicer or an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan in a foreclosure proceeding, as well as other professionals retained to provide appraisals or inspections of properties.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Successor in interest.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Joint tenants and tenants by the entirety.</E> If a borrower who has an ownership interest as a joint tenant or tenant by the entirety in a property securing a mortgage loan subject to this subpart dies, a surviving joint tenant or tenant by the entirety with a right of survivorship in the property is a successor in interest as defined in § 1024.31.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Beneficiaries of</E> inter vivos <E T="03">trusts.</E> In the event of a transfer into an <E T="03">inter vivos</E> trust in which the borrower is and remains a beneficiary and which does not relate to a transfer of rights of occupancy in the property, the beneficiaries of the <E T="03">inter vivos</E> trust rather than the <E T="03">inter vivos</E> trust itself are considered to be the successors in interest for purposes of § 1024.31. For example, assume Borrower A transfers her home into such an <E T="03">inter vivos</E> trust for the benefit of her spouse and herself. As of the transfer date, Borrower A and her spouse would be considered successors in interest and, upon confirmation, would be borrowers for purposes of certain provisions of Regulation X. If the lender has not released Borrower A from the loan obligation, Borrower A would also remain a borrower more generally for purposes of Regulation X.</P>

A servicer may identify in the acknowledgment form examples of the types of notices and communications identified in § 1024.32(c)(1)(iii), such as periodic statements and mortgage servicing transfer notices. Any examples provided should be the types of notices or communications that would be available to a confirmed successor in interest if the confirmed successor in interest executed the acknowledgment and returned it to the servicer.</P>

            <P>2. <E T="03">Effect of revocation of acknowledgment.</E> If a confirmed successor in interest who is not liable on the mortgage loan obligation executes and then later revokes an acknowledgment pursuant to § 1024.32(c)(1)(iv), the servicer is not required to provide to the confirmed successor in interest any written disclosure required by § 1024.17, § 1024.33, § 1024.34, § 1024.37, or § 1024.39 or to comply with the live contact requirements in § 1024.39(a) with respect to the confirmed successor in interest from the date the revocation is received until the confirmed successor in interest either assumes the mortgage loan obligation under State law or executes a new acknowledgment that complies with § 1024.32(c)(1)(iv) and provides it to the servicer.<PRTPAGE P="699"/>

For example, a servicer is not required to provide a force-placed insurance notice required under § 1024.37 to a confirmed successor in interest if the servicer is providing the same force-placed insurance notice to a transferor borrower or to another confirmed successor in interest.</P>

            <P>1. <E T="03">Terminology.</E> Although the servicing disclosure statement must be clear and conspicuous pursuant to § 1024.32(a), § 1024.33(a) does not set forth any specific rules for the format of the statement, and the specific language of the servicing disclosure statement in appendix MS-1 is not required to be used. The model format may be supplemented with additional information that clarifies or enhances the model language.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Delivery to co-applicants.</E> If co-applicants indicate the same address on their application, one copy delivered to that address is sufficient. If different addresses are shown by co-applicants on the application, a copy must be delivered to each of the co-applicants.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Lender servicing.</E> If the lender, mortgage broker who anticipates using table funding, or dealer in a first lien dealer loan knows at the time of making the disclosure whether it will service the mortgage loan for which the applicant has applied, the disclosure must, as applicable, state that such entity will service such loan and does not intend to sell, transfer, or assign the servicing of the loan, or that such entity intends to assign, sell, or transfer servicing of such mortgage loan before the first payment is due. In all other instances, a disclosure that states that the servicing of the loan may be assigned, sold, or transferred while the loan is outstanding complies with § 1024.33(a).</P>

            <P>2. <E T="03">Borrower agreement.</E> A borrower may agree either orally or in writing to a servicer's crediting of any remaining balance in an escrow account to a new escrow account for a new mortgage loan pursuant to § 1024.34(b)(2).</P>

              <E T="03">35(a) Notice of error.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Borrower's representative.</E> A notice of error is submitted by a borrower if the notice of error is submitted by an agent of the borrower. A servicer may undertake reasonable procedures to determine if a person that claims to be an agent of a borrower has authority from the borrower to act on the borrower's behalf, for example, by requiring that a person that claims to be an agent of the borrower provide documentation from the borrower stating that the purported agent is acting on the borrower's behalf. Upon receipt of such documentation, the servicer shall treat the notice of error as having been submitted by the borrower.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Information request.</E> A servicer should not rely solely on the borrower's description of a submission to determine whether the submission constitutes a notice of error under § 1024.35(a), an information request under § 1024.36(a), or both. For example, a borrower may submit a letter that claims to be a “Notice of Error” that indicates that the borrower wants to receive the information set forth in an annual escrow account statement and asserts an error for the servicer's failure to provide the borrower an annual escrow statement. Such a letter may constitute an information request under § 1024.36(a) that triggers an obligation by the <PRTPAGE P="700"/>servicer to provide an annual escrow statement. A servicer should not rely on the borrower's characterization of the letter as a “Notice of Error,” but must evaluate whether the letter fulfills the substantive requirements of a notice of error, information request, or both.</P>

              <E T="03">35(b) Scope of error resolution.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Noncovered errors.</E> A servicer is not required to comply with § 1024.35(d), (e) and (i) with respect to a borrower's assertion of an error that is not defined as an error in § 1024.35(b). For example, the following are not errors for purposes of § 1024.35:</P>
            <P>i. An error relating to the origination of a mortgage loan;</P>
            <P>ii. An error relating to the underwriting of a mortgage loan;</P>
            <P>iii. An error relating to a subsequent sale or securitization of a mortgage loan;</P>
            <P>iv. An error relating to a determination to sell, assign, or transfer the servicing of a mortgage loan. However, an error relating to the failure to transfer accurately and timely information relating to the servicing of a borrower's mortgage loan account to a transferee servicer is an error for purposes of § 1024.35.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Unreasonable basis.</E> For purposes of § 1024.35(b)(5), a servicer lacks a reasonable basis to impose fees that are not bona fide, such as:</P>
            <P>i. A late fee for a payment that was not late;</P>
            <P>ii. A charge imposed by a service provider for a service that was not actually rendered;</P>
            <P>iii. A default property management fee for borrowers that are not in a delinquency status that would justify the charge; or</P>

            <P>1. <E T="03">Exclusive address not required.</E> A servicer is not required to designate a specific address that a borrower must use to assert an error. If a servicer does not designate a specific address that a borrower must use to assert an error, a servicer must respond to a notice of error received by any office of the servicer.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Notice of an exclusive address.</E> A notice establishing an address that a borrower must use to assert an error may be included with a different disclosure, such as a notice of transfer. The notice is subject to the clear and conspicuous requirement in § 1024.32(a)(1). If a servicer establishes an address that a borrower must use to assert an error, a servicer must provide that address to the borrower in the following contexts:</P>
            <P>i. The written notice designating the specific address, required pursuant to § 1024.35(c) and § 1024.36(b).</P>
            <P>ii. Any periodic statement or coupon book required pursuant to 12 CFR 1026.41.</P>
            <P>iii. Any Web site the servicer maintains in connection with the servicing of the loan.</P>
            <P>iv. Any notice required pursuant to §§ 1024.39 or .41 that includes contact information for assistance.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Multiple offices.</E> A servicer may designate multiple office addresses for receiving notices of errors. However, a servicer is required to comply with the requirements of § 1024.35 with respect to a notice of error received at any such designated address regardless of whether that specific address was provided to a specific borrower asserting an error. For example, a servicer may designate an address to receive notices of error for borrowers located in California and a separate address to receive notices of errors for borrowers located in Texas. If a borrower located in California asserts an error through the address used by the servicer for borrowers located in Texas, the servicer is still considered to have received a notice of error and must comply with the requirements of § 1024.35.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Internet intake of notices of error.</E> A servicer may, but need not, establish a process for receiving notices of error through email, Web site form, or other online intake methods. Any such online intake process shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any process for receiving notices of error by mail. The process or processes established by the servicer for receiving notices of error through an online intake method shall be the exclusive online intake process or processes for receiving notices of error. A servicer is not required to provide a separate notice to a borrower to establish a specific online intake process as an exclusive online process for receiving such notices of error.</P>

For example, in response to an asserted error regarding payment allocation, a servicer may provide a printed screen-capture showing amounts credited to principal, interest, escrow, or other charges in the servicer's system for the borrower's mortgage loan account.</P>

Assertions of errors regarding substantially all aspects of a mortgage loan, including errors relating to all aspects of mortgage origination, mortgage servicing, and foreclosure, as well as errors relating to the crediting of substantially every borrower payment and escrow account transaction;</P>
            <P>ii. Assertions of errors in the form of a judicial action complaint, subpoena, or discovery request that purports to require servicers to respond to each numbered paragraph; and</P>
            <P>iii. Assertions of errors in a form that is not reasonably understandable or is included with voluminous tangential discussion or requests for information, such that a servicer cannot reasonably identify from the notice of error any error for which § 1024.35 requires a response.</P>

              <E T="03">35(h) Payment requirements prohibited.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Borrower obligation to make payments.</E> Section 1024.35(h) prohibits a servicer from requiring a borrower to make a payment that may be owed on a borrower's account as a prerequisite to investigating or responding to a notice of error submitted by a borrower, but does not alter or otherwise affect a borrower's obligation to make payments owed pursuant to the terms of a mortgage loan. For example, if a borrower makes a monthly payment in February for a mortgage loan, but asserts an error relating to the servicer's acceptance of the February payment, § 1024.35(h) does not alter a borrower's obligation to make a monthly payment that the borrower owes for March. A servicer, however, may not require that a borrower make the March payment as a condition for complying with its obligations under § 1024.35 with respect to the notice of error on the February payment.</P>

            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Borrower's representative.</E> An information request is submitted by a borrower if the information request is submitted by an agent of the borrower. A servicer may undertake reasonable procedures to determine if a person that claims to be an agent of a borrower has authority from the borrower to act on the borrower's behalf, for example, by requiring that a person that claims to be an agent of the borrower provide documentation from the borrower stating that the purported agent is acting on the borrower's behalf. Upon receipt of such documentation, the servicer shall treat the request for information as having been submitted by the borrower.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Owner or assignee of a mortgage loan.</E> i. When a loan is not held in a trust for which an appointed trustee receives payments on behalf of the trust, a servicer complies with § 1024.36(d) by responding to a request for information regarding the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan by identifying the person on whose behalf the servicer receives payments from the borrower. A servicer is not the owner or assignee for purposes of § 1024.36(d) if the servicer holds title to the loan, or title is assigned to the servicer, solely for the administrative convenience of the servicer in servicing the mortgage loan obligation. The Government National Mortgage Association is not the owner or assignee for purposes of such requests for information solely as a result of its role as the guarantor of the security in which the loan serves as the collateral.</P>

            <P>ii. When the loan is held in a trust for which an appointed trustee receives payments on behalf of the trust, a servicer complies with § 1024.36(d) by responding to a borrower's request for information regarding the owner, assignee, or trust of the mortgage <PRTPAGE P="702"/>loan with the following information, as applicable:</P>
            <P>A. For any request for information where the Federal National Mortgage Association or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation is not the owner of the loan or the trustee of the securitization trust in which the loan is held: The name of the trust, and the name, address, and appropriate contact information for the trustee. Assume, for example, a mortgage loan is owned by Mortgage Loan Trust, Series ABC-1, for which XYZ Trust Company is the trustee. The servicer complies with § 1024.36(d) by identifying the owner as Mortgage Loan Trust, Series ABC-1, and providing the name, address, and appropriate contact information for XYZ Trust Company as the trustee.</P>
            <P>B. If the request for information did not expressly request the name or number of the trust or pool and the Federal National Mortgage Association or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation is the owner of the loan or the trustee of the securitization trust in which the loan is held: The name and contact information for the Federal National Mortgage Association or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, as applicable, without also providing the name of the trust.</P>
            <P>C. If the request for information did expressly request the name or number of the trust or pool and the Federal National Mortgage Association or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation is the owner of the loan or the trustee of the securitization trust in which the loan is held: The name of the trust, and the name, address, and appropriate contact information for the trustee, as in comment 36(a)-2.ii.A above.</P>

            <P>1. <E T="03">Requests that indicate that the person may be a successor in interest.</E> Section 1024.36(i) requires a servicer to respond to certain written requests received from a person that indicate the person may be a successor in interest. Examples of written requests that indicate that the person may be a successor in interest include, without limitation, a written statement from a person other than a borrower indicating that there has been a transfer of ownership or of an ownership interest in the property to the person or that a borrower has been divorced, legally separated, or died, or a written loss mitigation application received from a person other than a borrower.</P>

Servicers subject to § 1024.38(b)(1)(vi)(B) must also maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that, upon receiving notice of the existence of a potential successor in interest, the servicer can promptly determine the documents the servicer reasonably requires to confirm that person's identity and ownership interest in the property and promptly provide to the potential <PRTPAGE P="704"/>successor in interest a description of those documents and how the person may submit a written request under § 1024.36(i) (including the appropriate address).

A servicer may undertake reasonable procedures to determine if a person that claims to be an agent of a potential successor in interest has authority from the potential successor in interest to act on the potential successor in interest's behalf, for example, by requiring that a person that claims to be an agent of the potential successor in interest provide documentation from the potential successor in interest stating that the purported agent is acting on the potential successor in interest's behalf. Upon receipt of such documentation, the servicer shall treat the request for information as having been submitted by the potential successor in interest.</P>

If a servicer receives no such information, the servicer may satisfy the reasonable basis to believe standard if the servicer acts with reasonable diligence to ascertain a borrower's hazard insurance status and does not receive from the borrower, or otherwise have evidence of insurance coverage as provided in § 1024.37(c)(1)(iii).

A servicer may reject evidence of hazard insurance coverage submitted by the borrower if neither the borrower's insurance provider nor insurance agent provides confirmation of the insurance information submitted by the borrower, or if the terms and conditions of the borrower's hazard insurance policy do not comply with the borrower's loan contract requirements.</P>

The servicer does not receive any insurance information from Borrower A. The servicer must deliver to Borrower A or place in the mail a reminder notice, with the information required by § 1024.37(d)(2)(i), at least 30 days after June 1 and at least 15 days before the servicer charges Borrower A for force-placed insurance.</P>

For example, a mortgage investor's requirements may provide that the amount of coverage for force-placed insurance depends on the borrower's delinquency status (the number of days the borrower's mortgage payment is past due). The amount of coverage affects the cost of force-placed insurance. A servicer that provides an estimate of the cost of force-placed insurance based on the borrower's delinquency status at the time the disclosure is made complies with § 1024.37(d)(2)(i)(D).</P>

To illustrate, assume that on January 2, the servicer sends the notice required by § 1024.37(e)(1)(i). At 12:01 a.m. on January 12, the existing force-placed insurance the servicer had purchased on the borrower's property expires and the servicer replaces the expired force-placed insurance policy with a new policy. On February 5, the servicer receives evidence demonstrating the borrower has hazard insurance effective since 12:01 a.m. on January 31. The servicer may charge the borrower for force-placed insurance covering the period from 12:01 a.m. January 12 to 12:01 a.m. January 31, as early as February 5.</P>

A servicer has flexibility to determine such policies and procedures and methods in light of the size, nature, and scope of the servicer's operations, including, for example, the volume and aggregate unpaid principal balance of mortgage loans serviced, the credit quality, including the default risk, of the mortgage loans serviced, and the servicer's history of consumer complaints.</P>

            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Identification of potential successors in interest.</E> A servicer may be notified of the existence of a potential successor in interest in a variety of ways. For example, a person could indicate that there has been a transfer of ownership or of an ownership interest in the property or that a borrower has been divorced, legally separated, or died, or a person other than a borrower could submit a loss mitigation application. A servicer must maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that the servicer can retain this information and promptly facilitate communication with potential successors in interest when a servicer is notified of their existence. A servicer is not required to conduct a search for potential successors in interest if the servicer has not received actual notice of their existence.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Documents reasonably required.</E> The documents a servicer requires to confirm a potential successor in interest's identity and ownership interest in the property must be reasonable in light of the laws of the relevant jurisdiction, the specific situation of the potential successor in interest, and the documents already in the servicer's possession. The required documents may, where appropriate, include, for example, a death certificate, an executed will, or a court order. The required documents may also include documents that the servicer reasonably believes are necessary to prevent fraud or other criminal activity (for example, if a servicer has reason to believe that documents presented are forged).</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Examples of reasonable requirements.</E> Because the relevant law governing each situation may vary from State to State, the following examples are illustrative only. The examples illustrate what documents it would generally be reasonable for a servicer to require to confirm a potential successor in interest's identity and ownership interest in the property under the specific circumstances described.</P>
            <P>i. <E T="03">Tenancy by the entirety or joint tenancy.</E> Assume that a servicer knows that the potential successor in interest and the transferor borrower owned the property as tenants by the entirety or joint tenants and that the transferor borrower has died. Assume further that, upon the death of the transferor borrower, the applicable law of the relevant jurisdiction does not require a probate proceeding to establish that the potential successor in interest has sole interest in the property but requires only that there be a prior recorded deed listing both the potential successor in interest and the transferor borrower as tenants by the entirety (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> married grantees) or joint tenants. Under these circumstances, it would be reasonable for the servicer to require the potential successor in interest to provide documentation of the recorded instrument, if the servicer does not already have it, and the death certificate of the transferor borrower. Because in this situation a probate proceeding is not required under the applicable law of the relevant jurisdiction, it generally would not be reasonable for the servicer to require documentation of a probate proceeding.</P>
            <P>ii. <E T="03">Affidavits of heirship.</E> Assume that a potential successor in interest indicates that an ownership interest in the property transferred to the potential successor in interest upon the death of the transferor borrower through intestate succession and offers an affidavit of heirship as confirmation. Assume further that, upon the death of the transferor borrower, the applicable law of the relevant jurisdiction does not require a probate proceeding to establish that the potential successor in interest has an interest in the <PRTPAGE P="707"/>property but requires only an appropriate affidavit of heirship. Under these circumstances, it would be reasonable for the servicer to require the potential successor in interest to provide the affidavit of heirship and the death certificate of the transferor borrower. Because a probate proceeding is not required under the applicable law of the relevant jurisdiction to recognize the transfer of title, it generally would not be reasonable for the servicer to require documentation of a probate proceeding.</P>
            <P>iii. <E T="03">Divorce or legal separation.</E> Assume that a potential successor in interest indicates that an ownership interest in the property transferred to the potential successor in interest from a spouse who is a borrower as a result of a property agreement incident to a divorce proceeding. Assume further that the applicable law of the relevant jurisdiction does not require a deed conveying the interest in the property but accepts a final divorce decree and accompanying separation agreement executed by both spouses to evidence transfer of title. Under these circumstances, it would be reasonable for the servicer to require the potential successor in interest to provide documentation of the final divorce decree and an executed separation agreement. Because the applicable law of the relevant jurisdiction does not require a deed, it generally would not be reasonable for the servicer to require a deed.</P>
            <P>iv. <E T="03">Living spouses or parents.</E> Assume that a potential successor in interest indicates that an ownership interest in the property transferred to the potential successor in interest from a living spouse or parent who is a borrower by quitclaim deed or act of donation. Under these circumstances, it would be reasonable for the servicer to require the potential successor in interest to provide the quitclaim deed or act of donation. It generally would not be reasonable, however, for the servicer to require additional documents.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Additional documentation required for confirmation determination.</E> Section 1024.38(b)(1)(vi)(C) requires a servicer to maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that, upon receipt of the documents identified by the servicer, the servicer promptly notifies a potential successor in interest that, as applicable, the servicer has confirmed the potential successor in interest's status, has determined that additional documents are required, or has determined that the potential successor in interest is not a successor in interest. If a servicer reasonably determines that it cannot make a determination of the potential successor in interest's status based on the documentation provided, it must specify what additional documentation is required. For example, if there is pending litigation involving the potential successor in interest and other claimants regarding who has title to the property at issue, a servicer may specify that documentation of a court determination or other resolution of the litigation is required.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Prompt confirmation and loss mitigation.</E> A servicer's policies and procedures must be reasonably designed to ensure that the servicer can promptly notify the potential successor in interest that the servicer has confirmed the potential successor in interest's status. Notification is not prompt for purposes of this requirement if it unreasonably interferes with a successor in interest's ability to apply for loss mitigation options according to the procedures provided in § 1024.41.</P>

            <P>1. <E T="03">Means of identifying all available loss mitigation options.</E> Servicers must develop policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to enable servicer personnel to identify all loss mitigation options available for mortgage loans currently serviced by the mortgage servicer. For example, a servicer's policies and procedures must be reasonably designed to address how a servicer specifically identifies, with respect to each owner or assignee, all of the loss mitigation options that the servicer may consider when evaluating any borrower for a loss mitigation option and the criteria that should be applied by a servicer when evaluating a borrower for such options. In addition, a servicer's policies and procedures must be reasonably designed to address how the servicer will apply any specific thresholds for eligibility for a particular loss mitigation option established by an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> if the owner or assignee requires that a servicer only make a particular loss mitigation option available to a certain percentage of the loans that the servicer services for that owner or assignee, then the servicer's policies and procedures must be reasonably designed to determine in advance how the servicer will apply that threshold to those mortgage loans). A servicer's policies and procedures must also be reasonably designed to ensure that such information is readily accessible to the servicer personnel involved with loss mitigation, including personnel made available to the borrower as described in § 1024.40.</P>

            <P>1. <E T="03">Owner or assignee requirements.</E> A servicer must have policies and procedures reasonably designed to evaluate a borrower for a loss mitigation option consistent with any owner or assignee requirements, even where the requirements of § 1024.41 may be inapplicable. For example, an owner or assignee may require that a servicer implement certain procedures to review a loss mitigation application submitted by a borrower less than 37 days before a foreclosure sale. Further, an owner or assignee may require that <PRTPAGE P="708"/>a servicer implement certain procedures to re-evaluate a borrower who has demonstrated a material change in the borrower's financial circumstances for a loss mitigation option after the servicer's initial evaluation. A servicer must have policies and procedures reasonably designed to implement these requirements even if such loss mitigation evaluations may not be required pursuant to § 1024.41.</P>

For example, a transferor servicer must have policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that data can be properly and promptly boarded by a transferee servicer's electronic systems and that all necessary documents and information are available to, and can be appropriately identified by, a transferee servicer.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Loss mitigation documents.</E> A transferor servicer's policies and procedures must be reasonably designed to ensure that the transfer includes any information reflecting the current status of discussions with a borrower regarding loss mitigation options, any agreements entered into with a borrower on a loss mitigation option, and any analysis by a servicer with respect to potential recovery from a non-performing mortgage loan, as appropriate.</P>

            <P>1. <E T="03">Missing loss mitigation documents and information.</E> A transferee servicer must have policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure, in connection with a servicing transfer, that the transferee servicer receives information regarding any loss mitigation discussions with a borrower, including any copies of loss mitigation agreements. Further, the transferee servicer's policies and procedures must address obtaining any such missing information or documents from a transferor servicer before attempting to obtain such information from a borrower. For example, assume a servicer receives documents or information from a transferor servicer indicating that a borrower has made payments consistent with a trial or permanent loan modification but has not received information about the existence of a trial or permanent loan modification agreement. The servicer must have policies and procedures reasonably designed to identify whether any such loan modification agreement exists with the transferor servicer and to obtain any such agreement from the transferor servicer.</P>

For example, a servicer may comply with § 1024.38(b)(5) by including in the periodic statement required pursuant to § 1026.41 a brief statement informing borrowers that borrowers have certain rights under Federal law related to resolving errors and requesting information about their account, and that they may learn more about their rights by contacting the servicer, and a statement directing borrowers to a Web site that provides a description of the procedures set forth in §§ 1024.35 and 1024.36. Alternatively, a servicer may also comply with § 1024.38(b)(5) by including a description of the procedures set forth in §§ 1024.35 and 1024.36 in the written notice required by § 1024.35(c) and § 1024.36(b).</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Oral complaints and requests.</E> A servicer's policies and procedures must be reasonably designed to provide information to borrowers who are not satisfied with the resolution of a complaint or request for information submitted orally about the procedures for submitting written notices of error set forth in § 1024.35 and for submitting written requests for information set forth in § 1024.36.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Notices of error incorrectly sent to addresses associated with submission of loss mitigation applications or the continuity of contact.</E> A servicer's policies and procedures must be reasonably designed to ensure that if a borrower incorrectly submits an assertion of an error to any address given to the borrower in connection with submission of a loss mitigation application or the continuity of contact pursuant to § 1024.40, the servicer will inform the borrower of the procedures for submitting written notices of error set forth in <PRTPAGE P="709"/>§ 1024.35, including the correct address.

A servicer is not required to comply with § 1024.38(c)(2) with respect to information created prior to January 10, 2014. For example, if a mortgage loan was originated on January 1, 2013, a servicer is not required by § 1024.38(c)(2) to maintain information regarding transactions credited or debited to that mortgage loan account in any particular manner for payments made prior to January 10, 2014. However, for payments made on or after January 10, 2014, a servicer must maintain such information in a manner that facilitates compiling such information into a servicing file within five days.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Borrower requests for servicing file.</E> Section 1024.38(c)(2) does not confer upon any borrower an independent right to access information contained in the servicing file.

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">§ 1024.39—Early Intervention Requirements for Certain Borrowers</HD>
            <P>
              <E T="03">39(a) Live contact.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Delinquency.</E> Section 1024.39 requires a servicer to establish or attempt to establish live contact no later than the 36th day of a borrower's delinquency. This provision is illustrated as follows:</P>
            <P>i. Assume a mortgage loan obligation with a monthly billing cycle and monthly payments of $2,000 representing principal, interest, and escrow due on the first of each month.</P>

            <P>A. The borrower fails to make a payment of $2,000 on, and makes no payment during the 36-day period after, January 1. The servicer must establish or make good faith efforts to establish live contact not later than 36 days after January 1—<E T="03">i.e.,</E> on or before February 6.</P>
            <P>B. The borrower makes no payments during the period January 1 through April 1, although payments of $2,000 each on January 1, February 1, and March 1 are due. Assuming it is not a leap year, the borrower is 90 days delinquent as of April 1. The servicer may time its attempts to establish live contact such that a single attempt will meet the requirements of § 1024.39(a) for two missed payments. To illustrate, the servicer complies with § 1024.39(a) if the servicer makes a good faith effort to establish live contact with the borrower, for example, on February 5 and again on March 25. The February 5 attempt meets the requirements of § 1024.39(a) for both the January 1 and February 1 missed payments. The March 25 attempt meets the requirements of § 1024.39(a) for the March 1 missed payment.</P>
            <P>ii. A borrower who is performing as agreed under a loss mitigation option designed to bring the borrower current on a previously missed payment is not delinquent for purposes of § 1024.39.</P>

            <P>iii. During the 60-day period beginning on the effective date of transfer of the servicing of any mortgage loan, a borrower is not delinquent for purposes of § 1024.39 if the transferee servicer learns that the borrower has made a timely payment that has been misdirected to the transferor servicer and the transferee servicer documents its files accordingly. <E T="03">See</E> § 1024.33(c)(1) and comment 33(c)(1)-2.</P>

            <P>iv. A servicer need not establish live contact with a borrower unless the borrower is delinquent during the 36 days after a payment due date. If the borrower satisfies a payment in full before the end of the 36-day period, the servicer need not establish live contact with the borrower. For example, if a borrower misses a January 1 due date but makes that payment on February 1, a servicer need not establish or make good faith efforts to establish live contact by February 6.<PRTPAGE P="710"/>
            </P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Establishing live contact.</E> Live contact provides servicers an opportunity to discuss the circumstances of a borrower's delinquency. Live contact with a borrower includes speaking on the telephone or conducting an in-person meeting with the borrower but not leaving a recorded phone message. A servicer may rely on live contact established at the borrower's initiative to satisfy the live contact requirement in § 1024.39(a). Servicers may also combine contacts made pursuant to § 1024.39(a) with contacts made with borrowers for other reasons, for instance, by telling borrowers on collection calls that loss mitigation options may be available.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Good faith efforts.</E> Good faith efforts to establish live contact consist of reasonable steps, under the circumstances, to reach a borrower and may include telephoning the borrower on more than one occasion or sending written or electronic communication encouraging the borrower to establish live contact with the servicer. The length of a borrower's delinquency, as well as a borrower's failure to respond to a servicer's repeated attempts at communication pursuant to § 1024.39(a), are relevant circumstances to consider. For example, whereas “good faith efforts” to establish live contact with regard to a borrower with two consecutive missed payments might require a telephone call, “good faith efforts” to establish live contact with regard to an unresponsive borrower with six or more consecutive missed payments might require no more than including a sentence requesting that the borrower contact the servicer with regard to the delinquencies in the periodic statement or in an electronic communication. Comment 39(a)-6 discusses the relationship between live contact and the loss mitigation procedures set forth in § 1024.41.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Promptly inform if appropriate.</E> i. <E T="03">Servicer's determination.</E> It is within a servicer's reasonable discretion to determine whether informing a borrower about the availability of loss mitigation options is appropriate under the circumstances. The following examples demonstrate when a servicer has made a reasonable determination regarding the appropriateness of providing information about loss mitigation options.</P>
            <P>A. A servicer provides information about the availability of loss mitigation options to a borrower who notifies a servicer during live contact of a material adverse change in the borrower's financial circumstances that is likely to cause the borrower to experience a long-term delinquency for which loss mitigation options may be available.</P>
            <P>B. A servicer does not provide information about the availability of loss mitigation options to a borrower who has missed a January 1 payment and notified the servicer that full late payment will be transmitted to the servicer by February 15.</P>
            <P>ii. <E T="03">Promptly inform.</E> If appropriate, a servicer may inform borrowers about the availability of loss mitigation options orally, in writing, or through electronic communication, but the servicer must provide such information promptly after the servicer establishes live contact. A servicer need not notify a borrower about any particular loss mitigation options at this time; if appropriate, a servicer need only inform borrowers generally that loss mitigation options may be available. If appropriate, a servicer may satisfy the requirement in § 1024.39(a) to inform a borrower about loss mitigation options by providing the written notice required by § 1024.39(b)(1), but the servicer must provide such notice promptly after the servicer establishes live contact.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Borrower's representative.</E> Section 1024.39 does not prohibit a servicer from satisfying its requirements by establishing live contact with and, if applicable, providing information about loss mitigation options to a person authorized by the borrower to communicate with the servicer on the borrower's behalf. A servicer may undertake reasonable procedures to determine if a person that claims to be an agent of a borrower has authority from the borrower to act on the borrower's behalf, for example, by requiring a person that claims to be an agent of the borrower to provide documentation from the borrower stating that the purported agent is acting on the borrower's behalf.</P>
            <P>6. <E T="03">Relationship between live contact and loss mitigation procedures.</E> If the servicer has established and is maintaining ongoing contact with the borrower under the loss mitigation procedures under § 1024.41, including during the borrower's completion of a loss mitigation application or the servicer's evaluation of the borrower's complete loss mitigation application, or if the servicer has sent the borrower a notice pursuant to § 1024.41(c)(1)(ii) that the borrower is not eligible for any loss mitigation options, the servicer complies with § 1024.39(a) and need not otherwise establish or make good faith efforts to establish live contact. A servicer must resume compliance with the requirements of § 1024.39(a) for a borrower who becomes delinquent again after curing a prior delinquency.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">39(b) Written notice.</E>
            </P>

              <E T="03">39(b)(1) Notice required.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Delinquency.</E> For guidance on the circumstances under which a borrower is delinquent for purposes of § 1024.39, see comment 39(a)-1. For example, if a payment due date is January 1 and the payment remains unpaid during the 45-day period after January 1, the servicer must provide the written notice within 45 days after January 1—<E T="03">i.e.,</E> by February 15. However, if a borrower satisfies a late payment in full before the end of the 45-day period, the servicer need not provide <PRTPAGE P="711"/>the written notice. For example, if a borrower misses a January 1 due date but makes that payment on February 1, a servicer need not provide the written notice by February 15.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Frequency of the written notice.</E> A servicer need not provide the written notice under § 1024.39(b) more than once during a 180-day period beginning on the date on which the written notice is provided. A servicer must provide the written notice under § 1024.39(b) at least once every 180 days to a borrower who is 45 days or more delinquent. This provision is illustrated as follows: Assume a borrower becomes delinquent on March 1, the amount due is not fully paid during the 45 days after March 1, and the servicer provides the written notice on the 45th day after March 1, which is April 15. Assume the borrower also fails to make the payment due on April 1 and the amount due is not fully paid during the 45 days after April 1. The servicer need not provide the written notice again until after the 180-day period beginning on April 15—<E T="03">i.e.,</E> no sooner than on October 12—and then only if the borrower is at that time 45 days or more delinquent.</P>
            <P>i. If the borrower is 45 days or more delinquent on October 12, the date that is 180 days after the prior provision of the written notice, the servicer is required to provide the written notice again on October 12.</P>

            <P>ii. If the borrower is less than 45 days delinquent on October 12, the servicer must again provide the written notice 45 days after the payment due date for which the borrower remains delinquent. For example, if the borrower becomes delinquent on October 1, and the amount due is not fully paid during the 45 days after October 1, the servicer will need to provide the written notice again no later than 45 days after October 1—<E T="03">i.e.,</E> by November 15.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Borrower's representative.</E> Comment 39(a)-5 explains how a servicer may satisfy the requirements under § 1024.39 with a person authorized by the borrower to communicate with the servicer on the borrower's behalf.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Relationship to § 1024.39(a).</E> The written notice required under § 1024.39(b)(1) must be provided even if the servicer provided information about loss mitigation and foreclosure previously during an oral communication with the borrower under § 1024.39(a).</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Servicing transfers.</E> A transferee servicer is required to comply with the requirements of § 1024.39(b) regardless of whether the transferor servicer provided a written notice to the borrower in the preceding 180-day period. However, a transferee servicer is not required to provide a written notice under § 1024.39(b) if the transferor servicer provided the written notice under § 1024.39(b) within 45 days of the transfer date. For example, assume a borrower has monthly payments, with a payment due on March 1. The transferor servicer provides the notice required by § 1024.39(b) on April 10. The loan is transferred on April 12. Assuming the borrower remains delinquent, the transferee servicer is not required to provide another written notice until 45 days after May 1, the first post-transfer payment due date—<E T="03">i.e.,</E> by June 15.</P>

            <P>3. <E T="03">Delivery.</E> A servicer may satisfy the requirement to provide the written notice by combining other notices that satisfy the content requirements of § 1024.39(b)(2) into a single mailing, provided each of the statements required by § 1024.39(b)(2) satisfies the clear and conspicuous standard in § 1024.32(a)(1).</P>

            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Number of examples.</E> Section 1024.39(b)(2)(iii) does not require that a specific number of examples be disclosed, but borrowers are likely to benefit from examples of options that would permit them to retain ownership of their home and examples of options that may require borrowers to end their ownership to avoid foreclosure. The servicer may include a generic list of loss mitigation options that it offers to borrowers. The servicer may include a statement that not all borrowers will qualify for the listed options.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Brief description.</E> An example of a loss mitigation option may be described in one or more sentences. If a servicer offers a loss mitigation option comprising several loss mitigation programs, the servicer may provide a generic description of the option without providing detailed descriptions of each program. For example, if the servicer offers several loan modification programs, the servicer may provide a generic description of “loan modification.”</P>

            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Explanation of how the borrower may obtain more information about loss mitigation options.</E> A servicer may comply with § 1024.39(b)(2)(iv) by directing the borrower to contact the servicer for more detailed information on how to apply for loss mitigation options. For example, a general statement such as, “contact us for instructions on how to apply” would satisfy the requirement to inform the borrower how to obtain more information about loss mitigation options. However, to expedite the borrower's timely application for any loss mitigation options, <PRTPAGE P="712"/>servicers may provide more detailed instructions, such as by listing representative documents the borrower should make available to the servicer (such as tax filings or income statements), and an estimate of how quickly the servicer expects to evaluate a completed application and make a decision on loss mitigation options. Servicers may also supplement the written notice required by § 1024.39(b)(1) with a loss mitigation application form.</P>

In general, bankruptcy counsel is the borrower's representative. A servicer's procedures for determining whether counsel is the borrower's representative are generally considered reasonable if they are limited to, for example, confirming that the attorney's name is listed on the borrower's bankruptcy petition or other court filing.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Adapting requirements in bankruptcy.</E> Section 1024.39(c) does not require a servicer to communicate with a borrower in a manner that would be inconsistent with applicable bankruptcy law or a court order in a bankruptcy case.

            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Delinquent borrower.</E> A borrower is not considered delinquent if the borrower has refinanced the mortgage loan, paid off the mortgage loan, brought the mortgage loan current by paying all amounts owed in arrears, or if title to the borrower's property has been transferred to a new owner through, for example, a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, a sale of the borrower's property, including, as applicable, a short sale, or a foreclosure sale. For purposes of responding to a borrower's inquiries and assisting a borrower with loss mitigation options, the term “borrower” includes a person authorized by the borrower to act on the borrower's behalf. A servicer may undertake reasonable procedures to determine if a person that claims to be an agent of a borrower has authority from the borrower to act on the borrower's behalf, for example by requiring that a person who claims to be an agent of the borrower provide documentation from the borrower stating that the purported agent is acting on the borrower's behalf.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Assignment of personnel.</E> A servicer has discretion to determine whether to assign a single person or a team of personnel to respond to a delinquent borrower. The personnel a servicer assigns to the borrower as described in § 1024.40(a)(1) may be single-purpose or multi-purpose personnel. Single-purpose personnel are personnel whose primary responsibility is to respond to a delinquent borrower's inquiries, and as applicable, assist the borrower with available loss mitigation options. Multi-purpose personnel can be personnel that do not have a primary responsibility at all, or personnel for whom responding to a delinquent borrower's inquiries, and as applicable, assisting the borrower with available loss mitigation options is not the personnel's primary responsibility. If the delinquent borrower files for bankruptcy, a servicer may assign personnel with specialized knowledge in bankruptcy law to assist the borrower.</P>

If a servicer receives a loss mitigation application from a potential successor in interest before confirming that person's identity and ownership interest in the property, the servicer may, but need not, review and evaluate the loss mitigation application in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 1024.41. If a servicer complies with the requirements of § 1024.41 for a complete loss mitigation application submitted by a potential successor in interest before confirming that person's identity and ownership interest in the property, § 1024.41(i)'s limitation on duplicative requests applies to that person, provided the servicer's evaluation of loss mitigation options available to the person would not have resulted in a different determination due to the person's confirmation as a successor in interest if it had been conducted after the servicer confirmed the person's status as a successor in interest.</P>

            <P>ii. If a servicer receives a loss mitigation application from a potential successor in interest and elects not to review and evaluate the loss mitigation application before confirming that person's identity and ownership interest in the property, the servicer must preserve the loss mitigation application and all documents submitted in connection with the application, and, upon such confirmation, the servicer must review and evaluate the loss mitigation application in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 1024.41 if the property is the confirmed successor in interest's principal residence and the procedures set forth in § 1024.41 are otherwise applicable. For purposes of § 1024.41, the servicer must treat the loss mitigation application as if it had been received on the date that the servicer confirmed the successor in interest's status. If the loss mitigation application is incomplete at the time of confirmation because documents submitted by the successor in interest became stale or invalid after they were submitted and confirmation is 45 days or more before a foreclosure sale, <PRTPAGE P="714"/>the servicer must identify the stale or invalid documents that need to be updated in a notice pursuant to § 1024.41(b)(2).</P>

            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">In general.</E> A servicer has flexibility to establish its own application requirements and to decide the type and amount of information it will require from borrowers applying for loss mitigation options. In the course of gathering documents and information from a borrower to complete a loss mitigation application, a servicer may stop collecting documents and information for a particular loss mitigation option after receiving information confirming that, pursuant to any requirements established by the owner or assignee of the borrower's mortgage loan, the borrower is ineligible for that option. A servicer may not stop collecting documents and information for any loss mitigation option based solely upon the borrower's stated preference but may stop collecting documents and information for any loss mitigation option based on the borrower's stated preference in conjunction with other information, as prescribed by any requirements established by the owner or assignee. A servicer must continue to exercise reasonable diligence to obtain documents and information from the borrower that the servicer requires to evaluate the borrower as to all other loss mitigation options available to the borrower. For example:</P>
            <P>i. Assume a particular loss mitigation option is only available for borrowers whose mortgage loans were originated before a specific date. Once a servicer receives documents or information confirming that a mortgage loan was originated after that date, the servicer may stop collecting documents or information from the borrower that the servicer would use to evaluate the borrower for that loss mitigation option, but the servicer must continue its efforts to obtain documents and information from the borrower that the servicer requires to evaluate the borrower for all other available loss mitigation options.</P>
            <P>ii. Assume applicable requirements established by the owner or assignee of the mortgage loan provide that a borrower is ineligible for home retention loss mitigation options if the borrower states a preference for a short sale and provides evidence of another applicable hardship, such as military Permanent Change of Station orders or an employment transfer more than 50 miles away. If the borrower indicates a preference for a short sale or, more generally, not to retain the property, the servicer may not stop collecting documents and information from the borrower pertaining to available home retention options solely because the borrower has indicated such a preference, but the servicer may stop collecting such documents and information once the servicer receives information confirming that the borrower has an applicable hardship under requirements established by the owner or assignee, such as military Permanent Change of Station orders or employment transfer.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">When an inquiry or prequalification request becomes an application.</E> A servicer is encouraged to provide borrowers with information about loss mitigation programs. If in giving information to the borrower, the borrower expresses an interest in applying for a loss mitigation option and provides information the servicer would evaluate in connection with a loss mitigation application, the borrower's inquiry or prequalification request has become a loss mitigation application. A loss mitigation application is considered expansively and includes any “prequalification” for a loss mitigation option. For example, if a borrower requests that a servicer determine if the borrower is “prequalified” for a loss mitigation program by evaluating the borrower against preliminary criteria to determine eligibility for a loss mitigation option, the request constitutes a loss mitigation application.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Examples of inquiries that are not applications.</E> The following examples illustrate situations in which only an inquiry has taken place and no loss mitigation application has been submitted:</P>
            <P>i. A borrower calls to ask about loss mitigation options and servicer personnel explain the loss mitigation options available to the borrower and the criteria for determining the borrower's eligibility for any such loss mitigation option. The borrower does not, however, provide any information that a servicer would consider for evaluating a loss mitigation application.</P>
            <P>ii. A borrower calls to ask about the process for applying for a loss mitigation option but the borrower does not provide any information that a servicer would consider for evaluating a loss mitigation application.</P>
            <P>4. Although a servicer has flexibility to establish its own requirements regarding the documents and information necessary for a loss mitigation application, the servicer must act with reasonable diligence to collect information needed to complete the application. A servicer must request information necessary to make a loss mitigation application complete promptly after receiving the loss mitigation application. Reasonable diligence for purposes of § 1024.41(b)(1) includes, without limitation, the following actions:</P>
            <P>i. A servicer requires additional information from the applicant, such as an address or a telephone number to verify employment; the servicer contacts the applicant promptly to obtain such information after receiving a loss mitigation application;</P>

            <P>ii. Servicing for a mortgage loan is transferred to a servicer and the borrower makes an incomplete loss mitigation application to the transferee servicer after the transfer; the <PRTPAGE P="715"/>transferee servicer reviews documents provided by the transferor servicer to determine if information required to make the loss mitigation application complete is contained within documents transferred by the transferor servicer to the servicer; and</P>
            <P>iii. A servicer offers a borrower a short-term payment forbearance program or a short-term repayment plan based on an evaluation of an incomplete loss mitigation application and provides the borrower the written notice pursuant to § 1024.41(c)(2)(iii). If the borrower remains in compliance with the short-term payment forbearance program or short-term repayment plan, and the borrower does not request further assistance, the servicer may suspend reasonable diligence efforts until near the end of the payment forbearance program or repayment plan. However, if the borrower fails to comply with the program or plan or requests further assistance, the servicer must immediately resume reasonable diligence efforts. Near the end of a short-term payment forbearance program offered based on an evaluation of an incomplete loss mitigation application pursuant to § 1024.41(c)(2)(iii), and prior to the end of the forbearance period, if the borrower remains delinquent, a servicer must contact the borrower to determine if the borrower wishes to complete the loss mitigation application and proceed with a full loss mitigation evaluation.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Information not in the borrower's control.</E> A loss mitigation application is complete when a borrower provides all information required from the borrower notwithstanding that additional information may be required by a servicer that is not in the control of a borrower. For example, if a servicer requires a consumer report for a loss mitigation evaluation, a loss mitigation application is considered complete if a borrower has submitted all information required from the borrower without regard to whether a servicer has obtained a consumer report that a servicer has requested from a consumer reporting agency.</P>

            <P>1. <E T="03">Definition of “evaluation.”</E> The conduct of a servicer's evaluation with respect to any loss mitigation option is in the sole discretion of a servicer. A servicer meets the requirements of § 1024.41(c)(1)(i) if the servicer makes a determination regarding the borrower's eligibility for a loss mitigation program. Consistent with § 1024.41(a), because nothing in section 1024.41 should be construed to permit a borrower to enforce the terms of any agreement between a servicer <PRTPAGE P="716"/>and the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan, including with respect to the evaluation for, or provision of, any loss mitigation option, § 1024.41(c)(1) does not require that an evaluation meet any standard other than the discretion of the servicer.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Loss mitigation options available to a borrower.</E> The loss mitigation options available to a borrower are those options offered by an owner or assignee of the borrower's mortgage loan. Loss mitigation options administered by a servicer for an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan other than the owner or assignee of the borrower's mortgage loan are not available to the borrower solely because such options are administered by the servicer. For example:</P>
            <P>i. A servicer services mortgage loans for two different owners or assignees of mortgage loans. Those entities each have different loss mitigation programs. loss mitigation options not offered by the owner or assignee of the borrower's mortgage loan are not available to the borrower; or</P>
            <P>ii. The owner or assignee of a borrower's mortgage loan has established pilot programs, temporary programs, or programs that are limited by the number of participating borrowers. Such loss mitigation options are available to a borrower. However, a servicer evaluates whether a borrower is eligible for any such program consistent with criteria established by an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan. For example, if an owner or assignee has limited a pilot program to a certain geographic area or to a limited number of participants, and the servicer determines that a borrower is not eligible based on any such requirement, the servicer shall inform the borrower that the investor requirement for the program is the basis for the denial.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Offer of a non-home retention option.</E> A servicer's offer of a non-home retention option may be conditional upon receipt of further information not in the borrower's possession and necessary to establish the parameters of a servicer's offer. For example, a servicer complies with the requirement for evaluating the borrower for a short sale option if the servicer offers the borrower the opportunity to enter into a listing or marketing period agreement but indicates that specifics of an acceptable short sale transaction may be subject to further information obtained from an appraisal or title search.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Other notices.</E> A servicer may combine other notices required by applicable law, including, without limitation, a notice with respect to an adverse action required by Regulation B, 12 CFR part 1002, or a notice required pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, with the notice required pursuant to § 1024.41(c)(1), unless otherwise prohibited by applicable law.</P>

            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Offer of a loss mitigation option without an evaluation of a loss mitigation application.</E> Nothing in § 1024.41(c)(2)(i) prohibits a servicer from offering loss mitigation options to a borrower who has not submitted a loss mitigation application. Further, nothing in § 1024.41(c)(2)(i) prohibits a servicer from offering a loss mitigation option to a borrower who has submitted an incomplete loss mitigation application where the offer of the loss mitigation option is not based on any evaluation of information submitted by the borrower in connection with such loss mitigation application. For example, if a servicer offers trial loan modification programs to all borrowers who become 150 days delinquent without an application or consideration of any information provided by a borrower in connection with a loss mitigation application, the servicer's offer of any such program does not violate § 1024.41(c)(2)(i), and a servicer is not required to comply with § 1024.41 with respect to any such program, because the offer of the loss mitigation option is not based on an evaluation of a loss mitigation application.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">2. Servicer discretion.</E> Although a review of a borrower's incomplete loss mitigation application is within a servicer's discretion, and is not required by § 1024.41, a servicer may be required separately, in accordance with policies and procedures maintained pursuant to § 1024.38(b)(2)(v), to properly evaluate a borrower who submits an application for a loss mitigation option for all loss mitigation options available to the borrower pursuant to any requirements established by the owner or assignee of the borrower's mortgage loan.

For purposes of § 1024.41(c)(2)(iii), a payment forbearance program is a loss mitigation option pursuant to which a servicer allows a borrower to forgo making certain payments or portions of payments for a period of time. A short-term payment forbearance program for purposes of § 1024.41(c)(2)(iii) allows the forbearance of <PRTPAGE P="717"/>payments due over periods of no more than six months. Such a program would be short-term regardless of the amount of time a servicer allows the borrower to make up the missing payments.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Short-term loss mitigation options and incomplete applications.</E> Section 1024.41(c)(2)(iii) allows a servicer to offer a borrower a short-term payment forbearance program or a short-term repayment plan based on an evaluation of an incomplete loss mitigation application. The servicer must still comply with the other requirements of § 1024.41 with respect to the incomplete loss mitigation application, including the requirement in § 1024.41(b)(2) to review the application to determine if it is complete, the requirement in § 1024.41(b)(1) to exercise reasonable diligence in obtaining documents and information to complete a loss mitigation application (<E T="03">see</E> comment 41(b)(1)-4.iii), and the requirement in § 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) to provide the borrower with written notice that the servicer acknowledges the receipt of the application and has determined that the application is incomplete.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Short-term loss mitigation options and complete applications.</E> Even if a servicer offers a borrower a short-term payment forbearance program or a short-term repayment plan based on an evaluation of an incomplete loss mitigation application, the servicer must still comply with all applicable requirements in § 1024.41 if the borrower completes a loss mitigation application.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Short-term repayment plan.</E> The exemption in § 1024.41(c)(2)(iii) applies to, among other things, short-term repayment plans. For purposes of § 1024.41(c)(2)(iii), a repayment plan is a loss mitigation option with terms under which a borrower would repay all past due payments over a specified period of time to bring the mortgage loan account current. A short-term repayment plan for purposes of § 1024.41(c)(2)(iii) allows for the repayment of no more than three months of past due payments and allows a borrower to repay the arrearage over a period lasting no more than six months.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Specific payment terms and duration.</E> i. <E T="03">General requirement.</E> Section 1024.41(c)(2)(iii) requires a servicer to provide the borrower a written notice stating, among other things, the specific payment terms and duration of a short-term payment forbearance program or a short-term repayment plan offered based on an evaluation of an incomplete application. Generally, a servicer complies with these requirements if the written notice states the amount of each payment due during the program or plan, the date by which the borrower must make each payment, and whether the mortgage loan will be current at the end of the program or plan if the borrower complies with the program or plan.</P>
            <P>ii. <E T="03">Disclosure of payment amounts that may change.</E> At the time a servicer provides the written notice pursuant to § 1024.41(c)(2)(iii), if the servicer lacks information necessary to determine the amount of a specific payment due during the program or plan (for example, because the borrower's interest rate will change to an unknown rate based on an index or because an escrow account computation year as defined in § 1024.17(b) will end and the borrower's escrow payment might change), the servicer complies with the requirement to disclose the specific payment terms and duration of a short-term payment forbearance program or short-term repayment plan if the disclosures are based on the best information reasonably available to the servicer at the time the notice is provided and the written notice identifies which payment amounts may change, states that such payment amounts are estimates, and states the general reason that such payment amounts might change. For example, if an escrow account computation year as defined in § 1024.17(b) will end during a borrower's short-term repayment plan, the written notice complies with § 1024.41(c)(2)(iii) if it identifies the payment amounts that may change, states that those payment amounts are estimates, and states that the affected payments might change because the borrower's escrow payment might change.</P>
            <P>6. <E T="03">Timing of notice.</E> Generally, a servicer acts promptly to provide the written notice required by § 1024.41(c)(2)(iii) if the servicer provides such written notice no later than five days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays) after offering the borrower a short-term payment forbearance program or short-term repayment plan. A servicer may provide the written notice at the same time the servicer offers the borrower the program or plan. A written offer that contains all the required elements of the written notice also satisfies § 1024.41(c)(2)(iii).</P>

            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Reasonable opportunity.</E> Section 1024.41(c)(2)(iv) requires a servicer to treat a facially complete application as complete for the purposes of paragraphs (f)(2) and (g) until the borrower has been given a reasonable opportunity to complete the application. A reasonable opportunity requires the servicer to notify the borrower of what additional information or corrected documents are required, and to afford the borrower sufficient time to gather the information and documentation necessary to complete the application and submit it to the servicer. The amount of time that is sufficient for this purpose will depend on the facts and circumstances.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Borrower fails to complete the application.</E> If the borrower fails to complete the application within the timeframe provided under § 1024.41(c)(2)(iv), the application shall be considered incomplete.</P>

            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Completion date.</E> A servicer complies with § 1024.41(c)(3)(i)(B) by disclosing on the notice the most recent date the servicer received the complete loss mitigation application. For example, assume that a borrower first submits a complete loss mitigation application on March 1. The servicer must disclose March 1 as the date the servicer received the application under § 1024.41(c)(3)(i)(B). Assume the servicer discovers on March 10 that it requires additional information or corrected documents to complete the application and promptly requests such additional information or documents from the borrower pursuant to § 1024.41(c)(2)(iv). If the borrower subsequently completes the application on March 21, the servicer must provide another notice in accordance with § 1024.41(c)(3)(i) and disclose March 21 as the date the servicer received the complete application. <E T="03">See</E> comment 41(c)(3)(i)-3.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">First notice or filing.</E> Section 1024.41(c)(3)(i)(D)(<E T="03">1</E>) and (<E T="03">2</E>) sets forth different requirements depending on whether the servicer has made the first notice or filing under applicable law for any judicial or non-judicial foreclosure process at the time the borrower submits a complete loss mitigation application. See comment 41(f)-1 for a description of whether a document is considered the first notice or filing under applicable law.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Additional notices.</E> Except as provided in § 1024.41(c)(3)(ii), § 1024.41(c)(3)(i) requires a servicer to provide a written notice every time a loss mitigation application becomes complete. For example, assume that a borrower first submits a complete loss mitigation application on March 1, and the servicer provides the notice under § 1024.41(c)(3)(i). Assume the servicer discovers on March 10 that it requires additional information or corrected documents regarding a source of income that the borrower previously identified. The servicer must promptly request such additional information or documents from the borrower pursuant to § 1024.41(c)(2)(iv). If the borrower subsequently completes the application on March 21, the servicer must provide another notice in accordance with § 1024.41(c)(3)(i), unless an exception applies under § 1024.41(c)(3)(ii). <E T="03">See</E> comment 41(c)(3)(i)-1.</P>

            <P>1. <E T="03">During the first 30 days following receipt of a complete loss mitigation application.</E> Section 1024.41(c)(4)(i) requires a servicer to act with reasonable diligence to obtain documents or information not in the borrower's control, which includes information in the servicer's control, that the servicer requires to determine which loss mitigation options, if any, it will offer to the borrower. At a minimum and without limitation, a servicer must request such documents or information from the appropriate party:</P>
            <P>i. Promptly upon determining that the servicer requires the documents or information to determine which loss mitigation options, if any, the servicer will offer the borrower; and</P>
            <P>ii. By a date that will enable the servicer to complete the evaluation within 30 days of receiving the complete loss mitigation application, as set forth in § 1024.41(c)(1), to the extent practicable.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">More than 30 days following receipt of a complete loss mitigation application.</E> If a servicer has not, within 30 days of receiving a complete loss mitigation application, received the required documents or information from a party other than the borrower or the servicer, the servicer acts with reasonable diligence pursuant to § 1024.41(c)(4)(i) by heightening efforts to obtain the documents or information promptly, to minimize delay in making a determination of which loss mitigation options, if any, it will offer to the borrower. Such heightened efforts include, for example, promptly verifying that it has contacted the appropriate party and determining whether it should obtain the required documents or information from a different party.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">41(c)(4)(ii) Effect in case of delay.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Third-party delay.</E> Notwithstanding delay in receiving required documents or information from any party other than the borrower or the servicer, § 1024.41(c)(1)(i) requires a servicer to complete all possible steps in the process of evaluating a complete loss mitigation application within 30 days of receiving the complete loss mitigation application. Such steps may include requirements imposed on the servicer by third parties, such as mortgage insurance companies, guarantors, owners, or assignees. For example, if a servicer can determine a borrower's eligibility for all available loss mitigation options based on an evaluation of the borrower's complete loss mitigation application subject only to approval from the mortgage insurance company, § 1024.41(c)(1)(i) requires the servicer to do so within 30 days of receiving the complete loss mitigation application notwithstanding the need to obtain such approval before offering the borrower any loss mitigation options.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Offers not prohibited.</E> Section 1024.41(c)(4)(ii)(A)(<E T="03">2</E>) permits a servicer to deny a complete loss mitigation application (in accordance with applicable investor requirements) if, after exercising reasonable diligence to obtain the required documents or information from a party other than the borrower or the servicer, the servicer has been unable to obtain such documents or information for a significant period of time and the servicer cannot complete its determination without the required documents or information. Section 1024.41(c)(4)(ii)(A)(<E T="03">2</E>) <PRTPAGE P="719"/>does not require a servicer to deny a complete loss mitigation application and permits a servicer to offer a borrower a loss mitigation option, even if the servicer does not obtain the requested documents or information.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">41(d) Denial of loan modification options.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Investor requirements.</E> If a trial or permanent loan modification option is denied because of a requirement of an owner or assignee of a mortgage loan, the specific reasons in the notice provided to the borrower must identify the owner or assignee of the mortgage loan and the requirement that is the basis of the denial. A statement that the denial of a loan modification option is based on an investor requirement, without additional information specifically identifying the relevant investor or guarantor and the specific applicable requirement, is insufficient. However, where an owner or assignee has established an evaluation criteria that sets an order ranking for evaluation of loan modification options (commonly known as a waterfall) and a borrower has qualified for a particular loan modification option in the ranking established by the owner or assignee, it is sufficient for the servicer to inform the borrower, with respect to other loan modification options ranked below any such option offered to a borrower, that the investor's requirements include the use of such a ranking and that an offer of a loan modification option necessarily results in a denial for any other loan modification options below the option for which the borrower is eligible in the ranking.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Net present value calculation.</E> If a trial or permanent loan modification is denied because of a net present value calculation, the specific reasons in the notice provided to the borrower must include the inputs used in the net present value calculation.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Determination not to offer a loan modification option constitutes a denial.</E> A servicer's determination not to offer a borrower a loan modification available to the borrower constitutes a denial of the borrower for that loan modification option, notwithstanding whether a servicer offers a borrower a different loan modification option or other loss mitigation option.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Reasons listed.</E> A servicer is required to disclose the actual reason or reasons for the denial. If a servicer's systems establish a hierarchy of eligibility criteria and reach the first criterion that causes a denial but do not evaluate the borrower based on additional criteria, a servicer complies with the rule by providing only the reason or reasons with respect to which the borrower was actually evaluated and rejected as well as notification that the borrower was not evaluated on other criteria. A servicer is not required to determine or disclose whether a borrower would have been denied on the basis of additional criteria if such criteria were not actually considered.</P>

            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Prohibited activities.</E> Section 1024.41(f) prohibits a servicer from making the first notice or filing required by applicable law for any judicial or non-judicial foreclosure process under certain circumstances. Whether a document is considered the first notice or filing is determined on the basis of foreclosure procedure under the applicable State law.</P>
            <P>i. Where foreclosure procedure requires a court action or proceeding, a document is considered the first notice or filing if it is the earliest document required to be filed with a court or other judicial body to commence the action or proceeding (e.g., a complaint, petition, order to docket, or notice of hearing).</P>
            <P>ii. Where foreclosure procedure does not require an action or court proceeding, such as under a power of sale, a document is considered the first notice or filing if it is the earliest document required to be recorded or published to initiate the foreclosure process.</P>
            <P>iii. Where foreclosure procedure does not require any court filing or proceeding, and also does not require any document to be recorded or published, a document is considered the first notice or filing if it is the earliest document that establishes, sets, or schedules a date for the foreclosure sale.</P>
            <P>iv. A document provided to the borrower but not initially required to be filed, recorded, or published is not considered the first notice or filing on the sole basis that the document must later be included as an attachment accompanying another document that is required to be filed, recorded, or published to carry out a foreclosure.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">41(g) Prohibition on foreclosure sale.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Dispositive motion.</E> The prohibition on a servicer moving for judgment or order of sale includes making a dispositive motion for foreclosure judgment, such as a motion for default judgment, judgment on the pleadings, or summary judgment, which may directly result in a judgment of foreclosure or order of sale. A servicer that has made any such motion before receiving a complete loss mitigation application has not moved for a foreclosure judgment or order of sale if the servicer takes reasonable steps to avoid a ruling on such motion or issuance of such order prior to completing the procedures required by § 1024.41, notwithstanding whether any such action successfully avoids a ruling on a dispositive motion or issuance of an order of sale.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Proceeding with the foreclosure process.</E> Nothing in § 1024.41(g) prevents a servicer from proceeding with the foreclosure process, including any publication, arbitration, or mediation requirements established by applicable law, when the first notice or filing for a foreclosure proceeding occurred before <PRTPAGE P="720"/>a servicer receives a complete loss mitigation application so long as any such steps in the foreclosure process do not cause or directly result in the issuance of a foreclosure judgment or order of sale, or the conduct of a foreclosure sale, in violation of § 1024.41.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Interaction with foreclosure counsel.</E> The prohibitions in § 1024.41(g) against moving for judgment or order of sale or conducting a sale may require a servicer to act through foreclosure counsel retained by the servicer in a foreclosure proceeding. If a servicer has received a complete loss mitigation application, the servicer must instruct counsel promptly not to make a dispositive motion for foreclosure judgment or order of sale; where such a dispositive motion is pending, to avoid a ruling on the motion or issuance of an order of sale; and, where a sale is scheduled, to prevent conduct of a foreclosure sale, unless one of the conditions in § 1024.41(g)(1) through (3) is met. A servicer is not relieved of its obligations because foreclosure counsel's actions or inaction caused a violation.</P>
            <P>4. <E T="03">Loss mitigation applications submitted 37 days or less before foreclosure sale.</E> Although a servicer is not required to comply with the requirements in § 1024.41 with respect to a loss mitigation application submitted 37 days or less before a foreclosure sale, a servicer is required separately, in accordance with policies and procedures maintained pursuant to § 1024.38(b)(2)(v) to properly evaluate a borrower who submits an application for a loss mitigation option for all loss mitigation options available to the borrower pursuant to any requirements established by the owner or assignee of the borrower's mortgage loan. Such evaluation may be subject to requirements applicable to a review of a loss mitigation application submitted by a borrower 37 days or less before a foreclosure sale.</P>
            <P>5. <E T="03">Conducting a sale prohibited.</E> Section 1024.41(g) prohibits a servicer from conducting a foreclosure sale, even if a person other than the servicer administers or conducts the foreclosure sale proceedings. Where a foreclosure sale is scheduled, and none of the conditions under § 1024.41(g)(1) through (3) are applicable, conduct of the sale violates § 1024.41(g).</P>

            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Short sale listing period.</E> An agreement for a short sale transaction, or other similar loss mitigation option, typically includes marketing or listing periods during which a servicer will allow a borrower to market a short sale transaction. A borrower is deemed to be performing under an agreement on a short sale, or other similar loss mitigation option, during the term of a marketing or listing period.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Short sale agreement.</E> If a borrower has not obtained an approved short sale transaction at the end of any marketing or listing period, a servicer may determine that a borrower has failed to perform under an agreement on a loss mitigation option. An approved short sale transaction is a short sale transaction that has been approved by all relevant parties, including the servicer, other affected lienholders, or insurers, if applicable, and the servicer has received proof of funds or financing, unless circumstances otherwise indicate that an approved short sale transaction is not likely to occur.</P>

            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Applicability of loss mitigation protections.</E> Under § 1024.41(i), a servicer must comply with § 1024.41 with respect to a loss mitigation application unless the servicer has previously done so for a complete loss mitigation application submitted by the borrower and the borrower has been delinquent at all times since submitting the prior complete application. Thus, for example, if the borrower has previously submitted a complete loss mitigation application and the servicer complied fully with § 1024.41 for that application, but the borrower then ceased to be delinquent and later became delinquent again, the servicer again must comply with § 1024.41 for any subsequent loss mitigation application submitted by the borrower. When a servicer is required to comply with the requirements of § 1024.41 for such a subsequent loss mitigation application, the servicer must comply with all applicable requirements of § 1024.41. For example, in such a case, the servicer's provision of the notice of determination of which loss mitigation options, if any, it will offer to the borrower under § 1024.41(c)(1)(ii) regarding the borrower's prior complete loss mitigation application does not affect the servicer's obligations to provide a new notice of complete application under § 1024.41(c)(3)(i) regarding the borrower's subsequent complete loss mitigation application.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Servicing transfers.</E> Section 1024.41(i) provides that a servicer need not comply with § 1024.41 for a subsequent loss mitigation application from a borrower where certain conditions are met. A transferee servicer and a transferor servicer, however, are not the same servicer. Accordingly, a transferee servicer is required to comply with the applicable requirements of § 1024.41 upon receipt of a loss mitigation application from a borrower whose servicing the transferee servicer has obtained through a servicing transfer, even if the borrower previously received an <PRTPAGE P="721"/>evaluation of a complete loss mitigation application from the transferor servicer.</P>

            <P>1. <E T="03">Pending loss mitigation application.</E> For purposes of § 1024.41(k), a loss mitigation application is pending if it was subject to § 1024.41 and had not been fully resolved before the transfer date. For example, a loss mitigation application would not be considered pending if a transferor servicer had denied a borrower for all options and the borrower's time for making an appeal, if any, had expired prior to the transfer date, such that the transferor servicer had no continuing obligations under § 1024.41 with respect to the application. A pending application is considered a pending complete application if it was complete as of the transfer date under the transferor servicer's criteria for evaluating loss mitigation applications.</P>

In connection with a transfer, a transferor servicer must timely transfer, and a transferee servicer must obtain from the transferor servicer, documents and information submitted by a borrower in connection with a loss mitigation application, consistent with policies and procedures adopted pursuant to § 1024.38(b)(4). A transferee servicer must comply with the applicable requirements of § 1024.41 with respect to a loss mitigation application received as a result of a transfer, even if the transferor servicer was not required to comply with § 1024.41 with respect to that application (for example, because § 1024.41(i) precluded applicability of § 1024.41 with respect to the transferor servicer). If an application was not subject to § 1024.41 prior to a transfer, then for purposes of § 1024.41(b) and (c), a transferee servicer is considered to have received the loss mitigation application on the transfer date. Any such application is subject to the timeframes for compliance set forth in § 1024.41(k).</P>
            <P>ii. A transferee servicer must, in accordance with § 1024.41(b)(1), exercise reasonable diligence to complete a loss mitigation application, including a facially complete application, received as a result of a transfer. In the transfer context, reasonable diligence includes ensuring that a borrower is informed of any changes to the application process, such as a change in the address to which the borrower should submit documents and information to complete the application, as well as ensuring that the borrower is informed about which documents and information are necessary to complete the application.</P>
            <P>iii. A borrower may provide documents and information necessary to complete an application to a transferor servicer after the transfer date. Consistent with policies and procedures maintained pursuant to § 1024.38(b)(4), the transferor servicer must timely transfer, and the transferee servicer must obtain, such documents and information.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Determination of rights and protections.</E> For purposes of § 1024.41(c) through (h), a transferee servicer must consider documents and information that constitute a complete loss mitigation application for the transferee servicer to have been received as of the date such documents and information were received by the transferor servicer, even if such documents and information were received by the transferor servicer after the transfer date. <E T="03">See</E> comment 41(k)(1)(i)-1.iii. An application that was facially complete under § 1024.41(c)(2)(iv) with respect to the transferor servicer remains facially complete under § 1024.41(c)(2)(iv) with respect to the transferee servicer as of the date it was facially complete with respect to the transferor servicer. If an application was complete with respect to the transferor servicer, but is not complete with respect to the transferee servicer, the transferee servicer must treat the application as facially complete under § 1024.41(c)(2)(iv) as of the date the application was complete with respect to the transferor servicer.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Duplicative notices not required.</E> A transferee servicer is not required to provide notices under § 1024.41 with respect to a particular loss mitigation application that the transferor servicer provided prior to the transfer. For example, if the transferor servicer provided the notice required by § 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) prior to the transfer, the transferee servicer is not required to provide the notice again for that application.</P>

              <E T="03">41(k)(1)(ii) Transfer date defined.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Transfer date.</E> Section 1024.41(k)(1)(ii) provides that the transfer date is the date on which the transferee servicer will begin accepting payments relating to the mortgage loan, as disclosed on the notice of transfer of loan servicing pursuant to § 1024.33(b)(4)(iv). The transfer date is the same date as that on which the transfer of the servicing responsibilities from the transferor servicer to the transferee servicer occurs. The transfer date is not necessarily the same date as either the effective date of the transfer of servicing as disclosed on the notice of transfer of loan servicing pursuant to § 1024.33(b)(4)(i) or the sale date identified in a servicing transfer agreement.</P>

            <P>
              <E T="03">41(k)(2)(ii) Prohibitions.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Examples of prohibitions.</E> Section 1024.41(k)(2)(ii)(A) and (B) adjusts the timeframes for certain borrower rights and foreclosure protections where § 1024.41(k)(2)(i) applies. These provisions are illustrated as follows: Assume a transferor servicer receives a borrower's initial loss mitigation application on October 1, and the loan is transferred five <PRTPAGE P="722"/>days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, or Sundays) later, on October 8. Assume that Columbus Day, a legal public holiday, occurs on October 14, and the transferee servicer provides the notice required by § 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) 10 days (excluding legal public holidays, Saturdays, or Sundays) after the transfer date, on October 23. Assume the transferee servicer discloses a 30-day reasonable date, November 22, under § 1024.41(b)(2)(ii).</P>
            <P>i. If the transferor servicer receives the borrower's initial loss mitigation application when the borrower's mortgage loan is 101 days delinquent, the borrower's mortgage loan would be 123 days delinquent on October 23, the date the transferee servicer provides the notice required by § 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B). Pursuant to § 1024.41(k)(2)(ii)(A), the transferee servicer cannot make the first notice or filing required by applicable law for any judicial or non-judicial foreclosure process until after November 22, the reasonable date disclosed under § 1024.41(b)(2)(ii), and then only if the borrower has not submitted a complete application by that date.</P>
            <P>ii. If the transferor servicer receives the borrower's initial loss mitigation application 55 days before the foreclosure sale, the date that the transferee servicer provides the notice required by § 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B), October 23, is 33 days before the foreclosure sale. Pursuant to § 1024.41(k)(2)(ii)(B), the transferee servicer must comply with § 1024.41(c), (d), and (g) if the borrower submits a complete loss mitigation application on or before November 22, the reasonable date disclosed under § 1024.41(b)(2)(ii).</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Applicability of loss mitigation provisions.</E> Section 1024.41(k)(2)(ii)(A) prohibits a servicer from making the first notice or filing required by applicable law for any judicial or non-judicial foreclosure process until a date that is after the reasonable date disclosed to the borrower pursuant to § 1024.41(b)(2)(ii), notwithstanding § 1024.41(f)(1). Section 1024.41(k)(2)(ii)(B) requires a servicer to comply with § 1024.41(c), (d), and (g) if a borrower submits a complete loss mitigation application on or before the reasonable date disclosed in the notice required by § 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B), even if the servicer would otherwise not be required to comply with § 1024.41(c), (d), and (g) because the application is submitted 37 days or fewer before a foreclosure sale. Section 1024.41(k)(2)(ii) provides additional protections for borrowers but does not remove any protections. Servicers remain subject to the requirements of § 1024.41 as applicable and so, for example, must comply with § 1024.41(h) if the servicer receives a complete loss mitigation application 90 days or more before a foreclosure sale. Similarly, a servicer is prohibited from making the first notice or filing before the borrower's mortgage loan obligation is more than 120 days delinquent, even if that is after the reasonable date disclosed to the borrower pursuant to § 1024.41(b)(2)(ii).</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Reasonable date when no milestones remain.</E> Generally, a servicer does not provide the notice required under § 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B) after the date that is 38 days before a foreclosure sale, so at least one milestone specified in comment 41(b)(ii)-1 always remains applicable. When § 1024.41(k)(2)(i) applies, however, the transferee servicer may sometimes provide the notice after the date that is 38 days before a foreclosure sale. When this occurs, the transferee servicer must determine the reasonable date when none of the four specified milestones remain. The other requirements of § 1024.41(b)(2)(ii) continue to apply. In this circumstance, a reasonable date may occur less than 30 days, but not less than seven days, after the date the transferee servicer provides the written notice pursuant to § 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B).</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">41(k)(3) Complete loss mitigation applications pending at transfer.</E>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Additional information or corrections to a previously submitted document.</E> If a transferee servicer acquires the servicing of a mortgage loan for which a complete loss mitigation application is pending as of the transfer date and the transferee servicer determines that additional information or a correction to a previously submitted document is required based upon its criteria for evaluating loss mitigation applications, the application is considered facially complete under § 1024.41(c)(2)(iv) as of the date it was first facially complete or complete, as applicable, with respect to the transferor servicer. Once the transferee servicer receives the information or corrections necessary to complete the application, § 1024.41(c)(3) requires the transferee servicer to provide a notice of complete application.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Applications first complete upon transfer.</E> If the borrower's loss mitigation application was incomplete based on the transferor servicer's criteria prior to transfer but is complete based upon the transferee servicer's criteria, the application is considered a pending loss mitigation application complete as of the transfer date for purposes of § 1024.41(k)(3). Consequently, the transferee servicer must comply with the applicable requirements of § 1024.41(c)(1) and (4) within 30 days of the transfer date. For purposes of § 1024.41(c) through (h), the application is complete as of the date the transferor servicer received the documents and information constituting the complete application. <E T="03">See</E> comment 41(k)(1)(i)-2. In such circumstances, § 1024.41(c)(3) requires the transferee servicer to provide a notice of complete application that discloses the date the transferor servicer received the documents and information constituting the complete application.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">41(k)(4) Applications subject to appeal process.</E>
              <PRTPAGE P="723"/>
            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Obtaining appeal.</E> A borrower may submit an appeal of a transferor servicer's determination pursuant to § 1024.41(h) to the transferor servicer after the transfer date. Consistent with policies and procedures maintained pursuant to § 1024.38(b)(4), the transferor servicer must timely transfer, and the transferee servicer must obtain, documents and information regarding such appeals.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Servicer unable to determine appeal.</E> A transferee servicer may be unable to make a determination on an appeal when, for example, the transferor servicer denied a borrower for a loan modification option that the transferee servicer does not offer or when the transferee servicer receives the mortgage loan through an involuntary transfer and the transferor servicer failed to maintain proper records such that the transferee servicer lacks sufficient information to review the appeal. In that circumstance, the transferee servicer is required to treat the appeal as a pending complete application, and it must permit the borrower to accept or reject any loss mitigation options offered by the transferor servicer, even if it does not offer the loss mitigation options offered by the transferor servicer, in addition to the loss mitigation options, if any, that the transferee servicer determines to offer the borrower based on its own evaluation of the borrower's complete loss mitigation application. For example, assume a transferor servicer denied a borrower for all loan modification options but offered the borrower a short sale option, and assume that the borrower's appeal of the loan modification denial was pending as of the transfer date. If the transferee servicer is unable to determine the borrower's appeal, the transferee servicer must evaluate the borrower for all available loss mitigation options in accordance with § 1024.41(c) and (k)(3). At the conclusion of such evaluation, the transferee servicer must permit the borrower to accept the short sale option offered by the transferor servicer, even if the transferee servicer does not offer the short sale option, in addition to any loss mitigation options the transferee servicer determines to offer the borrower based upon its own evaluation.</P>

            </P>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Obtaining evidence of borrower acceptance.</E> A borrower may provide an acceptance or rejection of a pending loss mitigation offer to a transferor servicer after the transfer date. Consistent with policies and procedures maintained pursuant to § 1024.38(b)(4), the transferor servicer must timely transfer, and the transferee servicer must obtain, documents and information regarding such acceptances and rejections, and the transferee servicer must provide the borrower with any timely accepted loss mitigation option, even if the borrower submitted the acceptance to the transferor servicer.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Appendix MS to Part 1024—Mortgage Servicing Model Forms and Clauses</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">In general.</E> This appendix contains model forms and clauses for mortgage servicing disclosures required by §§ 1024.33, 37, and 39. Each of the model forms is designated for uses in a particular set of circumstances as indicated by the title of that model form or clause. Although use of the model forms and clauses is not required, servicers using them appropriately will be in compliance with disclosure requirements of §§ 1024.33, 37, and 39. To use the forms appropriately, information required by regulation must be set forth in the disclosures.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Permissible changes.</E> Servicers may make certain changes to the format or content of the forms and clauses and may delete any disclosures that are inapplicable without losing the protection from liability so long as those changes do not affect the substance, clarity, or meaningful sequence of the forms and clauses. Servicers making revisions to that effect will lose their protection from civil liability. Except as otherwise specifically required, acceptable changes include, for example:</P>
            <P>i. Use of “borrower” and “servicer” instead of pronouns.</P>
            <P>ii. Substitution of the words “lender” and “servicer” for each other.</P>
            <P>iii. Addition of graphics or icons, such as the servicer's corporate logo.</P>
            <P>iv. Modifications to remove language that could suggest liability under the mortgage loan agreement if such language is not applicable. For example, in the case of a confirmed successor in interest who has not assumed the mortgage loan obligation under State law and is not otherwise liable on the mortgage loan obligation, this could include:</P>
            <P>A. Use of “the mortgage loan” or “this mortgage loan” instead of “your mortgage loan” and “the monthly payments” instead of “your monthly payments.”</P>
            <P>B. Use of “Payments due on or after [Date] may be sent to” instead of “Send all payments due on or after [Date] to” in notices of transfer.</P>
            <P>C. Use of “We will charge the loan account” instead of “You must pay us” in notices relating to force-placed insurance.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Appendix MS-3—Model Force-Placed Insurance Notice Forms</HD>
            <P>1. Where the model forms MS-3(A), MS-3(B), MS-3(C), and MS-3(D) use the term “hazard insurance,” the servicer may substitute “hazard insurance” with “homeowners' insurance” or “property insurance.”</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">Appendix MS-4—Model Clauses for the Written Early Intervention Notice</HD>
            <P>1. <E T="03">Model MS-4(A).</E> These model clauses illustrate how a servicer may provide its contact information, how a servicer may request <PRTPAGE P="724"/>that the borrower contact the servicer, and how the servicer may inform the borrower how to obtain additional information about loss mitigation options, as required by § 1024.39(b)(2)(i), (ii), and (iv).</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Model MS-4(B).</E> These model clauses illustrate how the servicer may inform the borrower of loss mitigation options that may be available, as required by § 1024.39(b)(2)(iii), if applicable. A servicer may include clauses describing particular loss mitigation options to the extent such options are available. Model MS-4(B) does not contain sample clauses for all loss mitigation options that may be available. The language in the model clauses contained in square brackets is optional; a servicer may comply with the disclosure requirements of § 1024.39(b)(2)(iii) by using language substantially similar to the language in the model clauses, providing additional detail about the options, or by adding or substituting applicable loss mitigation options for options not represented in these model clauses, provided the information disclosed is accurate and clear and conspicuous.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Model MS-4(C).</E> These model clauses illustrate how a servicer may provide contact information for housing counselors, as required by § 1024.39(b)(2)(v). A servicer may, at its option, provide the Web site and telephone number for either the Bureau's or the Department of Housing and Urban Development's housing counselors list, as provided by paragraphs § 1024.39(b)(2)(v).</P>
