      Explanation
      The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
      Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
      
        Title 1 through Title 16 
        as of January 1
        Title 17 through Title 27 
        as of April 1
        Title 28 through Title 41 
        as of July 1
        Title 42 through Title 50 
        as of October 1
      
      The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.
      
        LEGAL STATUS
        The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).
      
      
        HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
        The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
        To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.
      
      
        EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
        Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.
      
      
        OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

        The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.
      
      
        PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
        Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.
      
      
        “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
        The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.
      
      
        INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
        
          What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
        
          What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
        (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
        (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
        (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
        
          What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.
      
      
        CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

        A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
        
        An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
        The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
        A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.
      
      
        REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

          Subpart A—General Provisions
          
            § 0.101
            Purpose.
            The regulations in this part prescribe procedures and standards of conduct that are appropriate to the particular functions and activities of the Department of the Treasury (Department).
          
          
            § 0.102
            Applicability.
            (a) Unless otherwise specified, the regulations in this part apply to all employees of the Department at all times, regardless of whether they are on duty or on leave, including leave without pay.
            (b) The regulations in this part may be supplemented by regulations, interpretive guidelines and procedures issued by the Department's offices and bureaus. The absence of a specific published rule of conduct covering an action or omission does not validate that action or omission nor indicate that the action or omission would not result in corrective or disciplinary action.
          
          
            § 0.103
            Other rules of conduct applicable to Department employees.

            (c) Any Treasury office which is now in existence or may hereafter be established, which is not specifically listed above and is not a subsidiary unit of a component of those listed above, shall be deemed a part of the Departmental Offices for the purpose of these regulations.
            (d) The head of each component is hereby authorized to substitute the official designated and change the address specified in the appendix to this subpart applicable to that component. Components may issue supplementary regulations applicable only to the component in question, which (except with respect to fee schedules) shall be consistent with these regulations. Persons interested in the records of a particular component should, therefore, also consult the Code of Federal Regulations for any rules or regulations promulgated specifically with respect to that component (see Appendices to this subpart for cross references). In the event of any actual or apparent inconsistency, these Departmental regulations shall govern.
            (e) Each component shall preserve all correspondence pertaining to the requests that it receives under this subpart, as well as copies of all requested records, until disposition or destruction is authorized pursuant to title 44 of the United States Code or the General Records Schedule 4.2 of the National Archives and Records Administration. Records that are identified as responsive to a request will not be disposed of or destroyed while they are the subject of a pending request, administrative appeal, or lawsuit under the FOIA.
            (f) Nothing in this subpart shall be construed to entitle any person, as of right, to any service or to the disclosure of any record to which such person is not entitled under the FOIA.
          
          
            § 1.1
            Proactive disclosure of Department records.

            (a) Records that are required by the FOIA to be made available for public inspection in an electronic format may be accessed through the Department's website, http://www.treasury.gov, and/or on the website of the component that maintains such records. The FOIA office of each component is responsible for determining which of the component's records are required to be made publicly available, as well as identifying additional records of interest to the public that are appropriate for public disclosure, and for posting such records. Each component has a FOIA Public Liaison who can assist individuals in locating records particular to that component. A list of the Department's FOIA Public Liaisons is available at: https://home.treasury.gov/footer/freedom-of-information-act.
            
            (b) When a component receives three or more requests for the same records, it shall make available for public inspection in an electronic format, any records released in response to those requests.
          
          
            § 1.2
            Requirements for making requests.
            (a) General information. (1) Requests should be addressed to the FOIA office of the component that maintains the requested records. The appendices to this subpart list the addresses of each FOIA office and the methods for submitting requests to each component. Requesters are encouraged to submit requests online (through FOIA.gov, component web pages or by completing the “Submit an Online Request” form located at https://home.treasury.gov/footer/freedom-of-information-act.
              
            
            (2) When a requester is unable to determine the appropriate Departmental component to which to direct a request, the requester may send the request to Freedom of Information Act Request, Department of the Treasury, Departmental Offices (DO), Director, FOIA and Transparency, 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20220. The FOIA and Transparency team will forward the request to the component(s) that it determines to be most likely to maintain the records that are sought.
            (3) A requester who is making a request for records about himself or herself must comply with the verification of identity provision set forth in section 1.26 of subpart C of this part.

            (4) Where a request for records pertains to a third party, a requester may receive greater access by submitting either a notarized authorization signed by that individual or a declaration by that individual made in compliance with the requirements set forth in 28 U.S.C. 1746, authorizing disclosure of the records to the requester, or submitting proof that the individual is deceased (e.g., a copy of a death certificate). As an exercise of its administrative discretion, each component can require a requester to supply additional information, if necessary, in order to verify that a particular individual has consented to disclosure.
            (b) Description of records sought. Requesters must describe the records sought in sufficient detail to enable Department personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. To the extent possible, requesters should include specific information that may assist a component in identifying the requested records, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, subject matter of the record, case number, file designation, or reference number. Requesters should refer to the Appendices of this subpart for additional component-specific requirements. In general, requesters should include as much detail as possible about the specific records or the types of records that they are seeking. If the requester fails to reasonably describe the records sought, the component shall inform the requester what additional information is needed or why the request is deficient. Requesters who are attempting to reformulate or modify such a request may discuss their request with the component's designated FOIA contact or the FOIA Public Liaison. When a requester fails to provide sufficient detail after having been asked to clarify a request, the component shall notify the requester that the request has not been properly made and that the request will be administratively closed.
          
          
            § 1.3
            Responsibility for responding to requests.
            (a) In general. The component that first receives a request for a record and maintains that record is the component responsible for responding to the request. In determining which records are responsive to a request, a component ordinarily will include only records in its possession as of the date that it begins its search. If any other date is used, the component shall inform the requester of that date. A record that is excluded from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c), shall not be considered responsive to a request.
            (b) Authority to grant or deny requests. The head of a component, or designee, is authorized to grant or to deny any requests for records that are maintained by that component.
            (c) Re-routing of misdirected requests. When a component's FOIA office determines that a request was misdirected within the agency, the receiving component's FOIA office must route the request to the FOIA office of the proper component(s) within the agency.
            (d) Consultation, referral, and coordination. When reviewing records located by a component in response to a request, the component will determine whether another agency of the Federal Government is better able to determine whether the record is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA. As to any such record, the agency must proceed in one of the following ways:
            (1) Consultation. When records originated with the component processing the request, but contain within them information of interest to another agency or other Federal Government office, the agency processing the request should typically consult with that other entity prior to making a release determination.
            (2) Referral. (i) When the component processing the request believes that a different agency is best able to determine whether to disclose the record, the component typically should refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that record to that agency. Ordinarily, the agency that originated the record is presumed to be the best agency to make the disclosure determination. However, if the component processing the request is in the best position to respond regarding the record, then the record may be handled as a consultation.
            (ii) Whenever a component refers any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another agency, it must document the referral, maintain a copy of the record that it refers, and notify the requester of the referral, informing the requester of the name(s) of the agency to which the record was referred, including that agency's FOIA contact information.
            (3) Coordination. The standard referral procedure is not appropriate where disclosure of the identity of the agency to which the referral would be made could harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption, such as the exemptions that protect personal privacy or national security interests. For example, if a non-law enforcement agency responding to a request for records on a living third party locates within its files records originating with a law enforcement agency, and if the existence of that law enforcement interest in the third party was not publicly known, then to disclose that law enforcement interest could cause an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of the third party. Similarly, if an agency locates within its files material originating with an Intelligence Community agency, and the involvement of that agency in the matter is classified and not publicly acknowledged, then to disclose or give attribution to the involvement of that Intelligence Community agency could cause national security harms. In such instances, in order to avoid harm to an interest protected by an applicable exemption, the agency that received the request should coordinate with the originating agency to seek its views on the disclosability of the record. The release determination for the record that is the subject of the coordination should then be conveyed to the requester by the agency that originally received the request.
            (4) Timing of responses to consultations and referrals. All consultations and referrals will be handled according to the date that the FOIA request was initially received by the component or other agency of the Federal government.
            (5) Agreements regarding consultations and referrals. Components may establish agreements with other Treasury components or agencies of the Federal government to eliminate the need for consultations or referrals with respect to particular types of records.
            (e) Classified information. On receipt of any request involving classified information, the component shall take appropriate action to ensure compliance with part 2 of this title and with all other laws and regulations relating to proper handling of classified information. Whenever a request involves a record containing information that has been classified or may be appropriate for classification by another component or agency under any applicable executive order concerning the classification of records, the receiving component shall refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that information to the component or agency that classified the information, or that should consider the information for classification. Whenever a component's record contains information that has been derivatively classified, i.e., it contains information classified by another component or agency of the Federal government, the component shall refer the responsibility for responding to that portion of the request to the component or agency that classified the underlying information.
          
          
            § 1.4
            Responses to requests.
            (a) In general. Components ordinarily will respond to requests according to their order of receipt. The Appendices to this subpart contain the list of the Departmental components that are designated to accept requests. In instances involving misdirected requests, i.e., where a request is sent to one of the components designated in the Appendices but is actually seeking records maintained by another component, the response time will commence on the date that the request is received by the appropriate component, but in any event not later than ten working days after the request is first received.
            (b) Multitrack processing. All components must designate a specific track for requests that are granted expedited processing, in accordance with the standards set forth in paragraph (e) of this section. A component may also designate additional processing tracks that distinguish between simple and more complex requests based on the estimated amount of work or time needed to process the request. A component can consider factors such as the number of pages involved in processing the request or the need for consultations or referrals. Components shall advise requesters of the track into which their request falls and, when appropriate, shall offer the requesters an opportunity to narrow their request so that it can be placed in a different processing track.
            (c) Unusual circumstances. Whenever the statutory time limits for processing a request cannot be met because of “unusual circumstances,” as defined in the FOIA, and the component extends the time limits on that basis, the component shall, before expiration of the twenty-day period to respond, notify the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances involved and of the date by which processing of the request can be expected to be completed. Where the extension exceeds ten working days, the component shall, as described by the FOIA, provide the requester with an opportunity to modify the request or agree to an alternative time period for processing. The component shall make available its designated FOIA contact or its FOIA Public Liaison for this purpose. The component must also alert requesters to the availability of the Office of Government Information Services to provide dispute resolution services.
            (d) Aggregating requests. For the purposes of identifying unusual circumstances under the FOIA, components may aggregate requests in cases where it reasonably appears that multiple requests, submitted either by a requester or by a group of requesters acting in concert, constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances. Components will not aggregate multiple requests that involve unrelated matters.
            (e) Expedited processing. (1) Requests and appeals will be processed on an expedited basis only upon request and when it is determined that they involve:
            (i) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited processing could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual;
            (ii) An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal government activity, if made by a person who is primarily engaged in disseminating information. The standard of “urgency to inform” requires that the records requested pertain to a matter of current exigency to the public and that delaying a response to a request for records would compromise a significant recognized interest to and throughout the general public; or
            (iii) The loss of substantial due process rights.
            (2) A request for expedited processing may be made at any time. Requests must be submitted to the component that maintains the records requested. The time period for making the determination on the request for expedited processing under this section shall commence on the date that the component receives the request.
            (3) A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct, explaining in detail the basis for making the request for expedited processing. As a matter of administrative discretion, a component may waive the formal certification requirement.

            (4) A requester seeking expedited processing under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, who is not a full-time member of the news media must establish that he or she is a person whose primary professional activity or occupation is information dissemination. Such a requester also must establish a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request—one that extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally.
            (5) A component shall notify the requester within ten calendar days of the receipt of a request for expedited processing of its decision whether to grant or deny expedited processing. If expedited processing is granted, the request shall be given priority, placed in the processing track for expedited requests, and shall be processed as soon as practicable. If a component denies expedited processing, any appeal of that decision that complies with the procedures set forth in § 1.6 of this subpart shall be acted on expeditiously.
            (f) Acknowledgments of requests. Upon receipt of a request that will take longer than ten business days to process, a component shall send the requester an acknowledgment letter that assigns the request an individualized tracking number. The component shall also include in the acknowledgment a brief description of the records sought to allow requesters to more easily keep track of their requests.
            (g) Grants of requests. Once a component makes a determination to grant a request in full or in part, it shall notify the requester in writing. The component also shall inform the requester of any fees charged under § 1.7 of this subpart and shall disclose the requested records to the requester promptly upon payment of any applicable fees. The component must also inform the requester of the availability of the FOIA Public Liaison to offer assistance.
            (h) Adverse determinations of requests. A component making an adverse determination denying a request in any respect shall notify the requester of that determination in writing. Adverse determinations, or denials of requests, include decisions that: The requested record is exempt, in whole or in part; the request does not reasonably describe the records sought; the information requested is not a record subject to the FOIA; the requested record does not exist, cannot be located, or has been destroyed; or the requested record is not readily reproducible in the form or format sought by the requester. Adverse determinations also include denials involving fees or fee waiver matters, and denials of requests for expedited processing.
            (i) Content of denial letter. The denial letter shall be signed by the head of the component, or FOIA designee, and shall include, when applicable:
            (1) The name and title or position of the person responsible for the denial;
            (2) A brief statement of the reasons for the denial, including any FOIA exemption applied by the component in denying the request; and
            (3) An estimate of the volume of any records or information withheld, for example, by providing the number of pages or some other reasonable form of estimation. This estimation is not required if the volume is otherwise indicated by deletions marked on records that are disclosed in part, or if the estimate would cause a harm protected by one of the exemptions.
            (4) A statement that the denial may be appealed under § 1.6(a) of this subpart, and a description of the requirements set forth therein.
            (5) A statement notifying the requester of the assistance available from the component's FOIA Public Liaison and the dispute resolution services offered by the Office of Government Information Services.
            (j) Markings on released documents. Records disclosed in part must be marked clearly to show the amount of information deleted and the exemption under which the deletion was made unless doing so would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption. The location of the information deleted shall also be indicated on the record, if technically feasible.
            (k) Use of record exclusions. (1) In the event a component identifies records that may be subject to exclusion from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c), the component shall consult with the Department of Justice, Office of Information Policy (OIP), before applying the exclusion.
            (2) A component invoking an exclusion must maintain an administrative record of the process of invocation and of the consultation with OIP.
          
          
            § 1.5
            Confidential commercial information.
            (a) Definitions—(1) Confidential commercial information means trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained by the Department from a submitter that may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA.
            (2) Submitter means any person or entity from whom the Department obtains confidential commercial information, directly or indirectly.
            (3) Designation of confidential commercial information. A submitter of confidential commercial information must use good faith efforts to designate by appropriate markings, either at the time of submission or within a reasonable time thereafter, any portion of its submission that it considers to be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4. These designations will expire ten years after the date of the submission unless the submitter requests and provides justification for a longer designation period.
            (b) When notice to submitters is required. (1) A component shall promptly provide written notice to a submitter whenever:
            (i) The requested confidential commercial information has been designated in good faith by the submitter as information considered protected from disclosure under Exemption 4; or
            (ii) The component has a reason to believe that the requested confidential commercial information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA.
            (2) The notice shall either describe the confidential commercial information requested or include a copy of the requested records or portions of records containing the information. In cases involving a voluminous number of submitters, notice may be made by posting or publishing the notice in a place or manner reasonably likely to accomplish it.
            (c) Exceptions to submitter notice requirements. The notice requirements of this section shall not apply if:
            (1) The component determines that the confidential commercial information is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA;
            (2) The confidential commercial information lawfully has been published or has been officially made available to the public; or
            (3) Disclosure of the confidential commercial information is required by a statute other than the FOIA or by a regulation issued in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12600 of June 23, 1987;
            (d) Opportunity to object to disclosure. (1) A component will specify a reasonable time period as determined within its administrative discretion within which the submitter must respond to the notice referenced above. If a submitter has any objections to disclosure, it should provide the component a detailed written statement that specifies all grounds for withholding the particular confidential commercial information under any exemption of the FOIA. In order to rely on Exemption 4 as a basis for nondisclosure, the submitter must explain why the information constitutes a trade secret, or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential.
            (2) A submitter who fails to respond within the time period specified in the notice shall be considered to have no objection to disclosure of the information. An objection to disclosure received by the component after the time period specified in the notice will not be considered by the component. Any information provided by a submitter under this subpart may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA and/or protected from disclosure by applicable exemptions or by a statute other than the FOIA.
            (e) Analysis of objections. A component shall consider a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure in deciding whether to disclose the requested confidential commercial information.
            (f) Notice of intent to disclose. Whenever a component decides to disclose confidential commercial information over the objection of a submitter, the component shall provide the submitter written notice, which shall include:
            (1) A statement of the reasons why each of the submitter's disclosure objections was not sustained;
            (2) Copies of the records that the component intends to disclose or, in the alternative, a description of the confidential commercial information to be disclosed; and

            (3) A specified disclosure date, which shall be a reasonable time subsequent to the notice.
            
            (g) Notice of FOIA lawsuit. Whenever a requester files a lawsuit seeking to compel the disclosure of confidential commercial information, the component shall promptly notify the submitter.
            (h) Requester notification. The component shall notify a requester whenever it provides the submitter with notice and an opportunity to object to disclosure; whenever it notifies the submitter of its intent to disclose the requested confidential commercial information; and whenever a submitter files a lawsuit to prevent the disclosure of the confidential commercial information.
          
          
            § 1.6
            Administrative appeals.
            (a) Requirements for making an appeal. Before seeking review by a court of a component's adverse determination, a requester generally must first submit a timely administrative appeal. A requester may appeal any adverse determinations denying his or her request to the official specified in the appropriate appendix to this subpart. Examples of adverse determinations are provided in § 1.4(h) of this subpart. The requester must make the appeal in writing and to be considered timely it must be postmarked, or in the case of electronic submissions, transmitted, within 90 calendar days after the date of the component's final response. The appeal letter should clearly identify the component's determination that is being appealed and the assigned request number. The requester should mark both the appeal letter and envelope, or subject line of the electronic transmission, “Freedom of Information Act Appeal.”
            (b) Adjudication of appeals. (1) The FOIA appeal official or designee specified in the appropriate appendix will act on all appeals under this section.
            (2) An appeal ordinarily will not be adjudicated if the request becomes a matter of FOIA litigation.
            (3) On receipt of any appeal involving classified information, the FOIA appeal official or designee must take appropriate action to ensure compliance with applicable classification rules.
            (c) Decision on appeals. A decision on an appeal must be made in writing by the component within 20 business days after receipt of the appeal. A decision that upholds a component's determination must contain a statement that identifies the reasons for the affirmance, including any FOIA exemptions applied. The decision must provide the requester with notification of the statutory right to file a lawsuit and will inform the requester of the mediation services offered by the Office of Government Information Services of the National Archives and Records Administration as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If a component's decision is remanded or modified on appeal the requester will be notified of that determination in writing. The component will then further process the request in accordance with that appeal determination and respond directly to the requester. Appeals that have not been postmarked or transmitted within the specified time frame will be considered untimely and will be administratively closed with written notice to the requester.
            (d) Engaging in dispute resolution services provided by Office of Government Information Services (OGIS). Mediation is a voluntary process. If a component agrees to participate in the mediation services provided by OGIS, it will actively engage as a partner to the process in an attempt to resolve the dispute.
          
          
            § 1.7
            Fees.
            (a) In general. Components may charge for processing requests under the FOIA in accordance with the provisions of this section or may issue their own fee schedules as long as they are consistent with the OMB Guidelines. In order to resolve any fee issues that arise under this section, a component may contact a requester for additional information. A component ordinarily will collect all applicable fees before sending copies of records to a requester. Requesters must pay fees by check or money order made payable to the Treasury of the United States, or by other means specified at https://home.treasury.gov/footer/freedom-of-information-act.
            
            (b) Definitions. For purposes of this section:
            (1) Commercial-use request is a request for information for a use or a purpose that furthers a commercial, trade, or profit interest, which can include furthering those interests through litigation.
            (2) Direct costs are those expenses that a component expends in searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of commercial-use requests, reviewing) records in order to respond to a FOIA request. For example, direct costs include the salary of the employee performing the work (i.e., the basic rate of pay for the employee, plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating computers and other electronic equipment, such as photocopiers and scanners. Direct costs do not include overhead expenses such as the costs of space, and of heating or lighting a facility. Components shall ensure that searches, review, and duplication are conducted in the most efficient and the least expensive manner.
            (3) Duplication is reproducing a copy of a record or of the information contained in it, necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Copies can take the form of paper, audiovisual materials, or electronic records, among others.
            (4) Educational institution is any school that operates a program of scholarly research. A requester in this category must show that the request is made in connection with the requester's role at the educational institution. Components may seek assurance from the requester that the request is in furtherance of scholarly research and will advise requesters of their placement in this category.
            (5) Noncommercial scientific institution is an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis, as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. A requester in this category must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are sought to further scientific research and not for a commercial use.
            (6) Representative of the news media is any person or entity that actively gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations broadcasting news to the public at large and publishers of periodicals that disseminate “news” and make their products available through a variety of means to the general public. A request for records that supports the news-dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered to be for a commercial use. “Freelance” journalists who demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through a news media entity shall be considered as a representative of the news media. A publishing contract would provide the clearest evidence that publication is expected; however, components shall also consider a requester's past publication record in making this determination.
            (7) Other requester refers to a requester who does not fall within any of the previously described categories.
            (8) Review is the examination of a record located in response to a request in order to determine whether any portion of it is exempt from disclosure. Review time includes time spent processing any record for disclosure, such as doing all that is necessary to prepare the record for disclosure, including the process of redacting the record and marking the appropriate exemptions. Review time also includes time spent obtaining and considering any formal objection to disclosure made by a confidential commercial information submitter under § 1.5 of this subpart, but it does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions. Review costs are properly charged even if a record ultimately is not disclosed.
            (9) Search is the process of looking for and retrieving records or information responsive to a request. Search time includes time devoted to page-by-page or line-by-line identification of information within records; and the reasonable efforts expended to locate and retrieve information from electronic records.
            
            (c) Charging fees. Unless a component has issued a separate fee schedule, or a waiver or reduction of fees has been granted under paragraph (k) of this section, components shall charge the following fees. Because the fee amounts provided below already account for the direct costs associated with a given fee type, components should not add any additional costs to those charges.
            (1) Search. (i) Search fees shall be charged for all requests, subject to the restrictions of paragraph (d) of this section. Components will charge search fees for all other requesters, subject to the restrictions of paragraph (d) of this section. Components may properly charge for time spent searching even if they do not locate any responsive records or if they determine that the records are entirely exempt from disclosure.
            (ii) For each quarter hour spent by personnel searching for requested records, including electronic searches that do not require new programming, the fees shall be as follows: executive—$21; professional—$16.50; and administrative—$13.00.
            (iii) In addition, requesters will be charged the direct costs associated with the creation of any new computer program required to locate the requested records.
            (2) Duplication. Duplication fees will be charged to all requesters, subject to the restrictions of paragraph (d) of this section. A component shall honor a requester's preference for receiving a record in a particular form or format where it is readily reproducible by the component in the form or format requested. Where photocopies are supplied, the component will provide one copy per request at a cost of $0.15 per page. For copies of records produced on tapes, disks, other forms of duplication, or other electronic media, components will charge the direct costs of producing the copy, including operator time. Where paper documents must be scanned in order to comply with a requester's preference to receive the records in an electronic format, the requester shall pay the direct costs associated with scanning those materials, including operator's time. For other forms of duplication, components will charge the direct costs.
            (3) Review. Review fees will only be charged to requesters who make commercial-use requests. Review fees will be assessed in connection with the initial review of the record, i.e., the review conducted by a component to determine whether an exemption applies to a particular record or portion of a record. No charge will be made for review at the administrative appeal stage of exemptions applied at the initial review stage. However, when the appellate authority determines that a particular exemption no longer applies, any costs associated with a component's re-review of the records in order to consider the use of other exemptions may be assessed as review fees. Review costs are properly charged even if a record ultimately is not disclosed. Review fees will be charged at the same rates as those charged for a search under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.
            (d) Restrictions on charging fees. (1) No search fees will be charged for requests by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media (unless the records are sought for commercial use).
            (2) If a component fails to comply with the FOIA's time limits in which to respond to a request, it may not charge search fees, or, in the instances of requests from requesters described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, may not charge duplication fees, except as described in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section.
            (i) If a component has determined that unusual circumstances as defined by the FOIA apply and the agency provided timely written notice to the requester in accordance with the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limit shall be excused for an additional ten days.

            (ii) If a component has determined that unusual circumstances as defined by the FOIA apply, and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, the component may charge search fees, or, in the case of requesters described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, may charge duplication fees if the following steps are taken. The component must have provided timely written notice of unusual circumstances to the requester in accordance with the FOIA and the component must have discussed with the requester via written mail, email, or telephone (or made not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(ii). If this exception is satisfied, the component may charge all applicable fees incurred in the processing of the request.
            (iii) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist as defined in the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limits shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.
            (3) No search or review fees will be charged for a quarter-hour period unless more than half of that period is required for search or review.
            (4) Except for requesters seeking records for a commercial use, components will provide without charge:
            (i) The first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent for other media); and
            (ii) The first two hours of search.
            (5) When, after first deducting the 100 free pages (or its cost equivalent) and the first two hours of search, a total fee calculated under paragraph (c) of this section is $25.00 or less for any request, no fee will be charged.
            (e) Notice of anticipated fees in excess of $25.00. When a component determines or estimates that the fees to be assessed in accordance with this section will exceed $25.00, the component shall notify the requester of the actual or estimated amount of the fees, including a breakdown of the fees for search, review or duplication, unless the requester has indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. If only a portion of the fee can be estimated readily, the component shall advise the requester accordingly. In cases in which a requester has been notified that the actual or estimated fees are in excess of $25.00, the request shall not be considered received and further work will not be completed until the requester commits in writing to pay the actual or estimated total fee. Such a commitment must be made by the requester in writing, must indicate a given dollar amount the requester is willing to pay, and must be received by the component within 30 calendar days from the date of notification of the fee estimate. If a commitment is not received within this period, the requester shall be notified, in writing, that the request shall be closed. Components will inform the requester of their right to seek assistance from the appropriate component FOIA Public Liaison or other FOIA professional to assist the requester in reformulating request in an effort to reduce fees. Components are not required to accept payments in installments. If the requester has indicated a willingness to pay some designated amount of fees, but the component estimates that the total fee will exceed that amount, the component will toll the processing of the request when it notifies the requester of the estimated fees in excess of the amount the requester has indicated a willingness to pay. The Component will inquire whether the requester wishes to revise the amount of fees the requester is willing to pay or modify the request. Once the requester responds, the time to respond will resume from where it was at the date of the notification.
            (f) Charges for other services. Although not required to provide special services, if a component chooses to do so as a matter of administrative discretion, the direct costs of providing the service will be charged. Examples of such services include certifying that records are true copies, providing multiple copies of the same document, or sending records by means other than first class mail.
            (g) Charging interest. Components may charge interest on any unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the date of billing the requester. Interest charges will be assessed at the rate provided in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the billing date until payment is received by the component. Components will follow the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749), as amended, and its administrative procedures, including the use of consumer reporting agencies, collection agencies, and offset.
            
            (h) Aggregating requests. When a component reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requesters acting in concert is attempting to divide a single request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding fees, the component may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly. Components may presume that multiple requests of this type made within a 30-day period have been made in order to avoid fees. For requests separated by a longer period, components will aggregate them only where there is a reasonable basis for determining that aggregation is warranted in view of all the circumstances involved. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters will not be aggregated.
            (i) Advance payments. (1) For requests other than those described in paragraphs (i)(2) and (i)(3) of this section, a component shall not require the requester to make an advance payment before work is commenced or continued on a request. Payment owed for work already completed (i.e., payment before copies are sent to a requester) is not an advance payment.
            (2) When a component determines or estimates that a total fee to be charged under this section will exceed $250.00, it may require that the requester make an advance payment up to the amount of the entire anticipated fee before beginning to process the request. A component may elect to process the request prior to collecting fees when it receives a satisfactory assurance of full payment from a requester with a history of prompt payment.
            (3) Where a requester has previously failed to pay a properly charged FOIA fee to any component or agency within 30 calendar days of the billing date, a component may require that the requester pay the full amount due, plus any applicable interest on that prior request and the component may require that the requester make an advance payment of the full amount of any anticipated fee before the component begins to process a new request or continues to process a pending request, or any pending appeal. Where a component has a reasonable basis to believe that a requester has misrepresented his or her identity in order to avoid paying outstanding fees, it may require that the requester provide proof of identity.
            (4) In cases in which a component requires advance payment, the request shall not be considered received and further work will not be completed until the required payment is received. If the requester does not pay the advance payment within 30 calendar days after the date of the component's fee determination letter, the request will be closed.
            (j) Other statutes specifically providing for fees. The fee schedule of this section does not apply to fees charged under any statute that specifically requires an agency to set and collect fees for particular types of records. In instances where records responsive to a request are subject to a statutorily-based fee schedule program, the component will inform the requester of the contact information for that source.
            (k) Requirements for waiver or reduction of fees. (1) Requesters may seek a waiver of fees by submitting a written application demonstrating how disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.
            (2) A component must furnish records responsive to a request without charge or at a reduced rate when it determines, based on all available information, that disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. In deciding whether this standard is satisfied the component must consider the factors described in paragraphs (k)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section:
            (i) Disclosure of the requested information would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated.

            (ii) Disclosure of the requested information would be likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. This factor is satisfied when the following criteria are met:
            (A) Disclosure of the requested records must be meaningfully informative about government operations or activities. The disclosure of information that is already in the public domain, in either the same or a substantially identical form, would not be meaningfully informative if nothing new would be added to the public's understanding.
            (B) The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's expertise in the subject area as well as the requester's ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public must be considered. Components will presume that a representative of the news media will satisfy this consideration.
            (iii) The disclosure must not be primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. To determine whether disclosure of the requested information is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester, components will consider the following criteria:
            (A) Components must identify whether the requester has any commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. A commercial interest includes any commercial, trade, or profit interest. Requesters must be given an opportunity to provide explanatory information regarding this consideration.
            (B) If there is an identified commercial interest, the component must determine whether that is the primary interest furthered by the request. A waiver or reduction of fees is justified when the requirements of paragraphs (k)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section are satisfied and any commercial interest is not the primary interest furthered by the request. Components ordinarily will presume that when a news media requester has satisfied the requirements of paragraphs (k)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, the request is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Disclosure to data brokers or others who merely compile and market government information for direct economic return will not be presumed to primarily serve the public interest.
            (3) Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the requirements for a waiver of fees, a waiver shall be granted for those records.
            (4) Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees should be made when the request is first submitted to the component and should address the criteria referenced above. A requester may submit a fee waiver request at a later time so long as the underlying record request is pending or on administrative appeal. When a requester who has committed to pay fees subsequently asks for a waiver of those fees and that waiver is denied, the requester shall be required to pay any costs incurred up to the date the fee waiver request was received.
            (5) The requester shall be notified in writing of the decision to grant or deny the fee waiver.

            § 1.11
            Testimony or the production of records in a court or other proceeding.
            (a) Applicability. (1) This section sets forth the policies and procedures of the Department regarding the testimony of employees and former employees as witnesses in legal proceedings and the production or disclosure of information contained in Department documents for use in legal proceedings pursuant to a request, order, or subpoena (collectively referred to in this subpart as a demand).
            (2) This section does not apply to any legal proceeding in which an employee is to testify while on leave status regarding facts or events that are unrelated to the official business of the Department.
            (3)(i) Nothing in this section affects the rights and procedures governing public access to records pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) or the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a).
            (ii) Demands in legal proceedings for the production of records, or for the testimony of Department employees regarding information protected by the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a), the Trade Secrets Act (18 U.S.C. 1905) or other confidentiality statutes, must satisfy the requirements for disclosure set forth in those statutes and the applicable regulations of this part before the records may be provided or testimony given.
            (4) This section is intended only to provide guidance for the internal operations of the Department and to inform the public about Department procedures concerning the service of process and responses to demands or requests, and the procedures specified in this section, or the failure of any Treasury employee to follow the procedures specified in this section, are not intended to, do not, and may not be relied upon to create a right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party against the United States.
            (b) Definitions. For purposes of this section:
            (1) Agency counsel means:
            (i) With respect to the Departmental Offices, the General Counsel or his or her designee; or
            (ii) With respect to a bureau or office of the Department, the Chief Counsel or Legal Counsel (or his or her designee) of such bureau or office.
            (2) Demand means a request, order, or subpoena for testimony or documents related to or for possible use in a legal proceeding.
            (3) Department means the United States Department of the Treasury.
            (4) Document means any record or other property, no matter what media and including copies thereof, held by the Department, including without limitation, official letters, telegrams, memoranda, reports, studies, calendar and diary entries, maps, graphs, pamphlets, notes, charts, tabulations, analyses, statistical or informational accumulations, any kind of summaries of meetings and conversations, film impressions, magnetic tapes and sound or mechanical reproductions.
            (5) Employee means all employees or officers of the Department, including contractors and any other individuals who have been appointed by, or are subject to the supervision, jurisdiction or control of the Secretary, as well as the Secretary of the Treasury. The procedures established within this subpart also apply to former employees of the Department where specifically noted.
            (6) General Counsel means the General Counsel of the Department or other Department employee to whom the General Counsel has delegated authority to act under this subpart.
            (7) Legal proceeding means all pretrial, trial and post trial stages of all existing or reasonably anticipated judicial or administrative actions, hearings, investigations, or similar proceedings before courts, commissions, boards, grand juries, or other tribunals, foreign or domestic. This phrase includes all phases of discovery as well as responses to formal or informal requests by attorneys or others involved in legal proceedings.
            (8) Official business means the authorized business of the Department.
            
            (9) Secretary means the Secretary of the Treasury.
            (10) Testimony means a statement in any form, including personal appearances before a court or other legal tribunal, interviews, depositions, telephonic, televised, or videotaped statements or any responses given during discovery or similar proceedings, which response would involve more than the production of documents.
            (c) Department policy. No current or former employee shall, in response to a demand, produce any Department documents, provide testimony regarding any information relating to or based upon Department documents, or disclose any information or produce materials acquired as part of the performance of that employee's official duties or official status, without the prior authorization of the General Counsel or the appropriate agency counsel.
            (d) Procedures for demand for testimony or production of documents. (1) A demand directed to the Department for the testimony of a Department employee or for the production of documents shall be served in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, or applicable state procedures and shall be directed to the General Counsel, Department of the Treasury, 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20220, or to the Chief or Legal Counsel of the concerned Department component. Acceptance of a demand shall not constitute an admission or waiver with respect to jurisdiction, propriety of service, improper venue, or any other defense in law or equity available under the applicable laws or rules.
            (2) A subpoena or other demand for testimony directed to an employee or former employee shall be served in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil or Criminal Procedure or applicable State procedure and a copy of the subpoena shall be sent to agency counsel.
            (3)(i) In court cases in which the United States or the Department is not a party, where the giving of testimony or the production of documents by the Department, or a current or former employee is desired, an affidavit (or if that is not feasible, a statement) by the litigant or the litigant's attorney, setting forth the information with respect to which the testimony or production is desired, must be submitted in order to obtain a decision concerning whether such testimony or production will be authorized. Such information shall include: the title of the legal proceeding, the forum, the requesting party's interest in the legal proceeding, the reason for the demand, a showing that other evidence reasonably suited to the requester's needs is not available from any other source and, if testimony is requested, the intended use of the testimony, a general summary of the desired testimony, and a showing that no document could be provided and used in lieu of testimony. The purpose of this requirement is to assist agency counsel in making an informed decision regarding whether testimony or the production of document should be authorized. Permission to testify or produce documents will, in all cases, be limited to the information set forth in the affidavit or statement, or to such portions thereof as may be deemed proper.
            (ii) Agency counsel may consult or negotiate with an attorney for a party, or the party if not represented by an attorney, to refine or limit a demand so that compliance is less burdensome or obtain information necessary to make the determination required by paragraph (e) of this section. Failure of the attorney or party to cooperate in good faith to enable agency counsel to make an informed determination under this subpart may serve, where appropriate, as a basis for a determination not to comply with the demand.
            (iii) A determination under this subpart to comply or not to comply with a demand is without prejudice as to any formal assertion or waiver of privilege, lack of relevance, technical deficiency or any other ground for noncompliance.
            (4)(i) Employees shall immediately refer all inquiries and demands made on the Department to agency counsel.

            (ii) An employee who receives a subpoena shall immediately forward the subpoena to agency counsel. Agency counsel will determine the manner in which to respond to the subpoena.
            
            (e) Factors to be considered by agency counsel. (1) In deciding whether to authorize the release of official information or the testimony of personnel concerning official information (hereafter referred to as “the disclosure”) agency counsel shall consider the following factors:
            (i) Whether the request or demand is unduly burdensome;
            (ii) Whether the request would involve the Department in controversial issues unrelated to the Department's mission;
            (iii) Whether the time and money of the United States would be used for private purposes;
            (iv) The extent to which the time of employees for conducting official business would be compromised;
            (v) Whether the public might misconstrue variances between personal opinions of employees and Department policy;
            (vi) Whether the request demonstrates that the information requested is relevant and material to the action pending, genuinely necessary to the proceeding, unavailable from other sources, and reasonable in its scope;
            (vii) Whether the number of similar requests would have a cumulative effect on the expenditure of agency resources;
            (viii) Whether disclosure otherwise would be inappropriate under the circumstances; and
            (ix) Any other factor that is appropriate.
            (2) Among those demands and requests in response to which compliance will not ordinarily be authorized are those with respect to which any of the following factors exists:
            (i) The disclosure would violate a statute, Executive order, or regulation;
            (ii) The integrity of the administrative and deliberative processes of the Department would be compromised;
            (iii) The disclosure would not be appropriate under the rules of procedure governing the case or matter in which the demand arose;
            (iv) The disclosure, including release in camera, is not appropriate or necessary under the relevant substantive law concerning privilege;
            (v) The disclosure, except when in camera and necessary to assert a claim of privilege, would reveal information properly classified or other matters exempt from unrestricted disclosure; or
            (vi) The disclosure would interfere with ongoing enforcement proceedings, compromise constitutional rights, reveal the identity of an intelligence source or confidential informant, or disclose trade secrets or similarly confidential commercial or financial information.
            (f) Requests for opinion or expert testimony. (1) Subject to 5 CFR 2635.805, an employee or former employee shall not provide, with or without compensation, opinion or expert testimony concerning official information, subjects, or activities, except on behalf of the United States or a party represented by the Department of Justice, without written approval of agency counsel.
            (2) Upon a showing by the requestor of exceptional need or unique circumstances and that the anticipated testimony will not be adverse to the interests of the Department or the United States, agency counsel may, in writing, grant authorization for an employee, or former employee, to appear and testify at no expense to the United States.
            (3) Any expert or opinion testimony by a former employee of the Department shall be excepted from § 1.11(f)(1) where the testimony involves only general expertise gained while employed at the Department.
            (g) Procedures when agency counsel directs an employee not to testify or provide documents. (1) If agency counsel determines that an employee or former employee should not comply with a subpoena or other request for testimony or the production of documents, agency counsel will so inform the employee and the party who submitted the subpoena or made the request.
            (2) If, despite the determination of the agency counsel that testimony should not be given and/or documents not be produced, a court of competent jurisdiction or other appropriate authority orders the employee or former employee to testify and/or produce documents, the employee shall notify agency counsel of such order.

            (i) If agency counsel determines that no further legal review of, or challenge to, the order will be sought, the employee or former employee shall comply with the order.

            (ii) If agency counsel determines to challenge the order, or that further legal review is necessary, the employee or former employee should not comply with the order. Where necessary, the employee should appear at the time and place set forth in the subpoena. If legal counsel cannot appear on behalf of the employee, the employee should produce a copy of this subpart and respectfully inform the legal tribunal that he/she has been advised by counsel not to provide the requested testimony and/or produce documents. If the legal tribunal rules that the subpoena must be complied with, the employee shall respectfully decline to comply, citing this section and United States ex rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951).

            § 1.12
            Regulations not applicable to official request.
            The regulations in this part shall not be applicable to official requests of other governmental agencies or officers thereof acting in their official capacities, unless it appears that granting a particular request would be in violation of law or inimical to the public interest. Cases of doubt should be referred for decision to agency counsel (as defined in § 1.11(b)(1)).

          Subpart C—Privacy Act
          
            § 1.20
            Purpose and scope of regulation.
            The regulations in this subpart are issued to implement the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a). The regulations apply to all records which are contained in systems of records maintained by the Department of the Treasury and which are retrieved by an individual's name or personal identifier. They do not relate to those personnel records of Government employees, which are under the jurisdiction of the Office of Personnel Management to the extent such records are subject to regulations issued by such OPM. The regulations apply to all components of the Department of the Treasury. Any reference in this subpart to the Department or its officials, employees, or records shall be deemed to refer also to the components or their officials, employees, or records. The regulations set forth the requirements applicable to Department of the Treasury employees maintaining, collecting, using or disseminating records pertaining to individuals. They also set forth the procedures by which individuals may request notification of whether the Department of the Treasury maintains or has disclosed a record pertaining to them or may seek access to such records maintained in any nonexempt system of records, request correction of such records, appeal any initial adverse determination of any request for amendment, or may seek an accounting of disclosures of such records. For the convenience of interested persons, the components of the Department of the Treasury may reprint these regulations in their entirety (less any appendices not applicable to the component in question) in those titles of the Code of Federal Regulations which normally contain regulations applicable to such components. In connection with such republication, and at other appropriate times, components may issue supplementary regulations applicable only to the component in question, which are consistent with these regulations. In the event of any actual or apparent inconsistency, these Departmental regulations shall govern. Persons interested in the records of a particular component should, therefore, also consult the Code of Federal Regulations for any rules or regulations promulgated specifically with respect to that component (see Appendices to this subpart for cross references). The head of each component is hereby also authorized to substitute other appropriate officials for those designated and correct addresses specified in the appendix to this subpart applicable to the component.

The controls instituted shall be proportional to the degree of sensitivity of the records but at a minimum must insure that records other than those available to the general public under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), are protected from public view, that the area in which the records are stored is supervised during all business hours and physically secure during nonbusiness hours to prevent unauthorized personnel from obtaining access to the records. Automated systems shall comply with the security standards promulgated by the National Bureau of Standards.
            (ii) System managers, with the approval of the head of their offices within a component, shall adopt access restrictions to insure that only those individuals within the agency who have a need to have access to the records for the performance of their duties have access to them. Procedures shall also be adopted to prevent accidental access to, or dissemination of, records.
            (e) Prohibition against maintenance of records concerning First Amendment rights. No component shall maintain a record describing how any individual exercises rights guaranteed by the First Amendment (e.g. speech), unless the maintenance of such record is:
            (1) Expressly authorized by statute, or
            (2) Expressly authorized by the individual about whom the record is maintained, or
            (3) Pertinent to and within the scope of an authorized law enforcement activity. (See 5 U.S.C. 552a (e)(7))
            (f) Notification of disclosure under compulsory legal process. Subject to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j) and § 1.23(c)(1), when records concerning an individual are subpoenaed by a Grand Jury, Court, or quasi-judicial agency, or disclosed in accordance with an ex parte court order pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 6103(i), the official served with the subpoena or court order shall make reasonable efforts to assure that notice of any disclosure is provided to the individual. Notice shall be provided within five working days of making the records available under compulsory legal process or, in the case of a Grand Jury subpoena or an ex parte order, within five days of its becoming a matter of public record. Notice shall be mailed to the last known address of the individual and shall contain the following information: the date and authority to which the subpoena is, or was returnable, or the date of and court issuing the ex parte order, the name and number of the case or proceeding, and the nature of the information sought and provided. Notice of the issuance of a subpoena or an ex parte order is not required if the system of records has been exempted from the notice requirement of 5 U.S.C. 552a (e)(8) and this section, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (j) and § 1.23 (c)(1), by a Notice of Exemption published in the Federal Register. (See 5 U.S.C. 552a (e)(8)).
            
            (g) Emergency disclosure. If information concerning an individual has been disclosed to any person under compelling circumstances affecting health or safety, the individual shall be notified at the last known address within 5 days of the disclosure (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays). Notification shall include the following information: The nature of the information disclosed, the person or agency to whom it was disclosed, the date of disclosure, and the compelling circumstances justifying the disclosure. Notification shall be given by the officer who made or authorized the disclosure. (See 5 U.S.C. 552a (b)(8)).
          
          
            § 1.23
            Publication in the Federal Register—Notices of systems of records, general exemptions, specific exemptions, review of all systems.
            (a) Notices of systems of records to be published in the

            (ii) The categories of individuals on whom records are maintained in the system;
            (iii) The categories of records maintained in the system;
            (iv) Each routine use of the records contained in the system, including the categories of users and the purpose of such use;
            (v) The policies and practices of the component regarding storage, retrievability, access controls, retention, and disposal of the records;
            (vi) The title and business address of the Treasury official who is responsible for the system of records;
            (vii) The procedures of the component whereby an individual can be notified if the system of records contain a record pertaining to the individual, including reasonable times, places, and identification requirements.
            (viii) The procedures of the component whereby an individual can be notified on how to gain access to any record pertaining to such individual that may be contained in the system of records, and how to contest its content; and
            (ix) The categories of sources of records in the system. (See 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4))
            (b) Notice of new or modified routine uses to be published in the
              Federal Register. At least 30 days prior to a new use or modification of a routine use, as published under paragraph (a)(3)(iv) of this section, each component shall publish in the Federal Register notice of such new or modified use of the information in the system and provide an opportunity for interested persons to submit written data, views, or arguments to the components. (See 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(11))
            (c) Promulgation of rules exempting systems from certain requirements—(1) General exemptions. In accordance with existing procedures applicable to a Treasury component's issuance of regulations, the head of each such component may adopt rules, in accordance with the requirements (including general notice) of 5 U.S.C. 553 (b) (1), (2), and (3), (c) and (e), to exempt any system of records within the component from any part of 5 U.S.C. 552a and these regulations except subsections (b) (sec. 1.24, conditions of disclosure), (c)(1) (sec. 1.25, keep accurate accounting of disclosures), (c)(2) (sec. 1.25, retain accounting for five years or life of record), (e)(4) (A) through (F) (paragraph (a) of this section, publication of annual notice of systems of records), (e)(6) (sec. 1.22(d), accuracy of records prior to dissemination), (e)(7) (sec. 1.22(e), maintenance of records on First Amendment rights), (e)(9) (sec. 1.28, establish rules of conduct), (e)(10) (sec. 1.22(d)(3), establish safeguards for records), (e)(11) (paragraph (c) of this section, publish new intended use), and (i) (sec. 1.28(c), criminal penalties) if the systems of records maintained by the component which performs as its principal function any activity pertaining to the enforcement of criminal laws, including police efforts to prevent, control, or reduce crime or to apprehend criminals, and the activities of prosecutors, courts, correctional, probation, pardon, or parole authorities, and which consists of:
            (i) Information compiled for the purpose of identifying individual criminal offenders and alleged offenders and consisting only of identifying data and notations of arrests, the nature and disposition of criminal charges, sentencing, confinement, release, and parole, and probation status;
            (ii) Information compiled for the purpose of a criminal investigation, including reports of informants and investigators, and associated with an identifiable individual; or
            (iii) Reports identifiable to an individual compiled at any stage of the process of enforcement of the criminal laws from arrest or indictment through release from supervision. (See 5 U.S.C. 552a(j))
            (2) Specific exemptions. In accordance with existing procedures applicable to a Treasury component's issuance of regulations, the head of each such component may adopt rules, in accordance with the requirements (including general notice) of 5 U.S.C. 553 (b) (1), (2), and (3), (c), and (e), to exempt any system of records within the component from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) (sec. 1.25(c)(2), accounting of certain disclosures available to the individual), (d) (sec. 1.26(a), access to records), (e)(1) (sec. 1.22(a)(1), maintenance of information to accomplish purposes authorized by statute or executive order only), (e)(4)(G) (paragraph (a)(7) of this section, publication of procedures for notification), (e)(4)(H) (paragraph (a)(8) of this section, publication of procedures for access and contest), (e)(4)(I) (paragraph (a)(9) of this section, publication of sources of records), and (f) (sec. 1.26, promulgate rules for notification, access and contest), if the system of records is:
            (i) Subject to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1);
            (ii) Investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes, other than material within the scope of subsection (j)(2) of 5 U.S.C. 552a and paragraph (a)(1) of this section. If any individual is denied any right, privilege, or benefit that such individual would otherwise be entitled to by Federal law, or for which such individual would otherwise be eligible, as a result of the maintenance of this material, such material shall be provided to the individual, except to the extent that the disclosure of the material would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, or prior to September 27, 1975, under an implied promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence;
            (iii) Maintained in connection with providing protective services to the President of the United States or other individuals pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3056;
            (iv) Required by statute to be maintained and used solely as statistical records;
            (v) Investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for Federal civilian employment, military service, Federal contracts, or access to classified information, but only to the extent that the disclosure of such material would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, or, prior to September 27, 1975, under an implied promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence;
            (vi) Testing or examination material used solely to determine individual qualifications for appointment or promotion in the Federal service the disclosure of which would compromise the objectivity or fairness of the testing or examination process; or

            (vii) Evaluation material used to determine potential for promotion in the armed services, but only to the extent that the disclosure of such material would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, or, prior to September 27, 1975, under an implied promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence.
            (3) At the time that rules under this subsection are adopted, the head of the component shall include in the statement required under 5 U.S.C. 553(c) the reasons why the system of records is to be exempted from a provision of 5 U.S.C. 552a and this part. (See 5 U.S.C. 552a (j) and (k))
            (d) Review and report to OMB. The Department shall ensure that the following reviews are conducted as often as specified below by each of the components who shall be prepared to report to the Departmental Disclosure Branch upon request the results of such reviews and any corrective action taken to resolve problems uncovered. Each component shall:
            (1) Review every two years a random sample of the component's contracts that provide for the maintenance of a system of records on behalf of the component to accomplish a function of the component, in order to ensure that the working of each contract makes the provisions of the Act apply. (5 U.S.C. 552a(m)(1))
            (2) Review annually component's recordkeeping and disposal policies and practices in order to assure compliance with the Act.
            (3) Review routine use disclosures every 3 years, that are associated with each system of records in order to ensure that the recipient's use of such records continues to be compatible with the purpose for which the disclosing agency originally collected the information.
            (4) Review every three years each system of records for which the component has issued exemption rules pursuant to section (j) or (k) of the Privacy Act in order to determine whether the exemption is needed.
            (5) Review annually each ongoing matching program in which the component has participated during the year, either as a source or as a matching agency in order to assure that the requirements of the Act, the OMB Matching Guidelines, and the OMB Model Control System and checklist have been met.
            (6) Review component's training practices annually to ensure that all component personnel are familiar with the requirements of the Act, these regulations and Departmental directives.
            (7) Review annually the actions of component personnel that have resulted either in the agency being found civilly liable under section (g) of the Act, or an employee being found criminally liable under the provisions of section (i) of the Act, in order to determine the extent of the problem and to prevent future recurrences.

            (8) Review annually each system of records notice to ensure that it accurately describes the system. Where minor changes are needed, publish an amended notice in the Federal Register. Minor changes shall be consolidated in one annual comprehensive publication. The term “minor change to a system of records” means a change that does not significantly change the system. More specifically, a minor change does not affect the character or purpose of the system and does not affect the ability of an individual to gain access to a record about the individual or to any information pertaining to such individual which is contained in the system; for example, changing the title of the system manager or the location of the system.
          
          
            § 1.24
            Disclosure of records to person other than the individual to whom they pertain.
            (a) Conditions of disclosure. No component of Treasury shall disclose any record which is contained in a system of records maintained by it by any means of communication to any person, or to another agency, except pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior written consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains, or the parent, if a minor, or legal guardian, if incompetent, of such individual, unless disclosure of the record would be:

            (2) Retired under 5 U.S.C. 552 (subpart A of this part);
            
            (3) For a routine use as defined in 5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(7) and § 1.21(g) and as described under 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(D) and § 1.23(a)(4);
            (4) To the Bureau of the Census for purposes of planning or carrying out a census or survey or related activity pursuant to the provisions of title 13 of the U.S. Code;
            (5) To a recipient who has provided the component with advance adequate written assurance that the record will be used solely as a statistical research or reporting record, and the record is to be transferred in a form that is not individually identifiable;
            (6) To the National Archives of the United States as a record which has sufficient historical or other value to warrant its continued preservation by the United States Government, or for evaluation by the Administrator of General Services or the designee of such official to determine whether the record has such value;
            (7) To another agency or to an instrumentality of any governmental jurisdiction within or under the control of the United States for a civil or criminal law enforcement activity.
            (i) If the activity is authorized by law; and
            (ii) If the head of the agency or instrumentality has made a written request to the Department of the Treasury specifying the particular portion desired and the law enforcement activities for which the record is sought;
            (8) To a person pursuant to a showing of compelling circumstances affecting the health or safety of an individual, if upon such disclosure, notification is transmitted to the last known address of such individual;
            (9) To either House of Congress, or, to the extent of matter within its jurisdiction, any committee or subcommittee thereof, any joint committee of Congress or subcommittee of any such joint committee.

            (11) Pursuant to the order of a court of competent jurisdiction. (See 5 U.S.C. 552a(b))
          
          
            § 1.25
            Accounting of disclosures.
            (a) Accounting of certain disclosures. Each component, with respect to each system of records under its control, shall:
            (1) Keep an accurate accounting of: (i) The date, nature, and purpose of each disclosure of a record to any person or to an agency made under 5 U.S.C. 552a (b) and § 1.24; and (ii) the name and address of the person or agency to whom the disclosure is made;
            (2) Retain the accounting made under paragraph (a)(1) of this section for at least five years or the life of the record, whichever is longer, after the disclosure for which the accounting is made; and
            (3) Inform any person or other agency about any correction or notation of dispute made by the constitutent unit in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552a (d) and § 1.28 of any record that has been disclosed to the person or agency if an accounting of the disclosure was made. (See 5 U.S.C. 552(c).)
            (b) Accounting systems. To permit the accounting required by paragraph (a) of this section, system managers, with the approval of the head of their offices within a component, shall establish or implement, a system of accounting for all disclosures of records, either orally or in writing, made outside the Department of the Treasury. Accounting records shall:
            (1) Be established in the least expensive and most convenient form that will permit the system manager to advise individuals, promptly upon request, what records concerning them have been disclosed and to whom:
            (2) Provide, as a minimum, the identification of the particular record disclosed, the name and address of the person or agency to whom or to whom or to which disclosed, and the date, nature and purpose of the disclosure; and
            (3) Be maintained for 5 years or until the record is destroyed or transferred to the National Archives and Records Service for storage in records centers, in which event, the accounting pertaining to those records, unless maintained separately, shall be transferred with the records themselves.
            (c) Exemptions from accounting requirements. No accounting is required for disclosure of records:
            
            (1) To those officers and employees of the Department of the Treasury who have a need for the record in the performance of their duties; or
            (2) If disclosure would be required under 5 U.S.C. 552 and Subpart A of this part.
            (d) Access to accounting by individual. (1) Subject to paragraphs (c) and (d)(2) of this section, each component shall establish and set forth in the appendix to this subpart applicable to the component, procedures for making the accounting required under paragraph (a) of this section available to the individual to whom the record pertains and shall thereafter make such accounting available in accordance therewith at the request of the individual. The procedures may require the requester to provide reasonable identification.
            (2) Access accountings of disclosure may be withheld from the individual named in the record only if the disclosures were (i) made under 5 U.S.C. 552a (b)(7) and § 1.24 (a)(7), or (ii) under a system of records exempted from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552 (j) or (k) and § 1.23(c). (See 5 U.S.C. 552a(c))
          
          
            § 1.26
            Procedures for notification and access to records pertaining to individuals—format and fees for request for access.
            (a) Procedures for notification and access. Each component shall establish, in accordance with the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553, and set forth in the appendix to this subpart applicable to such component procedures whereby an individual can be notified, in response to a request, if any system of records named by the individual contains a record pertaining to that individual. In addition, such procedures shall set forth the requirements for access to such records. As a minimum such procedures shall specify the times during, and the places at which access will be accorded, together with such identification as may be required of the individual before access. (See 5 U.S.C. 552a(f) (1), (2) and (3))
            (b) Access. Each component in accordance with the procedures prescribed under paragraph (a) of this section, shall allow an individual to gain access to records or to any information pertaining to such individual which is contained in the system of records upon request. The individual shall be permitted to review the record and have a copy made of all or any portion of the record in a form that is comprehensible. The individual will also be permitted to be accompanied by any person of the individual's choosing to review the record, except that the agency may require the individual to furnish a written statement authorizing discussion of that individual's record in the accompanying person's presence. (See 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1))
            (c) Exceptions. Neither the procedures prescribed under paragraph (a) of this section nor the requirements for access under paragraph (b) of this section shall be applicable to—(1) systems of records exempted pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (j) and (k) and § 1.23(c); (2) information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding (See 5 U.S.C. 552(d)(5)); or (3) information pertaining to an individual which is contained in, and inseparable from, another individual's record.
            (d) Format of request. (1) A record for notification of whether a record exists shall:
            (i) Be made in writing and signed by the person making the request, who must be the individual about whom the record is maintained, or such individual's duly authorized representative (See § 1.34);
            (ii) State that it is made pursuant to the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a or these regulations, have marked “Privacy Act Request” on the request and on the envelope;
            (iii) Give the name of the system or subsystem or categories of records to which access is sought, as specified in “Privacy Act Issuances” published by the Office of the Federal Register and referenced in the appendices to this subpart;

            (iv) Describe the nature of the record(s) sought in sufficient detail to enable Department personnel to locate the system of records containing the record with a reasonable amount of effort. Whenever possible, a request for access should describe the nature of the record sought, the date of the record or the period in which the record was compiled.
            
            (v) Provide such identification of the requester as may be specified in the appropriate appendix to this subpart; and
            (vi) Be addressed or delivered in person to the office or officer of the component indicated for the particular system or subsystem or categories of records the individual wishes access to, as specified in “Privacy Act Issuances” published by the Office of the Federal Register and referenced in the appendices to this subpart. Assistance in ascertaining the appropriate component or in preparing a request for notification may be obtained by a written request to this effect addressed as specified in appendix A of this part, as the address for the Departmental Offices for “Request for notification and access to records and accountings of disclosures”.
            (2) A request for access to records shall, in addition to complying with paragraph (a)(1)(i) through (vi) of this section:
            (i) State whether the requester wishes to inspect the records or desires to have a copy made and furnished without first inspecting them;
            (ii) If the requester desires to have a copy made, state the firm agreement of the requester to pay the fees for duplication ultimately determined in accordance with (31 CFR 1.6) Subpart A of this title, unless such fees are waived pursuant to that section by the system manager or other appropriate official as indicated in the appropriate appendix to these regulations; and
            (iii) Comply with any other requirement set forth in the applicable appendix to this subpart or the “Notice of Records Systems” applicable to the system in question. Requesters are hereby advised that any request for access which does not comply with the foregoing requirements and those set forth elsewhere in this Subpart C, will not be deemed subject to the time constraints of this section, unless and until amended so as to comply. However, components shall advise the requester in what respect the request is deficient so that it may be processed. This section applies only to records which are contained in a system of records and which are in the possession or control of the component. (See 5 U.S.C. 552a (d) and (f))
            (e) Requests for records not in control of component. (1) Treasury employees shall make reasonable efforts to assist an oral requester to ascertain to which office or officer a written request should be sent. When the request is for a record which is not in the possession or control of any component of the Department of the Treasury, the requester shall be so advised.
            (2) Where the record requested was created by a Department or agency other than the Department of the Treasury or a component of the Department and has been classified (e.g. National Defense or Intelligence Information) or otherwise restrictively endorsed (e.g. Office of Personnel Management records of FBI reports) by such other Department or agency, and a copy is in the possession of a component of the Department of the Treasury, that portion of the request shall be referred to the originating agency for determination as to all issues in accordance with the Privacy Act. In the case of a referral to another agency under this paragraph, the requester shall be notified that such portion of the request has been so referred and that the requester may expect to hear from that agency.
            (3) When information sought from a system manager or other appropriate official in the Department of the Treasury includes information furnished by other Federal agencies not classified or otherwise restrictively endorsed, the system manager or other appropriate official receiving the request shall consult with the appropriate agency prior to making a decision to disclose or not to disclose the record. The decision as to whether the record shall be disclosed shall be made, in the first instance by the system manager or other appropriate official maintaining the record. (See 5 U.S.C. 552a (d) and (f))
            (f) Date of receipt of request. A request for notification or access to records shall be considered to have been received for purposes of this subpart on the date on which the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section have been satisfied. Requests for notification or access to records and any separate agreement to pay shall be stamped or endorsed with the date of receipt by the receiving office. The latest of such stamped dates will be deemed to be the date of receipt of the request for the purposes of this subpart. (See 5 U.S.C. 552a (d) and (f))
            (g) Notification of determination—(1) In general. Notification of determinations as to notification of whether a record exists or as to whether to grant access to records requested will be made by the officers designated in the appendices to this subpart. The notification of the determination shall be mailed within 30 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal public holidays) after the date of receipt of the request, as determined in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section. If it is not possible to respond within 30 days, the designated officer shall inform the requester, stating the reason for the delay (e.g. volume of records requested, scattered location of the records, need to consult other agencies, or the difficulty of the legal issues involved) and when a response will be dispatched. (See 5 U.S.C. 552a (d) and (f))
            (2) Granting of access. When it has been determined that the request for access will be granted—(i) and a copy requested; such copy in a form comprehensible to the requester shall be furnished promptly, together with a statement of the applicable fees for duplication; and (ii) and the right to inspect has been requested, the requester shall be promptly notified in writing of the determination, and when and where the requested records may be inspected. An individual seeking to inspect such records may be accompanied by another person of such individual's choosing. The individual seeking access shall be required to sign the required form indicating that the Department of the Treasury is authorized to discuss the contents of the subject record in the accompanying person's presence. If, after making the inspection, the individual making the request desires a copy of all or a portion of the requested records, such copy in a form comprehensible to the individual shall be furnished upon payment of the applicable fees for duplication. Fees to be charged are as prescribed by 31 CFR part 1, subpart A, § 1.6 Fees shall not be charged where they would amount, in the aggregate, to less than $3.00. (See 5 U.S.C. 552a (d) and (f))
            (3) Requirements for access to medical records. When access is requested to medical records, including psychological records, the responsible official may determine that such release could have an adverse effect on the individual and that release will be made only to a physician authorized in writing to have access to such records by the individual making the request. Upon receipt of the authorization the physician will be permitted to review the records or to receive copies of the records by mail, upon proper verification of identity. (See 5 U.S.C. 552a (f) (3))
            (4) Denial of request. When it is determined that the request for notification of whether a record exists or access to records will be denied (whether in whole or part or subject to conditions or exceptions), the person making the request shall be so notified by mail in accordance with paragraph (g)(1) of this section. The letter of notification shall specify the city or other location where the requested records are situated (if known), contain a statement of the reasons for not granting the request as made, set forth the name and title or position of the responsible official and advise the individual making the request of the right to file suit in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552a (g)(1)(B).
            (5) Prohibition against the use of 5 U.S.C. 552 (b) exemptions. Exemptions from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552 (b) (31 CFR part 1, subpart A, § 1.2 (c)), may not be invoked for the purpose of withholding from an individual any record which is otherwise accessible to such individual under the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a and this subpart. (See 5 U.S.C. 552a (q))
            (6) Records exempt in whole or in part. (i) When an individual requests notification as to whether a record exists or access to records concerning the individual which have been exempted from individual access pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (j) or which have been compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding in either a court or before an administrative tribunal and the assertion of the exemption is deemed necessary, the Department of the Treasury will neither confirm nor deny the existence of the record but shall advise the individual only that no record available to the individual pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974 has been identified.
            (ii) Requests from individuals for access to records which have been exempted from access pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (k) shall be processed as follows:
            (A) Requests for information classified pursuant to Executive Orders 12958, 13526, or successor or prior Executive Orders require the responsible component of the Department to review the information to determine whether it continues to warrant classification pursuant to an Executive Order. Information which no longer warrants classification under these criteria shall be declassified and made available to the individual. If the information continues to warrant classification, the individual shall be advised that the information sought is classified, that it has been reviewed and continues to warrant classification, and that it has been exempted from access pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552 (b)(1) and 5 U.S.C. 552a (k)(1). Information which has been exempted pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (j) and which is also classified shall be reviewed as required by this paragraph but the response to the individual shall be in the form prescribed by paragraph (g)(6)(i) of this section.
            (B) Requests for information which has been exempted from disclosure pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (k)(2) shall be responded to in the manner provided in paragraph (g)(6)(i) of this section unless the requester shows that the information has been used or is being used to deny the individual any right, privilege or benefit for which he is eligible or to which he would otherwise be entitled under federal law. In that event, the individual shall be advised of the existence of the information but such information as would identify a confidential source shall be extracted or summarized in a manner which protects the source to the maximum degree possible and the summary extract shall be provided to the requesting individual.
            (C) Information compiled as part of an employee background investigation which has been exempted pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (k)(5) shall be made available to an individual upon request except to the extent that it identifies the confidential source. Material identifying the confidential sources shall be extracted or summarized in a manner which protects the source to the maximum degree possible and the summary or extract shall be provided to the requesting individual.
            (D) Testing or examination material which has been exempted pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (k)(6) shall not be made available to an individual if disclosure would compromise the objectivity or fairness of the testing or examination process; but may be made available if no such compromise possibility exists. (See 5 U.S.C. 552a (d)(5), (j) and (k)).

            (2) Form of request for administrative review of refusal to amend record. At any time within 35 days after the date of the notification of the initial decision described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, the requester may submit an administrative appeal from such refusal to the official specified in the notification of the initial decision and the appropriate appendix to this subpart. The appeal shall:
            (i) Be made in writing stating any arguments in support thereof and be signed by the person to whom the record pertains, or the duly authorized representative of such official;
            (ii) Be addressed to and mailed or hand delivered within 35 days of the date of the initial decision, to the office or officer specified in the appropriate appendix to this subpart and in the notification.

            (3) Date of receipt. Appeals shall be promptly stamped with the date of their receipt by the office to which addressed and such stamped date will be deemed to be the date of receipt for all purposes of this subpart. The receipt of the appeal shall be acknowledged within 10 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) from the date of the receipt (unless the determination on appeal is dispatched in 10 days, in which case, no acknowledgement is required) by the responsible official and the requester advised of the date of receipt established by the foregoing and when a response is due in accordance with this paragraph. (See 5 U.S.C. 552a (d) and (f))
            (4) Review of administrative appeals from denial of requests to amend records. Officials responsible for deciding administrative appeals from denials of requests to amend records pertaining to an individual, as specified in the appendices to this subpart shall: Complete the review, and notify the requester of the final agency decision within 30 days (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays and legal public holidays) after the date of receipt of such appeal, unless the time is extended by the head of the agency or the delegate of such official, for good cause shown. If such final agency decision is to refuse to amend the record, in whole or in part, the requester shall also be advised of the right—(i) to file a concise “Statement of Disagreement” setting forth the reasons for his disagreement with the decision which shall be filed within 35 days of the date of the notification of the final agency decision and (ii) to judicial review of the final agency decision under 5 U.S.C. 552a(g)(1)(A). (See 5 U.S.C. 552a (d), (f) and (g)(1))
            (5) Notation on record and distribution of statements of disagreement.

            (a) Training.

            (3) For the purposes of 5 U.S.C. 552a (i), the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section are applicable to Government contractors and employees of such contractors who by contract, operate by or on behalf of the Department of the Treasury a system of records to accomplish a Departmental function.

Except for forms developed and used by constituent units, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Administration shall be responsible for reviewing all forms developed and used by the Department of the Treasury to collect information from and about individuals. The heads of components shall each be responsible for the review of forms used by such component to collect information from and about individuals.
            (b) Scope of review. The responsible officers shall review each form for the purpose of eliminating any requirement for information that is not relevant and necessary to carry out an agency function and to accomplish the following objectives;
            (1) To insure that no information concerning religion, political beliefs or activities, association memberships (other than those required for a professional license), or the exercise of First Amendment rights is required to be disclosed unless such requirement of disclosure is expressly authorized by statute or is pertinent to, and within the scope of, any authorized law enforcement activity;
            (2) To insure that the form or a separate form that can be retained by the individual makes clear to the individual which information he is required by law to disclose and the authority for that requirement and which information is voluntary;
            (3) To insure that the form or a separate form that can be retained by the individual states clearly the principal purpose or purposes for which the information is being collected, and summarizes concisely the routine uses that will be made of the information;
            (4) To insure that the form or a separate form that can be retained by the individual clearly indicates to the individual the effect in terms of rights, benefits or privileges of not providing all or part of the requested information; and

            (5) To insure that any form requesting disclosure of a Social Security Number, or a separate form that can be retained by the individual, clearly advises the individual of the statute or regulation requiring disclosure of the number or clearly advises the individual that disclosure is voluntary and that no consequence will follow from the refusal to disclose it, and the uses that will be made of the number whether disclosed mandatorily and voluntarily.
            (c) Revision of forms. Any form which does not meet the objectives specified in the Privacy Act and in this section, shall be revised to conform thereto. A separate statement may be used in instances when a form does not conform. This statement will accompany a form and shall include all the information necessary to accomplish the objectives specified in the Privacy Act and this section.
          
          
            § 1.36

            (2) The Department hereby exempts the systems of records listed in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (x) of this section from the following provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2): 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) and (4), 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1), (2), (3), (4), 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1), (2) and (3), 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(5) and (8), 5 U.S.C. 552a(f), and 5 U.S.C. 552a(g).
            (d) Reasons for exemptions under 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2). (1) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(G) and (f)(l) enable individuals to inquire whether a system of records contains records pertaining to them. Application of these provisions to the systems of records would give individuals an opportunity to learn whether they have been identified as suspects or subjects of investigation. As further described in the following paragraph, access to such knowledge would impair the Department's ability to carry out its mission, since individuals could:
            (i) Take steps to avoid detection;
            (ii) Inform associates that an investigation is in progress;
            (iii) Learn the nature of the investigation;
            (iv) Learn whether they are only suspects or identified as law violators;
            (v) Begin, continue, or resume illegal conduct upon learning that they are not identified in the system of records; or
            (vi) Destroy evidence needed to prove the violation.
            (2) 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1), (e)(4)(H) and (f)(2), (3) and (5) grant individuals access to records pertaining to them. The application of these provisions to the systems of records would compromise the Department's ability to provide useful tactical and strategic information to law enforcement agencies.
            (i) Permitting access to records contained in the systems of records would provide individuals with information concerning the nature of any current investigations and would enable them to avoid detection or apprehension by:
            (A) Discovering the facts that would form the basis for their arrest;
            (B) Enabling them to destroy or alter evidence of criminal conduct that would form the basis for their arrest; and
            (C) Using knowledge that criminal investigators had reason to believe that a crime was about to be committed, to delay the commission of the crime or commit it at a location that might not be under surveillance.
            (ii) Permitting access to either on-going or closed investigative files would also reveal investigative techniques and procedures, the knowledge of which could enable individuals planning crimes to structure their operations so as to avoid detection or apprehension.

            (iii) Permitting access to investigative files and records could, moreover, disclose the identity of confidential sources and informants and the nature of the information supplied and thereby endanger the physical safety of those sources by exposing them to possible reprisals for having provided the information. Confidential sources and informants might refuse to provide criminal investigators with valuable information unless they believe that their identities will not be revealed through disclosure of their names or the nature of the information they supplied. Loss of access to such sources would seriously impair the Department's ability to carry out its mandate.
            (iv) Furthermore, providing access to records contained in the systems of records could reveal the identities of undercover law enforcement officers who compiled information regarding the individual's criminal activities and thereby endanger the physical safety of those undercover officers or their families by exposing them to possible reprisals.
            (v) By compromising the law enforcement value of the systems of records for the reasons outlined in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section, permitting access in keeping with these provisions would discourage other law enforcement and regulatory agencies, foreign and domestic, from freely sharing information with the Department and thus would restrict the Department's access to information necessary to accomplish its mission most effectively.
            (vi) Finally, the dissemination of certain information that the Department maintains in the systems of records is restricted by law.
            (3) 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(2), (3) and (4), (e)(4)(H), and (f)(4) permit an individual to request amendment of a record pertaining to him or her and require the agency either to amend the record, or to note the disputed portion of the record and to provide a copy of the individual's statement of disagreement with the agency's refusal to amend a record to persons or other agencies to whom the record is thereafter disclosed. Since these provisions depend on the individual having access to his or her records, and since these rules exempt the systems of records from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a relating to access to records, for the reasons set out in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, these provisions should not apply to the systems of records.
            (4) 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) requires an agency to make accountings of disclosures of a record available to the individual named in the record upon his or her request. The accountings must state the date, nature, and purpose of each disclosure of the record and the name and address of the recipient.
            (i) The application of this provision would impair the ability of law enforcement agencies outside the Department of the Treasury to make effective use of information provided by the Department. Making accountings of disclosures available to the subjects of an investigation would alert them to the fact that another agency is conducting an investigation into their criminal activities and could reveal the geographic location of the other agency's investigation, the nature and purpose of that investigation, and the dates on which that investigation was active. Individuals possessing such knowledge would be able to take measures to avoid detection or apprehension by altering their operations, by transferring their criminal activities to other geographical areas, or by destroying or concealing evidence that would form the basis for arrest. In the case of a delinquent account, such release might enable the subject of the investigation to dissipate assets before levy.
            (ii) Moreover, providing accountings to the subjects of investigations would alert them to the fact that the Department has information regarding their criminal activities and could inform them of the general nature of that information. Access to such information could reveal the operation of the Department's information-gathering and analysis systems and permit individuals to take steps to avoid detection or apprehension.

            (5) 5 U.S.C. 552(c)(4) requires an agency to inform any person or other agency about any correction or notation of dispute that the agency made in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552a(d) to any record that the agency disclosed to the person or agency if an accounting of the disclosure was made. Since this provision depends on an individual's having access to and an opportunity to request amendment of records pertaining to him or her, and since these rules exempt the systems of records from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a relating to access to and amendment of records, for the reasons set out in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, this provision should not apply to the systems of records.
            
            (6) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(I) requires an agency to publish a general notice listing the categories of sources for information contained in a system of records. The application of this provision to the systems of records could compromise the Department's ability to provide useful information to law enforcement agencies, since revealing sources for the information could:
            (i) Disclose investigative techniques and procedures;
            (ii) Result in threats or reprisals against informants by the subjects of investigations; and
            (iii) Cause informants to refuse to give full information to criminal investigators for fear of having their identities as sources disclosed.
            (7) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1) requires an agency to maintain in its records only such information about an individual as is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the agency required to be accomplished by statute or executive order. The term “maintain,” as defined in 5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(3), includes “collect” and “disseminate.” The application of this provision to the systems of records could impair the Department's ability to collect and disseminate valuable law enforcement information.
            (i) In many cases, especially in the early stages of investigation, it may be impossible to immediately determine whether information collected is relevant and necessary, and information that initially appears irrelevant and unnecessary often may, upon further evaluation or upon collation with information developed subsequently, prove particularly relevant to a law enforcement program.
            (ii) Not all violations of law discovered by the Department fall within the investigative jurisdiction of the Department of the Treasury. To promote effective law enforcement, the Department will have to disclose such violations to other law enforcement agencies, including State, local and foreign agencies, that have jurisdiction over the offenses to which the information relates. Otherwise, the Department might be placed in the position of having to ignore information relating to violations of law not within the jurisdiction of the Department of the Treasury when that information comes to the Department's attention during the collation and analysis of information in its records.
            (8) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(2) requires an agency to collect information to the greatest extent practicable directly from the subject individual when the information may result in adverse determinations about an individual's rights, benefits, and privileges under Federal programs. The application of this provision to the systems of records would impair the Department's ability to collate, analyze, and disseminate investigative, intelligence, and enforcement information.
            (i) Most information collected about an individual under criminal investigation is obtained from third parties, such as witnesses and informants. It is usually not feasible to rely upon the subject of the investigation as a source for information regarding his criminal activities.
            (ii) An attempt to obtain information from the subject of a criminal investigation will often alert that individual to the existence of an investigation, thereby affording the individual an opportunity to attempt to conceal his criminal activities so as to avoid apprehension.
            (iii) In certain instances, the subject of a criminal investigation may assert his/her constitutional right to remain silent and refuse to supply information to criminal investigators upon request.
            (iv) During criminal investigations it is often a matter of sound investigative procedure to obtain information from a variety of sources to verify information already obtained from the subject of a criminal investigation or other sources.

            (9) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(3) requires an agency to inform each individual whom it asks to supply information, on the form that it uses to collect the information or on a separate form that the individual can retain, of the agency's authority for soliciting the information; whether disclosure of information is voluntary or mandatory; the principal purposes for which the agency will use the information; the routine uses that may be made of the information; and the effects on the individual of not providing all or part of the information. The systems of records should be exempted from this provision to avoid impairing the Department's ability to collect and collate investigative, intelligence, and enforcement data.
            (i) Confidential sources or undercover law enforcement officers often obtain information under circumstances in which it is necessary to keep the true purpose of their actions secret so as not to let the subject of the investigation or his or her associates know that a criminal investigation is in progress.
            (ii) If it became known that the undercover officer was assisting in a criminal investigation, that officer's physical safety could be endangered through reprisal, and that officer may not be able to continue working on the investigation.
            (iii) Individuals often feel inhibited in talking to a person representing a criminal law enforcement agency but are willing to talk to a confidential source or undercover officer whom they believe are not involved in law enforcement activities.
            (iv) Providing a confidential source of information with written evidence that he or she was a source, as required by this provision, could increase the likelihood that the source of information would be subject to retaliation by the subject of the investigation.
            (v) Individuals may be contacted during preliminary information gathering, surveys, or compliance projects concerning the administration of the internal revenue laws before any individual is identified as the subject of an investigation. Informing the individual of the matters required by this provision would impede or compromise subsequent investigations.
            (10) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(5) requires an agency to maintain all records it uses in making any determination about any individual with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness as is reasonably necessary to assure fairness to the individual in the determination.
            (i) Since 5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(3) defines “maintain” to include “collect” and “disseminate,” application of this provision to the systems of records would hinder the initial collection of any information that could not, at the moment of collection, be determined to be accurate, relevant, timely, and complete. Similarly, application of this provision would seriously restrict the Department's ability to disseminate information pertaining to a possible violation of law to law enforcement and regulatory agencies. In collecting information during a criminal investigation, it is often impossible or unfeasible to determine accuracy, relevance, timeliness, or completeness prior to collection of the information. In disseminating information to law enforcement and regulatory agencies, it is often impossible to determine accuracy, relevance, timeliness, or completeness prior to dissemination because the Department may not have the expertise with which to make such determinations.
            (ii) Information that may initially appear inaccurate, irrelevant, untimely, or incomplete may, when collated and analyzed with other available information, become more pertinent as an investigation progresses. In addition, application of this provision could seriously impede criminal investigators and intelligence analysts in the exercise of their judgment in reporting results obtained during criminal investigations.
            (11) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(8) requires an agency to make reasonable efforts to serve notice on an individual when the agency makes any record on the individual available to any person under compulsory legal process, when such process becomes a matter of public record. The systems of records should be exempted from this provision to avoid revealing investigative techniques and procedures outlined in those records and to prevent revelation of the existence of an ongoing investigation where there is need to keep the existence of the investigation secret.

            (12) 5 U.S.C. 552a(g) provides for civil remedies to an individual when an agency wrongfully refuses to amend a record or to review a request for amendment, when an agency wrongfully refuses to grant access to a record, when an agency fails to maintain accurate, relevant, timely, and complete records which are used to make a determination adverse to the individual, and when an agency fails to comply with any other provision of 5 U.S.C. 552a so as to adversely affect the individual. The systems of records should be exempted from this provision to the extent that the civil remedies may relate to provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a from which these rules exempt the systems of records, since there should be no civil remedies for failure to comply with provisions from which the Department is exempted. Exemption from this provision will also protect the Department from baseless civil court actions that might hamper its ability to collate, analyze, and disseminate investigative, intelligence, and law enforcement data.
            (e) Specific exemptions under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1). (1) Under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1), the head of any agency may promulgate rules to exempt any system of records within the agency from certain provisions of the Privacy Act to the extent that the system contains information subject to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1). This paragraph applies to the following systems of records maintained by the Department of the Treasury:
            (i) Departmental Offices:

            (2) The Department of the Treasury hereby exempts the systems of records listed in paragraph (e)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section from the following provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1): 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1), (2), (3), and (4), 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1), 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), and 5 U.S.C. 552a(f).
            (f) Reasons for exemptions under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1). The reason for invoking the exemption is to protect material authorized to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy pursuant to Executive Orders 12958, 13526, or successor or prior Executive Orders.
            (g) Specific exemptions under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). (1) Under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), the head of any agency may promulgate rules to exempt any system of records within the agency from certain provisions of the Privacy Act if the system is investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes and for the purposes of assuring the safety of individuals protected by the Department pursuant to the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 3056. This paragraph applies to the following systems of records maintained by the Department of the Treasury:
            (i) Treasury:

            (2) The Department hereby exempts the systems of records listed in paragraphs (g)(1)(i) through (x) of this section from the following provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2): 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1), (2), (3), (4), 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1), 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), and 5 U.S.C. 552a(f).
            (h) Reasons for exemptions under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). (1) 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) requires an agency to make accountings of disclosures of a record available to the individual named in the record upon his or her request. The accountings must state the date, nature, and purpose of each disclosure of the record and the name and address of the recipient.

            (i) The application of this provision would impair the ability of the Department of the Treasury and of law enforcement agencies outside the Department to make effective use of information maintained by the Department. Making accountings of disclosures available to the subjects of an investigation would alert them to the fact that an agency is conducting an investigation into their illegal activities and could reveal the geographic location of the investigation, the nature and purpose of that investigation, and the dates on which that investigation was active. Individuals possessing such knowledge would be able to take measures to avoid detection or apprehension by altering their operations, by transferring their illegal activities to other geographical areas, or by destroying or concealing evidence that would form the basis for detection or apprehension. In the case of a delinquent account, such release might enable the subject of the investigation to dissipate assets before levy.
            
            (ii) Providing accountings to the subjects of investigations would alert them to the fact that the Department has information regarding their illegal activities and could inform them of the general nature of that information.
            (2) 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1), (e)(4)(H) and (f)(2), (3) and (5) grant individuals access to records pertaining to them. The application of these provisions to the systems of records would compromise the Department's ability to utilize and provide useful tactical and strategic information to law enforcement agencies.
            (i) Permitting access to records contained in the systems of records would provide individuals with information concerning the nature of any current investigations and would enable them to avoid detection or apprehension by:
            (A) Discovering the facts that would form the basis for their detection or apprehension;
            (B) Enabling them to destroy or alter evidence of illegal conduct that would form the basis for their detection or apprehension, and
            (C) Using knowledge that investigators had reason to believe that a violation of law was about to be committed, to delay the commission of the violation or commit it at a location that might not be under surveillance.
            (ii) Permitting access to either on-going or closed investigative files would also reveal investigative techniques and procedures, the knowledge of which could enable individuals planning non-criminal acts to structure their operations so as to avoid detection or apprehension.
            (iii) Permitting access to investigative files and records could, moreover, disclose the identity of confidential sources and informants and the nature of the information supplied and thereby endanger the physical safety of those sources by exposing them to possible reprisals for having provided the information. Confidential sources and informants might refuse to provide investigators with valuable information unless they believed that their identities would not be revealed through disclosure of their names or the nature of the information they supplied. Loss of access to such sources would seriously impair the Department's ability to carry out its mandate.
            (iv) Furthermore, providing access to records contained in the systems of records could reveal the identities of undercover law enforcement officers or other persons who compiled information regarding the individual's illegal activities and thereby endanger the physical safety of those undercover officers, persons, or their families by exposing them to possible reprisals.
            (v) By compromising the law enforcement value of the systems of records for the reasons outlined in paragraphs (h)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section, permitting access in keeping with these provisions would discourage other law enforcement and regulatory agencies, foreign and domestic, from freely sharing information with the Department and thus would restrict the Department's access to information necessary to accomplish its mission most effectively.
            (vi) Finally, the dissemination of certain information that the Department may maintain in the systems of records is restricted by law.
            (3) 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(2), (3) and (4), (e)(4)(H), and (f)(4) permit an individual to request amendment of a record pertaining to him or her and require the agency either to amend the record, or to note the disputed portion of the record and to provide a copy of the individual's statement of disagreement with the agency's refusal to amend a record to persons or other agencies to whom the record is thereafter disclosed. Since these provisions depend on the individual having access to his or her records, and since these rules exempt the systems of records from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a relating to access to records, these provisions should not apply to the systems of records for the reasons set out in paragraph (h)(2) of this section.

            (4) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1) requires an agency to maintain in its records only such information about an individual as is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the agency required by statute or executive order. The term “maintain,” as defined in 5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(3), includes “collect” and “disseminate.” The application of this provision to the system of records could impair the Department's ability to collect, utilize and disseminate valuable law enforcement information.
            (i) In many cases, especially in the early stages of investigation, it may be impossible immediately to determine whether information collected is relevant and necessary, and information that initially appears irrelevant and unnecessary often may, upon further evaluation or upon collation with information developed subsequently, prove particularly relevant to a law enforcement program.
            (ii) Not all violations of law discovered by the Department analysts fall within the investigative jurisdiction of the Department of the Treasury. To promote effective law enforcement, the Department will have to disclose such violations to other law enforcement agencies, including State, local and foreign agencies that have jurisdiction over the offenses to which the information relates. Otherwise, the Department might be placed in the position of having to ignore information relating to violations of law not within the jurisdiction of the Department of the Treasury when that information comes to the Department's attention during the collation and analysis of information in its records.
            (5) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(G) and (f)(1) enable individuals to inquire whether a system of records contains records pertaining to them. Application of these provisions to the systems of records would allow individuals to learn whether they have been identified as suspects or subjects of investigation. As further described in the following paragraph, access to such knowledge would impair the Department's ability to carry out its mission, since individuals could:
            (i) Take steps to avoid detection;
            (ii) Inform associates that an investigation is in progress;
            (iii) Learn the nature of the investigation;
            (iv) Learn whether they are only suspects or identified as law violators;
            (v) Begin, continue, or resume illegal conduct upon learning that they are not identified in the system of records; or
            (vi) Destroy evidence needed to prove the violation.
            (6) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(I) requires an agency to publish a general notice listing the categories of sources for information contained in a system of records. The application of this provision to the systems of records could compromise the Department's ability to complete or continue investigations or to provide useful information to law enforcement agencies, since revealing sources for the information could:
            (i) Disclose investigative techniques and procedures;
            (ii) Result in threats or reprisals against informants by the subjects of investigations; and
            (iii) Cause informants to refuse to give full information to investigators for fear of having their identities as sources disclosed.
            (i) Specific exemptions under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(4). (1) Under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(4), the head of any agency may promulgate rules to exempt any system of records within the agency from certain provisions of the Privacy Act if the system is required by statute to be maintained and used solely as statistical records. This paragraph applies to the following system of records maintained by the Department, for which exemption is claimed under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(4).
            Internal Revenue Service:
            
              
                Number
                System name
              
              
                IRS 70.001
                Statistics of Income—Individual Tax Returns.
              
            
            (2) The Department hereby exempts the system of records listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this section from the following provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(4): 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1), (2), (3), and (4), 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1), 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), and 5 U.S.C. 552a(f).

            (3) The system of records is maintained under section 6108 of the Internal Revenue Code, which provides that “the Secretary or his delegate shall prepare and publish annually statistics reasonably available with respect to the operation of the income tax laws, including classifications of taxpayers and of income, the amounts allowed as deductions, exemptions, and credits, and any other facts deemed pertinent and valuable.”
            (j) Reasons for exemptions under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(4). The reason for exempting the system of records is that disclosure of statistical records (including release of accounting for disclosures) would in most instances be of no benefit to a particular individual since the records do not have a direct effect on a given individual.
            (k) Specific exemptions under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5). (1) Under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5), the head of any agency may promulgate rules to exempt any system of records within the agency from certain provisions of the Privacy Act if the system is investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, and qualifications for Federal civilian employment or access to classified information, but only to the extent that the disclosure of such material would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, or, prior to September 27, 1975, under an implied promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence. Thus to the extent that the records in this system can be disclosed without revealing the identity of a confidential source, they are not within the scope of this exemption and are subject to all the requirements of the Privacy Act. This paragraph applies to the following systems of records maintained by the Department or one of its bureaus:
            (i) Treasury:
            
              
                Number

            (ii) Departmental Offices:
            
              
                Number
                System name

                TIGTA Recruiting and Placement.
              
            
            (iii) Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau.
            (iv) Comptroller of the Currency.
            (v) Bureau of Engraving and Printing.
            (vi) Financial Management Service.
            (vii) Internal Revenue Service:
            
              
                Number
                System name

            (ix) Bureau of the Public Debt.
            (x) Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.
            (2) The Department hereby exempts the systems of records listed in paragraph (k)(1)(i) through (x) of this section from the following provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5): 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1), (2), (3), and (4), 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1), 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), and 5 U.S.C. 552a(f).
            (l) Reasons for exemptions under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5). (1) The sections of 5 U.S.C. 552a from which the systems of records are exempt include in general those providing for individuals' access to or amendment of records. When such access or amendment would cause the identity of a confidential source to be revealed, it would impair the future ability of the Department to compile investigatory material for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for Federal civilian employment, Federal contracts, or access to classified information. In addition, the systems shall be exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1) which requires that an agency maintain in its records only such information about an individual as is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the agency required to be accomplished by statute or executive order. The Department believes that to fulfill the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1) would unduly restrict the agency in its information gathering inasmuch as it is often not until well after the investigation that it is possible to determine the relevance and necessity of particular information.
            (2) If any investigatory material contained in the above-named systems becomes involved in criminal or civil matters, exemptions of such material under 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) or (k)(2) is hereby claimed.
            (m) Exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(6). (1) Under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(6), the head of any agency may promulgate rules to exempt any system of records that is testing or examination material used solely to determine individual qualifications for appointment or promotion in the Federal service the disclosure of which would compromise the objectivity or fairness of the testing or examination process. This paragraph applies to the following system of records maintained by the Department, for which exemption is claimed under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(6).
            Departmental Officers:
            
              
                Number
                System name

                TIGTA Recruiting and Placement Records.
              
            
            (2) The Department hereby exempts the system of records listed in paragraphs (m)(1) of this section from the following provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(6): 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1), (2), (3), and (4), 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1), 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), and 5 U.S.C. 552a(f).
            (n) Reasons for exemptions under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(6). The reason for exempting the system of records is that disclosure of the material in the system would compromise the objectivity or fairness of the examination process.
            (o) Exempt information included in another system. Any information from a system of records for which an exemption is claimed under 5 U.S.C. 552a(j) or (k) which is also included in another system of records retains the same exempt status such information has in the system for which such exemption is claimed.

            8. Verification of identity. An individual seeking notification or access to records, or seeking to amend a record, must satisfy one of the following identification requirements before action will be taken by the Departmental Offices on any such request:
            (i) An individual seeking notification or access to records in person, or seeking to amend a record in person, may establish identity by the presentation of a single official document bearing a photograph (such as a passport or identification badge) or by the presentation of two items of identification which do not bear a photograph but do bear both a name and signature (such as a driver's license or credit card).
            (ii) An individual seeking notification or access to records by mail, or seeking to amend a record by mail, may establish identity by a signature, address, and one other identifier such as a photocopy of a driver's license or other official document bearing the individual's signature.
            (iii) Notwithstanding subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph, an individual seeking notification or access to records by mail or in person, or seeking to amend a record by mail or in person, who so desires, may establish identity by providing a notarized statement, swearing or affirming to such individual's identity and to the fact that the individual understands the penalties provided in 5 U.S.C. 552a(i)(3) for requesting or obtaining access to records under false pretenses.
            Notwithstanding subdivision (i), (ii), or (iii) of this subparagraph, a designated official may require additional proof of an individual's identity before action will be taken on any request, if such official determines that it is necessary to protect against unauthorized disclosure of information in a particular case. In addition, a parent of any minor or a legal guardian of any individual will be required to provide adequate proof of legal relationship before such person may act on behalf of such minor or such individual.

            Pt. 1, Subpt. C, App. B
            Appendix B to Subpart C of Part 1—Internal Revenue Service
            1. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to set forth the procedures that have been established by the Internal Revenue Service for individuals to exercise their rights under the Privacy Act of 1974 (88 Stat. 1896) with respect to systems of records maintained by the Internal Revenue Service, including the Office of the Chief Counsel. The procedures contained in this section are to be promulgated under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 552a(f). The procedures contained in this section relate to the following:
            (a) The procedures whereby an individual can be notified in response to a request if a system of records named by the individual contains a record pertaining to such individual (5 U.S.C. 552a(f)(1)).
            (b) The procedures governing reasonable times, places, and requirements for identifying an individual who requests a record of information pertaining to such individual before the Internal Revenue Service will make the record or information available to the individual (5 U.S.C. 552a (f)(2)).
            (c) The procedures for the disclosure to an individual upon a request of a record of information pertaining to such individual, including special procedures for the disclosure to an individual of medical records, including psychological records. (5 U.S.C. 552a (f)(3)).
            (d) The procedures for reviewing a request from an individual concerning the amendment of any record or information pertaining to the individual, for making a determination on the request, for an appeal within the Internal Revenue Service of an initial adverse agency determination, and for whatever additional means may be necessary for individuals to be able to exercise fully their right under 5 U.S.C. 552a (5 U.S.C. 552a (f)(4)).
            Any individual seeking to determine whether a system of records maintained by any office of the Internal Revenue Service contains a record or information pertaining to such individual, or seeking access to, or amendment of, such a record, must comply fully with the applicable procedure contained in paragraph (3) or (4) of this section before the Internal Revenue Service will act on the request. Neither the notification and access (or accounting of disclosures) procedures under paragraph (3) of this section nor the amendment procedures under paragraph (4) of this section are applicable to (i) systems of records exempted pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (j) and (k), (ii) information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding (see 5 U.S.C. 552a (d)(5)), or (iii) information pertaining to an individual which is contained in, and inseparable from, another individual's record.
            2. Access to and amendment of tax records. The provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 may not be used by an individual to amend or correct any tax record. The determination of liability for taxes imposed by the Internal Revenue Service Code, the collection of such taxes, and the payment (including credits or refunds of overpayments) of such taxes are governed by the provisions of the Internal Revenue Service Code and by the procedural rules of the Internal Revenue Service. These provisions set forth the established procedures governing the determination of liability for tax, the collection of such taxes, and the payment (including credits or refunds of overpayments) of such taxes. In addition, these provisions set forth the procedures (including procedures for judicial review) for resolving disputes between taxpayers and the Internal Revenue Service involving the amount of tax owed, or the payment or collection of such tax. These procedures are the exclusive means available to an individual to contest the amount of any liability for tax or the payment or collection thereof. See, for example, 26 CFR 601.103 for summary of general tax procedures. Individuals are advised that Internal Revenue Service procedures permit the examination of tax records during the course of an investigation, audit, or collection activity. Accordingly, individuals should contact the Internal Revenue Service employee conducting an audit or effecting the collection of tax liabilities to gain access to such records, rather than seeking access under the provisions of the Privacy Act. Where, on the other hand, an individual desires information or records not in connection with an investigation, audit, or collection activity, the individual may follow these procedures.
            3. Procedures for access to records—(a) In general. This paragraph sets forth the procedure whereby an individual can be notified in response to a request if a system of records named by the individual which is maintained by the Internal Revenue Service contains a record pertaining to such individual. In addition, this paragraph sets forth the procedure for the disclosure to an individual upon a request of a record or information pertaining to such individual, including the procedures for verifying the identity of the individual before the Internal Revenue Service will make a record available, and the procedure for requesting an accounting of disclosures of such records. An individual seeking to determine whether a particular system of records contains a record or records pertaining to such individual and seeking access to such records (or seeking an accounting of disclosures of such records) shall make a request for notification and access (or a request for an accounting of disclosures) in accordance with the rules provided in paragraph 3(b) of this section.
            (b) Form of request for notification and access or request for an accounting of disclosures. (i) A request for notification and access (or request for an accounting of disclosures) shall be made in writing and shall be signed by the person making the request.
            (ii) Such request shall be clearly marked, “Request for notification and access,” or “Request for accounting of disclosures.”

            (iii) Such a request shall contain a statement that it is being made under the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974.
            
            (iv) Such request shall contain the name and address of the individual making the request. In addition, if a particular system employs an individual's social security number as an essential means of accessing the system, the request must include the individual's social security number. In the case of a record maintained in the name of two or more individuals (e.g., husband and wife), the request shall contain the names, addresses, and social security numbers (if necessary) of both individuals.
            (v) Such request shall specify the name and location of the particular system of records (as set forth in the Notice of Systems) for which the individual is seeking notification and access (or an accounting of disclosures), and the title and business address of the official designated in the access section for the particular system (as set forth in the Notice of Systems). In the case of two or more systems of records which are under the control of the same designated official at the same systems location, a single request may be made for such systems. In the case of two or more systems of records which are not in the control of the same designated official at the same systems location, a separate request must be made for each such system.
            (vi) If an individual wishes to limit a request for notification and access to a particular record or records, the request should identify the particular record. In the absence of a statement to the contrary, a request for notification and access for a particular system of records shall be considered to be limited to records which are currently maintained by the designated official at the systems location specified in the request.
            (vii) If such request is seeking notification and access to material maintained in a system of records which is exempt from disclosure and access under 5 U.S.C. 552a (k)(2), the individual making the request must establish that such individual has been denied a right, privilege, or benefit that such individual would otherwise be entitled to under Federal law as a result of the maintenance of such material.
            (viii) Such request shall state whether the individual wishes to inspect the record in person, or desires to have a copy made and furnished without first inspecting it. If the individual desires to have a copy made, the request must include an agreement to pay the fee for duplication ultimately determined to be due. If the individual does not wish to inspect a record, but merely wishes to be notified whether a particular system or records contains a record pertaining to such individual, the request should so state.
            (c) Time and place for making a request. A request for notification and access to records under the Privacy Act (or a request for accounting of disclosures) shall be addressed to or delivered in person to the office of the official designated in the access section for the particular system of records for which the individual is seeking notification and access (or an accounting of disclosures). The title and office address of such official is set forth for each system of records in the Notice of Systems of Records. A request delivered to an office in person must be delivered during the regular office hours of that office.
            (d) Sample request for notification and access to records. The following are sample requests for notification and access to records which will satisfy the requirements of this paragraph:
            Request for Notification and Access to Records by Mail

            I, John Doe, of 100 Main Street, Boston, MA 02108 (soc. sec. num. 000-00-0000) request under the Privacy Act of 1974 that the following system of records be examined and that I be furnished with a copy of any record (or a specified record) contained therein pertaining to me. I agree that I will pay the fees ultimately determined to be due for duplication of such record. I have enclosed the necessary information.
            
            System Name:
            System Location:
            Designated Official:
            
            
            John Doe 
            
            Request for Notification and Access to Records in Person

            I, John Doe, of 100 Main Street, Boston, MA 02108 (soc. sec. num. 000-00-0000) request under the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, that the following system of records be examined and that I be granted access in person to inspect any record (or a specified record) contained therein pertaining to me. I have enclosed the necessary identification.
            
            System Name:
            System Location:
            Designated Official:
            
            
            John Doe  
            
            (e) Processing a request for notification and access to records or a request for an accounting of disclosures. (i) If a request for notification and access (or request for an accounting of disclosures) omits any information which is essential to processing the request, the request will not be acted upon and the individual making the request will be promptly advised of the additional information which must be submitted before the request can be processed.

            (ii) Within 30 days (not including Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the receipt of a request for notification and access (or a request for an accounting of disclosures), to a particular system of records by the designated official for such system, a determination will be made as to whether the particular system of records is exempt from the notification and access provisions of the Privacy Act, and if such system is not exempt, whether it does or does not contain a record pertaining to the individual making the request. If a determination cannot be made within 30 days, the individual will be notified of the delay, the reasons therefor, and the approximate time required to make a determination. If it is determined by the designated official that the particular system of records is exempt from the notification and access provisions of the Privacy Act, the individual making the request will be notified of the provisions of the Privacy Act under which the exemption is claimed. On the other hand, if it is determined by the designated official that the particular system of records is not exempted from the notification and access provisions of the Privacy Act and that such system contains a record pertaining to the individual making the request, the individual will be notified of the time and place where inspection may be made. If an individual has not requested that access be granted to inspect the record in person, but merely requests that a copy of the record be furnished, or if it is determined by the designated official that the granting of access to inspect a record in person is not feasible in a particular case, then the designated official will furnish a copy of the record with the notification, or if a copy cannot be furnished at such time, a statement indicating the approximate time such copy will be furnished. If the request is for an accounting of disclosures from a system of records which is not exempt from the accounting of disclosure provisions of the Privacy Act, the individual will be furnished with an accounting of such disclosures.
            (f) Granting of access. Normally, an individual will be granted access to inspect a record in person within 30 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the receipt for a request for notification and access by the designated official. If access cannot be granted within 30 days, the notification will state the reasons for the delay and the approximate time such access will be granted. An individual wishing to inspect a record may be accompanied by another person of his choosing. Both the individual seeking access and the individual accompanying him may be required to sign a form supplied by the IRS indicating that the Service is authorized to disclose or discuss the contents of the record in the presence of both individuals. See 26 CFR 601.502 for requirements to be met by taxpayer's representatives in order to discuss the contents of any tax records.
            (g) Medical records. When access is requested to medical records (including psychological records), the designated official may determine that release of such records will be made only to a physician designated by the individual to have access to such records.
            (h) Verification of identity. An individual seeking notification or access to records, or seeking to amend a record, must satisfy one of the following identification requirements before action will be taken by the IRS on any such request:
            (i) An individual seeking notification or access to records in person, or seeking to amend a record in person, may establish identity by the presentation of a single document bearing a photograph (such as a passport or identification badge) or by the presentation of two items of identification which do not bear a photograph but do bear both a name and signature (such as a driver's license or credit card).
            (ii) An individual seeking notification or access to records by mail, or seeking to amend a record by mail, may establish identity by a signature, address, and one other identifier such as a photocopy of a driver's license or other document bearing the individual's signature.
            (iii) Notwithstanding subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph, an individual seeking notification or access to records by mail or in person, or seeking to amend a record by mail or in person, who so desires, may establish identity by providing a notarized statement, swearing or affirming to such individual's identity and to the fact that the individual understands the penalties provided in 5 U.S.C. 552a(i)(3) for requesting or obtaining access to records under false pretenses.
            (iv) Notwithstanding subdivisions (i), (ii), or (iii) of this subparagraph, a designated official may require additional proof of an individual's identity before action will be taken on any request if such official determines that it is necessary to protect unauthorized disclosure of information in a particular case. In addition, a parent of any minor or a legal guardian of any individual will be required to provide adequate proof of legal relationship before such person may act on behalf of such minor or such individual.
            (i) Fees. The fee for costs required of the IRS in copying records pursuant to this paragraph is $0.15 per page. However, no fee will be charged if the aggregate costs required of the IRS in copying records is less than $3.00. If an individual who has requested access to inspect a record in person is denied such access by the designated official because it would not be feasible in a particular case, copies of such record will be furnished to the individual without payment of the fees otherwise required under this subparagraph. If the IRS estimates that the total fees for costs incurred in complying with a request for copies of records will amount to $50 or more, the individual making the request may be required to enter into a contract for the payment of the actual fees with respect to the request before the Service will furnish the copies requested. Payment of fees for copies of records should be made by check or money order payable to the Internal Revenue Service.
            4. Procedures for amendment of records. (a) In general. This paragraph sets forth the procedures for reviewing a request from an individual concerning the amendment of any record or information pertaining to such individual, for making a determination on the request, for making an appeal within the IRS of an initial adverse determination, and for judicial review of a final determination.
            (b) Amendment of record. Under 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(2), an individual who has been granted access to a record pertaining to such individual may, after inspecting the record, request that the record be amended to make any correction of any portion thereof which the individual believes is not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete. An individual may seek to amend a record in accordance with the rules provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. See paragraph (b) of this section for prohibition against amendment of tax records.
            (c) Form of request for amendment of record. (i) A request for amendment of a record shall be in writing and shall be signed by the individual making the request.
            (ii) Such request shall be clearly marked “Request for amendment of record.”
            (iii) Such request shall contain a statement that it is being made under the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974.
            (iv) Such request shall contain the name and address of the individual making the request. In addition, if a particular system employs an individual's social security number as an essential means of accessing the system, the request must include the individual's social security number. In the case of a record maintained in the name of two or more individuals (e.g., husband and wife), the request shall contain the names, addresses, and social security numbers (if necessary) of both individuals.
            (v) Such request shall specify the name and location of the system of records (as set forth in the Notice of Systems) in which such record is maintained, and the title and business address of the official designated in the access section for such system (as set forth in the Notice of Systems).
            (vi) Such request shall specify the particular record in the system which the individual is seeking to amend.
            (vii) Such request shall clearly state the specific changes which the individual wishes to make in the record and a concise explanation of the reasons for the changes. If the individual wishes to correct or add any information, the request shall contain specific language making the desired correction or addition.
            (d) Time and place for making request. A request to amend a record under the Privacy Act shall be addressed to or delivered in person to the office of the official designated in the access section for the particular system of records. The title and office address of such official is set forth for each system of records in the Notice of Systems of Records. A request delivered to an office in person must be delivered during the regular office hours of that office.
            (e) Processing a request for amendment of a record. (i) Within 10 days (not including Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the receipt of a request to amend a record by the designated official, the individual will be sent a written acknowledgement that will state that the request has been received, that action is being taken thereon, and that the individual will be notified within 30 days (not including Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the receipt of the request whether the requested amendments will or will not be made. If a request for amendment of a record omits any information which is essential to processing the request, the request will not be acted upon and the individual making the request will be promptly advised on the additional information which must be submitted before the request can be processed.

            (ii) Within 30 days (not including Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the receipt of a request to amend a record by the designated official, a determination will be made as to whether to grant the request in whole or part. The individual will then be notified in writing of the determination. If a determination cannot be made within 30 days, the individual will be notified in writing within such time of the reasons for the delay and the approximate time required to make a determination. If it is determined by the designated official that the request will be granted, the requested changes will be made in the record and the individual will be notified of the changes. In addition, to the extent an accounting was maintained, all prior recipients of such record will be notified of the changes. Upon request, an individual will be furnished with a copy of the record, as amended, subject to the payment of the appropriate fees. On the other hand, if it is determined by the designated official that the request, or any portion thereof, will not be granted, the individual will be notified in writing of the adverse determination. The notification of an adverse determination will set forth the reasons for refusal to amend the record. In addition, the notification will contain a statement informing the individual of such individual's right to request an independent review of the adverse determination by a reviewing officer in the national office of the IRS and the procedures for requesting such a review.
            (f) Administrative review of adverse determination. Under 5 U.S.C. 552a (d)(3), an individual who disagrees with the refusal of the agency to amend a record may, within 35 days of being notified of the adverse determination, request an independent review of such refusal by a reviewing officer in the national office of the IRS. The reviewing officer for the IRS is the Commission of Internal Revenue, the Deputy Commissioner, or an Assistant Commissioner. In the case of an adverse determination relating to a system of records maintained by the Office of General Counsel for the IRS, the reviewing officer is the Chief Counsel or his delegate. An individual seeking a review of an adverse determination shall make a request for review in accordance with the rules provided in paragraph (d)(7) of this section.

            (v) Such request shall specify the particular record which the individual is seeking to amend, the name and location of the system of records (as set forth in the Notice of Systems) in which such record is maintained, and the title and business address of the designated official for such system (as set forth in the Notice of Systems).
            (vi) Such request shall include the date of the initial request for amendment of the record, and the date of the letter notifying the individual of the initial adverse determination with respect to such request.
            (vii) such request shall clearly state the specific changes which the individual wishes to make in the record and a concise explanation of the reasons for the changes. If the individual wishes to correct or add any information, the request shall contain specific language making the desired correction or addition.
            (h) Time and place for making the request. A request for review of an adverse determination under the Privacy Act shall be addressed to or delivered in person to the Director, Office of Disclosure, Attention: OP:EX:D Internal Revenue Service, 1111 Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20224. A request for review of an adverse determination will be promptly referred by the Director, Office of Disclosure to the appropriate reviewing officer for his review and final determination.
            (i) Processing a request for review of adverse determination. Within 30 days (not including Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the receipt of a request for review of an adverse determination by the appropriate reviewing officer, the reviewing officer will review the initial adverse determination, make a final determination whether to grant the request to amend the record in whole or in part, and notify the individual in writing of the final determination. If a final determination cannot be made within 30 days, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue may extend such 30-day period. The individual will be notified in writing within the 30 day period of the cause for the delay and the approximate time required to make a final determination. If it is determined by the reviewing officer that the request to amend the record will be granted, the reviewing officer will cause the requested changes to be made and the individual will be so notified. Upon request, an individual will be furnished with a copy of the record as amended subject to the payment of appropriate fees. On the other hand, if it is determined by the reviewing officer that the request to amend the record, or any portion thereof, will not be granted, the individual will be notified in writing of the final adverse determination. The notification of a final adverse determination will set forth the reasons for the refusal of the reviewing officer to amend the record. The notification shall include a statement informing the individual of the right to submit a concise statement for insertion in the record setting forth the reasons for the disagreement with the refusal of the reviewing officer to amend the record. In addition, the notification will contain a statement informing the individual of the right to seek judicial review by a United States district court of a final adverse determination.
            (j) Statement of disagreement. Under 5 U.S.C. 552a (d)(3), an individual who disagrees with a final adverse determination not to amend a record subject to amendment under the Privacy Act may submit a concise statement for insertion in the record setting forth the reasons for disagreement with the refusal of the reviewing officer to amend the record. A statement of disagreement should be addressed to or delivered in person to the Director, Office of Disclosure, Attention: OP:EX:D, Internal Revenue Service, 1111 Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20224. The Director, Office of Disclosure will foward the statement of disagreement to the appropriate designated official who will cause the statement to be inserted in the individual's record. Any such statement will be available to anyone to whom the record is subsequently disclosed and the prior recipients of the record will be provided with a copy of the statement of disagreement, to the extent an accounting of disclosures was maintained.
            (k) Judicial review. If, after a review and final determination on a request to amend a record by the appropriate reviewing officer, the individual is notified that the request will not be granted, or if, after the expiration of 30 days (not including Sundays, Saturdays, and legal public holidays) from the receipt of such request by the Director, Disclosure Operations Division, action is not taken thereon in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (d)(9) of this section, an individual may commence an action within the time prescribed by law in a U.S. District Court pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (g)(1). The statute authorizes an action only against the agency. With respect to records maintained by the IRS, the agency is the Internal Revenue Service, not an officer or employee thereof. Service of process in such an action shall be in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 U.S.C. App.) applicable to actions against an agency of the United States. Where provided in such Rules, delivery of process upon the IRS must be directed to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Attention: CC:GLS, 1111 Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20224. The district court will determine the matter de novo.
            5. Records transferred to Federal Records Centers. Records transferred to the Administrator of General Services for storage in a Federal Records Center are not used by the Internal Revenue Service in making any determination about any individual while stored at such location and therefore are not subject to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a (e)(5) during such time.

          § 2.1
          Processing of mandatory declassification review requests.

          (a) Except as provided by section 3.4(b) of Executive Order 13292, Further Amendment to Executive Order 12958, as amended, Classified National Security Information, all information classified by the Department of the Treasury under these Orders or any predecessor Executive Order shall be subject to mandatory declassification review by the Department, if:
          (1) The request for a mandatory declassification review describes the document or material containing the information with sufficient specificity to enable Treasury personnel to locate it with a reasonable amount of effort;
          (2) The information is not exempt from search and review under sections 105C, 105D, or 701 of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 431, 432 and 432a); and
          (3) The information has not been reviewed for declassification within the past 2 years or the information is not the subject of pending litigation.
          (b) Requests for classified records originated by the Department of the Treasury shall be directed to the Office of Security Programs, Attention: Assistant Director (Information Security), 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20220. Upon receipt of each request for mandatory declassification review, pursuant to section 3.5 of Executive Order 13292, the following procedures will apply:
          (1) The Office of Security Programs will acknowledge receipt of the request.
          (2)(i) A mandatory declassification review request need not identify the requested information by date or title of the responsive records, but must be of sufficient specificity to allow Treasury personnel to locate records containing the information sought with a reasonable amount of effort. Whenever a request does not reasonably describe the information sought, the requester will be notified by the Office of Security Programs that unless additional information is provided or the scope of the request is narrowed, no further action will be undertaken with respect to the request.
          (ii) If Treasury has reviewed the information within the past 2 years and determined that all or part thereof remains classified, or the information is the subject of pending litigation, the requester shall be so informed and advised of the requester's appeal rights.
          (3) The Office of Security Programs will determine the appropriate Treasury offices or bureaus to conduct the mandatory declassification review. The Office of Security Programs will also advise Treasury and/or bureau reviewing officials concerning the mandatory declassification review process. Classified information relating to intelligence activities (including special activities), intelligence sources or methods, or cryptology will also be coordinated with the Office of the Assistant Secretary (Intelligence and Analysis). As appropriate, the Office of Security Programs will refer requests to other Federal departments and agencies having a direct interest in the requested documents.

          (4)(i) Treasury personnel undertaking a mandatory declassification review shall make reasonable efforts to determine if particular information may be declassified. Reviewing officials may rely on applicable exemption criteria under the Freedom of Information Act, the Privacy Act, and any other applicable law that authorizes the withholding of information. Reviewing officials shall also identify the amount of search and review time required to process each request. Barring extenuating circumstances, mandatory declassification reviews for reasonably small volumes of records should be completed in a timely fashion. A final determination regarding large volumes of records should ordinarily be made within one year of Treasury's receipt of any mandatory declassification review request.
          (ii) If the Director, Office of Security Programs determines that a Treasury office or bureau responsible for conducting a mandatory declassification review is not making reasonable efforts to review classified information subject to a mandatory declassification request, the Director may authorize Treasury-and/or bureau-originated information to be declassified in consultation with the Department's Senior Agency Official.
          (iii) If information cannot be declassified in its entirety, reasonable efforts, consistent with applicable law, will be made to release those declassified portions of the requested information that constitute a coherent segment. Upon the denial or partial denial of a declassification request, the requester will be so informed by the Office of Security Programs and advised of the requester's appeal rights.
          (5)(i) If Treasury receives a mandatory declassification review request for information in its possession that were originated by another Federal department or agency, the Office of Security Programs will forward the request to that department or agency for a declassification determination, together with a copy of the requested records, a recommendation concerning a declassification determination, and a request to be advised of that department's or agency's declassification determination. The Office of Security Programs may, after consultation with the originating department or agency, inform any requester of the referral unless such association is itself classified under Executive Order 13292 or prior orders.
          (ii) Mandatory declassification review requests concerning classified information originated by a Treasury office or bureau that has been transferred to another Federal department or agency will be forwarded to the appropriate successor department or agency for a declassification determination.
          (6) If another Federal department or agency forwards a mandatory declassification review request to Treasury for information in its custody that was classified by Treasury, the Office of Security Programs will:
          (i) Advise the referring department or agency as to whether it may notify the requester of the referral; and
          (ii) Respond to the Federal department, agency, or requester, as applicable, in accordance with the requirements of this section.
          (7)(i) Upon the denial, in whole or in part, of a request for the mandatory declassification review of information, the Office of Security Programs will so notify the requester in writing and will inform the requester of the right to appeal the classification determination within 60 calendar days of the receipt of the classification determination. The notice will also advise the requester of the name and address of the Treasury official who will be responsible for deciding an appeal (the Deciding Official). The Office of Security Programs will coordinate appeals with the appropriate Treasury offices and bureaus.
          (ii) The Deciding Official should make a determination on an appeal within 30 working days following the receipt of the appeal, or within 60 working days following receipt if the Deciding Official determines that additional time is required to make a determination and so notifies the requester. The Deciding Official should notify the requester in writing of Treasury's determination on appeal and, if applicable, the reasons for any whole or partial denial of the appeal. The Office of Security Programs will also notify the requester of their right of a final appeal to the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel, as appropriate, under 32 CFR 2001.33.
          (8)(i) Treasury may charge fees for search, review, and duplicating costs in connection with a mandatory declassification review request.

          (A) The fee for services of Treasury personnel involved in locating and/or reviewing records will be charged at the rate of a GS-11, Step 1 employee, in the Washington-Baltimore Federal pay area, in effect when the mandatory declassification review request is received by the Office of Security Programs for searches that take more than two hours or for review times that are greater than two hours. Fees may be waived, in writing, by a bureau head or the equivalent Treasury official at the Assistant Secretary level.
          (B) There is no fee for duplicating the first 100 pages of fully or partially releasable documents. The cost of additional pages is 20 cents per page. No charges shall be levied for search and/or review time requiring less than 2 hours.
          (ii) If it is estimated that the fees associated with a mandatory declassification review will exceed $100, the Office of Security Programs will notify the requester in writing of the estimated costs and shall obtain satisfactory written assurance of full payment or require the requester to make an advance payment of the entire estimated fee before proceeding to process the request. Treasury may request pre-payment where the fee is likely to exceed $500. After 60 calendar days without receiving the requester's written assurance of full payment or agreement to make pre-payment of estimated fees (or to amend the mandatory declassification review request in a manner as to result in fees acceptable to the requester), Treasury may administratively terminate the mandatory declassification review request. Failure of a requester to pay fees after billing will result in future requests not being honored. Nothing in this paragraph will preclude Treasury from taking any other lawful action to recover payment for costs incurred in processing a mandatory declassification review request.
          (iii) Payment of fees shall be made by check or money order to the Treasurer of the United States. Fees charged by Treasury for mandatory declassification review are separate and distinct from any other fees that may be imposed by a Presidential Library, the National Archives and Records Administration, or another Federal department or agency.
        
        
          § 2.2
          Access to classified information by historical researchers, former Treasury Presidential and Vice Presidential appointees, and former Presidents and Vice Presidents.
          (a) Access to classified information may be granted only to individuals who have a need-to-know the information. This requirement may be waived, however, for individuals who:
          (1) Are engaged in historical research projects;
          (2) Previously occupied a position in the Treasury to which they were appointed by the President under 3 U.S.C. 105(a)(2)(A), or the Vice President under 3 U.S.C. 106(a)(1)(A); or
          (3) Served as President or Vice President.
          (b) Access to classified information may be granted to individuals described in paragraph (a) of this section upon:
          (1) A written determination by Treasury's Senior Agency Official, under Section 5.4(d) of Executive Order 13292, that access is consistent with the interest of the national security; and
          (2) Receipt of the individual's written agreement to safeguard classified information, including taking all appropriate steps to protect classified information from unauthorized disclosure or compromise. This written agreement must also include the individual's consent to have any and all notes (including those prepared or stored in electronic media, whether written or oral) reviewed by authorized Treasury personnel to ensure that no classified information is contained therein and, if so, that the classified information is not published.
          (c)(i)(A) A historical researcher is not authorized to have access to foreign government information or information classified by another Federal department or agency.
          (B) A former Treasury Presidential or Vice Presidential appointee is only authorized access to classified information that the former official originated, reviewed, signed or received while serving as such an appointee.

          (C) A former President or Vice President is only authorized access to classified information that was prepared by Treasury while that individual was serving as President or Vice President.
          
          (ii) Granting access to classified information pursuant to this section does not constitute the granting of a security clearance for access to classified information.
          (d) Treasury personnel will coordinate access to classified information by individuals described in paragraph (a) of this section with the Director, Office of Security Programs, who will ensure that the written agreement described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section is signed as a condition of being granted access to classified information.
          (e) Any review of classified information by an individual described in paragraph (a) of this section shall take place in a location designated by the Director, Office of Security Programs. Such persons must be accompanied at all times by appropriately authorized Treasury personnel authorized to have access to the classified information being reviewed. All notes (including those prepared or stored in electronic media, whether written or oral) made by an individual described in paragraph (a) of this section shall remain in the custody of the Office of Security Programs pending a determination by appropriately cleared subject matter experts that no classified information is contained therein.
          (f) An individual described in paragraph (a) of this section is subject to search, as are all packages or carrying cases prior to entering or leaving Treasury. Access to Treasury-originated classified information at another Federal department or agency, as may be authorized by the Director, Office of Security Programs shall be governed by security protocols in effect at the other Federal department or agency.
          (g) Treasury personnel must perform a physical verification and an accounting of all classified information each time such information is viewed by an individual described in paragraph (a) of this section. Physical verification and an accounting of all classified information shall be made both prior to and after viewing. Any discrepancy must be immediately reported to the Director, Office of Security Programs.
          (h) An individual described in paragraph (a) of this section may be charged reasonable fees for services rendered by Treasury in connection with the review of classified information under this section. To the extent such services involve searching, reviewing, and copying material, the provisions of § 2.1(b)(8) shall apply.

          Subpart B—Claims Under the Small Claims Act
          
            § 3.20
            General.
            The Act of December 28, 1922, 42 Stat. 1066, the Small Claims Act, authorized the head of each department and establishment to consider, ascertain, adjust, and determine claims of $1,000 or less for damage to, or loss of, privately owned property caused by the negligence of any officer or employee of the Government acting within the scope of his employment. The Federal Tort Claims Act superseded the Small Claims Act with respect to claims that are allowable under the former act. Therefore, claims that are not allowable under the Federal Tort Claims Act, for example, claims arising abroad, may be allowable under the Small Claims Act.
          
          
            § 3.21
            Action by claimant.
            Procedures and requirements for filing claims under this section shall be the same as required for filing claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act as set forth in Subpart A of this part.
          
          
            § 3.22
            Legal review.
            Claims filed under this subpart shall be forwarded to the legal division of the bureau or office out of whose activities the claim arose. The claim, together with the reports of the employee and the investigation, shall be reviewed in the legal division which shall thereupon make a recommendation that the claim be approved, disapproved or compromised.
          
          
            § 3.23
            Approval of claims.
            Claims shall be approved, disapproved, or compromised by the head of the bureau or office or his designee, taking into consideration the recommendation of the legal division.
          
          
            § 3.24
            Statute of limitations.
            No claim will be considered under this subpart unless filed within 1 year from the date of the accrual of said claim.

            § 3.30
            Policy.
            (a) The Department of the Treasury may indemnify, in whole or in part, a Department employee (which for purposes of this regulation shall include a former employee) for any verdict, judgment or other monetary award rendered against such employee, provided the Secretary or his or her designee determines that (1) the conduct giving rise to such verdict, judgment or award was within the scope of his or her employment and (2) such indemnification is in the interest of the Department of the Treasury.
            (b) The Department of the Treasury may pay for the settlement or compromise of a claim against a Department employee at any time, provided the Secretary or his or her designee determines that (1) the alleged conduct giving rise to the claim was within the scope of the employee's employment and (2) such settlement or compromise is in the interest of the Department of the Treasury.
            (c) Absent exceptional circumstances, as determined by the Secretary or his or her designee, the Department will not entertain a request to indemnify or to pay for settlement of a claim before entry of an adverse judgment, verdict or other determination.
            (d) When a Department employee becomes aware that he or she has been named as a party in a proceeding in his or her individual capacity as a result of conduct within the scope of his or her employment, the employee should immediately notify his or her supervisor that such an action is pending. The supervisor shall promptly thereafter notify the chief legal officer of the employee's employing component. The employee shall immediately apprise the chief legal officer of his or her employing component of any offer to settle the proceeding.
            (e) A Department employee may request indemnification to satisfy a verdict, judgment or monetary award entered against the employee or to compromise a claim pending against the employee. The employee shall submit a written request, with appropriate documentation including a copy of the verdict, judgment, award or other order or settlement proposal, in a timely manner to the Secretary or his or her designee for decision.
            (f) Any payment under this section either to indemnify a Department employee or to settle a claim shall be contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds for the payment of salaries and expenses of the employing component.

            § 5.1
            What definitions apply to the regulations in this part?
            As used in this part:
            
              Administrative offset or offset means withholding funds payable by the United States (including funds payable by the United States on behalf of a State Government) to, or held by the United States for, a person to satisfy a debt owed by the person. The term “administrative offset” includes, but is not limited to, the offset of Federal salary, vendor, retirement, and Social Security benefit payments. The terms “centralized administrative offset” and “centralized offset” refer to the process by which the Treasury Department's Financial Management Service offsets Federal payments through the Treasury Offset Program.
            
              Administrative wage garnishment means the process by which a Federal agency orders a non-Federal employer to withhold amounts from a debtor's wages to satisfy a debt, as authorized by 31 U.S.C. 3720D, 31 CFR 285.11, and this part.
            
              Agency or Federal agency means a department, agency, court, court administrative office, or instrumentality in the executive, judicial, or legislative branch of the Federal Government, including government corporations.
            
              Creditor agency means any Federal agency that is owed a debt.
            
              Debt means any amount of money, funds or property that has been determined by an appropriate official of the Federal Government to be owed to the United States by a person. As used in this part, the term “debt” does not include debts arising under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.).
            
              Debtor means a person who owes a debt to the United States.
            
              Delinquent debt means a debt that has not been paid by the date specified in the agency's initial written demand for payment or applicable agreement or instrument (including a post-delinquency payment agreement) unless other satisfactory payment arrangements have been made.
            
              Delinquent Treasury debt means a delinquent debt owed to a Treasury entity.
            
            
              Disposable pay has the same meaning as that term is defined in 5 CFR 550.1103.
            
              Employee or Federal employee means a current employee of the Treasury Department or other Federal agency, including a current member of the Armed Forces, Reserve of the Armed Forces of the United States, or the National Guard.
            
              FCCS means the Federal Claims Collection Standards, which were jointly published by the Departments of the Treasury and Justice and codified at 31 CFR parts 900-904.
            
              Financial Management Service means the Financial Management Service, a bureau of the Treasury Department, which is responsible for the centralized collection of delinquent debts through the offset of Federal payments and other means.
            
              Payment agency or Federal payment agency means any Federal agency that transmits payment requests in the form of certified payment vouchers, or other similar forms, to a disbursing official for disbursement. The “payment agency” may be the agency that employs the debtor. In some cases, the Treasury Department may be both the creditor agency and payment agency.
            
              Person means an individual, corporation, partnership, association, organization, State or local government, or any other type of entity other than a Federal agency.
            
              Salary offset means a type of administrative offset to collect a debt owed by a Federal employee from the current pay account of the employee.
            
              Secretary means the Secretary of the Treasury.
            
              Tax refund offset is defined in 31 CFR 285.2(a).
            
              Treasury debt means a debt owed to a Treasury entity by a person.
            
              Treasury Department means the United States Department of the Treasury.
            
              Treasury entity means the Office of Inspector General, the Office of Inspector General for Tax Administration, or a bureau of the Treasury Department, including the Departmental Offices, responsible for the collection of the applicable Treasury debt. Departmental Offices include, but are not limited to, the Office of D.C. Pensions, the Community Development Financial Institution Fund, the Executive Office of Asset Forfeiture, and the Office of Foreign Assets Control. Other bureaus include, but are not limited to, the Bureau of Public Debt; Bureau of Engraving and Printing; U.S. Mint; U.S. Secret Service; Customs Service; Financial Management Service; Internal Revenue Service; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms; Office of Comptroller of the Currency; the Office of Thrift Supervision; Federal Law Enforcement Training Center; and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.
          
          
            § 5.2
            Why is the Treasury Department issuing these regulations and what do they cover?
            (a) Scope. This part provides procedures for the collection of Treasury debts. This part also provides procedures for collection of other debts owed to the United States when a request for offset of a Treasury payment is received by the Treasury Department from another agency (for example, when a Treasury Department employee owes a debt to the United States Department of Education).
            (b) Applicability. (1) This part applies to the Treasury Department when collecting a Treasury debt, to persons who owe Treasury debts, and to Federal agencies requesting offset of a payment issued by the Treasury Department as a payment agency (including salary payments to Treasury Department employees).
            (2) This part does not apply to tax debts nor to any debt for which there is an indication of fraud or misrepresentation, as described in § 900.3 of the FCCS, unless the debt is returned by the Department of Justice to the Treasury Department for handling.

            (3) This part does not apply to the Financial Management Service when acting on behalf of other Federal agencies and states to collect delinquent debt referred to the Financial Management Service for collection action as required or authorized by Federal law. See 31 CFR part 285.

            (4) Nothing in this part precludes collection or disposition of any debt under statutes and regulations other than those described in this part. See, for example, 5 U.S.C. 5705, Advancements and Deductions, which authorizes Treasury entities to recover travel advances by offset of up to 100% of a Federal employee's accrued pay. See, also, 5 U.S.C. 4108, governing the collection of training expenses. To the extent that the provisions of laws, other regulations, and Treasury Department enforcement policies differ from the provisions of this part, those provisions of law, other regulations, and Treasury Department enforcement policies apply to the remission or mitigation of fines, penalties, and forfeitures, and debts arising under the tariff laws of the United States, rather than the provisions of this part.
            (c) Additional policies and procedures. Treasury entities may, but are not required to, promulgate additional policies and procedures consistent with this part, the FCCS, and other applicable Federal law, policies, and procedures.
            (d) Duplication not required. Nothing in this part requires a Treasury entity to duplicate notices or administrative proceedings required by contract, this part, or other laws or regulations.
            (e) Use of multiple collection remedies allowed. Treasury entities and other Federal agencies may simultaneously use multiple collection remedies to collect a debt, except as prohibited by law. This part is intended to promote aggressive debt collection, using for each debt all available collection remedies. These remedies are not listed in any prescribed order to provide Treasury entities with flexibility in determining which remedies will be most efficient in collecting the particular debt.
          
          
            § 5.3
            Do these regulations adopt the Federal Claims Collection Standards (FCCS)?
            This part adopts and incorporates all provisions of the FCCS. This part also supplements the FCCS by prescribing procedures consistent with the FCCS, as necessary and appropriate for Treasury Department operations.
          
        
        
          Subpart B—Procedures To Collect Treasury Debts
          
            § 5.4
            What notice will Treasury entities send to a debtor when collecting a Treasury debt?
            (a) Notice requirements. Treasury entities shall aggressively collect Treasury debts. Treasury entities shall promptly send at least one written notice to a debtor informing the debtor of the consequences of failing to pay or otherwise resolve a Treasury debt. The notice(s) shall be sent to the debtor at the most current address of the debtor in the records of the Treasury entity collecting the debt. Generally, before starting the collection actions described in §§ 5.5 and 5.9 through 5.17 of this part, Treasury entities will send no more than two written notices to the debtor. The purpose of the notice(s) is to explain why the debt is owed, the amount of the debt, how a debtor may pay the debt or make alternate repayment arrangements, how a debtor may review documents related to the debt, how a debtor may dispute the debt, the collection remedies available to Treasury entities if the debtor refuses to pay the debt, and other consequences to the debtor if the debt is not paid. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the written notice(s) shall explain to the debtor:
            (1) The nature and amount of the debt, and the facts giving rise to the debt;

            (2) How interest, penalties, and administrative costs are added to the debt, the date by which payment should be made to avoid such charges, and that such assessments must be made unless excused in accordance with 31 CFR 901.9 (see § 5.5 of this part);
            (3) The date by which payment should be made to avoid the enforced collection actions described in paragraph (a)(6) of this section;

            (4) The Treasury entity's willingness to discuss alternative payment arrangements and how the debtor may enter into a written agreement to repay the debt under terms acceptable to the Treasury entity (see § 5.6 of this part);

            (5) The name, address, and telephone number of a contact person or office within the Treasury entity;
            
            (6) The Treasury entity's intention to enforce collection if the debtor fails to pay or otherwise resolve the debt, by taking one or more of the following actions:
            (i) Offset. Offset the debtor's Federal payments, including income tax refunds, salary, certain benefit payments (such as Social Security), retirement, vendor, travel reimbursements and advances, and other Federal payments (see §§ 5.10 through 5.12 of this part);
            (ii) Private collection agency. Refer the debt to a private collection agency (see § 5.15 of this part);
            (iii) Credit bureau reporting. Report the debt to a credit bureau (see § 5.14 of this part);
            (iv) Administrative wage garnishment. Garnish the debtor's wages through administrative wage garnishment (see § 5.13 of this part);
            (v) Litigation. Refer the debt to the Department of Justice to initiate litigation to collect the debt (see § 5.16 of this part);
            (vi) Treasury Department's Financial Management Service. Refer the debt to the Financial Management Service for collection (see § 5.9 of this part);

            (7) That Treasury debts over 180 days delinquent must be referred to the Financial Management Service for the collection actions described in paragraph (a)(6) of this section (see § 5.9 of this part);
            (8) How the debtor may inspect and copy records related to the debt;

            (9) How the debtor may request a review of the Treasury entity's determination that the debtor owes a debt and present evidence that the debt is not delinquent or legally enforceable (see §§ 5.10(c) and 5.11(c) of this part);

            (10) How a debtor may request a hearing if the Treasury entity intends to garnish the debtor's private sector (i.e., non-Federal) wages (see § 5.13(a) of this part), including:
            (i) The method and time period for requesting a hearing;
            (ii) That the timely filing of a request for a hearing on or before the 15th business day following the date of the notice will stay the commencement of administrative wage garnishment, but not necessarily other collection procedures; and
            (iii) The name and address of the office to which the request for a hearing should be sent.

            (11) How a debtor who is a Federal employee subject to Federal salary offset may request a hearing (see § 5.12(e) of this part), including:
            (i) The method and time period for requesting a hearing;
            (ii) That the timely filing of a request for a hearing on or before the 15th calendar day following receipt of the notice will stay the commencement of salary offset, but not necessarily other collection procedures;
            (iii) The name and address of the office to which the request for a hearing should be sent;
            (iv) That the Treasury entity will refer the debt to the debtor's employing agency or to the Financial Management Service to implement salary offset, unless the employee files a timely request for a hearing;
            (v) That a final decision on the hearing, if requested, will be issued at the earliest practical date, but not later than 60 days after the filing of the request for a hearing, unless the employee requests and the hearing official grants a delay in the proceedings;
            (vi) That any knowingly false or frivolous statements, representations, or evidence may subject the Federal employee to penalties under the False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. 3729-3731) or other applicable statutory authority, and criminal penalties under 18 U.S.C. 286, 287, 1001, and 1002, or other applicable statutory authority;
            (vii) That unless prohibited by contract or statute, amounts paid on or deducted for the debt which are later waived or found not owed to the United States will be promptly refunded to the employee; and
            (viii) That proceedings with respect to such debt are governed by 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 31 U.S.C. 3716;

            (12) How the debtor may request a waiver of the debt, if applicable (see, for example, Treasury Directive 34-01 (Waiving Claims Against Treasury Employees for Erroneous Payments), set forth at appendix A of this part and at http://www.treas.gov/regs);

            (13) How the debtor's spouse may claim his or her share of a joint income tax refund by filing Form 8379 with the Internal Revenue Service (see http://www.irs.gov)
            (14) How the debtor may exercise other statutory or regulatory rights and remedies available to the debtor;

            (15) That certain debtors may be ineligible for Federal Government loans, guaranties and insurance (see 31 U.S.C. 3720B, 31 CFR 285.13, and § 5.17(a) of this part);

            (16) If applicable, the Treasury entity's intention to suspend or revoke licenses, permits or privileges (see § 5.17(b) of this part); and
            (17) That the debtor should advise the Treasury entity of a bankruptcy proceeding of the debtor or another person liable for the debt being collected.
            (b) Exceptions to notice requirements. A Treasury entity may omit from a notice to a debtor one or more of the provisions contained in paragraphs (a)(6) through (a)(17) of this section if the Treasury entity, in consultation with its legal counsel, determines that any provision is not legally required given the collection remedies to be applied to a particular debt.
            (c) Respond to debtors; comply with FCCS. Treasury entities should respond promptly to communications from debtors and comply with other FCCS provisions applicable to the administrative collection of debts. See 31 CFR part 901.
          
          
            § 5.5
            How will Treasury entities add interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs to a Treasury debt?
            (a) Assessment and notice. Treasury entities shall assess interest, penalties and administrative costs on Treasury debts in accordance with the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3717 and 31 CFR 901.9, on Treasury debts. Interest shall be charged in accordance with the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3717(a). Penalties shall accrue at the rate of 6% per year, or such other higher rate as authorized by law. Administrative costs, that is the costs of processing and handling a delinquent debt, shall be determined by the Treasury entity collecting the Treasury debt. Treasury entities may have additional policies regarding how interest, penalties, and administrative costs are assessed on particular types of debts. Treasury entities are required to explain in the notice to the debtor described in § 5.4 of this part how interest, penalties, costs, and other charges are assessed, unless the requirements are included in a contract or repayment agreement.
            (b) Waiver of interest, penalties, and administrative costs. Unless otherwise required by law, Treasury entities may not charge interest if the amount due on the debt is paid within 30 days after the date from which the interest accrues. See 31 U.S.C. 3717(d). Treasury entities may waive interest, penalties, and administrative costs, or any portion thereof, when it would be against equity and good conscience or not in the Treasury entity's best interest to collect such charges, in accordance with Treasury guidelines for waiving claims against Treasury employees for erroneous overpayments. See Treasury Directive 34-01 (Waiving Claims Against Treasury Employees for Erroneous Payments) set forth at appendix A of this part and at http://www.treas.gov/regs. Legal counsel approval is not required to waive such charges. Cf., §§ 5.7 and 5.8 of this part, which require legal counsel approval when compromising a debt or terminating debt collection activity on a debt.
            (c) Accrual during suspension of debt collection. In most cases, interest, penalties and administrative costs will continue to accrue during any period when collection has been suspended for any reason (for example, when the debtor has requested a hearing). Treasury entities may suspend accrual of any or all of these charges when accrual would be against equity and good conscience or not in the Treasury entity's best interest, in accordance with Treasury guidelines for waiving claims against Treasury employees for erroneous overpayments. See Treasury Directive 34-01 (Waiving Claims Against Treasury Employees for Erroneous Payments), set forth at appendix A of this part and http://www.treas.gov/regs.
            
          
          
            
            § 5.6
            When will Treasury entities allow a debtor to pay a Treasury debt in installments instead of one lump sum?
            If a debtor is financially unable to pay the debt in one lump sum, a Treasury entity may accept payment of a Treasury debt in regular installments, in accordance with the provisions of 31 CFR 901.8 and the Treasury entity's policies and procedures.
          
          
            § 5.7
            When will Treasury entities compromise a Treasury debt?

            If a Treasury entity cannot collect the full amount of a Treasury debt, the Treasury entity may compromise the debt in accordance with the provisions of 31 CFR part 902 and the Treasury entity's policies and procedures. Legal counsel approval to compromise a Treasury debt is required as described in Treasury Directive 34-02 (Credit Management and Debt Collection), which may be found at http://www.treas.gov/regs.
            
          
          
            § 5.8
            When will Treasury entities suspend or terminate debt collection on a Treasury debt?

            If, after pursuing all appropriate means of collection, a Treasury entity determines that a Treasury debt is uncollectible, the Treasury entity may suspend or terminate debt collection activity in accordance with the provisions of 31 CFR part 903 and the Treasury entity's policies and procedures. Legal counsel approval to terminate debt collection activity is required as described in Treasury Directive 34-02 (Credit Management and Debt Collection), which may be found at http://www.treas.gov/regs.
            
          
          
            § 5.9
            When will Treasury entities transfer a Treasury debt to the Treasury Department's Financial Management Service for collection?

            (a) Treasury entities will transfer any eligible debt that is more than 180 days delinquent to the Financial Management Service for debt collection services, a process known as “cross-servicing.” See 31 U.S.C. 3711(g) and 31 CFR 285.12. Treasury entities may transfer debts delinquent 180 days or less to the Financial Management Service in accordance with the procedures described in 31 CFR 285.12. The Financial Management Service takes appropriate action to collect or compromise the transferred debt, or to suspend or terminate collection action thereon, in accordance with the statutory and regulatory requirements and authorities applicable to the debt and the collection action to be taken. See 31 CFR 285.12(b)(2). Appropriate action includes, but is not limited to, contact with the debtor, referral of the debt to the Treasury Offset Program, private collection agencies or the Department of Justice, reporting of the debt to credit bureaus, and administrative wage garnishment.

            (b) At least sixty (60) days prior to transferring a Treasury debt to the Financial Management Service, Treasury entities will send notice to the debtor as required by § 5.4 of this part. Treasury entities will certify to the Financial Management Service, in writing, that the debt is valid, delinquent, legally enforceable, and that there are no legal bars to collection. In addition, Treasury entities will certify their compliance with all applicable due process and other requirements as described in this part and other Federal laws. See 31 CFR 285.12(i) regarding the certification requirement.

            (c) As part of its debt collection process, the Financial Management Service uses the Treasury Offset Program to collect Treasury debts by administrative and tax refund offset. See 31 CFR 285.12(g). The Treasury Offset Program is a centralized offset program administered by the Financial Management Service to collect delinquent debts owed to Federal agencies and states (including past-due child support). Under the Treasury Offset Program, before a Federal payment is disbursed, the Financial Management Service compares the name and taxpayer identification number (TIN) of the payee with the names and TINs of debtors that have been submitted by Federal agencies and states to the Treasury Offset Program database. If there is a match, the Financial Management Service (or, in some cases, another Federal disbursing agency) offsets all or a portion of the Federal payment, disburses any remaining payment to the payee, and pays the offset amount to the creditor agency. Federal payments eligible for offset include, but are not limited to, income tax refunds, salary, travel advances and reimbursements, retirement and vendor payments, and Social Security and other benefit payments.
          
          
            § 5.10
            How will Treasury entities use administrative offset (offset of non-tax Federal payments) to collect a Treasury debt?
            (a) Centralized administrative offset through the Treasury Offset Program. (1) In most cases, the Financial Management Service uses the Treasury Offset Program to collect Treasury debts by the offset of Federal payments. See § 5.9(c) of this part. If not already transferred to the Financial Management Service under § 5.9 of this part, Treasury entities will refer any eligible debt over 180 days delinquent to the Treasury Offset Program for collection by centralized administrative offset. See 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(6); 31 CFR part 285, subpart A; and 31 CFR 901.3(b). Treasury entities may refer any eligible debt less than 180 days delinquent to the Treasury Offset Program for offset.
            (2) At least sixty (60) days prior to referring a debt to the Treasury Offset Program, in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section, Treasury entities will send notice to the debtor in accordance with the requirements of § 5.4 of this part. Treasury entities will certify to the Financial Management Service, in writing, that the debt is valid, delinquent, legally enforceable, and that there are no legal bars to collection by offset. In addition, Treasury entities will certify their compliance with the requirements described in this part.
            (b) Non-centralized administrative offset for Treasury debts. (1) When centralized administrative offset through the Treasury Offset Program is not available or appropriate, Treasury entities may collect past-due, legally enforceable Treasury debts through non-centralized administrative offset. See 31 CFR 901.3(c). In these cases, Treasury entities may offset a payment internally or make an offset request directly to a Federal payment agency. If the Federal payment agency is another Treasury entity, the Treasury entity making the request shall do so through the Deputy Chief Financial Officer as described in § 5.20(c) of this part.

            (2) At least thirty (30) days prior to offsetting a payment internally or requesting a Federal payment agency to offset a payment, Treasury entities will send notice to the debtor in accordance with the requirements of § 5.4 of this part. When referring a debt for offset under this paragraph (b), Treasury entities making the request will certify, in writing, that the debt is valid, delinquent, legally enforceable, and that there are no legal bars to collection by offset. In addition, Treasury entities will certify their compliance with these regulations concerning administrative offset. See 31 CFR 901.3(c)(2)(ii).
            (c) Administrative review. The notice described in § 5.4 of this part shall explain to the debtor how to request an administrative review of a Treasury entity's determination that the debtor owes a Treasury debt and how to present evidence that the debt is not delinquent or legally enforceable. In addition to challenging the existence and amount of the debt, the debtor may seek a review of the terms of repayment. In most cases, Treasury entities will provide the debtor with a “paper hearing” based upon a review of the written record, including documentation provided by the debtor. Treasury entities shall provide the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for an oral hearing when the debtor requests reconsideration of the debt and the Treasury entity determines that the question of the indebtedness cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence, for example, when the validity of the debt turns on an issue of credibility or veracity. Unless otherwise required by law, an oral hearing under this section is not required to be a formal evidentiary hearing, although Treasury entities should carefully document all significant matters discussed at the hearing. Treasury entities may suspend collection through administrative offset and/or other collection actions pending the resolution of a debtor's dispute. Each Treasury entity will have its own policies and procedures concerning the administrative review process consistent with the FCCS and the regulations in this section.
            (d) Procedures for expedited offset. Under the circumstances described in 31 CFR 901.3(b)(4)(iii), Treasury entities may effect an offset against a payment to be made to the debtor prior to sending a notice to the debtor, as described in § 5.4 of this part, or completing the procedures described in paragraph (b)(2) and (c) of this section. Treasury entities shall give the debtor notice and an opportunity for review as soon as practicable and promptly refund any money ultimately found not to have been owed to the Government.
          
          
            § 5.11
            How will Treasury entities use tax refund offset to collect a Treasury debt?
            (a) Tax refund offset. In most cases, the Financial Management Service uses the Treasury Offset Program to collect Treasury debts by the offset of tax refunds and other Federal payments. See § 5.9(c) of this part. If not already transferred to the Financial Management Service under § 5.9 of this part, Treasury entities will refer to the Treasury Offset Program any past-due, legally enforceable debt for collection by tax refund offset. See 26 U.S.C. 6402(d), 31 U.S.C. 3720A and 31 CFR 285.2.
            (b) Notice. At least sixty (60) days prior to referring a debt to the Treasury Offset Program, Treasury entities will send notice to the debtor in accordance with the requirements of § 5.4 of this part. Treasury entities will certify to the Financial Management Service's Treasury Offset Program, in writing, that the debt is past-due and legally enforceable in the amount submitted and that the Treasury entities have made reasonable efforts to obtain payment of the debt as described in 31 CFR 285.2(d). In addition, Treasury entities will certify their compliance with all applicable due process and other requirements described in this part and other Federal laws. See 31 U.S.C. 3720A(b) and 31 CFR 285.2.
            (c) Administrative review. The notice described in § 5.4 of this part shall provide the debtor with at least 60 days prior to the initiation of tax refund offset to request an administrative review as described in § 5.10(c) of this part. Treasury entities may suspend collection through tax refund offset and/or other collection actions pending the resolution of the debtor's dispute.
          
          
            § 5.12
            How will Treasury entities offset a Federal employee's salary to collect a Treasury debt?
            (a) Federal salary offset. (1) Salary offset is used to collect debts owed to the United States by Treasury Department and other Federal employees. If a Federal employee owes a Treasury debt, Treasury entities may offset the employee's Federal salary to collect the debt in the manner described in this section. For information on how a Federal agency other than a Treasury entity may collect debt from the salary of a Treasury Department employee, see §§ 5.20 and 5.21, subpart C, of this part.

            (2) Nothing in this part requires a Treasury entity to collect a Treasury debt in accordance with the provisions of this section if Federal law allows otherwise. See, for example, 5 U.S.C. 5705 (travel advances not used for allowable travel expenses are recoverable from the employee or his estate by setoff against accrued pay and other means) and 5 U.S.C. 4108 (recovery of training expenses).
            (3) Treasury entities may use the administrative wage garnishment procedure described in § 5.13 of this part to collect a debt from an individual's non-Federal wages.
            (b) Centralized salary offset through the Treasury Offset Program. As described in § 5.9(a) of this part, Treasury entities will refer Treasury debts to the Financial Management Service for collection by administrative offset, including salary offset, through the Treasury Offset Program. When possible, Treasury entities should attempt salary offset through the Treasury Offset Program before applying the procedures in paragraph (c) of this section. See 5 CFR 550.1109.
            (c) Non-centralized salary offset for Treasury debts. When centralized salary offset through the Treasury Offset Program is not available or appropriate, Treasury entities may collect delinquent Treasury debts through non-centralized salary offset. See 5 CFR 550.1109. In these cases, Treasury entities may offset a payment internally or make a request directly to a Federal payment agency to offset a salary payment to collect a delinquent debt owed by a Federal employee. If the Federal payment agency is another Treasury entity, the Treasury entity making the request shall do so through the Deputy Chief Financial Officer as described in § 5.20(c) of this part. At least thirty (30) days prior to offsetting internally or requesting a Federal agency to offset a salary payment, Treasury entities will send notice to the debtor in accordance with the requirements of § 5.4 of this part. When referring a debt for offset, Treasury entities will certify to the payment agency, in writing, that the debt is valid, delinquent and legally enforceable in the amount stated, and there are no legal bars to collection by salary offset. In addition, Treasury entities will certify that all due process and other prerequisites to salary offset have been met. See 5 U.S.C. 5514, 31 U.S.C. 3716(a), and this section for a description of the due process and other prerequisites for salary offset.
            (d) When prior notice not required. Treasury entities are not required to provide prior notice to an employee when the following adjustments are made by a Treasury entity to a Treasury employee's pay:
            (1) Any adjustment to pay arising out of any employee's election of coverage or a change in coverage under a Federal benefits program requiring periodic deductions from pay, if the amount to be recovered was accumulated over four pay periods or less;
            (2) A routine intra-agency adjustment of pay that is made to correct an overpayment of pay attributable to clerical or administrative errors or delays in processing pay documents, if the overpayment occurred within the four pay periods preceding the adjustment, and, at the time of such adjustment, or as soon thereafter as practical, the individual is provided written notice of the nature and the amount of the adjustment and point of contact for contesting such adjustment; or
            (3) Any adjustment to collect a debt amounting to $50 or less, if, at the time of such adjustment, or as soon thereafter as practical, the individual is provided written notice of the nature and the amount of the adjustment and a point of contact for contesting such adjustment.
            (e) Hearing procedures—(1) Request for a hearing. A Federal employee who has received a notice that his or her Treasury debt will be collected by means of salary offset may request a hearing concerning the existence or amount of the debt. The Federal employee also may request a hearing concerning the amount proposed to be deducted from the employee's pay each pay period. The employee must send any request for hearing, in writing, to the office designated in the notice described in § 5.4. See § 5.4(a)(11). The request must be received by the designated office on or before the 15th calendar day following the employee's receipt of the notice. The employee must sign the request and specify whether an oral or paper hearing is requested. If an oral hearing is requested, the employee must explain why the matter cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence alone. All travel expenses incurred by the Federal employee in connection with an in-person hearing will be borne by the employee.
            (2) Failure to submit timely request for hearing. If the employee fails to submit a request for hearing within the time period described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the employee will have waived the right to a hearing, and salary offset may be initiated. However, Treasury entities should accept a late request for hearing if the employee can show that the late request was the result of circumstances beyond the employee's control or because of a failure to receive actual notice of the filing deadline.
            (3) Hearing official. Treasury entities must obtain the services of a hearing official who is not under the supervision or control of the Secretary. Treasury entities may contact the Deputy Chief Financial Officer as described in § 5.20(c) of this part or an agent of any agency designated in Appendix A to 5 CFR part 581 (List of Agents Designated to Accept Legal Process) to request a hearing official.
            (4) Notice of hearing. After the employee requests a hearing, the designated hearing official shall inform the employee of the form of the hearing to be provided. For oral hearings, the notice shall set forth the date, time and location of the hearing. For paper hearings, the notice shall notify the employee of the date by which he or she should submit written arguments to the designated hearing official. The hearing official shall give the employee reasonable time to submit documentation in support of the employee's position. The hearing official shall schedule a new hearing date if requested by both parties. The hearing official shall give both parties reasonable notice of the time and place of a rescheduled hearing.
            (5) Oral hearing. The hearing official will conduct an oral hearing if he or she determines that the matter cannot be resolved by review of documentary evidence alone (for example, when an issue of credibility or veracity is involved). The hearing need not take the form of an evidentiary hearing, but may be conducted in a manner determined by the hearing official, including but not limited to:
            (i) Informal conferences with the hearing official, in which the employee and agency representative will be given full opportunity to present evidence, witnesses and argument;
            (ii) Informal meetings with an interview of the employee by the hearing official; or
            (iii) Formal written submissions, with an opportunity for oral presentation.
            (6) Paper hearing. If the hearing official determines that an oral hearing is not necessary, he or she will make the determination based upon a review of the available written record, including any documentation submitted by the employee in support of his or her position.
            (7) Failure to appear or submit documentary evidence. In the absence of good cause shown (for example, excused illness), if the employee fails to appear at an oral hearing or fails to submit documentary evidence as required for a paper hearing, the employee will have waived the right to a hearing, and salary offset may be initiated. Further, the employee will have been deemed to admit the existence and amount of the debt as described in the notice of intent to offset. If the Treasury entity representative fails to appear at an oral hearing, the hearing official shall proceed with the hearing as scheduled, and make his or her determination based upon the oral testimony presented and the documentary evidence submitted by both parties.
            (8) Burden of proof. Treasury entities will have the initial burden to prove the existence and amount of the debt. Thereafter, if the employee disputes the existence or amount of the debt, the employee must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that no debt exists or that the amount of the debt is incorrect. In addition, the employee may present evidence that the proposed terms of the repayment schedule are unlawful, would cause a financial hardship to the employee, or that collection of the debt may not be pursued due to operation of law.
            (9) Record. The hearing official shall maintain a summary record of any hearing provided by this part. Witnesses will testify under oath or affirmation in oral hearings.
            (10) Date of decision. The hearing official shall issue a written opinion stating his or her decision, based upon documentary evidence and information developed at the hearing, as soon as practicable after the hearing, but not later than 60 days after the date on which the request for hearing was received by the Treasury entity. If the employee requests a delay in the proceedings, the deadline for the decision may be postponed by the number of days by which the hearing was postponed. When a decision is not timely rendered, the Treasury entity shall waive penalties applied to the debt for the period beginning with the date the decision is due and ending on the date the decision is issued.
            (11) Content of decision. The written decision shall include:
            (i) A statement of the facts presented to support the origin, nature, and amount of the debt;
            (ii) The hearing official's findings, analysis, and conclusions; and
            (iii) The terms of any repayment schedules, if applicable.
            (12) Final agency action. The hearing official's decision shall be final.

            (f) Waiver not precluded. Nothing in this part precludes an employee from requesting waiver of an overpayment under 5 U.S.C. 5584 or 8346(b), 10 U.S.C. 2774, 32 U.S.C. 716, or other statutory authority.
            (g) Salary offset process—(1) Determination of disposable pay. The office of the Deputy Chief Financial Officer will consult with the appropriate Treasury entity payroll office to determine the amount of a Treasury Department employee's disposable pay (as defined in § 5.1 of this part) and will implement salary offset when requested to do so by a Treasury entity, as described in paragraph (c) of this section, or another agency, as described in § 5.20 of this part. If the debtor is not employed by the Treasury Department, the agency employing the debtor will determine the amount of the employee's disposable pay and will implement salary offset upon request.
            (2) When salary offset begins. Deductions shall begin within three official pay periods following receipt of the creditor agency's request for offset.
            (3) Amount of salary offset. The amount to be offset from each salary payment will be up to 15 percent of a debtor's disposable pay, as follows:
            (i) If the amount of the debt is equal to or less than 15 percent of the disposable pay, such debt generally will be collected in one lump sum payment;
            (ii) Installment deductions will be made over a period of no greater than the anticipated period of employment. An installment deduction will not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made unless the employee has agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount or the creditor agency has determined that smaller deductions are appropriate based on the employee's ability to pay.
            (4) Final salary payment. After the employee has separated either voluntarily or involuntarily from the payment agency, the payment agency may make a lump sum deduction exceeding 15 percent of disposable pay from any final salary or other payments pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716 in order to satisfy a debt.
            (h) Payment agency's responsibilities. (1) As required by 5 CFR 550.1109, if the employee separates from the payment agency from which a Treasury entity has requested salary offset, the payment agency must certify the total amount of its collection and notify the Treasury entity and the employee of the amounts collected. If the payment agency is aware that the employee is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement Fund and Disability Fund, the Federal Employee Retirement System, or other similar payments, it must provide written notification to the payment agency responsible for making such payments that the debtor owes a debt, the amount of the debt, and that the Treasury entity has complied with the provisions of this section. Treasury entities must submit a properly certified claim to the new payment agency before the collection can be made.
            (2) If the employee is already separated from employment and all payments due from his or her former payment agency have been made, Treasury entities may request that money due and payable to the employee from the Civil Service Retirement Fund and Disability Fund, the Federal Employee Retirement System, or other similar funds, be administratively offset to collect the debt. Generally, Treasury entities will collect such monies through the Treasury Offset Program as described in § 5.9(c) of this part.
            (3) When an employee transfers to another agency, Treasury entities should resume collection with the employee's new payment agency in order to continue salary offset.
          
          
            § 5.13
            How will Treasury entities use administrative wage garnishment to collect a Treasury debt from a debtor's wages?

            (a) Treasury entities are authorized to collect debts from a debtor's wages by means of administrative wage garnishment in accordance with the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3720D and 31 CFR 285.11. This part adopts and incorporates all of the provisions of 31 CFR 285.11 concerning administrative wage garnishment, including the hearing procedures described in 31 CFR 285.11(f). Treasury entities may use administrative wage garnishment to collect a delinquent Treasury debt unless the debtor is making timely payments under an agreement to pay the debt in installments (see § 5.6 of this part). At least thirty (30) days prior to initiating an administrative wage garnishment, Treasury entities will send notice to the debtor in accordance with the requirements of § 5.4 of this part, including the requirements of § 5.4(a)(10) of this part. For Treasury debts referred to the Financial Management Service under § 5.9 of this part, Treasury entities may authorize the Financial Management Service to send a notice informing the debtor that administrative wage garnishment will be initiated and how the debtor may request a hearing as described in § 5.4(a)(10) of this part. If a debtor makes a timely request for a hearing, administrative wage garnishment will not begin until a hearing is held and a decision is sent to the debtor. See 31 CFR 285.11(f)(4). If a debtor's hearing request is not timely, Treasury entities may suspend collection by administrative wage garnishment in accordance with the provisions of 31 CFR 285.11(f)(5). All travel expenses incurred by the debtor in connection with an in-person hearing will be borne by the debtor.
            (b) This section does not apply to Federal salary offset, the process by which Treasury entities collect debts from the salaries of Federal employees (see § 5.12 of this part).
          
          
            § 5.14
            How will Treasury entities report Treasury debts to credit bureaus?

            Treasury entities shall report delinquent Treasury debts to credit bureaus in accordance with the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3711(e), 31 CFR 901.4, and the Office of Management and Budget Circular A-129, “Policies for Federal Credit Programs and Nontax Receivables.” For additional information, see Financial Management Service's “Guide to the Federal Credit Bureau Program,” which may be found at http://www.fms.treas.gov/debt. At least sixty (60) days prior to reporting a delinquent debt to a consumer reporting agency, Treasury entities will send notice to the debtor in accordance with the requirements of § 5.4 of this part. Treasury entities may authorize the Financial Management Service to report to credit bureaus those delinquent Treasury debts that have been transferred to the Financial Management Service under § 5.9 of this part.
          
          
            § 5.15
            How will Treasury entities refer Treasury debts to private collection agencies?
            Treasury entities will transfer delinquent Treasury debts to the Financial Management Service to obtain debt collection services provided by private collection agencies. See § 5.9 of this part.
          
          
            § 5.16
            When will Treasury entities refer Treasury debts to the Department of Justice?
            (a) Compromise or suspension or termination of collection activity. Treasury entities shall refer Treasury debts having a principal balance over $100,000, or such higher amount as authorized by the Attorney General, to the Department of Justice for approval of any compromise of a debt or suspension or termination of collection activity. See §§ 5.7 and 5.8 of this part; 31 CFR 902.1; 31 CFR 903.1.
            (b) Litigation. Treasury entities shall promptly refer to the Department of Justice for litigation delinquent Treasury debts on which aggressive collection activity has been taken in accordance with this part and that should not be compromised, and on which collection activity should not be suspended or terminated. See 31 CFR part 904. Treasury entities may authorize the Financial Management Service to refer to the Department of Justice for litigation those delinquent Treasury debts that have been transferred to the Financial Management Service under § 5.9 of this part.
          
          
            § 5.17
            Will a debtor who owes a Treasury debt be ineligible for Federal loan assistance or Federal licenses, permits or privileges?
            (a) Delinquent debtors barred from obtaining Federal loans or loan insurance or guaranties. As required by 31 U.S.C. 3720B and 31 CFR 901.6, Treasury entities will not extend financial assistance in the form of a loan, loan guarantee, or loan insurance to any person delinquent on a debt owed to a Federal agency. This prohibition does not apply to disaster loans. Treasury entities may extend credit after the delinquency has been resolved. See 31 CFR 285.13 for standards defining when a “delinquency” is “resolved” for purposes of this prohibition.
            (b) Suspension or revocation of eligibility for licenses, permits, or privileges. Unless prohibited by law, Treasury entities should suspend or revoke licenses, permits, or other privileges for any inexcusable or willful failure of a debtor to pay a debt. The Treasury entity responsible for distributing the licenses, permits, or other privileges will establish policies and procedures governing suspension and revocation for delinquent debtors. If applicable, Treasury entities will advise the debtor in the notice required by § 5.4 of this part of the Treasury entities' ability to suspend or revoke licenses, permits or privileges. See § 5.4(a)(16) of this part.
          
          
            § 5.18
            How does a debtor request a special review based on a change in circumstances such as catastrophic illness, divorce, death, or disability?
            (a) Material change in circumstances. A debtor who owes a Treasury debt may, at any time, request a special review by the applicable Treasury entity of the amount of any offset, administrative wage garnishment, or voluntary payment, based on materially changed circumstances beyond the control of the debtor such as, but not limited to, catastrophic illness, divorce, death, or disability.
            (b) Inability to pay. For purposes of this section, in determining whether an involuntary or voluntary payment would prevent the debtor from meeting essential subsistence expenses (costs incurred for food, housing, clothing, transportation, and medical care), the debtor shall submit a detailed statement and supporting documents for the debtor, his or her spouse, and dependents, indicating:
            (1) Income from all sources;
            (2) Assets;
            (3) Liabilities;
            (4) Number of dependents;
            (5) Expenses for food, housing, clothing, and transportation;
            (6) Medical expenses; and
            (7) Exceptional expenses, if any.
            (c) Alternative payment arrangement. If the debtor requests a special review under this section, the debtor shall submit an alternative proposed payment schedule and a statement to the Treasury entity collecting the debt, with supporting documents, showing why the current offset, garnishment or repayment schedule imposes an extreme financial hardship on the debtor. The Treasury entity will evaluate the statement and documentation and determine whether the current offset, garnishment, or repayment schedule imposes extreme financial hardship on the debtor. The Treasury entity shall notify the debtor in writing of such determination, including, if appropriate, a revised offset, garnishment, or payment schedule. If the special review results in a revised offset, garnishment, or repayment schedule, the Treasury entity will notify the appropriate agency or other persons about the new terms.
          
          
            § 5.19
            Will Treasury entities issue a refund if money is erroneously collected on a debt?
            Treasury entities shall promptly refund to a debtor any amount collected on a Treasury debt when the debt is waived or otherwise found not to be owed to the United States, or as otherwise required by law. Refunds under this part shall not bear interest unless required by law.
          
        
        
          Subpart C—Procedures for Offset of Treasury Department Payments To Collect Debts Owed to Other Federal Agencies
          
            § 5.20
            How do other Federal agencies use the offset process to collect debts from payments issued by a Treasury entity?
            (a) Offset of Treasury entity payments to collect debts owed to other Federal agencies. (1) In most cases, Federal agencies submit eligible debts to the Treasury Offset Program to collect delinquent debts from payments issued by Treasury entities and other Federal agencies, a process known as “centralized offset.” When centralized offset is not available or appropriate, any Federal agency may ask a Treasury entity (when acting as a “payment agency”) to collect a debt owed to such agency by offsetting funds payable to a debtor by the Treasury entity, including salary payments issued to Treasury entity employees. This section and § 5.21 of this subpart C apply when a Federal agency asks a Treasury entity to offset a payment issued by the Treasury entity to a person who owes a debt to the United States.
            (2) This subpart C does not apply to Treasury debts. See §§ 5.10 through 5.12 of this part for offset procedures applicable to Treasury debts.

            (3) This subpart C does not apply to the collection of non-Treasury debts through tax refund offset. See 31 CFR 285.2 for tax refund offset procedures.
            (b) Administrative offset (including salary offset); certification. A Treasury entity will initiate a requested offset only upon receipt of written certification from the creditor agency that the debtor owes the past-due, legally enforceable debt in the amount stated, and that the creditor agency has fully complied with all applicable due process and other requirements contained in 31 U.S.C. 3716, 5 U.S.C. 5514, and the creditor agency's regulations, as applicable. Offsets will continue until the debt is paid in full or otherwise resolved to the satisfaction of the creditor agency.
            (c) Where a creditor agency makes requests for offset. Requests for offset under this section shall be sent to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, ATTN: Deputy Chief Financial Officer, 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Attention: Metropolitan Square, Room 6228, Washington, DC 20220. The Deputy Chief Financial Officer will forward the request to the appropriate Treasury entity for processing in accordance with this subpart C.
            (d) Incomplete certification. A Treasury entity will return an incomplete debt certification to the creditor agency with notice that the creditor agency must comply with paragraph (b) of this section before action will be taken to collect a debt from a payment issued by a Treasury entity.
            (e) Review. A Treasury entity is not authorized to review the merits of the creditor agency's determination with respect to the amount or validity of the debt certified by the creditor agency.
            (f) When Treasury entities will not comply with offset request. A Treasury entity will comply with the offset request of another agency unless the Treasury entity determines that the offset would not be in the best interests of the United States, or would otherwise be contrary to law.
            (g) Multiple debts. When two or more creditor agencies are seeking offsets from payments made to the same person, or when two or more debts are owed to a single creditor agency, the Treasury entity that has been asked to offset the payments may determine the order in which the debts will be collected or whether one or more debts should be collected by offset simultaneously.
            (h) Priority of debts owed to Treasury entity. For purposes of this section, debts owed to a Treasury entity generally take precedence over debts owed to other agencies. The Treasury entity that has been asked to offset the payments may determine whether to pay debts owed to other agencies before paying a debt owed to a Treasury entity. The Treasury entity that has been asked to offset the payments will determine the order in which the debts will be collected based on the best interests of the United States.
          
          
            § 5.21
            What does a Treasury entity do upon receipt of a request to offset the salary of a Treasury entity employee to collect a debt owed by the employee to another Federal agency?
            (a) Notice to the Treasury employee. When a Treasury entity receives proper certification of a debt owed by one of its employees, the Treasury entity will begin deductions from the employee's pay at the next officially established pay interval. The Treasury entity will send a written notice to the employee indicating that a certified debt claim has been received from the creditor agency, the amount of the debt claimed to be owed by the creditor agency, the date deductions from salary will begin, and the amount of such deductions.
            (b) Amount of deductions from Treasury employee's salary. The amount deducted under § 5.20(b) of this part will be the lesser of the amount of the debt certified by the creditor agency or an amount up to 15% of the debtor's disposable pay. Deductions shall continue until the Treasury entity knows that the debt is paid in full or until otherwise instructed by the creditor agency. Alternatively, the amount offset may be an amount agreed upon, in writing, by the debtor and the creditor agency. See § 5.12(g) (salary offset process).
            (c) When the debtor is no longer employed by the Treasury entity—(1) Offset of final and subsequent payments. If a Treasury entity employee retires or resigns or if his or her employment ends before collection of the debt is complete, the Treasury entity will continue to offset, under 31 U.S.C. 3716, up to 100% of an employee's subsequent payments until the debt is paid or otherwise resolved. Such payments include a debtor's final salary payment, lump-sum leave payment, and other payments payable to the debtor by the Treasury entity. See 31 U.S.C. 3716 and 5 CFR 550.1104(l) and 550.1104(m).
            (2) Notice to the creditor agency. If the employee is separated from the Treasury entity before the debt is paid in full, the Treasury entity will certify to the creditor agency the total amount of its collection. If the Treasury entity is aware that the employee is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, Federal Employee Retirement System, or other similar payments, the Treasury entity will provide written notice to the agency making such payments that the debtor owes a debt (including the amount) and that the provisions of 5 CFR 550.1109 have been fully complied with. The creditor agency is responsible for submitting a certified claim to the agency responsible for making such payments before collection may begin. Generally, creditor agencies will collect such monies through the Treasury Offset Program as described in § 5.9(c) of this part.
            (3) Notice to the debtor. The Treasury entity will provide to the debtor a copy of any notices sent to the creditor agency under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
            (d) When the debtor transfers to another Federal agency—(1) Notice to the creditor agency. If the debtor transfers to another Federal agency before the debt is paid in full, the Treasury entity will notify the creditor agency and will certify the total amount of its collection on the debt. The Treasury entity will provide a copy of the certification to the creditor agency. The creditor agency is responsible for submitting a certified claim to the debtor's new employing agency before collection may begin.
            (2) Notice to the debtor. The Treasury entity will provide to the debtor a copy of any notices and certifications sent to the creditor agency under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
            (e) Request for hearing official. A Treasury entity will provide a hearing official upon the creditor agency's request with respect to a Treasury entity employee. See 5 CFR 550.1107(a).
          
          
            Pt. 5, App. A
            Appendix A to Part 5—Treasury Directive 34-01—Waiving Claims Against Treasury Employees for Erroneous Payments
            Treasury Directive 34-01
            
              Date: July 12, 2000.
            
              Sunset Review: July 12, 2004.
            
              Subject: Waiving Claims Against Treasury Employees for Erroneous Payments.
            1. Purpose
            This Directive establishes the Department of the Treasury's policies and procedures for waiving claims by the Government against an employee for erroneous payments of: (1) Pay and allowances (e.g., health and life insurance) and (2) travel, transportation, and relocation expenses and allowances.
            2. Background
            a. 5 U.S.C. § 5584 authorizes the waiver of claims by the United States in whole or in part against an employee arising out of erroneous payments of pay and allowances, travel, transportation, and relocation expenses and allowances. A waiver may be considered when collection of the claim would be against equity and good conscience and not in the best interest of the United States provided that there does not exist, in connection with the claim, an indication of fraud, misrepresentation, fault, or lack of good faith on the part of the employee or any other person having an interest in obtaining a waiver of the claim.

            b. The General Accounting Office Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-316), Title I, § 103(d), enacted October 19, 1996, amended 5 U.S.C. § 5584 by transferring the authority to waive claims for erroneous payments exceeding $1,500 from the Comptroller General of the United States to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). OMB subsequently redelegated this waiver authority to the executive agency that made the erroneous payment. The authority to waive claims not exceeding $1,500, which was vested in the head of each agency prior to the enactment of Pub. L. 104-316, was unaffected by the Act.
            c. 5 U.S.C. § 5514 authorizes the head of each agency, upon a determination that an employee is indebted to the United States for debts to which the United States is entitled to be repaid at the time of the determination, to deduct up to 15%, or a greater amount if agreed to by the employee, from the employee's pay at officially established pay intervals in order to repay the debt.
            3. Delegation
            a. The Deputy Assistant Secretary (Administration), the heads of bureaus, the Inspector General, and the Inspector General for Tax Administration are delegated the authority to waive, in whole or in part, a claim of the United States against an employee for an erroneous payment of pay and allowances, travel, transportation, and relocation expenses and allowances, aggregating less than $5,000 per claim, in accordance with the limitations and standards in 5 U.S.C. § 5584.
            b. Treasury's Deputy Chief Financial Officer is delegated the authority to waive, in whole or in part, a claim of the United States against an employee for an erroneous payment of pay and allowances, travel, transportation, and relocation expenses and allowances, aggregating $5,000 or more per claim, in accordance with the limitations and standards in 5 U.S.C. § 5584.
            4. Appeals
            a. Requests for waiver of claims aggregating less than $5,000 per claim which are denied in whole or in part may be appealed to the Deputy Chief Financial Officer for the Department of the Treasury.
            b. Requests for waiver of claims aggregating $5,000 or more per claim which are denied in whole or in part may be appealed to the Assistant Secretary (Management)/Chief Financial Officer.
            5. Redelegation
            The Deputy Assistant Secretary (Administration), the heads of bureaus, the Inspector General, and the Inspector General for Tax Administration may redelegate their respective authority and responsibility in writing no lower than the bureau deputy chief financial officer unless authorized by Treasury's Deputy Chief Financial Officer. Copies of each redelegation shall be submitted to the Department's Deputy Chief Financial Officer.
            6. Responsibilities
            a. The Deputy Assistant Secretary (Administration), the heads of bureaus, the Inspector General, and the Inspector General for Tax Administration shall:
            (1) Promptly notify an employee upon discovery of an erroneous payment to that employee;
            (2) Promptly act to collect the erroneous overpayment, following established debt collection policies and procedures;
            (3) Establish time frames for employees to request a waiver in writing and for the bureau to review the waiver request. These time frames must take into consideration the responsibilities of the United States to take prompt action to pursue enforced collection on overdue debts, which may arise from erroneous payments.
            (4) Notify employees whose requests for waiver of claims aggregating less than $5,000 per claim are denied in whole or in part of the basis for the denial and the right to appeal the denial to the Deputy Chief Financial Officer of the Department of the Treasury. All such appeals shall:
            (a) Be made in writing;
            (b) Specify the basis for the appeal;
            (c) Include a chronology of the events surrounding the erroneous payments;
            (d) Include a statement regarding any mitigating factors; and
            (e) Be submitted to the official who denied the waiver request no later than 60 days from receipt by the employee of written notice of the denial of the waiver; and
            (f) Attach at least the following documents: the employee's original request for a waiver; the bureau's denial of the request; any personnel actions, e.g., promotions, demotions, step increases, etc. that relate to the overpayment.
            (5) Forward to Treasury's Deputy Chief Financial Officer the appeal and supporting documentation, the bureau's recommendation as to why the appeal should be approved or denied; and a statement as to the action taken by the bureau to avoid a recurrence of the error.
            (6) Pay a refund when appropriate if a waiver is granted;
            (7) Fulfill all labor relations responsibilities when implementing this directive; and
            (8) Fulfill any other responsibility of the agency imposed by 5 U.S.C. § 5584, or other applicable laws and regulations.

            b. Treasury's Deputy Chief Financial Officer shall advise employees whose requests for waiver of claims aggregating $5,000 or more per claim are denied in whole or in part of the basis for the denial and the right to appeal the denial to the Assistant Secretary (Management)/Chief Financial Officer. All such appeals shall be in the format and contain the information and documentation described in subsection 6.a.(4), above. The Deputy Chief Financial Officer shall forward to Assistant Secretary (Management)/Chief Financial Officer the appeal and supporting documentation, his/her recommendation as to why the appeal should be approved or denied, and a statement obtained from the bureau from which the claim arose as to the action taken by the bureau to avoid a recurrence of the error.
            7. Reporting Requirements
            a. Each bureau, the Deputy Assistant Secretary (Administration) for Departmental Offices, the Inspector General, and the Inspector General for Tax Administration shall maintain a register of waiver actions subject to Departmental review. The register shall cover each fiscal year and be prepared by December 31 of each year for the preceding fiscal year. The register shall contain the following information:
            (1) The total amount waived by the bureau;
            (2) The number and dollar amount of waiver applications granted in full;
            (3) The number and dollar amount of waiver applications granted in part and denied in part, and the dollar amount of each;
            (4) The number and dollar amount of waiver applications denied in their entirety;
            (5) The number of waiver applications referred to the Deputy Chief Financial Officer for initial action or for appeal;
            (6) The dollar amount refunded as a result of waiver action by the bureau; and
            (7) The dollar amount refunded as a result of waiver action by the Deputy Chief Financial Officer or the Assistant Secretary (Management)/Chief Financial Officer.
            b. Each bureau, the Deputy Assistant Secretary (Administration) for Departmental Offices, the Inspector General, and the Inspector General for Tax Administration shall retain a written record of each waiver action for 6 years and 3 months. At a minimum, the written record shall contain:
            (1) The bureau's summary of the events surrounding the erroneous payment;
            (2) Any written comments submitted by the employee from whom collection is sought;
            (3) An account of the waiver action taken and the reasons for such action; and
            (4) Other pertinent information such as any action taken to refund amounts repaid.
            8. Effect of Request for Waiver
            A request for a waiver of a claim shall not affect an employee's opportunity under 5 U.S.C. § 5514(a)(2)(D) for a hearing on the determination of the agency concerning the existence or the amount of the debt, or the terms of the repayment schedule. A request by an employee for a hearing under 5 U.S.C. § 5514(a)(2)(D) shall not affect an employee's right to request a waiver of the claim. The determination whether to waive a claim may be made at the discretion of the deciding official either before or after a final decision is rendered pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 5514(a)(2)(D) concerning the existence or the amount of the debt, or the terms of the repayment schedule.
            9. Guidelines for Determining Requests
            a. A request for a waiver shall not be granted if the deciding official determines there exists, in connection with the claim, an indication of fraud, misrepresentation, fault, or lack of good faith on the part of the employee or any other person having an interest in obtaining a waiver of the claim. There are no exceptions to this rule for financial hardship or otherwise.
            (1) “Fault” exists if, in light of all the circumstances, it is determined that the employee knew or should have known that an error existed, but failed to take action to have it corrected. Fault can derive from an act or a failure to act. Unlike fraud, fault does not require a deliberate intent to deceive. Whether an employee should have known about an error in pay is determined from the perspective of a reasonable person. Pertinent considerations in finding fault include whether:
            (a) The payment resulted from the employee's incorrect, but not fraudulent, statement that the employee should have known was incorrect;
            (b) The payment resulted from the employee's failure to disclose material facts in the employee's possession which the employee should have known to be material; or
            (c) The employee accepted a payment, which the employee knew or should have known to be erroneous.
            (2) Every case must be examined in light of its particular facts. For example, where an employee is promoted to a higher grade but the step level for the employee's new grade is miscalculated, it may be appropriate to conclude that there is no fault on the employee's part because employees are not typically expected to be aware of and understand the rules regarding determination of step level upon promotion. On the other hand, a different conclusion as to fault potentially may be reached if the employee in question is a personnel specialist or an attorney who concentrates on personnel law.
            b. If the deciding official finds an indication of fraud, misrepresentation, fault, or lack of good faith on the part of the employee or any other person having an interest in obtaining a waiver of the claim, then the request for a waiver must be denied.

            c. If the deciding official finds no indication of fraud, misrepresentation, fault, or lack of good faith on the part of the employee or any other person having an interest in obtaining a waiver of the claim, the employee is not automatically entitled to a waiver. Before a waiver can be granted, the deciding official must also determine that collection of the claim against an employee would be against equity and good conscience and not in the best interests of the United States. Factors to consider when determining if collection of a claim against an employee would be against equity and good conscience and not in the best interests of the United States include, but are not limited to:
            (1) Whether collection of the claim would cause serious financial hardship to the employee from whom collection is sought.
            (2) Whether, because of the erroneous payment, the employee either has relinquished a valuable right or changed positions for the worse, regardless of the employee's financial circumstances.
            (a) To establish that a valuable right has been relinquished, it must be shown that the right was, in fact, valuable; that it cannot be regained; and that the action was based chiefly or solely on reliance on the overpayment.
            (b) To establish that the employee's position has changed for the worse, it must be shown that the decision would not have been made but for the overpayment, and that the decision resulted in a loss.
            (c) An example of a “detrimental reliance” would be a decision to sign a lease for a more expensive apartment based chiefly or solely upon reliance on an erroneous calculation of salary, and the funds spent for rent cannot be recovered.
            (3) The cost of collecting the claim equals or exceeds the amount of the claim;
            (4) The time elapsed between the erroneous payment and discovery of the error and notification of the employee;
            (5) Whether failure to make restitution would result in unfair gain to the employee;
            (6) Whether recovery of the claim would be unconscionable under the circumstances.
            d. The burden is on the employee to demonstrate that collection of the claim would be against equity and good conscience and not in the best interest of the United States.

          Subpart A—General Provisions
          
            § 6.1
            Purpose of these rules.

            The Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504 (called “the Act” in this part), provides for the award of attorney fees and other expenses to eligible individuals and entities who are parties to certain administrative proceedings (called “adversary adjudications”) before agencies of the Government of the United States. An eligible party may receive an award when it prevails over an agency, unless the agency's position in the proceeding was substantially justified or special circumstances make an award unjust. The rules in this part describe the parties eligible for awards and the proceedings that are covered. They also explain how to apply for awards, and the procedures and standards that the Treasury Department will use to make them.
          
          
            § 6.2
            When the Act applies.
            The Act applies to any adversary adjudication pending before an agency at any time between October 1, 1981 and September 30, 1984. This includes proceedings begun before October 1, 1981, if final agency action has not been taken before that date, and proceedings pending on September 30, 1984, regardless of when they were initiated or when final agency action occurs.
          
          
            § 6.3
            Proceedings covered.
            The Act applies to adversary adjudications required to be conducted by the Treasury Department under 5 U.S.C. 554. Within the Treasury Department, these proceedings are:
            (a) Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms: (1) Permit proceedings under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (27 U.S.C. 204); (2) Permit proceedings under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 5171, 5271, 5713); (3) License and permit proceedings under the Federal Explosives Laws (18 U.S.C. 843).
            (b) Comptroller of the Currency:
            All proceedings conducted under 12 CFR part 19, subpart A.
          
          
            § 6.4
            Eligibility of applicants.
            (a) To be eligible for an award of attorney fees and other expenses under the Act, the applicant must be a party to the adversary adjudication for which it seeks an award. The term “party” is defined in 5 U.S.C. 551(3). The applicant must show that it meets all conditions of eligibility set out in this subpart and has complied with the requirements in Subpart B of this part.
            (b) The types of eligible applicants are as follows:
            (1) An individual with a net worth of not more than $1 million;
            (2) The sole owner of an unincorporated business who has a net worth of not more than $5 million, including both personal and business interests, and not more than 500 employees;
            (3) A charitable or other tax-exempt organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) with not more than 500 employees;
            (4) A cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141(a)) with not more than 500 employees, or
            (5) Any other partnership, corporation, association, or public or private organization with a net worth of not more than $5 million and not more than 500 employees.
            (c) For the purpose of eligibility, the net worth and number of employees of an applicant shall be determined as of the date the proceeding was initiated.
            (d) An applicant who owns an unincorporated business will be considered as an “individual” rather than a “sole owner of an unincorporated business” if the matter in controversy is primarily related to personal interests rather than to business interests.
            (e) The employees of an applicant include all persons who regularly perform services for remuneration for the applicant, under the applicant's direction and control. Part-time employees shall be included.
            (f) The net worth and number of employees of the applicant and all of its affiliates shall be aggregated to determine eligibility. Any individual or group of individuals, corporation or other entity that directly or indirectly controls or owns a majority of the voting shares of another business, or controls in any manner the election of a majority of that business's board of directors, trustees, or other persons exercising similar functions, will be considered an affiliate of that business for purposes of this part, unless the adjudicative officer determines that such treatment would be unjust and contrary to the purposes of the Act in light of the actual relationship between the affiliated entities. In addition, the adjudicative officer may determine that financial relationships of the applicant other than those described in this paragraph constitute special circumstances that would make an award unjust.

            (g) An applicant that participates in a proceeding primarily on behalf of one or more other persons or entities that would be ineligible is not itself eligible for an award.
          
          
            § 6.5
            Standards for awards.

            (a) A prevailing applicant may receive an award for fees and expenses incurred in connection with the final disposition of a proceeding, unless (1) the position of the agency was substantially justified, or (2) special circumstances make the award unjust. No presumption arises that the agency's position was not substantially justified simply because the agency did not prevail.
            (b) An award will be reduced or denied if the applicant has unduly or unreasonably protracted the proceeding or if special circumstances make the award sought unjust.
          
          
            § 6.6
            Allowable fees and other expenses.
            (a) The following fees and other expenses are allowable under the Act:
            (1) Reasonable expenses of expert witnesses;
            (2) Reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test, or project which the agency finds necessary for the preparation of the party's case;
            (3) Reasonable attorney or agent fees.
            (b) The amount of fees awarded will be based upon the prevailing market rates for the kind and quality of services furnished, except that
            (1) Compensation for an expert witness will not exceed the highest rate paid by the agency for expert witnesses; and
            (2) Attorney or agent fees will not be in excess of $75 per hour.
          
          
            § 6.7
            Delegations of authority.
            The Director, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the Comptroller of the Currency are authorized to take final action on matters pertaining to the Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504, in proceedings listed in § 6.3 under the respective bureau or office. The Secretary of the Treasury may by order delegate authority to take final action on matters pertaining to the Equal Access to Justice Act in particular cases to other subordinate officials.
          
        
        
          Subpart B—Information Required From Applicants
          
            § 6.8
            Contents of application.
            (a) An application for an award of fees and expenses under the Act shall identify the applicant and the proceeding for which an award is sought. The application shall show that the applicant has prevailed and identify the position of the agency in the proceeding that the applicant alleges was not substantially justified. The application shall state the basis for the applicant's belief that the position was not substantially justified. Unless the applicant is an individual, the application shall also state the number of employees of the applicant and describe briefly the type and purpose of its organization or business.
            (b) The application shall also include a statement that the applicant's net worth does not exceed $1 million (if an individual) or $5 million (for all other applicants, including their affiliates). However, an applicant may omit this statement if:
            (1) It attaches a copy of a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service that it qualifies as an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) or, in the case of a tax-exempt organization not required to obtain a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service on its exempt status, a statement that describes the basis for the applicant's belief that it qualifies under such section; or
            (2) It states that it is a cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)).
            (c) The application shall itemize the amount of fees and expenses for which an award is sought.
            (d) The application may also include any other matters that the applicant wishes the agency to consider in determining whether and in what amount an award should be made.

            (e) The application shall be signed by the applicant or an authorized officer with respect to the eligibility of the applicant and by the attorney of the applicant with respect to fees and expenses sought. It shall also contain or be accompanied by a written verification under oath or under penalty of perjury that the information provided in the application is true and correct.

            § 6.9
            Net worth exhibit.
            (a) Each applicant except a qualified tax-exempt organization, or cooperative association must provide with its application a detailed exhibit showing the net worth of the applicant and any affiliates (as defined in § 6.4(f)) when the proceeding was initiated. In the case of national banking associations, “net worth” shall be considered to be the total capital and surplus as reported, in conformity with the applicable instructions and guidelines, on the bank's last Consolidated Report of Condition filed before the initiation of the underlying proceeding.
            (b) The exhibit may be in any form convenient to the applicant that provides full disclosure of the applicant's and its affiliates assets and liabilities and is sufficient to determine whether the applicant qualifies under the standards in this part. The adjudicative officer may require an applicant to file additional information to determine its eligibility for an award.
          
          
            § 6.10
            Documentation of fees and expenses.
            (a) The application shall be accompanied by full documentation of the fees and expenses, including the cost of any study, engineering report, test, or project, for which an award is sought.
            (b) The documentation shall include an affidavit from any attorney, agent, or expert witness representing or appearing in behalf of the party, stating the actual time expended and the rate at which fees and other expenses were computed and describing the specific services performed.
            (1) The affidavit shall state the services performed. In order to establish the hourly rate, the affidavit shall state the hourly rate which is billed and paid by the majority of clients during the relevant time periods.
            (2) If not hourly rate is paid by the majority of clients because, for instance, the attorney or agent represents most clients on a contingency basis, the attorney or agent shall provide information about two attorneys or agents with similar experience, who perform similar work, stating their hourly rate.
            (c) The documentation shall also include a description of any expenses for which reimbursement is sought and a statement of the amounts paid and payable by the applicant or by any other person or entity for the services provided.
            (d) The adjudicative officer may require the applicant to provide vouchers, receipts, or other substantiation for any expenses claimed.
          
          
            § 6.11
            When an application may be filed.
            (a) An application may be filed whenever the applicant has prevailed in the proceeding but in no case later than 30 days after the agency's final disposition of the proceeding.
            (b) If review or reconsideration is sought or taken of a decision as to which an applicant believes it has prevailed, proceedings for the award of fees shall be stayed pending final disposition of the underlying controversy.

            Any application for an award or other pleading or document related to an application shall be filed and served on all parties to the proceeding in the same manner as other pleadings in the proceeding.
          
          
            § 6.13
            Answer to application.
            (a) Within 30 days after service of an application, counsel representing the agency against which an award is sought shall file an answer to the application.

            (b) If agency counsel and the applicant believe that the issues in the fee application can be settled, they may jointly file a statement of their intent to negotiate a settlement. The filing of this statement shall extend the time for filing an answer for an additional 60 days and further extensions may be granted by the adjudicative officer upon request by agency counsel and the applicant.
            (c) The answer shall explain any objections to the award requested and identify the facts relied on in support of agency counsel's position. If the answer is based on any alleged facts not already in the record of the proceeding, agency counsel shall include with the answer supporting affidavits.
          
          
            § 6.14
            Decision.
            The adjudicative officer shall issue an initial decision on the application within 60 days after completion of proceedings on the application. The decision shall include written findings and conclusions on the applicant's eligibility and status as a prevailing party, and an explanation of the reasons for any difference between the amount requested and the amount awarded. The decision shall also include, if at issue, findings on whether the agency's position was substantially justified, whether the applicant unduly protracted the proceedings, or whether special circumstances make an award unjust.
          
          
            § 6.15
            Agency review.
            Either the applicant or agency counsel may seek review of the initial decision on the fee application, or the agency may decide to review the decision on its own initiative. If neither the applicant nor agency counsel seeks a review and the agncy does not take review on its own initiative, the initial decision on the application shall become a final decision of the agency 30 days after it is issued. Whether to review a decision is a matter within the discretion of the agency. If review is taken, the agency will issue a final decision on the application or remand the application to the adjudicative officer for further proceedings.
          
          
            § 6.16
            Judicial review.
            Judicial review of final agency decisions on awards may be sought as provided in 5 U.S.C. 504(c)(2).
          
          
            § 6.17
            Payment of award.
            An applicant seeking payment of an award shall submit to the agency a copy of the agency's final decision granting the award, accompanied by a statement that the applicant will not seek review of the decision in the United States courts. An applicant shall be paid the amount awarded unless judicial review of the award or of the underlying decision of the adversary adjudication has been sought by the applicant or any other party to the proceeding.

          § 7.1
          Purpose.

          Provisions defining the right, title, and interest of the Government in and to an invention made by a Government employee under various circumstances and the duties of Government agencies with respect thereto are set forth in Executive Order 10096, 15 FR 389, as amended (35 U.S.C. 266 note). Further definition of the circumstances under which the Government will acquire the right to a patent in such an invention or a nonexclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free license in the invention, and the procedures for the determination of these interests, are set forth in the regulations issued under that Executive order by the Patent Office, 37 CFR part 100. The purpose of this part 7 is to implement for the Treasury Department the foregoing Executive order and regulations of the Patent Office by (a) bringing to the attention of Treasury employees the law and procedure governing their rights to, and interest in, inventions made by them, (b) defining responsibility within the Department for making the necessary determinations, and, (c) establishing internal procedures for action in conformity with the Executive order and the Patent Office regulations.
        
        
          § 7.2
          Responsibilities of the Department.
          The responsibilities of the Treasury Department are to determine initially (a) the occurrence of an invention by an employee, (b) his rights in the invention and the rights of the Government therein, and (c) whether patent protection will be sought in the United States by the Department, and to furnish the required reports to the Patent Office.
        
        
          § 7.3
          Responsibilities of heads of offices.
          (a) Heads of bureaus or offices in the Department shall be responsible for determining initially whether the results of research, development, or other activity of an employee within that bureau or office constitute an invention which falls within the purview of Executive Order 10096, as amended, and is to be handled in accordance with the regulations in this part.
          (b) Heads of bureaus or offices are responsible for obtaining from the employee the necessary information and, if the determination under paragraph (a) of this section is affirmative, preparing on behalf of the bureau or office a description of the invention and its relationship to the employee's duties and work assignments.
          (c) Heads of bureaus or offices, after such examination and investigation as may be necessary, shall refer to the General Counsel all information obtained concerning the invention and such determination as the head of the bureau or office has made with respect to the character of the activity as an invention. These reports shall include any determination as to the giving of a cash award to the employee for his performance relating to that invention.
        
        
          § 7.4
          Responsibilities of the General Counsel.
          (a) The General Counsel shall be responsible for determining, subject to review by the Commissioner of Patents, the respective rights of the Government and of the inventor in and to any invention made by an employee of the Department.
          (b) On the basis of the foregoing determination, the General Counsel shall determine whether patent protection will be sought by the Department for such an invention.
          (c) The General Counsel will prepare and furnish to the Patent Office the reports required by the regulations of that Office and will serve as the liaison officer between the Department and the Commissioner of Patents.
        
        
          § 7.5
          Responsibilities of employees.
          All employees are required to report to the heads of their bureaus or offices any result of research, development, or other activity on their part which may constitute an invention and the circumstances under which this possible invention came into being.
        
        
          § 7.6
          Effect of awards.
          The acceptance by an employee of a cash award for performance which constitutes an invention shall, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 4502(c), constitute an agreement that the use by the Government of the idea, method, or device for which the award is made does not form the basis of any further claim against the Government by the employee, his heirs or assigns.

            (b) Failure to appear. If either party to the proceedings fails to appear at the hearing, after due notice has been sent, the Administrative Law Judge may deem them to have waived the right to a hearing and may make a decision against the absent party by default.
          
          
            
            § 8.64
            Evidence.
            (a) Rules of evidence. The rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law and equity are not controlling in hearings. However, the Administrative Law Judge shall exclude evidence which is irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious.
            (b) Depositions. Depositions of witnesses taken pursuant to § 8.65 may be admitted as evidence.
            (c) Government documents. Official documents, records, and papers of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the Office of the Director of Practice are admissible in evidence without the prouction of an officer or employee to authenticate them. These documents, records and papers may be evidenced by a copy attested or identified by an officer or employee of the Bureau or the Treasury Department.
            (d) Exhibits. If any document, record, or other paper is introduced in evidence as an exhibit, the Administrative Law Judge may authorize the withdrawal of the exhibit subject to any conditions he or she deems proper.
            (e) Objections. Objections to evidence will be in short form, stating the grounds of objection and the record may not include arguments thereon, except as ordered by the Administrative Law Judge. Rulings on objections will be a part of the record. No exception to the ruling is necessary to preserve the rights of the parties.
          
          
            § 8.65
            Depositions.
            Depositions for use at a hearing may, with the written approval of the Administrative Law Judge, be taken by either the Director of Practice or the respondent or their authorized representatives. Depositions may be taken upon oral or written questioning, upon not less than 10 days' written notice to the other party before any officer authorized to administer an oath for general purposes or before an officer or employee of the Bureau authorized to administer an oath pursuant to 27 CFR 70.35. The written notice will state the names of the witnesses and the time and place where the depositions are to be taken. The requirement of 10 days' notice may be waived by the parties in writing, and depositions may then be taken from the persons and at the times and places mutually agreed to by the parties. When a deposition is taken upon written questioning, any cross-examination will be upon written questioning. Copies of the written questioning will be served upon the other party with the notice, and copies of any written cross-interrogation will be mailed or delivered to the opposing party at least 5 days before the date of taking the depositions, unless the parties mutually agree otherwise. A party on whose behalf a deposition is taken must file it with the Administrative Law Judge and serve one copy upon the opposing party. Expenses in the reproduction of depositions will be borne by the party at whose instance the deposition is taken.

            In cases in which the hearing is stenographically reported by a Government contract reporter, copies of the transcript may be obtained from the reporter at rates not to exceed the maximum rates fixed by contract between the Government and the reporter. If the hearing is stenographically reported by a regular employee of the Bureau, a copy of the hearing will be supplied to the respondent either without charge or upon the payment of a reasonable fee. Copies of exhibits introduced at the hearing or at the taking of depositions will be supplied to the parties upon the payment of a reasonable fee.

Upon the issuance of a final order for suspension or disbarment, the Director of Practice shall give notice of the order to appropriate officers and employees of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and to interested departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Director of Practice may also give notice as he or she may determine to the proper authorities of the State in which the disbarred or suspended person was licensed to practice as an attorney or certified public accountant.

          General.
          (a) Upon request of the head of any Government department or agency, upon application of an interested party, or upon his own motion, the Assistant Secretary shall set in motion an immediate investigation to determine the effects on the national security of imports of any article.
          (b) The Secretary shall report the findings of his investigation under paragraph (a) of this section with respect to the effect of the importation of such article in such quantities or under such circumstances upon the national security and, based on such findings, his recommendation for action or inaction to the President within one year after receiving an application from an interested party or otherwise beginning an investigation under this section.

          § 9.4
          Criteria for determining effects of imports on national security.
          (a) In determining the effect on the national security of imports of the article which is the subject of the investigation, the Secretary is required to take into consideration the following:
          (1) Domestic production needed for projected national defense requirements including restoration and rehabilitation.
          (2) The capacity of domestic industries to meet such projected requirements, including existing and anticipated availabilities of:
          (i) Human resources.
          (ii) Products.
          (iii) Raw materials.
          (iv) Production equipment and facilities.
          (v) Other supplies and services essential to the national defense.
          (3) The requirement of growth of such industries and such supplies and services including the investment, exploration and development necessary to assure capacity to meet projected defense requirements.
          (4) The effect which the quantities, availabilities, character and uses of imported goods have or will have on such industries and the capacity of the United States to meet national security requirements.
          (5) The economic welfare of the Nation as it is related to our national security, including the impact of foreign competition on the economic welfare of individual domestic industries. In determining whether such impact may impair the national security, any substantial unemployment, decrease in revenues of government, loss of skills or investment, or other serious effects shall be considered.
          (b) The Secretary shall also consider other relevant factors in determining whether the national security is affected by imports of the article.

          (4) Pertinent statistics showing the quantities and values of both imports and production in the United States.
          (5) Nature, sources, and degree of the competition created by imports of the article in question.

            § 10.4
            Eligibility to become an enrolled agent, enrolled retirement plan agent, or registered tax return preparer.
            (a) Enrollment as an enrolled agent upon examination. The Commissioner, or delegate, will grant enrollment as an enrolled agent to an applicant eighteen years of age or older who demonstrates special competence in tax matters by written examination administered by, or administered under the oversight of, the Internal Revenue Service, who possesses a current or otherwise valid preparer tax identification number or other prescribed identifying number, and who has not engaged in any conduct that would justify the suspension or disbarment of any practitioner under the provisions of this part.
            (b) Enrollment as a retirement plan agent upon examination. The Commissioner, or delegate, will grant enrollment as an enrolled retirement plan agent to an applicant eighteen years of age or older who demonstrates special competence in qualified retirement plan matters by written examination administered by, or administered under the oversight of, the Internal Revenue Service, who possesses a current or otherwise valid preparer tax identification number or other prescribed identifying number, and who has not engaged in any conduct that would justify the suspension or disbarment of any practitioner under the provisions of this part.
            (c) Designation as a registered tax return preparer. The Commissioner, or delegate, may designate an individual eighteen years of age or older as a registered tax return preparer provided an applicant demonstrates competence in Federal tax return preparation matters by written examination administered by, or administered under the oversight of, the Internal Revenue Service, or otherwise meets the requisite standards prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, possesses a current or otherwise valid preparer tax identification number or other prescribed identifying number, and has not engaged in any conduct that would justify the suspension or disbarment of any practitioner under the provisions of this part.
            (d) Enrollment of former Internal Revenue Service employees. The Commissioner, or delegate, may grant enrollment as an enrolled agent or enrolled retirement plan agent to an applicant who, by virtue of past service and technical experience in the Internal Revenue Service, has qualified for such enrollment and who has not engaged in any conduct that would justify the suspension or disbarment of any practitioner under the provisions of this part, under the following circumstances:
            (1) The former employee applies for enrollment on an Internal Revenue Service form and supplies the information requested on the form and such other information regarding the experience and training of the applicant as may be relevant.
            (2) The appropriate office of the Internal Revenue Service provides a detailed report of the nature and rating of the applicant's work while employed by the Internal Revenue Service and a recommendation whether such employment qualifies the applicant technically or otherwise for the desired authorization.
            (3) Enrollment as an enrolled agent based on an applicant's former employment with the Internal Revenue Service may be of unlimited scope or it may be limited to permit the presentation of matters only of the particular specialty or only before the particular unit or division of the Internal Revenue Service for which the applicant's former employment has qualified the applicant. Enrollment as an enrolled retirement plan agent based on an applicant's former employment with the Internal Revenue Service will be limited to permit the presentation of matters only with respect to qualified retirement plan matters.
            (4) Application for enrollment as an enrolled agent or enrolled retirement plan agent based on an applicant's former employment with the Internal Revenue Service must be made within three years from the date of separation from such employment.
            (5) An applicant for enrollment as an enrolled agent who is requesting such enrollment based on former employment with the Internal Revenue Service must have had a minimum of five years continuous employment with the Internal Revenue Service during which the applicant must have been regularly engaged in applying and interpreting the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations relating to income, estate, gift, employment, or excise taxes.
            (6) An applicant for enrollment as an enrolled retirement plan agent who is requesting such enrollment based on former employment with the Internal Revenue Service must have had a minimum of five years continuous employment with the Internal Revenue Service during which the applicant must have been regularly engaged in applying and interpreting the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations relating to qualified retirement plan matters.

            (7) For the purposes of paragraphs (d)(5) and (6) of this section, an aggregate of 10 or more years of employment in positions involving the application and interpretation of the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, at least three of which occurred within the five years preceding the date of application, is the equivalent of five years continuous employment.
            (e) Natural persons. Enrollment or authorization to practice may be granted only to natural persons.
            (f) Effective/applicability date. This section is applicable beginning August 2, 2011.
            [T.D. 9527, 76 FR 32301, June 3, 2011]
          
          
            § 10.5
            Application to become an enrolled agent, enrolled retirement plan agent, or registered tax return preparer.
            (a) Form; address. An applicant to become an enrolled agent, enrolled retirement plan agent, or registered tax return preparer must apply as required by forms or procedures established and published by the Internal Revenue Service, including proper execution of required forms under oath or affirmation. The address on the application will be the address under which a successful applicant is enrolled or registered and is the address to which all correspondence concerning enrollment or registration will be sent.
            (b) Fee. A reasonable nonrefundable fee may be charged for each application to become an enrolled agent, enrolled retirement plan agent, or registered tax return preparer. See 26 CFR part 300.
            (c) Additional information; examination. The Internal Revenue Service may require the applicant, as a condition to consideration of an application, to file additional information and to submit to any written or oral examination under oath or otherwise. Upon the applicant's written request, the Internal Revenue Service will afford the applicant the opportunity to be heard with respect to the application.
            (d) Compliance and suitability checks. (1) As a condition to consideration of an application, the Internal Revenue Service may conduct a Federal tax compliance check and suitability check. The tax compliance check will be limited to an inquiry regarding whether an applicant has filed all required individual or business tax returns and whether the applicant has failed to pay, or make proper arrangements with the Internal Revenue Service for payment of, any Federal tax debts. The suitability check will be limited to an inquiry regarding whether an applicant has engaged in any conduct that would justify suspension or disbarment of any practitioner under the provisions of this part on the date the application is submitted, including whether the applicant has engaged in disreputable conduct as defined in § 10.51. The application will be denied only if the results of the compliance or suitability check are sufficient to establish that the practitioner engaged in conduct subject to sanctions under §§ 10.51 and 10.52.
            (2) If the applicant does not pass the tax compliance or suitability check, the applicant will not be issued an enrollment or registration card or certificate pursuant to § 10.6(b) of this part. An applicant who is initially denied enrollment or registration for failure to pass a tax compliance check may reapply after the initial denial if the applicant becomes current with respect to the applicant's tax liabilities.
            (e) Temporary recognition. On receipt of a properly executed application, the Commissioner, or delegate, may grant the applicant temporary recognition to practice pending a determination as to whether status as an enrolled agent, enrolled retirement plan agent, or registered tax return preparer should be granted. Temporary recognition will be granted only in unusual circumstances and it will not be granted, in any circumstance, if the application is not regular on its face, if the information stated in the application, if true, is not sufficient to warrant granting the application to practice, or the Commissioner, or delegate, has information indicating that the statements in the application are untrue or that the applicant would not otherwise qualify to become an enrolled agent, enrolled retirement plan agent, or registered tax return preparer. Issuance of temporary recognition does not constitute either a designation or a finding of eligibility as an enrolled agent, enrolled retirement plan agent, or registered tax return preparer, and the temporary recognition may be withdrawn at any time.
            (f) Protest of application denial. The applicant will be informed in writing as to the reason(s) for any denial of an application. The applicant may, within 30 days after receipt of the notice of denial of the application, file a written protest of the denial as prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service in forms, guidance, or other appropriate guidance. A protest under this section is not governed by subpart D of this part.
            (g) Effective/applicability date. This section is applicable to applications received on or after August 2, 2011.
            [T.D. 9527, 63 FR 32302, June 3, 2011, as amended at 76 FR 49650, Aug. 11, 2011]
          
          
            § 10.6
            Term and renewal of status as an enrolled agent, enrolled retirement plan agent, or registered tax return preparer.
            (a) Term. Each individual authorized to practice before the Internal Revenue Service as an enrolled agent, enrolled retirement plan agent, or registered tax return preparer will be accorded active enrollment or registration status subject to renewal of enrollment or registration as provided in this part.
            (b) Enrollment or registration card or certificate. The Internal Revenue Service will issue an enrollment or registration card or certificate to each individual whose application to practice before the Internal Revenue Service is approved. Each card or certificate will be valid for the period stated on the card or certificate. An enrolled agent, enrolled retirement plan agent, or registered tax return preparer may not practice before the Internal Revenue Service if the card or certificate is not current or otherwise valid. The card or certificate is in addition to any notification that may be provided to each individual who obtains a preparer tax identification number.
            (c) Change of address. An enrolled agent, enrolled retirement plan agent, or registered tax return preparer must send notification of any change of address to the address specified by the Internal Revenue Service within 60 days of the change of address. This notification must include the enrolled agent's, enrolled retirement plan agent's, or registered tax return preparer's name, prior address, new address, tax identification number(s) (including preparer tax identification number), and the date the change of address is effective. Unless this notification is sent, the address for purposes of any correspondence from the appropriate Internal Revenue Service office responsible for administering this part shall be the address reflected on the practitioner's most recent application for enrollment or registration, or application for renewal of enrollment or registration. A practitioner's change of address notification under this part will not constitute a change of the practitioner's last known address for purposes of section 6212 of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations thereunder.
            (d) Renewal—(1) In general. Enrolled agents, enrolled retirement plan agents, and registered tax return preparers must renew their status with the Internal Revenue Service to maintain eligibility to practice before the Internal Revenue Service.

            (ii) Enrolled agents who have a Social Security number or tax identification number that ends with the numbers 0, 1, 2, or 3, except for those individuals who received their initial enrollment after November 1, 2003, must apply for renewal between November 1, 2003, and January 31, 2004. The renewal will be effective April 1, 2004.

The renewal will be effective April 1, 2006.
            
            (v) Thereafter, applications for renewal as an enrolled agent will be required between November 1 and January 31 of every subsequent third year as specified in paragraph (d)(2)(i), (d)(2)(ii), or (d)(2)(iii) of this section according to the last number of the individual's Social Security number or tax identification number. Those individuals who receive initial enrollment as an enrolled agent after November 1 and before April 2 of the applicable renewal period will not be required to renew their enrollment before the first full renewal period following the receipt of their initial enrollment.
            (3) Renewal period for enrolled retirement plan agents. (i) All enrolled retirement plan agents must renew their preparer tax identification number as prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service in forms, instructions, or other appropriate guidance.

            (6) Fee. A reasonable nonrefundable fee may be charged for each application for renewal filed. See 26 CFR part 300.

The notice will state the basis for the determination of noncompliance and will provide the individual an opportunity to furnish the requested information in writing relating to the matter within 60 days of the date of the notice. Such information will be considered in making a final determination as to eligibility for renewal. The individual must be informed of the reason(s) for any denial of a renewal.

A protest under this section is not governed by subpart D of this part.
            (2) The continuing education records of an enrolled agent, enrolled retirement plan agent, or registered tax return preparer may be reviewed to determine compliance with the requirements and standards for renewal as provided in paragraph (f) of this section. As part of this review, the enrolled agent, enrolled retirement plan agent or registered tax return preparer may be required to provide the Internal Revenue Service with copies of any continuing education records required to be maintained under this part. If the enrolled agent, enrolled retirement plan agent or registered tax return preparer fails to comply with this requirement, any continuing education hours claimed may be disallowed.
            (3) An individual who has not filed a timely application for renewal, who has not made a timely response to the notice of noncompliance with the renewal requirements, or who has not satisfied the requirements of eligibility for renewal will be placed on a roster of inactive enrolled individuals or inactive registered individuals.

            (4) Individuals placed in inactive status and individuals ineligible to practice before the Internal Revenue Service may not state or imply that they are eligible to practice before the Internal Revenue Service, or use the terms enrolled agent, enrolled retirement plan agent, or registered tax return preparer, the designations “EA” or “ERPA” or other form of reference to eligibility to practice before the Internal Revenue Service.
            (5) An individual placed in inactive status may be reinstated to an active status by filing an application for renewal and providing evidence of the completion of all required continuing education hours for the enrollment cycle or registration year. Continuing education credit under this paragraph (j)(5) may not be used to satisfy the requirements of the enrollment cycle or registration year in which the individual has been placed back on the active roster.

            (6) An individual placed in inactive status must file an application for renewal and satisfy the requirements for renewal as set forth in this section within three years of being placed in inactive status. Otherwise, the name of such individual will be removed from the inactive status roster and the individual's status as an enrolled agent, enrolled retirement plan agent, or registered tax return preparer will terminate. Future eligibility for active status must then be reestablished by the individual as provided in this section.
            (7) Inactive status is not available to an individual who is the subject of a pending disciplinary matter before the Internal Revenue Service.
            (k) Inactive retirement status. An individual who no longer practices before the Internal Revenue Service may request to be placed in an inactive retirement status at any time and such individual will be placed in an inactive retirement status. The individual will be ineligible to practice before the Internal Revenue Service. An individual who is placed in an inactive retirement status may be reinstated to an active status by filing an application for renewal and providing evidence of the completion of the required continuing education hours for the enrollment cycle or registration year. Inactive retirement status is not available to an individual who is ineligible to practice before the Internal Revenue Service or an individual who is the subject of a pending disciplinary matter under this part.

            (a) In general. A practitioner must exercise due diligence—
            (1) In preparing or assisting in the preparation of, approving, and filing tax returns, documents, affidavits, and other papers relating to Internal Revenue Service matters;
            (2) In determining the correctness of oral or written representations made by the practitioner to the Department of the Treasury; and
            (3) In determining the correctness of oral or written representations made by the practitioner to clients with reference to any matter administered by the Internal Revenue Service.
            (b) Reliance on others. Except as modified by §§ 10.34 and 10.37, a practitioner will be presumed to have exercised due diligence for purposes of this section if the practitioner relies on the work product of another person and the practitioner used reasonable care in engaging, supervising, training, and evaluating the person, taking proper account of the nature of the relationship between the practitioner and the person.

            Assistance from or to disbarred or suspended persons and former Internal Revenue Service employees.
            A practitioner may not, knowingly and directly or indirectly:
            (a) Accept assistance from or assist any person who is under disbarment or suspension from practice before the Internal Revenue Service if the assistance relates to a matter or matters constituting practice before the Internal Revenue Service.
            (b) Accept assistance from any former government employee where the provisions of § 10.25 or any Federal law would be violated.
          
          
            § 10.25
            Practice by former government employees, their partners and their associates.
            (a) Definitions. For purposes of this section—
            (1) Assist means to act in such a way as to advise, furnish information to, or otherwise aid another person, directly, or indirectly.
            (2) Government employee is an officer or employee of the United States or any agency of the United States, including a special Government employee as defined in 18 U.S.C. 202(a), or of the District of Columbia, or of any State, or a member of Congress or of any State legislature.
            (3) Member of a firm is a sole practitioner or an employee or associate thereof, or a partner, stockholder, associate, affiliate or employee of a partnership, joint venture, corporation, professional association or other affiliation of two or more practitioners who represent nongovernmental parties.
            (4) Particular matter involving specific parties is defined at 5 CFR 2637.201(c), or superseding post-employment regulations issued by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics.
            (5) Rule includes Treasury regulations, whether issued or under preparation for issuance as notices of proposed rulemaking or as Treasury decisions, revenue rulings, and revenue procedures published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see 26 CFR 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b)).
            (b) General rules—(1) No former Government employee may, subsequent to Government employment, represent anyone in any matter administered by the Internal Revenue Service if the representation would violate 18 U.S.C. 207 or any other laws of the United States.

            (2) No former Government employee who personally and substantially participated in a particular matter involving specific parties may, subsequent to Government employment, represent or knowingly assist, in that particular matter, any person who is or was a specific party to that particular matter.
            
            (3) A former Government employee who within a period of one year prior to the termination of Government employment had official responsibility for a particular matter involving specific parties may not, within two years after Government employment is ended, represent in that particular matter any person who is or was a specific party to that particular matter.
            (4) No former Government employee may, within one year after Government employment is ended, communicate with or appear before, with the intent to influence, any employee of the Treasury Department in connection with the publication, withdrawal, amendment, modification, or interpretation of a rule the development of which the former Government employee participated in, or for which, within a period of one year prior to the termination of Government employment, the former government employee had official responsibility. This paragraph (b)(4) does not, however, preclude any former employee from appearing on one's own behalf or from representing a taxpayer before the Internal Revenue Service in connection with a particular matter involving specific parties involving the application or interpretation of a rule with respect to that particular matter, provided that the representation is otherwise consistent with the other provisions of this section and the former employee does not utilize or disclose any confidential information acquired by the former employee in the development of the rule.
            (c) Firm representation—(1) No member of a firm of which a former Government employee is a member may represent or knowingly assist a person who was or is a specific party in any particular matter with respect to which the restrictions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section apply to the former Government employee, in that particular matter, unless the firm isolates the former Government employee in such a way to ensure that the former Government employee cannot assist in the representation.
            (2) When isolation of a former Government employee is required under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a statement affirming the fact of such isolation must be executed under oath by the former Government employee and by another member of the firm acting on behalf of the firm. The statement must clearly identify the firm, the former Government employee, and the particular matter(s) requiring isolation. The statement must be retained by the firm and, upon request, provided to the office(s) of the Internal Revenue Service administering or enforcing this part.
            (d) Pending representation. The provisions of this regulation will govern practice by former Government employees, their partners and associates with respect to representation in particular matters involving specific parties where actual representation commenced before the effective date of this regulation.

            Notaries.
            A practitioner may not take acknowledgments, administer oaths, certify papers, or perform any official act as a notary public with respect to any matter administered by the Internal Revenue Service and for which he or she is employed as counsel, attorney, or agent, or in which he or she may be in any way interested.
          
          
            § 10.27
            Fees.
            (a) In general. A practitioner may not charge an unconscionable fee in connection with any matter before the Internal Revenue Service.
            (b) Contingent fees. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2), (3), and (4) of this section, a practitioner may not charge a contingent fee for services rendered in connection with any matter before the Internal Revenue Service.
            (2) A practitioner may charge a contingent fee for services rendered in connection with the Service's examination of, or challenge to—
            (i) An original tax return; or

            (ii) An amended return or claim for refund or credit where the amended return or claim for refund or credit was filed within 120 days of the taxpayer receiving a written notice of the examination of, or a written challenge to the original tax return.
            (3) A practitioner may charge a contingent fee for services rendered in connection with a claim for credit or refund filed solely in connection with the determination of statutory interest or penalties assessed by the Internal Revenue Service.
            (4) A practitioner may charge a contingent fee for services rendered in connection with any judicial proceeding arising under the Internal Revenue Code.
            (c) Definitions. For purposes of this section—
            (1) Contingent fee is any fee that is based, in whole or in part, on whether or not a position taken on a tax return or other filing avoids challenge by the Internal Revenue Service or is sustained either by the Internal Revenue Service or in litigation. A contingent fee includes a fee that is based on a percentage of the refund reported on a return, that is based on a percentage of the taxes saved, or that otherwise depends on the specific result attained. A contingent fee also includes any fee arrangement in which the practitioner will reimburse the client for all or a portion of the client's fee in the event that a position taken on a tax return or other filing is challenged by the Internal Revenue Service or is not sustained, whether pursuant to an indemnity agreement, a guarantee, rescission rights, or any other arrangement with a similar effect.
            (2) Matter before the Internal Revenue Service includes tax planning and advice, preparing or filing or assisting in preparing or filing returns or claims for refund or credit, and all matters connected with a presentation to the Internal Revenue Service or any of its officers or employees relating to a taxpayer's rights, privileges, or liabilities under laws or regulations administered by the Internal Revenue Service. Such presentations include, but are not limited to, preparing and filing documents, corresponding and communicating with the Internal Revenue Service, rendering written advice with respect to any entity, transaction, plan or arrangement, and representing a client at conferences, hearings, and meetings.
            (d) Effective/applicability date. This section is applicable for fee arrangements entered into after March 26, 2008.

            § 10.28
            Return of client's records.
            (a) In general, a practitioner must, at the request of a client, promptly return any and all records of the client that are necessary for the client to comply with his or her Federal tax obligations. The practitioner may retain copies of the records returned to a client. The existence of a dispute over fees generally does not relieve the practitioner of his or her responsibility under this section. Nevertheless, if applicable state law allows or permits the retention of a client's records by a practitioner in the case of a dispute over fees for services rendered, the practitioner need only return those records that must be attached to the taxpayer's return. The practitioner, however, must provide the client with reasonable access to review and copy any additional records of the client retained by the practitioner under state law that are necessary for the client to comply with his or her Federal tax obligations.
            (b) For purposes of this section, Records of the client include all documents or written or electronic materials provided to the practitioner, or obtained by the practitioner in the course of the practitioner's representation of the client, that preexisted the retention of the practitioner by the client. The term also includes materials that were prepared by the client or a third party (not including an employee or agent of the practitioner) at any time and provided to the practitioner with respect to the subject matter of the representation. The term also includes any return, claim for refund, schedule, affidavit, appraisal or any other document prepared by the practitioner, or his or her employee or agent, that was presented to the client with respect to a prior representation if such document is necessary for the taxpayer to comply with his or her current Federal tax obligations. The term does not include any return, claim for refund, schedule, affidavit, appraisal or any other document prepared by the practitioner or the practitioner's firm, employees or agents if the practitioner is withholding such document pending the client's performance of its contractual obligation to pay fees with respect to such document.
          
          
            § 10.29
            Conflicting interests.
            (a) Except as provided by paragraph (b) of this section, a practitioner shall not represent a client before the Internal Revenue Service if the representation involves a conflict of interest. A conflict of interest exists if—
            (1) The representation of one client will be directly adverse to another client; or
            (2) There is a significant risk that the representation of one or more clients will be materially limited by the practitioner's responsibilities to another client, a former client or a third person, or by a personal interest of the practitioner.
            (b) Notwithstanding the existence of a conflict of interest under paragraph (a) of this section, the practitioner may represent a client if—
            (1) The practitioner reasonably believes that the practitioner will be able to provide competent and diligent representation to each affected client;
            (2) The representation is not prohibited by law; and
            (3) Each affected client waives the conflict of interest and gives informed consent, confirmed in writing by each affected client, at the time the existence of the conflict of interest is known by the practitioner. The confirmation may be made within a reasonable period after the informed consent, but in no event later than 30 days.
            (c) Copies of the written consents must be retained by the practitioner for at least 36 months from the date of the conclusion of the representation of the affected clients, and the written consents must be provided to any officer or employee of the Internal Revenue Service on request.
            (d) Effective/applicability date. This section is applicable on September 26, 2007.

            § 10.30
            Solicitation.
            (a) Advertising and solicitation restrictions. (1) A practitioner may not, with respect to any Internal Revenue Service matter, in any way use or participate in the use of any form of public communication or private solicitation containing a false, fraudulent, or coercive statement or claim; or a misleading or deceptive statement or claim. Enrolled agents, enrolled retirement plan agents, or registered tax return preparers, in describing their professional designation, may not utilize the term “certified” or imply an employer/employee relationship with the Internal Revenue Service. Examples of acceptable descriptions for enrolled agents are “enrolled to represent taxpayers before the Internal Revenue Service,” “enrolled to practice before the Internal Revenue Service,” and “admitted to practice before the Internal Revenue Service.” Similarly, examples of acceptable descriptions for enrolled retirement plan agents are “enrolled to represent taxpayers before the Internal Revenue Service as a retirement plan agent” and “enrolled to practice before the Internal Revenue Service as a retirement plan agent.” An example of an acceptable description for registered tax return preparers is “designated as a registered tax return preparer by the Internal Revenue Service.”
            (2) A practitioner may not make, directly or indirectly, an uninvited written or oral solicitation of employment in matters related to the Internal Revenue Service if the solicitation violates Federal or State law or other applicable rule, e.g., attorneys are precluded from making a solicitation that is prohibited by conduct rules applicable to all attorneys in their State(s) of licensure. Any lawful solicitation made by or on behalf of a practitioner eligible to practice before the Internal Revenue Service must, nevertheless, clearly identify the solicitation as such and, if applicable, identify the source of the information used in choosing the recipient.
            (b) Fee information. (1)(i) A practitioner may publish the availability of a written schedule of fees and disseminate the following fee information—
            (A) Fixed fees for specific routine services.
            (B) Hourly rates.
            
            (C) Range of fees for particular services.
            (D) Fee charged for an initial consultation.
            (ii) Any statement of fee information concerning matters in which costs may be incurred must include a statement disclosing whether clients will be responsible for such costs.
            (2) A practitioner may charge no more than the rate(s) published under paragraph (b)(1) of this section for at least 30 calendar days after the last date on which the schedule of fees was published.
            (c) Communication of fee information. Fee information may be communicated in professional lists, telephone directories, print media, mailings, electronic mail, facsimile, hand delivered flyers, radio, television, and any other method. The method chosen, however, must not cause the communication to become untruthful, deceptive, or otherwise in violation of this part. A practitioner may not persist in attempting to contact a prospective client if the prospective client has made it known to the practitioner that he or she does not desire to be solicited. In the case of radio and television broadcasting, the broadcast must be recorded and the practitioner must retain a recording of the actual transmission. In the case of direct mail and e-commerce communications, the practitioner must retain a copy of the actual communication, along with a list or other description of persons to whom the communication was mailed or otherwise distributed. The copy must be retained by the practitioner for a period of at least 36 months from the date of the last transmission or use.
            (d) Improper associations. A practitioner may not, in matters related to the Internal Revenue Service, assist, or accept assistance from, any person or entity who, to the knowledge of the practitioner, obtains clients or otherwise practices in a manner forbidden under this section.
            (e) Effective/applicability date. This section is applicable beginning August 2, 2011.

            Best practices for tax advisors.
            (a) Best practices. Tax advisors should provide clients with the highest quality representation concerning Federal tax issues by adhering to best practices in providing advice and in preparing or assisting in the preparation of a submission to the Internal Revenue Service. In addition to compliance with the standards of practice provided elsewhere in this part, best practices include the following:
            (1) Communicating clearly with the client regarding the terms of the engagement. For example, the advisor should determine the client's expected purpose for and use of the advice and should have a clear understanding with the client regarding the form and scope of the advice or assistance to be rendered.

            (2) Establishing the facts, determining which facts are relevant, evaluating the reasonableness of any assumptions or representations, relating the applicable law (including potentially applicable judicial doctrines) to the relevant facts, and arriving at a conclusion supported by the law and the facts.
            (3) Advising the client regarding the import of the conclusions reached, including, for example, whether a taxpayer may avoid accuracy-related penalties under the Internal Revenue Code if a taxpayer acts in reliance on the advice.
            (4) Acting fairly and with integrity in practice before the Internal Revenue Service.
            (b) Procedures to ensure best practices for tax advisors. Tax advisors with responsibility for overseeing a firm's practice of providing advice concerning Federal tax issues or of preparing or assisting in the preparation of submissions to the Internal Revenue Service should take reasonable steps to ensure that the firm's procedures for all members, associates, and employees are consistent with the best practices set forth in paragraph (a) of this section.

            § 10.34
            Standards with respect to tax returns and documents, affidavits and other papers.
            (a) Tax returns. (1) A practitioner may not willfully, recklessly, or through gross incompetence—
            (i) Sign a tax return or claim for refund that the practitioner knows or reasonably should know contains a position that—
            (A) Lacks a reasonable basis;
            (B) Is an unreasonable position as described in section 6694(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue code (Code) (including the related regulations and other published guidance); or
            (C) Is a willful attempted by the practitioner to understate the liability for tax or a reckless or intentional disregard of rules or regulations by the practitioner as described in section 6694(b)(2) of the Code (including the related regulations and other published guidance).
            (ii) Advise a client to take a position on a tax return or claim for refund, or prepare a portion off a tax return or claim for refund containing a position, that—
            (A) Lacks a reasonable basis;
            (B) Is an unreasonable position as described in section 6694(a)(2) of the Code (including the related regulations and other published guidance); or
            (C) Is a willful attempt by the practitioner to understate the liability for tax or a reckless or intentional disregard of rules or regulations by the practitioner as described in section 6694(b)(2) of the Code (including the related regulations and other published guidance).
            (2) A pattern of conduct is a factor that will be taken into account in determining whether a practitioner acted willfully, recklessly, or through gross incompetence.
            (b) Documents, affidavits and other papers. (1) A practitioner may not advise a client to take a position on a document, affidavit or other paper submitted to the Internal Revenue Service unless the position is not frivolous.
            (2) A practitioner may not advise a client to submit a document, affidavit or other paper to the Internal Revenue Service—
            (i) The purpose of which is to delay or impede the administration of the Federal tax laws;
            (ii) That is frivolous; or
            (iii) That contains or omits information in a manner that demonstrates an intentional disregard of a rule or regulation unless the practitioner also advises the client to submit a document that evidences a good faith challenge to the rule or regulation.
            (c) Advising clients on potential penalties. (1) A practitioner must inform a client of any penalties that are reasonably likely to apply to the client with respect to—
            (i) A position taken on a tax return if—
            (A) The practitioner advised the client with respect to the position; or
            (B) The practitioner prepared or signed the tax return; and
            (ii) Any document, affidavit or other paper submitted to the Internal Revenue Service.

            (2) The practitioner also must inform the client of any opportunity to avoid any such penalties by disclosure, if relevant, and of the requirements for adequate disclosure.
            (3) This paragraph (c) applies even if the practitioner is not subject to a penalty under the Internal Revenue Code with respect to the position or with respect to the document, affidavit or other paper submitted.
            (d) Relying on information furnished by clients. A practitioner advising a client to take a position on a tax return, document, affidavit or other paper submitted to the Internal Revenue Service, or preparing or signing a tax return as a preparer, generally may rely in good faith without verification upon information furnished by the client. The practitioner may not, however, ignore the implications of information furnished to, or actually known by, the practitioner, and must make reasonable inquiries if the information as furnished appears to be incorrect, inconsistent with an important fact or another factual assumption, or incomplete.

            § 10.37
            Requirements for written advice.
            (a) Requirements. (1) A practitioner may give written advice (including by means of electronic communication) concerning one or more Federal tax matters subject to the requirements in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Government submissions on matters of general policy are not considered written advice on a Federal tax matter for purposes of this section. Continuing education presentations provided to an audience solely for the purpose of enhancing practitioners' professional knowledge on Federal tax matters are not considered written advice on a Federal tax matter for purposes of this section. The preceding sentence does not apply to presentations marketing or promoting transactions.
            (2) The practitioner must—
            (i) Base the written advice on reasonable factual and legal assumptions (including assumptions as to future events);
            (ii) Reasonably consider all relevant facts and circumstances that the practitioner knows or reasonably should know;
            (iii) Use reasonable efforts to identify and ascertain the facts relevant to written advice on each Federal tax matter;
            (iv) Not rely upon representations, statements, findings, or agreements (including projections, financial forecasts, or appraisals) of the taxpayer or any other person if reliance on them would be unreasonable;
            (v) Relate applicable law and authorities to facts; and
            (vi) Not, in evaluating a Federal tax matter, take into account the possibility that a tax return will not be audited or that a matter will not be raised on audit.
            (3) Reliance on representations, statements, findings, or agreements is unreasonable if the practitioner knows or reasonably should know that one or more representations or assumptions on which any representation is based are incorrect, incomplete, or inconsistent.
            (b) Reliance on advice of others. A practitioner may only rely on the advice of another person if the advice was reasonable and the reliance is in good faith considering all the facts and circumstances. Reliance is not reasonable when—
            (1) The practitioner knows or reasonably should know that the opinion of the other person should not be relied on;
            (2) The practitioner knows or reasonably should know that the other person is not competent or lacks the necessary qualifications to provide the advice; or
            (3) The practitioner knows or reasonably should know that the other person has a conflict of interest in violation of the rules described in this part.
            (c) Standard of review. (1) In evaluating whether a practitioner giving written advice concerning one or more Federal tax matters complied with the requirements of this section, the Commissioner, or delegate, will apply a reasonable practitioner standard, considering all facts and circumstances, including, but not limited to, the scope of the engagement and the type and specificity of the advice sought by the client.

            (2) In the case of an opinion the practitioner knows or has reason to know will be used or referred to by a person other than the practitioner (or a person who is a member of, associated with, or employed by the practitioner's firm) in promoting, marketing, or recommending to one or more taxpayers a partnership or other entity, investment plan or arrangement a significant purpose of which is the avoidance or evasion of any tax imposed by the Internal Revenue Code, the Commissioner, or delegate, will apply a reasonable practitioner standard, considering all facts and circumstances, with emphasis given to the additional risk caused by the practitioner's lack of knowledge of the taxpayer's particular circumstances, when determining whether a practitioner has failed to comply with this section.
            (d) Federal tax matter. A Federal tax matter, as used in this section, is any matter concerning the application or interpretation of—
            (1) A revenue provision as defined in section 6110(i)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code;
            (2) Any provision of law impacting a person's obligations under the internal revenue laws and regulations, including but not limited to the person's liability to pay tax or obligation to file returns; or
            (3) Any other law or regulation administered by the Internal Revenue Service.
            (e) Effective/applicability date. This section is applicable to written advice rendered after June 12, 2014.

To promote and maintain the public's confidence in tax advisors, the Internal Revenue Service is authorized to establish one or more advisory committees composed of at least six individuals authorized to practice before the Internal Revenue Service. Membership of an advisory committee must be balanced among those who practice as attorneys, accountants, enrolled agents, enrolled actuaries, enrolled retirement plan agents, and registered tax return preparers. Under procedures prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, an advisory committee may review and make general recommendations regarding the practices, procedures, and policies of the offices described in § 10.1.

            § 10.50
            Sanctions.
            (a) Authority to censure, suspend, or disbar. The Secretary of the Treasury, or delegate, after notice and an opportunity for a proceeding, may censure, suspend, or disbar any practitioner from practice before the Internal Revenue Service if the practitioner is shown to be incompetent or disreputable (within the meaning of § 10.51), fails to comply with any regulation in this part (under the prohibited conduct standards of § 10.52), or with intent to defraud, willfully and knowingly misleads or threatens a client or prospective client. Censure is a public reprimand.
            (b) Authority to disqualify. The Secretary of the Treasury, or delegate, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, may disqualify any appraiser for a violation of these rules as applicable to appraisers.
            (1) If any appraiser is disqualified pursuant to this subpart C, the appraiser is barred from presenting evidence or testimony in any administrative proceeding before the Department of Treasury or the Internal Revenue Service, unless and until authorized to do so by the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to § 10.81, regardless of whether the evidence or testimony would pertain to an appraisal made prior to or after the effective date of disqualification.
            (2) Any appraisal made by a disqualified appraiser after the effective date of disqualification will not have any probative effect in any administrative proceeding before the Department of the Treasury or the Internal Revenue Service. An appraisal otherwise barred from admission into evidence pursuant to this section may be admitted into evidence solely for the purpose of determining the taxpayer's reliance in good faith on such appraisal.
            (c) Authority to impose monetary penalty—(1) In general. (i) The Secretary of the Treasury, or delegate, after notice and an opportunity for a proceeding, may impose a monetary penalty on any practitioner who engages in conduct subject to sanction under paragraph (a) of this section.

            (ii) If the practitioner described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section was acting on behalf of an employer or any firm or other entity in connection with the conduct giving rise to the penalty, the Secretary of the Treasury, or delegate, may impose a monetary penalty on the employer, firm, or entity if it knew, or reasonably should have known, of such conduct.
            (2) Amount of penalty. The amount of the penalty shall not exceed the gross income derived (or to be derived) from the conduct giving rise to the penalty.
            (3) Coordination with other sanctions. Subject to paragraph (c)(2) of this section—
            (i) Any monetary penalty imposed on a practitioner under this paragraph (c) may be in addition to or in lieu of any suspension, disbarment or censure and may be in addition to a penalty imposed on an employer, firm or other entity under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.
            (ii) Any monetary penalty imposed on an employer, firm or other entity may be in addition to or in lieu of penalties imposed under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.
            (d) Authority to accept a practitioner's consent to sanction. The Internal Revenue Service may accept a practitioner's offer of consent to be sanctioned under § 10.50 in lieu of instituting or continuing a proceeding under § 10.60(a).
            (e) Sanctions to be imposed. The sanctions imposed by this section shall take into account all relevant facts and circumstances.

            § 10.51
            Incompetence and disreputable conduct.
            (a) Incompetence and disreputable conduct. Incompetence and disreputable conduct for which a practitioner may be sanctioned under § 10.50 includes, but is not limited to—
            (1) Conviction of any criminal offense under the Federal tax laws.
            (2) Conviction of any criminal offense involving dishonesty or breach of trust.
            (3) Conviction of any felony under Federal or State law for which the conduct involved renders the practitioner unfit to practice before the Internal Revenue Service.
            (4) Giving false or misleading information, or participating in any way in the giving of false or misleading information to the Department of the Treasury or any officer or employee thereof, or to any tribunal authorized to pass upon Federal tax matters, in connection with any matter pending or likely to be pending before them, knowing the information to be false or misleading. Facts or other matters contained in testimony, Federal tax returns, financial statements, applications for enrollment, affidavits, declarations, and any other document or statement, written or oral, are included in the term “information.”
            (5) Solicitation of employment as prohibited under § 10.30, the use of false or misleading representations with intent to deceive a client or prospective client in order to procure employment, or intimating that the practitioner is able improperly to obtain special consideration or action from the Internal Revenue Service or any officer or employee thereof.
            (6) Willfully failing to make a Federal tax return in violation of the Federal tax laws, or willfully evading, attempting to evade, or participating in any way in evading or attempting to evade any assessment or payment of any Federal tax.
            (7) Willfully assisting, counseling, encouraging a client or prospective client in violating, or suggesting to a client or prospective client to violate, any Federal tax law, or knowingly counseling or suggesting to a client or prospective client an illegal plan to evade Federal taxes or payment thereof.
            (8) Misappropriation of, or failure properly or promptly to remit, funds received from a client for the purpose of payment of taxes or other obligations due the United States.

            (9) Directly or indirectly attempting to influence, or offering or agreeing to attempt to influence, the official action of any officer or employee of the Internal Revenue Service by the use of threats, false accusations, duress or coercion, by the offer of any special inducement or promise of an advantage, or by the bestowing of any gift, favor or thing of value.
            (10) Disbarment or suspension from practice as an attorney, certified public accountant, public accountant or actuary by any duly constituted authority of any State, territory, or possession of the United States, including a Commonwealth, or the District of Columbia, any Federal court of record or any Federal agency, body or board.
            (11) Knowingly aiding and abetting another person to practice before the Internal Revenue Service during a period of suspension, disbarment or ineligibility of such other person.
            (12) Contemptuous conduct in connection with practice before the Internal Revenue Service, including the use of abusive language, making false accusations or statements, knowing them to be false or circulating or publishing malicious or libelous matter.
            (13) Giving a false opinion, knowingly, recklessly, or through gross incompetence, including an opinion which is intentionally or recklessly misleading, or engaging in a pattern of providing incompetent opinions on questions arising under the Federal tax laws. False opinions described in this paragraph (a)(13) include those which reflect or result from a knowing misstatement of fact or law, from an assertion of a position known to be unwarranted under existing law, from counseling or assisting in conduct known to be illegal or fraudulent, from concealing matters required by law to be revealed, or from consciously disregarding information indicating that material facts expressed in the opinion or offering material are false or misleading. For purposes of this paragraph (a)(13), reckless conduct is a highly unreasonable omission or misrepresentation involving an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care that a practitioner should observe under the circumstances. A pattern of conduct is a factor that will be taken into account in determining whether a practitioner acted knowingly, recklessly, or through gross incompetence. Gross incompetence includes conduct that reflects gross indifference, preparation which is grossly inadequate under the circumstances, and a consistent failure to perform obligations to the client.
            (14) Willfully failing to sign a tax return prepared by the practitioner when the practitioner's signature is required by the Federal tax laws unless the failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect.
            (15) Willfully disclosing or otherwise using a tax return or tax return information in a manner not authorized by the Internal Revenue Code, contrary to the order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or contrary to the order of an administrative law judge in a proceeding instituted under § 10.60.
            (16) Willfully failing to file on magnetic or other electronic media a tax return prepared by the practitioner when the practitioner is required to do so by the Federal tax laws unless the failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect.
            (17) Willfully preparing all or substantially all of, or signing, a tax return or claim for refund when the practitioner does not possess a current or otherwise valid preparer tax identification number or other prescribed identifying number.
            (18) Willfully representing a taxpayer before an officer or employee of the Internal Revenue Service unless the practitioner is authorized to do so pursuant to this part.

            § 10.64
            Answer; default.
            (a) Filing. The respondent's answer must be filed with the Administrative Law Judge, and served on the Internal Revenue Service, within the time specified in the complaint unless, on request or application of the respondent, the time is extended by the Administrative Law Judge.
            
            (b) Contents. The answer must be written and contain a statement of facts that constitute the respondent's grounds of defense. General denials are not permitted. The respondent must specifically admit or deny each allegation set forth in the complaint, except that the respondent may state that the respondent is without sufficient information to admit or deny a specific allegation. The respondent, nevertheless, may not deny a material allegation in the complaint that the respondent knows to be true, or state that the respondent is without sufficient information to form a belief, when the respondent possesses the required information. The respondent also must state affirmatively any special matters of defense on which he or she relies.
            (c) Failure to deny or answer allegations in the complaint. Every allegation in the complaint that is not denied in the answer is deemed admitted and will be considered proved; no further evidence in respect of such allegation need be adduced at a hearing.
            (d) Default. Failure to file an answer within the time prescribed (or within the time for answer as extended by the Administrative Law Judge), constitutes an admission of the allegations of the complaint and a waiver of hearing, and the Administrative Law Judge may make the decision by default without a hearing or further procedure. A decision by default constitutes a decision under § 10.76.
            (e) Signature. The answer must be signed by the respondent or the respondent's authorized representative under § 10.69(a)(2) and must include a statement directly above the signature acknowledging that the statements made in the answer are true and correct and that knowing and willful false statements may be punishable under 18 U.S.C. 1001.

            § 10.65
            Supplemental charges.
            (a) In general. Supplemental charges may be filed against the respondent by amending the complaint with the permission of the Administrative Law Judge if, for example—
            (1) It appears that the respondent, in the answer, falsely and in bad faith, denies a material allegation of fact in the complaint or states that the respondent has insufficient knowledge to form a belief, when the respondent possesses such information; or
            (2) It appears that the respondent has knowingly introduced false testimony during the proceedings against the respondent.
            (b) Hearing. The supplemental charges may be heard with other charges in the case, provided the respondent is given due notice of the charges and is afforded a reasonable opportunity to prepare a defense to the supplemental charges.

            § 10.66
            Reply to answer.
            (a) The Internal Revenue Service may file a reply to the respondent's answer, but unless otherwise ordered by the Administrative Law Judge, no reply to the respondent's answer is required. If a reply is not filed, new matter in the answer is deemed denied.
            (b) Effective/applicability date. This section is applicable beginning August 2, 2011.

            § 10.67
            Proof; variance; amendment of pleadings.
            In the case of a variance between the allegations in pleadings and the evidence adduced in support of the pleadings, the Administrative Law Judge, at any time before decision, may order or authorize amendment of the pleadings to conform to the evidence. The party who would otherwise be prejudiced by the amendment must be given a reasonable opportunity to address the allegations of the pleadings as amended and the Administrative Law Judge must make findings on any issue presented by the pleadings as amended.
          
          
            
            § 10.68
            Motions and requests.
            (a) Motions—(1) In general. At any time after the filing of the complaint, any party may file a motion with the Administrative Law Judge. Unless otherwise ordered by the Administrative Law Judge, motions must be in writing and must be served on the opposing party as provided in § 10.63(b). A motion must concisely specify its grounds and the relief sought, and, if appropriate, must contain a memorandum of facts and law in support.
            (2) Summary adjudication. Either party may move for a summary adjudication upon all or any part of the legal issues in controversy. If the non-moving party opposes summary adjudication in the moving party's favor, the non-moving party must file a written response within 30 days unless ordered otherwise by the Administrative Law Judge.
            (3) Good Faith. A party filing a motion for extension of time, a motion for postponement of a hearing, or any other non-dispositive or procedural motion must first contact the other party to determine whether there is any objection to the motion, and must state in the motion whether the other party has an objection.
            (b) Response. Unless otherwise ordered by the Administrative Law Judge, the nonmoving party is not required to file a response to a motion. If the Administrative Law Judge does not order the nonmoving party to file a response, and the nonmoving party files no response, the nonmoving party is deemed to oppose the motion. If a nonmoving party does not respond within 30 days of the filing of a motion for decision by default for failure to file a timely answer or for failure to prosecute, the nonmoving party is deemed not to oppose the motion.
            (c) Oral motions; oral argument—(1) The Administrative Law Judge may, for good cause and with notice to the parties, permit oral motions and oral opposition to motions.
            (2) The Administrative Law Judge may, within his or her discretion, permit oral argument on any motion.
            (d) Orders. The Administrative Law Judge should issue written orders disposing of any motion or request and any response thereto.

            § 10.69
            Representation; ex parte communication.
            (a) Representation. (1) The Internal Revenue Service may be represented in proceedings under this part by an attorney or other employee of the Internal Revenue Service. An attorney or an employee of the Internal Revenue Service representing the Internal Revenue Service in a proceeding under this part may sign the complaint or any document required to be filed in the proceeding on behalf of the Internal Revenue Service.
            (2) A respondent may appear in person, be represented by a practitioner, or be represented by an attorney who has not filed a declaration with the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to § 10.3. A practitioner or an attorney representing a respondent or proposed respondent may sign the answer or any document required to be filed in the proceeding on behalf of the respondent.
            (b) Ex parte communication. The Internal Revenue Service, the respondent, and any representatives of either party, may not attempt to initiate or participate in ex parte discussions concerning a proceeding or potential proceeding with the Administrative Law Judge (or any person who is likely to advise the Administrative Law Judge on a ruling or decision) in the proceeding before or during the pendency of the proceeding. Any memorandum, letter or other communication concerning the merits of the proceeding, addressed to the Administrative Law Judge, by or on behalf of any party shall be regarded as an argument in the proceeding and shall be served on the other party.

            (1) Administer oaths and affirmations;
            (2) Make rulings on motions and requests, which rulings may not be appealed prior to the close of a hearing except in extraordinary circumstances and at the discretion of the Administrative Law Judge;
            (3) Determine the time and place of hearing and regulate its course and conduct;

            § 10.71
            Discovery.
            (a) In general. Discovery may be permitted, at the discretion of the Administrative Law Judge, only upon written motion demonstrating the relevance, materiality and reasonableness of the requested discovery and subject to the requirements of § 10.72(d)(2) and (3). Within 10 days of receipt of the answer, the Administrative Law Judge will notify the parties of the right to request discovery and the timeframes for filing a request. A request for discovery, and objections, must be filed in accordance with § 10.68. In response to a request for discovery, the Administrative Law Judge may order—
            (1) Depositions upon oral examination; or
            (2) Answers to requests for admission.
            (b) Depositions upon oral examination—(1) A deposition must be taken before an officer duly authorized to administer an oath for general purposes or before an officer or employee of the Internal Revenue Service who is authorized to administer an oath in Federal tax law matters.
            (2) In ordering a deposition, the Administrative Law Judge will require reasonable notice to the opposing party as to the time and place of the deposition. The opposing party, if attending, will be provided the opportunity for full examination and cross-examination of any witness.
            (3) Expenses in the reporting of depositions shall be borne by the party at whose instance the deposition is taken. Travel expenses of the deponent shall be borne by the party requesting the deposition, unless otherwise authorized by Federal law or regulation.
            (c) Requests for admission. Any party may serve on any other party a written request for admission of the truth of any matters which are not privileged and are relevant to the subject matter of this proceeding. Requests for admission shall not exceed a total of 30 (including any subparts within a specific request) without the approval from the Administrative Law Judge.
            (d) Limitations. Discovery shall not be authorized if—
            (1) The request fails to meet any requirement set forth in paragraph (a) of this section;
            (2) It will unduly delay the proceeding;
            (3) It will place an undue burden on the party required to produce the discovery sought;
            (4) It is frivolous or abusive;
            (5) It is cumulative or duplicative;

            (6) The material sought is privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure by law;
            
            (7) The material sought relates to mental impressions, conclusions, or legal theories of any party, attorney, or other representative, of a party prepared in anticipation of a proceeding; or

            (e) Failure to comply. Where a party fails to comply with an order of the Administrative Law Judge under this section, the Administrative Law Judge may, among other things, infer that the information would be adverse to the party failing to provide it, exclude the information from evidence or issue a decision by default.
            (f) Other discovery. No discovery other than that specifically provided for in this section is permitted.
            (g) Effective/applicability date. This section is applicable to proceedings initiated on or after September 26, 2007.

            § 10.72
            Hearings.
            (a) In general—(1) Presiding officer. An Administrative Law Judge will preside at the hearing on a complaint filed under § 10.60 for the sanction of a practitioner, employer, firm or other entity, or appraiser.
            (2) Time for hearing. Absent a determination by the Administrative Law Judge that, in the interest of justice, a hearing must be held at a later time, the Administrative Law Judge should, on notice sufficient to allow proper preparation, schedule the hearing to occur no later than 180 days after the time for filing the answer.

            (iv) An evidentiary hearing must be held in all proceedings prior to the issuance of a decision by the Administrative Law Judge unless—
            (A) The Internal Revenue Service withdraws the complaint;

            (C) A decision is issued under § 10.82(e);
            (D) The respondent requests a decision on the written record without a hearing; or

            (b) Cross-examination. A party is entitled to present his or her case or defense by oral or documentary evidence, to submit rebuttal evidence, and to conduct cross-examination, in the presence of the Administrative Law Judge, as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts. This paragraph (b) does not limit a party from presenting evidence contained within a deposition when the Administrative Law Judge determines that the deposition has been obtained in compliance with the rules of this subpart D.
            (c) Prehearing memorandum. Unless otherwise ordered by the Administrative Law Judge, each party shall file, and serve on the opposing party or the opposing party's representative, prior to any hearing, a prehearing memorandum containing—
            (1) A list (together with a copy) of all proposed exhibits to be used in the party's case in chief;
            (2) A list of proposed witnesses, including a synopsis of their expected testimony, or a statement that no witnesses will be called;
            (3) Identification of any proposed expert witnesses, including a synopsis of their expected testimony and a copy of any report prepared by the expert or at his or her direction; and
            (4) A list of undisputed facts.
            (d) Publicity—(1) In general. All reports and decisions of the Secretary of the Treasury, or delegate, including any reports and decisions of the Administrative Law Judge, under this subpart D are, subject to the protective measures in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, public and open to inspection within 30 days after the agency's decision becomes final.
            (2) Request for additional publicity. The Administrative Law Judge may grant a request by a practitioner or appraiser that all the pleadings and evidence of the disciplinary proceeding be made available for inspection where the parties stipulate in advance to adopt the protective measures in paragraph (d)(4) of this section.
            (3) Returns and return information—(i) Disclosure to practitioner or appraiser. Pursuant to section 6103(l)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code, the Secretary of the Treasury, or delegate, may disclose returns and return information to any practitioner or appraiser, or to the authorized representative of the practitioner or appraiser, whose rights are or may be affected by an administrative action or proceeding under this subpart D, but solely for use in the action or proceeding and only to the extent that the Secretary of the Treasury, or delegate, determines that the returns or return information are or may be relevant and material to the action or proceeding.
            (ii) Disclosure to officers and employees of the Department of the Treasury. Pursuant to section 6103(l)(4)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code, the Secretary of the Treasury, or delegate, may disclose returns and return information to officers and employees of the Department of the Treasury for use in any action or proceeding under this subpart D, to the extent necessary to advance or protect the interests of the United States.
            (iii) Use of returns and return information. Recipients of returns and return information under this paragraph (d)(3) may use the returns or return information solely in the action or proceeding, or in preparation for the action or proceeding, with respect to which the disclosure was made.
            (iv) Procedures for disclosure of returns and return information. When providing returns or return information to the practitioner or appraiser, or authorized representative, the Secretary of the Treasury, or delegate, will—
            (A) Redact identifying information of any third party taxpayers and replace it with a code;
            (B) Provide a key to the coded information; and
            (C) Notify the practitioner or appraiser, or authorized representative, of the restrictions on the use and disclosure of the returns and return information, the applicable damages remedy under section 7431 of the Internal Revenue Code, and that unauthorized disclosure of information provided by the Internal Revenue Service under this paragraph (d)(3) is also a violation of this part.
            (4) Protective measures—(i) Mandatory protective order. If redaction of names, addresses, and other identifying information of third party taxpayers may still permit indirect identification of any third party taxpayer, the Administrative Law Judge will issue a protective order to ensure that the identifying information is available to the parties and the Administrative Law Judge for purposes of the proceeding, but is not disclosed to, or open to inspection by, the public.
            (ii) Authorized orders. (A) Upon motion by a party or any other affected person, and for good cause shown, the Administrative Law Judge may make any order which justice requires to protect any person in the event disclosure of information is prohibited by law, privileged, confidential, or sensitive in some other way, including, but not limited to, one or more of the following—
            (1) That disclosure of information be made only on specified terms and conditions, including a designation of the time or place;
            (2) That a trade secret or other information not be disclosed, or be disclosed only in a designated way.
            (iii) Denials. If a motion for a protective order is denied in whole or in part, the Administrative Law Judge may, on such terms or conditions as the Administrative Law Judge deems just, order any party or person to comply with, or respond in accordance with, the procedure involved.
            (iv) Public inspection of documents. The Secretary of the Treasury, or delegate, shall ensure that all names, addresses or other identifying details of third party taxpayers are redacted and replaced with the code assigned to the corresponding taxpayer in all documents prior to public inspection of such documents.
            (e) Location. The location of the hearing will be determined by the agreement of the parties with the approval of the Administrative Law Judge, but, in the absence of such agreement and approval, the hearing will be held in Washington, D.C.
            (f) Failure to appear. If either party to the proceeding fails to appear at the hearing, after notice of the proceeding has been sent to him or her, the party will be deemed to have waived the right to a hearing and the Administrative Law Judge may make his or her decision against the absent party by default.

            (a) In general. The rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law and equity are not controlling in hearings or proceedings conducted under this part. The Administrative Law Judge may, however, exclude evidence that is irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious,
            (b) Depositions. The deposition of any witness taken pursuant to § 10.71 may be admitted into evidence in any proceeding instituted under § 10.60.
            (c) Requests for admission. Any matter admitted in response to a request for admission under § 10.71 is conclusively established unless the Administrative Law Judge on motion permits withdrawal or modification of the admission. Any admission made by a party is for the purposes of the pending action only and is not an admission by a party for any other purpose, nor may it be used against a party in any other proceeding.
            (d) Proof of documents. Official documents, records, and papers of the Internal Revenue Service and the Office of Professional Responsibility are admissible in evidence without the production of an officer or employee to authenticate them. Any documents, records, and papers may be evidenced by a copy attested to or identified by an officer or employee of the Internal Revenue Service or the Treasury Department, as the case may be.
            (e) Withdrawal of exhibits. If any document, record, or other paper is introduced in evidence as an exhibit, the Administrative Law Judge may authorize the withdrawal of the exhibit subject to any conditions that he or she deems proper.
            (f) Objections. Objections to evidence are to be made in short form, stating the grounds for the objection. Except as ordered by the Administrative Law Judge, argument on objections will not be recorded or transcribed. Rulings on objections are to be a part of the record, but no exception to a ruling is necessary to preserve the rights of the parties.

The decision must include a statement of findings and conclusions, as well as the reasons or basis for making such findings and conclusions, and an order of censure, suspension, disbarment, monetary penalty, disqualification, or dismissal of the complaint.
            (2) Summary adjudication. In the event that a motion for summary adjudication is filed, the Administrative Law Judge should rule on the motion for summary adjudication within 60 days after the party in opposition files a written response, or if no written response is filed, within 90 days after the motion for summary adjudication is filed. A decision shall thereafter be rendered if the pleadings, depositions, admissions, and any other admissible evidence show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that a decision may be rendered as a matter of law. The decision must include a statement of conclusions, as well as the reasons or basis for making such conclusions, and an order of censure, suspension, disbarment, monetary penalty, disqualification, or dismissal of the complaint.
            (3) Returns and return information. In the decision, the Administrative Law Judge should use the code assigned to third party taxpayers (described in § 10.72(d)).
            (b) Standard of proof. If the sanction is censure or a suspension of less than six months' duration, the Administrative Law Judge, in rendering findings and conclusions, will consider an allegation of fact to be proven if it is established by the party who is alleging the fact by a preponderance of the evidence in the record. If the sanction is a monetary penalty, disbarment or a suspension of six months or longer duration, an allegation of fact that is necessary for a finding against the practitioner must be proven by clear and convincing evidence in the record. An allegation of fact that is necessary for a finding of disqualification against an appraiser must be proven by clear and convincing evidence in the record.
            (c) Copy of decision. The Administrative Law Judge will provide the decision to the Internal Revenue Service's authorized representative, and a copy of the decision to the respondent or the respondent's authorized representative.
            (d) When final. In the absence of an appeal to the Secretary of the Treasury or delegate, the decision of the Administrative Law Judge will, without further proceedings, become the decision of the agency 30 days after the date of the Administrative Law Judge's decision.
            (e) Effective/applicability date. This section is applicable beginning August 2, 2011.

            § 10.77
            Appeal of decision of Administrative Law Judge.
            (a) Appeal. Any party to the proceeding under this subpart D may appeal the decision of the Administrative Law Judge by filing a notice of appeal with the Secretary of the Treasury, or delegate deciding appeals. The notice of appeal must include a brief that states exceptions to the decision of Administrative Law Judge and supporting reasons for such exceptions.
            (b) Time and place for filing of appeal. The notice of appeal and brief must be filed, in duplicate, with the Secretary of the Treasury, or delegate deciding appeals, at an address for appeals that is identified to the parties with the decision of the Administrative Law Judge. The notice of appeal and brief must be filed within 30 days of the date that the decision of the Administrative Law Judge is served on the parties. The appealing party must serve a copy of the notice of appeal and the brief to any non-appealing party or, if the party is represented, the non-appealing party's representative.
            (c) Response. Within 30 days of receiving the copy of the appellant's brief, the other party may file a response brief with the Secretary of the Treasury, or delegate deciding appeals, using the address identified for appeals. A copy of the response brief must be served at the same time on the opposing party or, if the party is represented, the opposing party's representative.
            (d) No other briefs, responses or motions as of right. Other than the appeal brief and response brief, the parties are not permitted to file any other briefs, responses or motions, except on a grant of leave to do so after a motion demonstrating sufficient cause, or unless otherwise ordered by the Secretary of the Treasury, or delegate deciding appeals.
            (e) Additional time for briefs and responses. Notwithstanding the time for filing briefs and responses provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the Secretary of the Treasury, or delegate deciding appeals, may, for good cause, authorize additional time for filing briefs and responses upon a motion of a party or upon the initiative of the Secretary of the Treasury, or delegate deciding appeals.
            (f) Effective/applicability date. This section is applicable beginning August 2, 2011.

            § 10.78
            Decision on review.
            (a) Decision on review. On appeal from or review of the decision of the Administrative Law Judge, the Secretary of the Treasury, or delegate, will make the agency decision. The Secretary of the Treasury, or delegate, should make the agency decision within 180 days after receipt of the appeal.
            (b) Standard of review. The decision of the Administrative Law Judge will not be reversed unless the appellant establishes that the decision is clearly erroneous in light of the evidence in the record and applicable law. Issues that are exclusively matters of law will be reviewed de novo. In the event that the Secretary of the Treasury, or delegate, determines that there are unresolved issues raised by the record, the case may be remanded to the Administrative Law Judge to elicit additional testimony or evidence.
            (c) Copy of decision on review. The Secretary of the Treasury, or delegate, will provide copies of the agency decision to the authorized representative of the Internal Revenue Service and the respondent or the respondent's authorized representative.

            § 10.79
            Effect of disbarment, suspension, or censure.
            (a) Disbarment. When the final decision in a case is against the respondent (or the respondent has offered his or her consent and such consent has been accepted by the Internal Revenue Service) and such decision is for disbarment, the respondent will not be permitted to practice before the Internal Revenue Service unless and until authorized to do so by the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to § 10.81.
            (b) Suspension. When the final decision in a case is against the respondent (or the respondent has offered his or her consent and such consent has been accepted by the Internal Revenue Service) and such decision is for suspension, the respondent will not be permitted to practice before the Internal Revenue Service during the period of suspension. For periods after the suspension, the practitioner's future representations may be subject to conditions as authorized by paragraph (d) of this section.
            (c) Censure. When the final decision in the case is against the respondent (or the Internal Revenue Service has accepted the respondent's offer to consent, if such offer was made) and such decision is for censure, the respondent will be permitted to practice before the Internal Revenue Service, but the respondent's future representations may be subject to conditions as authorized by paragraph (d) of this section.
            (d) Conditions. After being subject to the sanction of either suspension or censure, the future representations of a practitioner so sanctioned shall be subject to specified conditions designed to promote high standards of conduct. These conditions can be imposed for a reasonable period in light of the gravity of the practitioner's violations. For example, where a practitioner is censured because the practitioner failed to advise the practitioner's clients about a potential conflict of interest or failed to obtain the clients' written consents, the practitioner may be required to provide the Internal Revenue Service with a copy of all consents obtained by the practitioner for an appropriate period following censure, whether or not such consents are specifically requested.

            Notice of disbarment, suspension, censure, or disqualification.
            (a) In general. On the issuance of a final order censuring, suspending, or disbarring a practitioner or a final order disqualifying an appraiser, notification of the censure, suspension, disbarment or disqualification will be given to appropriate officers and employees of the Internal Revenue Service and interested departments and agencies of the Federal government. The Internal Revenue Service may determine the manner of giving notice to the proper authorities of the State by which the censured, suspended, or disbarred person was licensed to practice.

            Petition for reinstatement.
            (a) In general. A practitioner disbarred or suspended under § 10.60, or suspended under § 10.82, or a disqualified appraiser may petition for reinstatement before the Internal Revenue Service after the expiration of 5 years following such disbarment, suspension, or disqualification (or immediately following the expiration of the suspension or disqualification period, if shorter than 5 years). Reinstatement will not be granted unless the Internal Revenue Service is satisfied that the petitioner is not likely to engage thereafter in conduct contrary to the regulations in this part, and that granting such reinstatement would not be contrary to the public interest.

            § 10.82
            Expedited suspension.
            (a) When applicable. Whenever the Commissioner, or delegate, determines that a practitioner is described in paragraph (b) of this section, the expedited procedures described in this section may be used to suspend the practitioner from practice before the Internal Revenue Service.
            (b) To whom applicable. This section applies to any practitioner who, within 5 years prior to the date that a show cause order under this section's expedited suspension procedures is served:
            (1) Has had a license to practice as an attorney, certified public accountant, or actuary suspended or revoked for cause (not including failure to pay a professional licensing fee) by any authority or court, agency, body, or board described in § 10.51(a)(10).
            (2) Has, irrespective of whether an appeal has been taken, been convicted of any crime under title 26 of the United States Code, any crime involving dishonesty or breach of trust, or any felony for which the conduct involved renders the practitioner unfit to practice before the Internal Revenue Service.
            (3) Has violated conditions imposed on the practitioner pursuant to § 10.79(d).
            (4) Has been sanctioned by a court of competent jurisdiction, whether in a civil or criminal proceeding (including suits for injunctive relief), relating to any taxpayer's tax liability or relating to the practitioner's own tax liability, for—
            (i) Instituting or maintaining proceedings primarily for delay;
            (ii) Advancing frivolous or groundless arguments; or
            (iii) Failing to pursue available administrative remedies.
            (5) Has demonstrated a pattern of willful disreputable conduct by—

            (i) Failing to make an annual Federal tax return, in violation of the Federal tax laws, during 4 of the 5 tax years immediately preceding the institution of a proceeding under paragraph (c) of this section and remains noncompliant with any of the practitioner's Federal tax filing obligations at the time the notice of suspension is issued under paragraph (f) of this section; or
            
            (ii) Failing to make a return required more frequently than annually, in violation of the Federal tax laws, during 5 of the 7 tax periods immediately preceding the institution of a proceeding under paragraph (c) of this section and remains noncompliant with any of the practitioner's Federal tax filing obligations at the time the notice of suspension is issued under paragraph (f) of this section.
            (c) Expedited suspension procedures. A suspension under this section will be proposed by a show cause order that names the respondent, is signed by an authorized representative of the Internal Revenue Service under § 10.69(a)(1), and served according to the rules set forth in § 10.63(a). The show cause order must give a plain and concise description of the allegations that constitute the basis for the proposed suspension. The show cause order must notify the respondent—
            (1) Of the place and due date for filing a response;
            (2) That an expedited suspension decision by default may be rendered if the respondent fails to file a response as required;
            (3) That the respondent may request a conference to address the merits of the show cause order and that any such request must be made in the response; and
            (4) That the respondent may be suspended either immediately following the expiration of the period within which a response must be filed or, if a conference is requested, immediately following the conference.
            (d) Response. The response to the show cause order described in this section must be filed no later than 30 calendar days following the date the show cause order is served, unless the time for filing is extended. The response must be filed in accordance with the rules set forth for answers to a complaint in § 10.64, except as otherwise provided in this section. The response must include a request for a conference, if a conference is desired. The respondent is entitled to the conference only if the request is made in a timely filed response.
            (e) Conference. An authorized representative of the Internal Revenue Service will preside at a conference described in this section. The conference will be held at a place and time selected by the Internal Revenue Service, but no sooner than 14 calendar days after the date by which the response must be filed with the Internal Revenue Service, unless the respondent agrees to an earlier date. An authorized representative may represent the respondent at the conference.
            (f) Suspension—(1) In general. The Commissioner, or delegate, may suspend the respondent from practice before the Internal Revenue Service by a written notice of expedited suspension immediately following:
            (i) The expiration of the period within which a response to a show cause order must be filed if the respondent does not file a response as required by paragraph (d) of this section;
            (ii) The conference described in paragraph (e) of this section if the Internal Revenue Service finds that the respondent is described in paragraph (b) of this section; or
            (iii) The respondent's failure to appear, either personally or through an authorized representative, at a conference scheduled by the Internal Revenue Service under paragraph (e) of this section.
            (2) Duration of suspension. A suspension under this section will commence on the date that the written notice of expedited suspension is served on the practitioner, either personally or through an authorized representative. The suspension will remain effective until the earlier of:
            (i) The date the Internal Revenue Service lifts the suspension after determining that the practitioner is no longer described in paragraph (b) of this section or for any other reason; or
            (ii) The date the suspension is lifted or otherwise modified by an Administrative Law Judge or the Secretary of the Treasury, or delegate deciding appeals, in a proceeding referred to in paragraph (g) of this section and instituted under § 10.60.
            (g) Practitioner demand for § 10.60 proceeding. If the Internal Revenue Service suspends a practitioner under the expedited suspension procedures described in this section, the practitioner may demand that the Internal Revenue Service institute a proceeding under § 10.60 and issue the complaint described in § 10.62. The demand must be in writing, specifically reference the suspension action under § 10.82, and be made within 2 years from the date on which the practitioner's suspension commenced. The Internal Revenue Service must issue a complaint demanded under this paragraph (g) within 60 calendar days of receiving the demand. If the Internal Revenue Service does not issue such complaint within 60 days of receiving the demand, the suspension is lifted automatically. The preceding sentence does not, however, preclude the Commissioner, or delegate, from instituting a regular proceeding under § 10.60 of this part.
            (h) Effective/applicability date. This section is generally applicable beginning June 12, 2014, except that paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section are applicable beginning August 2, 2011.

          Policy.

          Blind vendors licensed by State licensing agencies designated by the Secretary of Education under the provisions of the Randolph-Sheppard Act (20 U.S.C. 107 et seq.) shall be given priority in the location and operation of vending facilities, including vending machines, on property controlled by the Department of the Treasury, provided the location or operation of such facility would not adversely affect the interests of the United States. Treasury bureaus shall ensure that the collection and distribution of vending machine income from vending machines on Treasury-controlled property shall be in compliance with the regulations set forth in 34 CFR 395.32. Blind vendors shall also be given priority on Treasury-controlled property in the operation of cafeterias according to 34 CFR 395.33.
        
        
          § 11.3
          Definitions.
          Terms used are defined in 34 CFR 395.1, except that as used in this part, the following terms shall have the following meanings:
          (a) Department of the Treasury controlled property means any Federal building, land, or other real property owned, leased, or occupied by a bureau or office of the Department of the Treasury, of which the maintenance, operation, and protection is under the control of the Department of the Treasury.
          (b) The term bureau means any bureau or office of the Department of the Treasury and such comparable administrative units as may hereafter be created or made a part of the Department, and includes the Departmental Offices and the Office of Inspector General. The “head of the bureau” for the Departmental Offices is the Deputy Assistant Secretary (Administration).
        
        
          § 11.4
          Establishing vending facilities.

          (a) Treasury bureaus shall not acquire a building by ownership, rent, or lease, or occupy a building to be constructed, substantially altered, or renovated unless it is determined that such buildings contain or will contain a “satisfactory site,” as defined in 34 CFR 395.1(q), for the location and operation of a blind vending facility.
          
          (b) In accordance with 34 CFR 395.31, Treasury bureaus shall provide the appropriate State licensing agency with written notice of the intention to acquire or otherwise occupy such building. Providing notification shall be the responsibility of the bureau on-site property management official.
        
        
          § 11.5

          § 13.3
          Eligibility to receive protection or reimbursement.
          (a) Protection, as determined by the Assistant Secretary, will be provided by the United States Secret Service Uniformed Division, pursuant to section 202 of Title 3, U.S. Code, as amended by Pub. L. 94-196, only to foreign diplomatic missions located in metropolitan areas (other than the District of Columbia) where there are located twenty or more such missions, as determined by the Secretary of State, which are headed by full time officers. According to present State Department figures, the following metropolitan areas have 20 or more such foreign diplomatic missions: Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York City, New Orleans and San Francisco. The protection provided by State or local governments rather than the United States Secret Service Uniformed Division will be reimbursed pursuant to section 208(a) of Title 3, U.S. Code and §§ 13.6, 13.7 and 13.8 of this part.
          (b) Protection or reimbursement will be provided for the metropolitan areas described in paragraph (a) of this section only if:

          (2) The Assistant Secretary determines that an extraordinary protective need exists; and

          (d) Where an extraordinary protective need exists, protection (or reimbursement) may be extended to missions as described in §§ 13.3(b)(3) (i) and (ii) whether or not associated with a visit by a foreign dignitary.

          § 13.4
          Requests for protection and advance notices of reimbursement requests.
          (a) In cases where they believe that an extraordinary protective need exists, the State or local governments may request that protection be provided by the United States Secret Service Uniformed Division; or they may give advance notice of their intention to provide, on a reimbursable basis, all or part of the protection themselves.
          (1) Requests for protection or advance notices of reimbursement requests shall be made to: Assistant Secretary (Enforcement and Operations), Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC 20220. Each government requesting the protection authorized pursuant to section 202 of Title 3, U.S. Code, as amended by Pub. L. 94-196, or which intends to seek reimbursement pursuant to section 208(a) of Title 3, U.S. Code and §§ 13.6 and 13.7 of this part, shall submit an application describing the extraordinary protective need. Applications made pursuant to this section shall be submitted to the Assistant Secretary 14 days before the extraordinary protective need arises. In association with a visit, the application shall include the name and title of the visiting foreign official or dignitary, the country he represents, and the name and location of the international organization or mission he will be visting. The application shall also include, if available, the temporary domicile of the visiting official or dignitary and his schedule, including dates and times of arrival and departure from the United States. If the extraordinary protective need occurs at a permanent mission to an international organization of which the United States is a member or an observer mission invited to participate in the work of such organization, or if another foreign diplomatic mission of the country qualifies under § 13.3 (b) or (d), the application shall include the name and location of the mission.
          (b) State and local governments shall also indicate on the application whether they are requesting the use of the United States Secret Service Uniformed Division or whether they are giving advance notice of their intention to provide, on a reimbursable basis, all or part of the protection themselves. In order to assist the Assistant Secretary in determining whether to utilize the United States Secret Service Uniformed Division to meet all or part of the extraordinary protective need, or to utilize, with their consent, the services, personnel, equipment, and facilities of the State or local government, or both, the application must include an estimate of the approximate number of personnel by grade and rank, the services, equipment, and facilities required, along with an estimate of the cost of such personnel, services, equipment and facilities. This application must be submitted in a format consistent with that illustrated in aappendix I of this part.
          (1) Upon receipt of a request for protection pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section and for the purposes of reimbursement pursuant to §§ 13.6 and 13.7, the Assistant Secretary will determine whether an extraordinary protective need exists and whether the United States Secret Service Uniformed Division will be used for all, part or none of the protection. In making determinations, the Assistant Secretary may consult with appropriate Federal, State and local government agencies.

          § 13.5
          Utilization of the services, personnel, equipment, and facilities of State and local governments.
          The Assistant Secretary may decide to utilize, on a reimbursable basis, the services, personnel, equipment, and facilities of State and local governments of the affected metropolitan area desiring to provide protection, or he may utilize the United States Secret Service Uniformed Division, or both. If the United States Secret Service Uniformed Division is utilized to meet all the extraordinary protective need, the governments of the affected metropolitan area will not be reimbursed. If the United States Secret Service Uniformed Division is utilized to meet part of the extraordinary protective needs, the governments of the affected metropolitan area will be reimbursed for that qualifying portion of the protection which is provided by State and local police authorities. If the Assistant Secretary decides to utilize, with their consent, the services, personnel, equipment, and facilities of such State and local governments to meet the extraordinary protective need, he will so notify the government as soon as possible after receipt of a request for protection or an advance notice of a reimbursement request made pursuant to § 13.4.

          § 13.6
          Reimbursement of State and local governments.
          (a) State and local governments providing services, personnel, equipment, or facilities to the affected metropolitan area pursuant to § 13.5 may forward to the Assistant Secretary a bill for reimbursement for the personnel, equipment, facilities, and services utilized in meeting the extraordinary protective need. The bill shall be in accordance with the format in appendix II of this part. The Assistant Secretary will reimburse only those costs directly related to the extraordinary protective need including personnel and equipment costs resulting from assignments made to assist in providing security at an otherwise qualified location in connection with the arrival, departure, or during the visit of a foreign dignitary. Reimbursable costs will also include the costs for establishing both fixed posts at a qualified location and protective perimeters outside of a qualified location when it is clearly established to the satisfaction of the Assistant Secretary that such assignments were necessary to assure the safety of the qualified location. Overhead and administrative costs associated with an extraordinary protective need are reimbursable as either a flat 18 percent of the total extraordinary protective need costs, or, if such costs can be clearly segregated from routine police costs, on a dollar-for-dollar basis. The jurisdiction seeking such reimbursement may select either method but may not use both. For the purposes of reimbursement the Assistant Secretary will, in all cases, determine when the extraordinary protective need began and terminated.

          § 13.7
          Reimbursement when the Assistant Secretary makes no determination to utilize State and local government services, personnel, equipment and facilities.
          (a) Where events require the State or local governments of the affected metropolitan area to provide protection to meet an extraordinary protective need otherwise qualifying for reimbursement, such reimbursement may be made even if the provisions of §§ 13.4 and 13.5 have not been complied with fully. In such circumstances the provisions of § 13.6 shall apply.
          (b) In cases where State or local governments, or both, utilized their own services, personnel, equipment, and facilities to provide protection for an extraordinary protective need, and no request for protective assistance pursuant to § 13.4 was made because the extraordinary protective need occurred prior to the promulgation of this part but after July 1, 1974, an application by such government to the Assistant Secretary for reimbursement otherwise conforming to the requirements of this part will be considered.

          (b) Requests for payments under this section shall conform to the procedures established elsewhere in this part governing reimbursements arising out of an extraordinary protective need.

            Interpretative standards.
            A determination that a former officer or employee of the Department violated 18 U.S.C. 207 (a), (b) or (c) will be made in conformance with the standards established in the interpretative regulations promulgated by the Office of Government Ethics and published at 5 CFR part 737.

            Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 207(j), if the General Counsel finds, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that a former officer or employee of the Department violated 18 U.S.C. 207 (a), (b) or (c), the General Counsel in his/her discretion may prohibit that person from engaging in practice before the Department or a separate statutory agency thereof for a period not to exceed five years, or may take other appropriate disciplinary action.
          
          
            § 15.737-8

            § 15.737-9
            Receipt of information concerning former Treasury employee.
            If an officer or employee of the Department has reason to believe that a former officer or employee of the Department has violated 18 U.S.C. 207 (a), (b) or (c), or if any such officer or employee receives information to that effect, he/she shall promptly make a written report thereof, which report or a copy thereof shall be forwarded to the Inspector General, Department of the Treasury. If any other person has information of such violations, he/she may make a report thereof to the Inspector General or to any officer or employee of the Department. The Inspector General shall refer any information he/she deems warranted to the Director.
          
          
            § 15.737-10
            Conferences.
            (a) In general. The Director may confer with a former officer or employee concerning allegations of misconduct irrespective of whether an administrative disciplinary proceeding has been instituted against him/her. If such conference results in a stipulation in connection with a proceeding in which such person is the respondent, the stipulation may be entered in the record at the instance of either party to the proceeding.
            (b) Voluntary suspension. A former officer or employee, in order to avoid the institution or conclusion of a proceeding, may offer his/her consent to suspension from practice before the Department or a separate statutory agency thereof. The Director in his/her discretion, may suspend a former officer or employee in accordance with the consent offered.
          
          
            § 15.737-11
            Institution of proceeding.
            (a) Whenever the Director has reason to believe that any former officer or employee of the Department has violated 18 U.S.C. 207 (a), (b) or (c), he/she may reprimand such person or institute an administrative disciplinary proceeding for that person's suspension from practice before the Department or a separate statutory agency thereof. The proceeding shall be instituted by a complaint which names the respondent and is signed by the Director and filed in his/her office. Except in cases of willfulness, or where time, the nature of the proceeding, or the public interest does not permit, a proceeding will not be instituted under this section until facts or conduct which may warrant such action have been called to the attention of the proposed respondent in writing and he/she has been accorded the opportunity to provide his/her position on the matter.
            (b) The Director shall coordinate proceedings under this part with the Department of Justice in cases where it initiates criminal prosecution.
          
          
            § 15.737-12
            Contents of complaint.
            (a) Charges. A complaint shall give a plain and concise description of the allegations which constitute the basis for the proceeding. A complaint shall be deemed sufficient if it fairly informs the respondent of the charges against him/her so that the respondent is able to prepare a defense.
            (b) Demand for answer. In the complaint, or in a separate paper attached to the complaint, notification shall be given of the place and time within which the respondent shall file his/her answer, which time shall not be less than 15 days from the date of service of the complaint, and notice shall be given that a decision by default may be rendered against the respondent in the event he/she fails to file an answer as required.
          
          
            § 15.737-13
            Service of complaint and other papers.
            (a) Complaint. The complaint or a copy thereof may be served upon the respondent by certified mail, or first-class mail as hereinafter provided; by delivering it to the respondent or his/her attorney or agent of record either in person or by leaving it at the office or place of business of the respondent, attorney or agent; or in any other manner which has been agreed to by the respondent. Where the service is by certified mail, the return post office receipt duly signed by or on behalf of the respondent shall be proof of service. If the certified mail is not claimed or accepted by the respondent and is returned undelivered, complete service may be made upon the respondent by mailing the complaint to him/her by first-class mail, addressed to him/her at the last address known to the Director. If service is made upon the respondent or his/her attorney or agent of record in person or by leaving the complaint at the office or place of business of the respondent, attorney or agent, the verified return by the person making service, setting forth the manner of service, shall be proof of such service.
            (b) Service of papers other than complaint. Any paper other than the complaint may be served upon a respondent as provided in paragraph (a) of this section or by mailing the paper by first-class mail to the respondent at the last address known to the Director, or by mailing the paper by first-class mail to the respondent's attorney or agent of record. Such mailing shall constitute complete service. Notices may be served upon the respondent or his/her attorney or agent of record by telegraph.
            (c) Filing of papers. Whenever the filing of a paper is required or permitted in connection with a proceeding, and the place of filing is not specified by this subpart or by rule or order of the Administrative Law Judge, the paper shall be filed with the Director of Practice, Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC 20220. All papers shall be filed in duplicate.
          
          
            § 15.737-14
            Answer.
            (a) Filing. The respondent's answer shall be filed in writing within the time specified in the complaint, unless on application the time is extended by the Director or the Administrative Law Judge. The answer shall be filed in duplicate with the Director.
            (b) Contents. The answer shall contain a statement of facts which constitute the grounds of defense, and it shall specifically admit or deny each allegation set forth in the complaint, except that the respondent shall not deny a material allegation in the complaint which he/she knows to be true, or state that he/she is without sufficient information to form a belief when in fact he/she possesses such information. The respondent may also state affirmatively special matters of defense.
            (c) Failure to deny or answer allegations in the complaint. Every allegation in the complaint which is not denied in the answer shall be deemed to be admitted and may be considered as proved, and no further evidence in respect of such allegation need be adduced at a hearing. Failure to file an answer within the time prescribed in the notice to the respondent, except as the time for answer is extended by the Director or the Administrative Law Judge, shall constitute an admission of the allegations of the complaint and a waiver of hearing, and the Administrative Law Judge may make his/her decision by default without a hearing or further procedure.
          
          
            § 15.737-15
            Reply to answer.
            No reply to the respondent's answer shall be required, and new matter in the answer shall be deemed to be denied, but the Director may file a reply in his/her discretion or at the request of the Administrative Law Judge.
          
          
            § 15.737-16
            Proof; variance; amendment of pleadings.

            In the case of a variance between the allegations in a pleading and the evidence adduced in support of the pleading, the Administrative Law Judge may order or authorize amendment of the pleading to conform to the evidence: Provided, That the party who would otherwise be prejudiced by the amendment is given reasonable opportunity to meet the allegations of the pleading as amended; and the Administrative Law Judge shall make findings on any issue presented by the pleadings as so amended.
          
          
            § 15.737-17
            Motions and requests.

A request for an open hearing must be included in the answer to be considered.
            (c) Failure to appear. If either party to the proceeding fails to appear at the hearing, after due notice thereof has been sent to him/her, he/she shall be deemed to have waived the right to a hearing and the Administrative Law Judge may make a decision against the absent party by default.
          
          
            § 15.737-21
            Evidence.
            (a) In general.

Copies of such written interrogatories shall be served upon the other party with the notice, and copies of any written cross-interrogation shall be mailed or delivered to the opposing party at least 5 days before the date of taking the depositions, unless the parties mutually agree otherwise. A party upon whose behalf a deposition is taken must file it with the Administrative Law Judge and serve one copy upon the opposing party.

            In cases where the hearing is stenographically reported by a Government contract reporter, copies of the transcript may be obtained from the reporter at rates not to exceed the maximum rates fixed by contract between the Government and the reporter or from the Department at actual cost of duplication.

            § 15.737-25
            Decision of the Administrative Law Judge.
            As soon as practicable after the conclusion of a hearing and the receipt of any proposed findings and conclusions timely submitted by the parties, the Administrative Law Judge shall make the initial decision in the case. The decision shall include (a) a statement of findings and conclusions, as well as the reasons or basis therefor, upon all the material issues of fact, law, or discretion presented on the record, and (b) an order of suspension from practice before the Department or separate statutory agency thereof or other appropriate disciplinary action, or an order of dismissal of the complaint. The Administrative Law Judge shall file the decision with the Director and shall transmit a copy thereof to the respondent or his/her attorney of record. In the absence of an appeal to the General Counsel or review of the decision upon motion of the General Counsel, the decision of the Administrative Law Judge shall without further proceedings become the decision of the General Counsel 30 days from the date of the Administrative Law Judge's decision.
          
          
            § 15.737-26
            Appeal to the General Counsel.

            Within 30 days from the date of the Administrative Law Judge's decision, either party may appeal to the General Counsel. The appeal shall be filed with the Director in duplicate and shall include exceptions to the decision of the Administrative Law Judge and supporting reasons for such exceptions. If an appeal is filed by the Director, he/she shall transmit a copy thereof to the respondent. Within 30 days after receipt of an appeal or copy thereof, the other party may file a reply brief in duplicate with the Director. If the reply brief is filed by the Director, he/she shall transmit a copy of it to the respondent. Upon the filing of an appeal and a reply brief, if any, the Director shall transmit the entire record to the General Counsel.

            Decision of the General Counsel.
            On appeal from or review of the initial decision of the Administrative Law Judge, the General Counsel will make the agency decision. In making his/her decision, the General Counsel will review the record or such portions thereof as may be cited by the parties to permit limiting of the issues. A copy of the General Counsel's decision shall be transmitted to the respondent by the Director.
          
          
            § 15.737-28
            Notice of disciplinary action.
            (a) Upon the issuance of a final order suspending a former officer or employee from practice before the Department or a separate statutory agency thereof, the Director shall give notice thereof to appropriate officers and employees of the Department. Officers and employees of the Department shall refuse to participate in any appearance by such former officer or employee or to accept any communication which constitutes the prohibited practice before the Department or separate statutory agency thereof during the period of suspension.
            (b) The Director shall take other appropriate disciplinary action as may be required by the final order.

          (b) When the period of time allowed is less than seven days, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays observed by the Federal Government shall be excluded from the computation.

          § 16.28
          Motions.
          (a) Any application to the ALJ for an order or ruling shall be by motion. Motions shall state the relief sought, the authority relied upon, and the facts alleged, and shall be filed with the ALJ and served on all other parties.
          (b) Except for motions made during a prehearing conference or at the hearing, all motions shall be in writing. The ALJ may require that oral motions be reduced to writing.
          (c) Within 15 days after a written motion is served, or such other time as may be fixed by the ALJ, any party may file a response to such motion.
          (d) The ALJ may not grant a written motion before the time for filing responses thereto has expired, except upon consent of the parties or following a hearing on the motion, but may overrule or deny such motion without awaiting a response.
          (e) The ALJ shall make a reasonable effort to dispose of all outstanding motions prior to the beginning of the hearing.
        
        
          § 16.29
          Sanctions.
          (a) The ALJ may sanction a person, including any party or representative for—
          (1) Failing to comply with an order, rule, or procedure governing the proceeding;
          (2) Failing to prosecute or defend an action; or
          (3) Engaging in other misconduct that interferes with the speedy, orderly, or fair conduct of the hearing.
          (b) Any such sanction, including but not limited to those listed in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section, shall reasonably relate to the nature of the failure or misconduct.
          (c) When a party fails to comply with an order, including an order for taking a deposition, the production of evidence within the party's control, or a request for admission, the ALJ may—
          (1) Draw an inference in favor of the requesting party with regard to the information sought;
          (2) In the case of requests for admission, deem each matter of which an admission is requested to be admitted;

          (3) Prohibit the party failing to comply with such order from introducing evidence concerning, or otherwise relying upon testimony relating to the information sought; and
          (4) Strike any part of the pleadings or other submissions of the party failing to comply with such request.
          (d) If a party fails to prosecute or defend an action under this part commenced by service of a notice of hearing, the ALJ may dismiss the action or may issue an initial decision imposing penalties and assessments.
          (e) The ALJ may refuse to consider any motion, request, response, brief or other document which is not filed in a timely fashion.
        
        
          § 16.30
          The hearing and burden of proof.
          (a) The ALJ shall conduct a hearing on the record in order to determine whether the defendant is liable for a civil penalty or assessment under § 16.3 and, if so, the appropriate amount of any such civil penalty or assessment considering any aggravating or mitigating factors.
          (b) The authority shall have the burden of proving defendant's liability and any aggravating factors by a preponderance of the evidence.
          (c) The defendant shall have the burden of proving any affirmative defenses and any mitigating factors by a preponderance of the evidence.
          (d) The hearing shall be open to the public unless otherwise ordered by the ALJ for good cause shown.
        
        
          § 16.31
          Determining the amount of penalties and assessments.
          (a) In determining an appropriate amount of civil penalties and assessements, the ALJ and upon appeal, the authority head, should evaluate any circumstances that mitigate or aggravate the violation and should articulate in their opinions the reasons that support the penalties and assessments they impose. Because of the intangible costs of fraud, the expense of investigating such conduct, and the need to deter others who might be similarly tempted, double damages and a significant civil penalty ordinarily should be imposed.

          (b) Although not exhaustive, the following factors are among those that may influence the ALJ and the authority head in determining the amount of penalties and assessments to impose with respect to the misconduct (i.e., the false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims or statements) charged in the complaint:
          (1) The number of false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims or statements;
          (2) The time period over which such claims or statements were made;
          (3) The degree of the defendant's culpability with respect to the misconduct;
          (4) The amount of money or the value of the property, services, or benefit falsely claimed;
          (5) The value of the Government's actual loss as a result of the misconduct, including foreseeable consequential damages and the costs of investigation;
          (6) The relationship of the amount imposed as civil penalties to the amount of the Government's loss;
          (7) The potential or actual impact of the misconduct upon national defense, public health or safety, or public confidence in the management of Government programs and operations;
          (8) Whether the defendant has engaged in a pattern of the same or similar misconduct;
          (9) Whether the defendant attempted to conceal the misconduct;
          (10) The degree to which the defendant has involved others in the misconduct or in concealing it;
          (11) Where the misconduct of employees or agents is imputed to the defendant, the extent to which the defendant's practices fostered or attempted to preclude such misconduct;
          (12) Whether the defendant cooperated in or obstructed an investigation of the misconduct;
          (13) Whether the defendant assisted in identifying and prosecuting other wrongdoers;
          (14) The complexity of the program or transaction, and the degree of the defendant's sophistication with respect to it, including the extent of the defendant's prior participation in the program or in similar transactions;

          (15) Whether the defendant has been found, in any criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding to have engaged in similar misconduct or to have dealt dishonestly with the Government of the United States or of a State, directly or indirectly; and
          (16) The need to deter the defendant and others from engaging in the same or similar misconduct.
          (c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the ALJ or the authority head from considering any other factors that in any given case may mitigate or aggravate the offense for which penalties and assessments are imposed.
        
        
          § 16.32
          Location of hearing.
          (a) The hearing may be held—
          (1) In any judicial district of the United States in which the defendant resides or transacts business;
          (2) In any judicial district of the United States in which the claim or statement in issue was made; or
          (3) In such other place as may be agreed upon by the defendant and the ALJ.
          (b) Each party shall have the opportunity to present argument with respect to the location of the hearing.
          (c) The hearing shall be held at the place and at the time ordered by the ALJ.
        
        
          § 16.33
          Witnesses.
          (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, testimony at the hearing shall be given orally by witnesses under oath or affirmation.
          (b) At the discretion of the ALJ, testimony may be admitted in the form of a written statement or deposition. Any such written statement must be provided to all other parties along with the last known address of such witness, in a manner which allows sufficient time for other parties to subpoena such witness for cross-examination at the hearing. Prior written statements of witnesses proposed to testify at the hearing and deposition transcripts shall be exchanged as provided in § 16.22(a).
          (c) The ALJ shall exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to—
          (1) Make the interrogation and presentation effective for the ascertainment of the truth,
          (2) Avoid needless consumption of time, and
          (3) Protect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment.
          (d) The ALJ shall permit the parties to conduct such cross examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts.
          (e) At the discretion of the ALJ, a witness may be cross-examined on matters relevant to the proceeding without regard to the scope of his or her direct examination. To the extent permited by the ALJ, cross-examination on matters outside the scope of direct examination shall be conducted in the manner of direct examination and may proceed by leading questions only if the witness is a hostile witness, an adverse party, or a witness identified with an adverse party.
          (f) Upon motion of any party, the ALJ shall order witnesses excluded so that they cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses. This rule does not authorize exclusion of—
          (1) A party who is an individual;
          (2) In the case of a party that is not an individual, an officer or employee of the party designated by the party's representative; or
          (3) An individual whose presence is shown by a party to be essential to the presentation of its case, including an individual employed by the Government engaged in assisting the representative for the Government.
        
        
          § 16.34
          Evidence.
          (a) The ALJ shall determine the admissibility of evidence.
          (b) Except as provided herein, the ALJ shall not be bound by the Federal Rules of Evidence. However, the ALJ may apply the Federal Rules of Evidence where appropriate, e.g., to exclude unreliable evidence.
          (c) The ALJ shall exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or incompetent evidence.
          (d) Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or by considerations of undue delay or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.

          (e) Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if it is privileged under Federal law.
          
          (f) Evidence concerning offers of compromise or settlement shall be inadmissible to the extent provided in Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.
          (g) The ALJ shall permit the parties to introduce rebuttal witnesses and evidence.
          (h) All documents and other evidence offered or taken for the record shall be open to examination by all parties, unless otherwise ordered by the ALJ pursuant to § 16.24.
        
        
          § 16.35
          The record.
          (a) The hearing will be recorded and transcribed. Transcripts may be obtained following the hearing from the ALJ at a cost not to exceed the actual cost of duplication.
          (b) The transcript of testimony, exhibits and other evidence admitted at the hearing, and all papers and requests filed in the proceeding constitute the record for the decision by the ALJ and the authority head.
          (c) The record may be inspected and copied (upon payment of a reasonable fee) by anyone, unless otherwise ordered by the ALJ pursuant to § 16.24.
        
        
          § 16.36
          Post-hearing briefs.

          (1) Whether the claims or statements identified in the complaint, or any portions thereof, violate § 16.3;
          (2) If the person is liable for penalties of assessments, the appropriate amount of any such penalties or assessments considering any mitigating or aggravating factors that he or she finds in the case, such as those described in § 16.31.
          (c) The ALJ shall promptly serve the initial decision on all parties within 90 days after the time for submission of post-hearing briefs and reply briefs (if permitted) has expired. The ALJ shall at the same time serve all defendants with a statement describing the right of any defendant determined to be liable for a civil penalty or assessment to file a motion for reconsideration with the ALJ or a notice of appeal with the authority head. If the ALJ fails to meet the deadline contained in this paragraph, he or she shall notify the parties of the reason for the delay and shall set a new deadline.
          (d) Unless the initial decision of the ALJ is timely appealed to the authority head, or a motion for reconsideration of the initial decision is timely filed, the initial decision shall constitute the final decision of the authority head and shall be final and binding on the parties 30 days after it is issued by the ALJ.
        
        
          § 16.38
          Reconsideration of initial decision.
          (a) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, any party may file a motion for reconsideration of the initial decision within 20 days of receipt of the initial decision. If service was made by mail, receipt will be presumed to be five days from the date of mailing in the absence of contrary proof.

          (f) When a motion for reconsideration is made, the time periods for appeal to the authority head contained in § 16.38, and for finality of the initial decision in § 16.36(d), shall begin on the date the ALJ issues the denial of the motion for reconsideration or a revised initial decision, as appropriate.
        
        
          § 16.39
          Appeal to authority head.
          (a) Any defendant who has filed a timely answer and who is determined in an initial decision to be liable for a civil penalty or assessment may appeal such decision to the authority head by filing a notice of appeal with the authority head in accordance with this section.
          (b)(1) No notice of appeal may be filed until the time period for filing a motion for reconsideration under § 16.38 has expired.

          (h) In reviewing the initial decision, the authority head shall not consider any objection that was not raised before the ALJ unless a demonstration is made of extraordinary circumstances causing the failure to raise the objection.
          (i) If any party demonstrates to the satisfaction of the authority head, prior to the issuance of the authority head's decision that additional evidence not presented at such hearing is material and that there were reasonable grounds for the failure to present such evidence at the hearing, the authority head shall remand the matter to the ALJ for consideration of such additional evidence.
          (j) The authority head may affirm, reduce, reverse, compromise, remand, or settle any penalty or assessment, determined by the ALJ in any initial decision.
          (k) The authority head shall promptly serve each party to the appeal to the ALJ with a copy of the decision of the authority head. At the same time the authority head shall serve the defendant with a statement describing the defendant's right to seek judicial review.
          (l) Unless a petition for judicial review is filed as provided in 31 U.S.C. 3805 after a defendant has exhausted all administrative remedies under this part and within 60 days after the date on which the authority head serves the defendant with a copy of the authority head's decision, a determination that a defendant is liable under § 16.3 is final and is not subject to judicial review.
        
        
          § 16.40
          Stays ordered by the Department of Justice.
          If at any time the Attorney General or an Assistant Attorney General designated by the Attorney General transmits to the authority head a written finding that continuation of the administrative process described in this part with respect to a claim or statement may adversely affect any pending or potential criminal or civil action related to such claim or statement, the authority head shall stay the process immediately. In such a case, the authority head may order the process resumed only upon receipt of the written authorization of the Attorney General.

          § 17.101
          Purpose.
          The purpose of this part is to effectuate section 119 of the Rehabilitation, Comprehensive Services, and Developmental Disabilities Amendments of 1978, which amended section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (“section 504”) to prohibit discrimination on the basis of handicap in programs or activities conducted by Executive agencies or the United States Postal Service.
        
        
          § 17.102
          Application.

          (a) No qualified individual with handicaps in the United States, shall, by reason of his or her handicap, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.

          (i) Deny a qualified individual with handicaps the opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service;
          (ii) Afford a qualified individual with handicaps an opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service that is not equal to that afforded others;

          (iii) Provide a qualified individual with handicaps with an aid, benefit, or service that is not as effective in affording equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement as that provided to others;
          
          (iv) Provide different or separate aid, benefits or services to individuals with handicaps or to any class of individuals with handicaps than is provided to others unless such action is necessary to provide qualified individuals with handicaps with aid, benefits or services that are as effective as those provided to others;

          (vi) Otherwise limit a qualified individual with handicaps in the enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity enjoyed by others receiving the aid, benefit, or service.
          (2) For purposes of this part, aids, benefits, and services, to be equally effective, are not required to produce the identical result or level of achievement for individuals with handicaps and for nonhandicapped persons, but must afford individuals with handicaps equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement in the most integrated setting appropriate to the individual's needs.
          (3) Even if the agency is permitted, under paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section, to operate a separate or different program for individuals with handicaps or for any class of individuals with handicaps, the agency must permit any qualified individual with handicaps who wishes to participate in the program that is not separate or different to do so.

          (i) Subject qualified individuals with handicaps to discrimination on the basis of handicap; or
          (ii) Defeat or substantially impair accomplishment of the objectives of a program or activity with respect to individuals with handicaps.
          (5) The agency may not, in determining the site or location of a facility, make selections the purpose or effect of which would—

          (ii) Defeat or substantially impair the accomplishment of the objectives of a program or activity with respect to individuals with handicaps.

However, the programs or activities of entities that are licensed or certified by the agency are not, themselves, covered by this part.
          (c) The exclusion of nonhandicapped persons from the benefits of a program limited by Federal statute or Executive order to individuals with handicaps or the exclusion of a specific class of individuals with handicaps from a program limited by Federal statute or Executive order to a different class of individuals with handicaps is not prohibited by this part.
          (d) The agency shall administer programs and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with handicaps.

The definitions, requirements and procedures of section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791), as established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR part 1613, shall apply to employment of federally conducted programs or activities.

          Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.
          Except as otherwise provided in § 17.150, no qualified individual with handicaps shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with handicaps, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.
        
        
          § 17.150
          Program accessibility; Existing facilities.
          (a) General. The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph does not require the agency—
          (1) To make structural alterations in each of its existing facilities in order to make them accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section; or
          (2) To take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with the § 17.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.
          (b) Methods. The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.
          (c) Time period for compliance. The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section within sixty (60) days of the effective date of this part except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made within three years of the effective date of this part, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.
          (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop within six months of the effective date of this part, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both telephonic and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall at a minimum—
          
          (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the physical accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals with handicaps;
          (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;
          (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and
          (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.

          Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established in 41 CFR 101-19.600 through 101-19.607 apply to buildings covered by this section.

          (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to effectively communicate with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal entities, and members of the public.
          (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.
          (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the individual with handicaps.
          (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature to applicants or participants in programs.
          (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, the agency shall use telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems to communicate with persons with impaired hearing.
          (b) The agency shall make available to interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.
          (c) The agency shall post notices at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to an accessible facility, or to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.
          (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens.
          In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 17.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maxium extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.

          (2) The agency shall accept and investigate all complete complaints over which it has jurisdiction.
          (3) All complete complaints must be filed within 180 days of the alleged act of discrimination. The agency may extend this time period for good cause.
          (e) If the agency receive a complaint over which it does not have jurisdiction, it shall promptly notify the complainant and shall make reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate government entity.
          (f) The agency shall notify the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a building or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), is not readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps.
          (g)(1) Within 180 days of the receipt of a complete complaint over which it has jurisdiction, the agency shall notify the complainant of the results of the investigation in a letter containing—

          § 19.50
          How is this part written?
          (a) This part uses a “plain language” format to make it easier for the general public and business community to use. The section headings and text, often in the form of questions and answers, must be read together.
          (b) Pronouns used within this part, such as “I” and “you,” change from subpart to subpart depending on the audience being addressed. The pronoun “we” always is the Department of the Treasury.

          § 19.75
          Do terms in this part have special meanings?
          This part uses terms throughout the text that have special meaning. Those terms are defined in subpart I of this part. For example, three important terms are—
          (a) Exclusion or excluded, which refers only to discretionary actions taken by a suspending or debarring official under this part or the Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4);
          (b) Disqualification or disqualified, which refers to prohibitions under specific statutes, executive orders (other than Executive Order 12549 and Executive Order 12689), or other authorities. Disqualifications frequently are not subject to the discretion of an agency official, may have a different scope than exclusions, or have special conditions that apply to the disqualification; and
          (c) Ineligibility or ineligible, which generally refers to a person who is either excluded or disqualified.
        
        
          Subpart A—General
          
            § 19.100
            What does this part do?
            This part adopts a governmentwide system of debarment and suspension for Department of the Treasury nonprocurement activities. It also provides for reciprocal exclusion of persons who have been excluded under the Federal Acquisition Regulation, and provides for the consolidated listing of all persons who are excluded, or disqualified by statute, executive order, or other legal authority. This part satisfies the requirements in section 3 of Executive Order 12549, “Debarment and Suspension” (3 CFR 1986 Comp., p. 189), Executive Order 12689, “Debarment and Suspension” (3 CFR 1989 Comp., p. 235) and 31 U.S.C. 6101 note (Section 2455, Public Law 103-355, 108 Stat. 3327).
          
          
            § 19.105
            Does this part apply to me?

            Portions of this part (see table at § 19.25(b)) apply to you if you are a(n)—
            
            (a) Person who has been, is, or may reasonably be expected to be, a participant or principal in a covered transaction;
            (b) Respondent (a person against whom the Department of the Treasury has initiated a debarment or suspension action);
            (c) Department of the Treasury debarring or suspending official; or
            (d) Department of the Treasury official who is authorized to enter into covered transactions with non-Federal parties.
          
          
            § 19.110
            What is the purpose of the nonprocurement debarment and suspension system?
            (a) To protect the public interest, the Federal Government ensures the integrity of Federal programs by conducting business only with responsible persons.
            (b) A Federal agency uses the nonprocurement debarment and suspension system to exclude from Federal programs persons who are not presently responsible.
            (c) An exclusion is a serious action that a Federal agency may take only to protect the public interest. A Federal agency may not exclude a person or commodity for the purposes of punishment.
          
          
            § 19.115
            How does an exclusion restrict a person's involvement in covered transactions?
            With the exceptions stated in §§ 19.120, 19.315, and 19.420, a person who is excluded by the Department of the Treasury or any other Federal agency may not:
            (a) Be a participant in a(n) Department of the Treasury transaction that is a covered transaction under subpart B of this part;
            (b) Be a participant in a transaction of any other Federal agency that is a covered transaction under that agency's regulation for debarment and suspension; or
            (c) Act as a principal of a person participating in one of those covered transactions.
          
          
            § 19.120
            May we grant an exception to let an excluded person participate in a covered transaction?
            (a) The Secretary of the Treasury may grant an exception permitting an excluded person to participate in a particular covered transaction. If the Secretary of the Treasury grants an exception, the exception must be in writing and state the reason(s) for deviating from the governmentwide policy in Executive Order 12549.
            (b) An exception granted by one agency for an excluded person does not extend to the covered transactions of another agency.
          
          
            § 19.125
            Does an exclusion under the nonprocurement system affect a person's eligibility for Federal procurement contracts?
            If any Federal agency excludes a person under its nonprocurement common rule on or after August 25, 1995, the excluded person is also ineligible to participate in Federal procurement transactions under the FAR. Therefore, an exclusion under this part has reciprocal effect in Federal procurement transactions.
          
          
            § 19.130
            Does exclusion under the Federal procurement system affect a person's eligibility to participate in nonprocurement transactions?
            If any Federal agency excludes a person under the FAR on or after August 25, 1995, the excluded person is also ineligible to participate in nonprocurement covered transactions under this part. Therefore, an exclusion under the FAR has reciprocal effect in Federal nonprocurement transactions.
          
          
            § 19.135
            May the Department of the Treasury exclude a person who is not currently participating in a nonprocurement transaction?
            Given a cause that justifies an exclusion under this part, we may exclude any person who has been involved, is currently involved, or may reasonably be expected to be involved in a covered transaction.
          
          
            § 19.140
            How do I know if a person is excluded?
            Check the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS) to determine whether a person is excluded. The General Services Administration (GSA) maintains the EPLS and makes it available, as detailed in subpart E of this part. When a Federal agency takes an action to exclude a person under the nonprocurement or procurement debarment and suspension system, the agency enters the information about the excluded person into the EPLS.
            
          
          
            § 19.145
            Does this part address persons who are disqualified, as well as those who are excluded from nonprocurement transactions?
            Except if provided for in Subpart J of this part, this part—
            (a) Addresses disqualified persons only to—
            (1) Provide for their inclusion in the EPLS; and
            (2) State responsibilities of Federal agencies and participants to check for disqualified persons before entering into covered transactions.
            (b) Does not specify the—
            (1) Department of the Treasury transactions for which a disqualified person is ineligible. Those transactions vary on a case-by-case basis, because they depend on the language of the specific statute, Executive order, or regulation that caused the disqualification;
            (2) Entities to which the disqualification applies; or
            (3) Process that the agency uses to disqualify a person. Unlike exclusion, disqualification is frequently not a discretionary action that a Federal agency takes.
          
        
        
          Subpart B—Covered Transactions
          
            § 19.200
            What is a covered transaction?
            A covered transaction is a nonprocurement or procurement transaction that is subject to the prohibitions of this part. It may be a transaction at—
            (a) The primary tier, between a Federal agency and a person (see appendix to this part); or
            (b) A lower tier, between a participant in a covered transaction and another person.
          
          
            § 19.205
            Why is it important if a particular transaction is a covered transaction?
            The importance of a covered transaction depends upon who you are.
            (a) As a participant in the transaction, you have the responsibilities laid out in subpart C of this part. Those include responsibilities to the person or Federal agency at the next higher tier from whom you received the transaction, if any. They also include responsibilities if you subsequently enter into other covered transactions with persons at the next lower tier.
            (b) As a Federal official who enters into a primary tier transaction, you have the responsibilities laid out in subpart D of this part.
            (c) As an excluded person, you may not be a participant or principal in the transaction unless—
            (1) The person who entered into the transaction with you allows you to continue your involvement in a transaction that predates your exclusion, as permitted under § 19.310 or § 19.415; or
            (2) A(n) Department of the Treasury official obtains an exception from the Secretary of the Treasury to allow you to be involved in the transaction, as permitted under § 19.120.
          
          
            § 19.210
            Which nonprocurement transactions are covered transactions?
            All nonprocurement transactions, as defined in § 19.970, are covered transactions unless listed in § 19.215. (See appendix to this part.)
          
          
            § 19.215
            Which nonprocurement transactions are not covered transactions?
            The following types of nonprocurement transactions are not covered transactions:
            (a) A direct award to—
            (1) A foreign government or foreign governmental entity;
            (2) A public international organization;
            (3) An entity owned (in whole or in part) or controlled by a foreign government; or
            (4) Any other entity consisting wholly or partially of one or more foreign governments or foreign governmental entities.

            (b) A benefit to an individual as a personal entitlement without regard to the individual's present responsibility (but benefits received in an individual's business capacity are not excepted). For example, if a person receives social security benefits under the Supplemental Security Income provisions of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1301 et seq., those benefits are not covered transactions and, therefore, are not affected if the person is excluded.
            (c) Federal employment.
            (d) A transaction that the Department of the Treasury needs to respond to a national or agency-recognized emergency or disaster.
            (e) A permit, license, certificate, or similar instrument issued as a means to regulate public health, safety, or the environment, unless the Department of the Treasury specifically designates it to be a covered transaction.
            (f) An incidental benefit that results from ordinary governmental operations.
            (g) Any other transaction if the application of an exclusion to the transaction is prohibited by law.
          
          
            § 19.220
            Are any procurement contracts included as covered transactions?
            (a) Covered transactions under this part—
            (1) Do not include any procurement contracts awarded directly by a Federal agency; but
            (2) Do include some procurement contracts awarded by non-Federal participants in nonprocurement covered transactions (see appendix to this part).
            (b) Specifically, a contract for goods or services is a covered transaction if any of the following applies:
            (1) The contract is awarded by a participant in a nonprocurement transaction that is covered under § 19.210, and the amount of the contract is expected to equal or exceed $25,000.
            (2) The contract requires the consent of a(n) Department of the Treasury official. In that case, the contract, regardless of the amount, always is a covered transaction, and it does not matter who awarded it. For example, it could be a subcontract awarded by a contractor at a tier below a nonprocurement transaction, as shown in the appendix to this part.
            (3) The contract is for federally-required audit services.
          
          
            § 19.225
            How do I know if a transaction in which I may participate is a covered transaction?
            As a participant in a transaction, you will know that it is a covered transaction because the agency regulations governing the transaction, the appropriate agency official, or participant at the next higher tier who enters into the transaction with you, will tell you that you must comply with applicable portions of this part.
          
        
        
          Subpart C—Responsibilities of Participants Regarding Transactions
          
            Doing Business With Other Persons
            
              § 19.300
              What must I do before I enter into a covered transaction with another person at the next lower tier?
              When you enter into a covered transaction with another person at the next lower tier, you must verify that the person with whom you intend to do business is not excluded or disqualified. You do this by:
              (a) Checking the EPLS; or
              (b) Collecting a certification from that person if allowed by this rule; or
              (c) Adding a clause or condition to the covered transaction with that person.
            
            
              § 19.305
              May I enter into a covered transaction with an excluded or disqualified person?
              (a) You as a participant may not enter into a covered transaction with an excluded person, unless the Department of the Treasury grants an exception under § 19.120.
              (b) You may not enter into any transaction with a person who is disqualified from that transaction, unless you have obtained an exception under the disqualifying statute, Executive order, or regulation.
            
            
              § 19.310
              What must I do if a Federal agency excludes a person with whom I am already doing business in a covered transaction?

              (a) You as a participant may continue covered transactions with an excluded person if the transactions were in existence when the agency excluded the person. However, you are not required to continue the transactions, and you may consider termination. You should make a decision about whether to terminate and the type of termination action, if any, only after a thorough review to ensure that the action is proper and appropriate.
              (b) You may not renew or extend covered transactions (other than no-cost time extensions) with any excluded person, unless the Department of the Treasury grants an exception under § 19.120.
            
            
              § 19.315
              May I use the services of an excluded person as a principal under a covered transaction?
              (a) You as a participant may continue to use the services of an excluded person as a principal under a covered transaction if you were using the services of that person in the transaction before the person was excluded. However, you are not required to continue using that person's services as a principal. You should make a decision about whether to discontinue that person's services only after a thorough review to ensure that the action is proper and appropriate.
              (b) You may not begin to use the services of an excluded person as a principal under a covered transaction unless the Department of the Treasury grants an exception under § 19.120.
            
            
              § 19.320
              Must I verify that principals of my covered transactions are eligible to participate?

              Yes, you as a participant are responsible for determining whether any of your principals of your covered transactions is excluded or disqualified from participating in the transaction. You may decide the method and frequency by which you do so. You may, but you are not required to, check the EPLS.
              
            
            
              § 19.325
              What happens if I do business with an excluded person in a covered transaction?
              If as a participant you knowingly do business with an excluded person, we may disallow costs, annul or terminate the transaction, issue a stop work order, debar or suspend you, or take other remedies as appropriate.
            
            
              § 19.330
              What requirements must I pass down to persons at lower tiers with whom I intend to do business?
              Before entering into a covered transaction with a participant at the next lower tier, you must require that participant to—
              (a) Comply with this subpart as a condition of participation in the transaction. You may do so using any method(s), unless § 19.440 requires you to use specific methods.
              (b) Pass the requirement to comply with this subpart to each person with whom the participant enters into a covered transaction at the next lower tier.
            
          
          
            Disclosing Information—Primary Tier Participants
            
              § 19.335
              What information must I provide before entering into a covered transaction with the Department of the Treasury?
              Before you enter into a covered transaction at the primary tier, you as the participant must notify the Department of the Treasury office that is entering into the transaction with you, if you know that you or any of the principals for that covered transaction:
              (a) Are presently excluded or disqualified;
              (b) Have been convicted within the preceding three years of any of the offenses listed in § 19.800(a) or had a civil judgment rendered against you for one of those offenses within that time period;
              (c) Are presently indicted for or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity (Federal, State or local) with commission of any of the offenses listed in § 19.800(a); or
              (d) Have had one or more public transactions (Federal, State, or local) terminated within the preceding three years for cause or default.
            
            
              § 19.340
              If I disclose unfavorable information required under § 19.335, will I be prevented from participating in the transaction?

              As a primary tier participant, your disclosure of unfavorable information about yourself or a principal under § 19.335 will not necessarily cause us to deny your participation in the covered transaction. We will consider the information when we determine whether to enter into the covered transaction. We also will consider any additional information or explanation that you elect to submit with the disclosed information.
            
            
              § 19.345
              What happens if I fail to disclose information required under § 19.335?
              If we later determine that you failed to disclose information under § 19.335 that you knew at the time you entered into the covered transaction, we may—
              (a) Terminate the transaction for material failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the transaction; or
              (b) Pursue any other available remedies, including suspension and debarment.
            
            
              § 19.350
              What must I do if I learn of information required under § 19.335 after entering into a covered transaction with the Department of the Treasury?
              At any time after you enter into a covered transaction, you must give immediate written notice to the Department of the Treasury office with which you entered into the transaction if you learn either that—
              (a) You failed to disclose information earlier, as required by § 19.335; or
              (b) Due to changed circumstances, you or any of the principals for the transaction now meet any of the criteria in § 19.335.
            
          
          
            Disclosing Information—Lower Tier Participants
            
              § 19.355
              What information must I provide to a higher tier participant before entering into a covered transaction with that participant?
              Before you enter into a covered transaction with a person at the next higher tier, you as a lower tier participant must notify that person if you know that you or any of the principals are presently excluded or disqualified.
            
            
              § 19.360
              What happens if I fail to disclose the information required under § 19.355?
              If we later determine that you failed to tell the person at the higher tier that you were excluded or disqualified at the time you entered into the covered transaction with that person, we may pursue any available remedies, including suspension and debarment.
            
            
              § 19.365
              What must I do if I learn of information required under § 19.355 after entering into a covered transaction with a higher tier participant?
              At any time after you enter into a lower tier covered transaction with a person at a higher tier, you must provide immediate written notice to that person if you learn either that—
              (a) You failed to disclose information earlier, as required by § 19.355; or
              (b) Due to changed circumstances, you or any of the principals for the transaction now meet any of the criteria in § 19.355.
            
          
        
        
          Subpart D—Responsibilities of Department of the Treasury Officials Regarding Transactions

            (b) You may not enter into any transaction with a person who is disqualified from that transaction, unless you obtain a waiver or exception under the statute, Executive order, or regulation that is the basis for the person's disqualification.
          
          
            § 19.405
            May I enter into a covered transaction with a participant if a principal of the transaction is excluded?
            As an agency official, you may not enter into a covered transaction with a participant if you know that a principal of the transaction is excluded, unless you obtain an exception under § 19.120.
          
          
            § 19.410
            May I approve a participant's use of the services of an excluded person?

            After entering into a covered transaction with a participant, you as an agency official may not approve a participant's use of an excluded person as a principal under that transaction, unless you obtain an exception under § 19.120.
          
          
            § 19.415
            What must I do if a Federal agency excludes the participant or a principal after I enter into a covered transaction?
            (a) You as an agency official may continue covered transactions with an excluded person, or under which an excluded person is a principal, if the transactions were in existence when the person was excluded. You are not required to continue the transactions, however, and you may consider termination. You should make a decision about whether to terminate and the type of termination action, if any, only after a thorough review to ensure that the action is proper.
            (b) You may not renew or extend covered transactions (other than no-cost time extensions) with any excluded person, or under which an excluded person is a principal, unless you obtain an exception under § 19.120.
          
          
            § 19.420
            May I approve a transaction with an excluded or disqualified person at a lower tier?
            If a transaction at a lower tier is subject to your approval, you as an agency official may not approve—
            (a) A covered transaction with a person who is currently excluded, unless you obtain an exception under § 19.120; or
            (b) A transaction with a person who is disqualified from that transaction, unless you obtain a waiver or exception under the statute, Executive order, or regulation that is the basis for the person's disqualification.
          
          
            § 19.425
            When do I check to see if a person is excluded or disqualified?
            As an agency official, you must check to see if a person is excluded or disqualified before you—
            (a) Enter into a primary tier covered transaction;
            (b) Approve a principal in a primary tier covered transaction;
            (c) Approve a lower tier participant if agency approval of the lower tier participant is required; or
            (d) Approve a principal in connection with a lower tier transaction if agency approval of the principal is required.
          
          
            § 19.430
            How do I check to see if a person is excluded or disqualified?
            You check to see if a person is excluded or disqualified in two ways:
            (a) You as an agency official must check the EPLS when you take any action listed in § 19.425.
            (b) You must review information that a participant gives you, as required by § 19.335, about its status or the status of the principals of a transaction.
          
          
            § 19.435
            What must I require of a primary tier participant?
            You as an agency official must require each participant in a primary tier covered transaction to—
            (a) Comply with subpart C of this part as a condition of participation in the transaction; and
            (b) Communicate the requirement to comply with Subpart C of this part to persons at the next lower tier with whom the primary tier participant enters into covered transactions.
          
          
            § 19.440
            What method do I use to communicate those requirements to participants?
            To communicate the requirements, you must include a term or condition in the transaction requiring the participants' compliance with subpart C of this part and requiring them to include a similar term or condition in lower-tier covered transactions.
            [68 FR 66607, Nov. 26, 2003]
          
          
            § 19.445
            What action may I take if a primary tier participant knowingly does business with an excluded or disqualified person?
            If a participant knowingly does business with an excluded or disqualified person, you as an agency official may refer the matter for suspension and debarment consideration. You may also disallow costs, annul or terminate the transaction, issue a stop work order, or take any other appropriate remedy.
          
          
            § 19.450
            What action may I take if a primary tier participant fails to disclose the information required under § 19.335?

            If you as an agency official determine that a participant failed to disclose information, as required by § 19.335, at the time it entered into a covered transaction with you, you may—
            (a) Terminate the transaction for material failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the transaction; or
            (b) Pursue any other available remedies, including suspension and debarment.
          
          
            § 19.455

            § 19.500
            What is the purpose of the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS)?
            The EPLS is a widely available source of the most current information about persons who are excluded or disqualified from covered transactions.
          
          
            § 19.505
            Who uses the EPLS?
            (a) Federal agency officials use the EPLS to determine whether to enter into a transaction with a person, as required under § 19.430.

            (b) Participants also may, but are not required to, use the EPLS to determine if—
            (1) Principals of their transactions are excluded or disqualified, as required under § 19.320; or
            (2) Persons with whom they are entering into covered transactions at the next lower tier are excluded or disqualified.
            (c) The EPLS is available to the general public.
          
          
            § 19.510
            Who maintains the EPLS?

            In accordance with the OMB guidelines, the General Services Administration (GSA) maintains the EPLS. When a Federal agency takes an action to exclude a person under the nonprocurement or procurement debarment and suspension system, the agency enters the information about the excluded person into the EPLS.
            
          
          
            § 19.515
            What specific information is in the EPLS?
            (a) At a minimum, the EPLS indicates—
            (1) The full name (where available) and address of each excluded or disqualified person, in alphabetical order, with cross references if more than one name is involved in a single action;
            (2) The type of action;
            (3) The cause for the action;
            (4) The scope of the action;
            (5) Any termination date for the action;
            (6) The agency and name and telephone number of the agency point of contact for the action; and
            (7) The Dun and Bradstreet Number (DUNS), or other similar code approved by the GSA, of the excluded or disqualified person, if available.
            (b)(1) The database for the EPLS includes a field for the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (the social security number (SSN) for an individual) of an excluded or disqualified person.
            (2) Agencies disclose the SSN of an individual to verify the identity of an individual, only if permitted under the Privacy Act of 1974 and, if appropriate, the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988, as codified in 5 U.S.C. 552(a).
          
          
            § 19.520
            Who places the information into the EPLS?

            Federal officials who take actions to exclude persons under this part or officials who are responsible for identifying disqualified persons must enter the following information about those persons into the EPLS:
            (a) Information required by § 19.515(a);
            (b) The Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) of the excluded or disqualified person, including the social security number (SSN) for an individual, if the number is available and may be disclosed under law;
            (c) Information about an excluded or disqualified person, generally within five working days, after—
            (1) Taking an exclusion action;
            
            (2) Modifying or rescinding an exclusion action;
            (3) Finding that a person is disqualified; or
            (4) Finding that there has been a change in the status of a person who is listed as disqualified.
          
          
            § 19.525
            Whom do I ask if I have questions about a person in the EPLS?
            If you have questions about a person in the EPLS, ask the point of contact for the Federal agency that placed the person's name into the EPLS. You may find the agency point of contact from the EPLS.
            
          
          
            § 19.530
            Where can I find the EPLS?
            (a) You may access the EPLS through the Internet, currently at http://epls.arnet.gov.
            
            (b) As of November 26, 2003, you may also subscribe to a printed version. However, we anticipate discontinuing the printed version.

          Subpart F—General Principles Relating to Suspension and Debarment Actions
          
            § 19.600
            How do suspension and debarment actions start?
            When we receive information from any source concerning a cause for suspension or debarment, we will promptly report and investigate it. We refer the question of whether to suspend or debar you to our suspending or debarring official for consideration, if appropriate.
          
          
            § 19.605
            How does suspension differ from debarment?
            Suspension differs from debarment in that—
            
              
                A suspending official . . .
                A debarring official . . .
              
              
                (a) Imposes suspension as a temporary status of ineligibility for procurement and nonprocurement transactions, pending completion of an investigation or legal proceedings
                Imposes debarment for a specified period as a final determination that a person is not presently responsible.
              
              
                (b) Must—(1) Have adequate evidence that there may be a cause for debarment of a person; and
                  (2) Conclude that immediate action is necessary to protect the Federal interest
                
                Must conclude, based on a preponderance of the evidence, that the person has engaged in conduct that warrants debarment.
              
              
                (c) Usually imposes the suspension first, and then promptly notifies the suspended person, giving the person an opportunity to contest the suspension and have it lifted
                Imposes debarment after giving the respondent notice of the action and an opportunity to contest the proposed debarment.
              
            
          
          
            § 19.610
            What procedures does the Department of the Treasury use in suspension and debarment actions?
            In deciding whether to suspend or debar you, we handle the actions as informally as practicable, consistent with principles of fundamental fairness.
            (a) For suspension actions, we use the procedures in this subpart and subpart G of this part.
            (b) For debarment actions, we use the procedures in this subpart and subpart H of this part.
          
          
            § 19.615
            How does the Department of the Treasury notify a person of a suspension or debarment action?
            (a) The suspending or debarring official sends a written notice to the last known street address, facsimile number, or e-mail address of—
            (1) You or your identified counsel; or
            (2) Your agent for service of process, or any of your partners, officers, directors, owners, or joint venturers.
            (b) The notice is effective if sent to any of these persons.
          
          
            § 19.620
            Do Federal agencies coordinate suspension and debarment actions?

            Yes, when more than one Federal agency has an interest in a suspension or debarment, the agencies may consider designating one agency as the lead agency for making the decision. Agencies are encouraged to establish methods and procedures for coordinating their suspension and debarment actions.
          
          
            § 19.625
            What is the scope of a suspension or debarment?
            If you are suspended or debarred, the suspension or debarment is effective as follows:
            (a) Your suspension or debarment constitutes suspension or debarment of all of your divisions and other organizational elements from all covered transactions, unless the suspension or debarment decision is limited—
            (1) By its terms to one or more specifically identified individuals, divisions, or other organizational elements; or
            (2) To specific types of transactions.
            (b) Any affiliate of a participant may be included in a suspension or debarment action if the suspending or debarring official—
            (1) Officially names the affiliate in the notice; and
            (2) Gives the affiliate an opportunity to contest the action.
          
          
            § 19.630
            May the Department of the Treasury impute conduct of one person to another?
            For purposes of actions taken under this rule, we may impute conduct as follows:
            (a) Conduct imputed from an individual to an organization. We may impute the fraudulent, criminal, or other improper conduct of any officer, director, shareholder, partner, employee, or other individual associated with an organization, to that organization when the improper conduct occurred in connection with the individual's performance of duties for or on behalf of that organization, or with the organization's knowledge, approval or acquiescence. The organization's acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct is evidence of knowledge, approval or acquiescence.
            (b) Conduct imputed from an organization to an individual, or between individuals. We may impute the fraudulent, criminal, or other improper conduct of any organization to an individual, or from one individual to another individual, if the individual to whom the improper conduct is imputed either participated in, had knowledge of, or reason to know of the improper conduct.
            (c) Conduct imputed from one organization to another organization. We may impute the fraudulent, criminal, or other improper conduct of one organization to another organization when the improper conduct occurred in connection with a partnership, joint venture, joint application, association or similar arrangement, or when the organization to whom the improper conduct is imputed has the power to direct, manage, control or influence the activities of the organization responsible for the improper conduct. Acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct is evidence of knowledge, approval or acquiescence.
          
          
            § 19.635
            May the Department of the Treasury settle a debarment or suspension action?
            Yes, we may settle a debarment or suspension action at any time if it is in the best interest of the Federal Government.
          
          
            § 19.640
            May a settlement include a voluntary exclusion?
            Yes, if we enter into a settlement with you in which you agree to be excluded, it is called a voluntary exclusion and has governmentwide effect.
          
          
            § 19.645
            Do other Federal agencies know if the Department of the Treasury agrees to a voluntary exclusion?

            (a) Yes, we enter information regarding a voluntary exclusion into the EPLS.
            
            (b) Also, any agency or person may contact us to find out the details of a voluntary exclusion.
          
        
        
          Subpart G—Suspension
          
            § 19.700
            When may the suspending official issue a suspension?

            Suspension is a serious action. Using the procedures of this subpart and subpart F of this part, the suspending official may impose suspension only when that official determines that—
            
            (a) There exists an indictment for, or other adequate evidence to suspect, an offense listed under § 19.800(a), or
            (b) There exists adequate evidence to suspect any other cause for debarment listed under § 19.800(b) through (d); and
            (c) Immediate action is necessary to protect the public interest.
          
          
            § 19.705
            What does the suspending official consider in issuing a suspension?
            (a) In determining the adequacy of the evidence to support the suspension, the suspending official considers how much information is available, how credible it is given the circumstances, whether or not important allegations are corroborated, and what inferences can reasonably be drawn as a result. During this assessment, the suspending official may examine the basic documents, including grants, cooperative agreements, loan authorizations, contracts, and other relevant documents.
            (b) An indictment, conviction, civil judgment, or other official findings by Federal, State, or local bodies that determine factual and/or legal matters, constitutes adequate evidence for purposes of suspension actions.
            (c) In deciding whether immediate action is needed to protect the public interest, the suspending official has wide discretion. For example, the suspending official may infer the necessity for immediate action to protect the public interest either from the nature of the circumstances giving rise to a cause for suspension or from potential business relationships or involvement with a program of the Federal Government.
          
          
            § 19.710
            When does a suspension take effect?
            A suspension is effective when the suspending official signs the decision to suspend.
          
          
            § 19.715
            What notice does the suspending official give me if I am suspended?
            After deciding to suspend you, the suspending official promptly sends you a Notice of Suspension advising you—
            (a) That you have been suspended;
            (b) That your suspension is based on—
            (1) An indictment;
            (2) A conviction;
            (3) Other adequate evidence that you have committed irregularities which seriously reflect on the propriety of further Federal Government dealings with you; or
            (4) Conduct of another person that has been imputed to you, or your affiliation with a suspended or debarred person;
            (c) Of any other irregularities in terms sufficient to put you on notice without disclosing the Federal Government's evidence;
            (d) Of the cause(s) upon which we relied under § 19.700 for imposing suspension;
            (e) That your suspension is for a temporary period pending the completion of an investigation or resulting legal or debarment proceedings;
            (f) Of the applicable provisions of this subpart, subpart F of this part, and any other Department of the Treasury procedures governing suspension decision making; and
            (g) Of the governmentwide effect of your suspension from procurement and nonprocurement programs and activities.
          
          
            § 19.720
            How may I contest a suspension?
            If you as a respondent wish to contest a suspension, you or your representative must provide the suspending official with information in opposition to the suspension. You may do this orally or in writing, but any information provided orally that you consider important must also be submitted in writing for the official record.
          
          
            § 19.725
            How much time do I have to contest a suspension?
            (a) As a respondent you or your representative must either send, or make rrangements to appear and present, the information and argument to the suspending official within 30 days after you receive the Notice of Suspension.
            (b) We consider the notice to be received by you—

            (1) When delivered, if we mail the notice to the last known street address, or five days after we send it if the letter is undeliverable;
            
            (2) When sent, if we send the notice by facsimile or five days after we send it if the facsimile is undeliverable; or
            (3) When delivered, if we send the notice by e-mail or five days after we send it if the e-mail is undeliverable.
          
          
            § 19.730
            What information must I provide to the suspending official if I contest a suspension?
            (a) In addition to any information and argument in opposition, as a respondent your submission to the suspending official must identify—
            (1) Specific facts that contradict the statements contained in the Notice of Suspension. A general denial is insufficient to raise a genuine dispute over facts material to the suspension;
            (2) All existing, proposed, or prior exclusions under regulations implementing E.O. 12549 and all similar actions taken by Federal, state, or local agencies, including administrative agreements that affect only those agencies;
            (3) All criminal and civil proceedings not included in the Notice of Suspension that grew out of facts relevant to the cause(s) stated in the notice; and
            (4) All of your affiliates.
            (b) If you fail to disclose this information, or provide false information, the Department of the Treasury may seek further criminal, civil or administrative action against you, as appropriate.
          
          
            § 19.735
            Under what conditions do I get an additional opportunity to challenge the facts on which the suspension is based?
            (a) You as a respondent will not have an additional opportunity to challenge the facts if the suspending official determines that—
            (1) Your suspension is based upon an indictment, conviction, civil judgment, or other finding by a Federal, State, or local body for which an opportunity to contest the facts was provided;
            (2) Your presentation in opposition contains only general denials to information contained in the Notice of Suspension;
            (3) The issues raised in your presentation in opposition to the suspension are not factual in nature, or are not material to the suspending official's initial decision to suspend, or the official's decision whether to continue the suspension; or
            (4) On the basis of advice from the Department of Justice, an office of the United States Attorney, a State attorney general's office, or a State or local prosecutor's office, that substantial interests of the government in pending or contemplated legal proceedings based on the same facts as the suspension would be prejudiced by conducting fact-finding.
            (b) You will have an opportunity to challenge the facts if the suspending official determines that—
            (1) The conditions in paragraph (a) of this section do not exist; and
            (2) Your presentation in opposition raises a genuine dispute over facts material to the suspension.
            (c) If you have an opportunity to challenge disputed material facts under this section, the suspending official or designee must conduct additional proceedings to resolve those facts.
          
          
            § 19.740
            Are suspension proceedings formal?
            (a) Suspension proceedings are conducted in a fair and informal manner. The suspending official may use flexible procedures to allow you to present matters in opposition. In so doing, the suspending official is not required to follow formal rules of evidence or procedure in creating an official record upon which the official will base a final suspension decision.
            (b) You as a respondent or your representative must submit any documentary evidence you want the suspending official to consider.
          
          
            § 19.745
            How is fact-finding conducted?
            (a) If fact-finding is conducted—
            (1) You may present witnesses and other evidence, and confront any witness presented; and
            (2) The fact-finder must prepare written findings of fact for the record.
            (b) A transcribed record of fact-finding proceedings must be made, unless you as a respondent and the Department of the Treasury agree to waive it in advance. If you want a copy of the transcribed record, you may purchase it.
          
          
            
            § 19.750
            What does the suspending official consider in deciding whether to continue or terminate my suspension?
            (a) The suspending official bases the decision on all information contained in the official record. The record includes—
            (1) All information in support of the suspending official's initial decision to suspend you;
            (2) Any further information and argument presented in support of, or opposition to, the suspension; and
            (3) Any transcribed record of fact-finding proceedings.
            (b) The suspending official may refer disputed material facts to another official for findings of fact. The suspending official may reject any resulting findings, in whole or in part, only after specifically determining them to be arbitrary, capricious, or clearly erroneous.
          
          
            § 19.755
            When will I know whether the suspension is continued or terminated?
            The suspending official must make a written decision whether to continue, modify, or terminate your suspension within 45 days of closing the official record. The official record closes upon the suspending official's receipt of final submissions, information and findings of fact, if any. The suspending official may extend that period for good cause.
          
          
            § 19.760
            How long may my suspension last?
            (a) If legal or debarment proceedings are initiated at the time of, or during your suspension, the suspension may continue until the conclusion of those proceedings. However, if proceedings are not initiated, a suspension may not exceed 12 months.
            (b) The suspending official may extend the 12 month limit under paragraph (a) of this section for an additional 6 months if an office of a U.S. Assistant Attorney General, U.S. Attorney, or other responsible prosecuting official requests an extension in writing. In no event may a suspension exceed 18 months without initiating proceedings under paragraph (a) of this section.
            (c) The suspending official must notify the appropriate officials under paragraph (b) of this section of an impending termination of a suspension at least 30 days before the 12 month period expires to allow the officials an opportunity to request an extension.
          
        
        
          Subpart H—Debarment
          
            § 19.800
            What are the causes for debarment?
            We may debar a person for—

            (4) Commission of any other offense indicating a lack of business integrity or business honesty that seriously and directly affects your present responsibility;
            (b) Violation of the terms of a public agreement or transaction so serious as to affect the integrity of an agency program, such as—
            (1) A willful failure to perform in accordance with the terms of one or more public agreements or transactions;
            (2) A history of failure to perform or of unsatisfactory performance of one or more public agreements or transactions; or
            (3) A willful violation of a statutory or regulatory provision or requirement applicable to a public agreement or transaction;
            (c) Any of the following causes:

            After consideration of the causes in § 19.800 of this subpart, if the debarring official proposes to debar you, the official sends you a Notice of Proposed Debarment, pursuant to § 19.615, advising you—

            § 19.810
            When does a debarment take effect?
            A debarment is not effective until the debarring official issues a decision. The debarring official does not issue a decision until the respondent has had an opportunity to contest the proposed debarment.
          
          
            § 19.815
            How may I contest a proposed debarment?
            If you as a respondent wish to contest a proposed debarment, you or your representative must provide the debarring official with information in opposition to the proposed debarment. You may do this orally or in writing, but any information provided orally that you consider important must also be submitted in writing for the official record.
          
          
            § 19.820
            How much time do I have to contest a proposed debarment?
            (a) As a respondent you or your representative must either send, or make arrangements to appear and present, the information and argument to the debarring official within 30 days after you receive the Notice of Proposed Debarment.
            (b) We consider the Notice of Proposed Debarment to be received by you—
            (1) When delivered, if we mail the notice to the last known street address, or five days after we send it if the letter is undeliverable;
            (2) When sent, if we send the notice by facsimile or five days after we send it if the facsimile is undeliverable; or
            (3) When delivered, if we send the notice by e-mail or five days after we send it if the e-mail is undeliverable.
          
          
            § 19.825
            What information must I provide to the debarring official if I contest a proposed debarment?
            (a) In addition to any information and argument in opposition, as a respondent your submission to the debarring official must identify—
            (1) Specific facts that contradict the statements contained in the Notice of Proposed Debarment. Include any information about any of the factors listed in § 19.860. A general denial is insufficient to raise a genuine dispute over facts material to the debarment;

            (2) All existing, proposed, or prior exclusions under regulations implementing E.O. 12549 and all similar actions taken by Federal, State, or local agencies, including administrative agreements that affect only those agencies;
            (3) All criminal and civil proceedings not included in the Notice of Proposed Debarment that grew out of facts relevant to the cause(s) stated in the notice; and

            § 19.830
            Under what conditions do I get an additional opportunity to challenge the facts on which a proposed debarment is based?
            (a) You as a respondent will not have an additional opportunity to challenge the facts if the debarring official determines that—
            (1) Your debarment is based upon a conviction or civil judgment;
            (2) Your presentation in opposition contains only general denials to information contained in the Notice of Proposed Debarment; or
            (3) The issues raised in your presentation in opposition to the proposed debarment are not factual in nature, or are not material to the debarring official's decision whether to debar.
            (b) You will have an additional opportunity to challenge the facts if the debarring official determines that—
            (1) The conditions in paragraph (a) of this section do not exist; and
            (2) Your presentation in opposition raises a genuine dispute over facts material to the proposed debarment.
            (c) If you have an opportunity to challenge disputed material facts under this section, the debarring official or designee must conduct additional proceedings to resolve those facts.
          
          
            § 19.835
            Are debarment proceedings formal?
            (a) Debarment proceedings are conducted in a fair and informal manner. The debarring official may use flexible procedures to allow you as a respondent to present matters in opposition. In so doing, the debarring official is not required to follow formal rules of evidence or procedure in creating an official record upon which the official will base the decision whether to debar.
            (b) You or your representative must submit any documentary evidence you want the debarring official to consider.
          
          
            § 19.840
            How is fact-finding conducted?
            (a) If fact-finding is conducted—
            (1) You may present witnesses and other evidence, and confront any witness presented; and
            (2) The fact-finder must prepare written findings of fact for the record.
            (b) A transcribed record of fact-finding proceedings must be made, unless you as a respondent and the Department of the Treasury agree to waive it in advance. If you want a copy of the transcribed record, you may purchase it.
          
          
            § 19.845
            What does the debarring official consider in deciding whether to debar me?
            (a) The debarring official may debar you for any of the causes in § 19.800. However, the official need not debar you even if a cause for debarment exists. The official may consider the seriousness of your acts or omissions and the mitigating or aggravating factors set forth at § 19.860.
            (b) The debarring official bases the decision on all information contained in the official record. The record includes—
            (1) All information in support of the debarring official's proposed debarment;
            (2) Any further information and argument presented in support of, or in opposition to, the proposed debarment; and
            (3) Any transcribed record of fact-finding proceedings.
            (c) The debarring official may refer disputed material facts to another official for findings of fact. The debarring official may reject any resultant findings, in whole or in part, only after specifically determining them to be arbitrary, capricious, or clearly erroneous.
          
          
            
            § 19.850
            What is the standard of proof in a debarment action?
            (a) In any debarment action, we must establish the cause for debarment by a preponderance of the evidence.
            (b) If the proposed debarment is based upon a conviction or civil judgment, the standard of proof is met.
          
          
            § 19.855
            Who has the burden of proof in a debarment action?
            (a) We have the burden to prove that a cause for debarment exists.
            (b) Once a cause for debarment is established, you as a respondent have the burden of demonstrating to the satisfaction of the debarring official that you are presently responsible and that debarment is not necessary.
          
          
            § 19.860
            What factors may influence the debarring official's decision?
            This section lists the mitigating and aggravating factors that the debarring official may consider in determining whether to debar you and the length of your debarment period. The debarring official may consider other factors if appropriate in light of the circumstances of a particular case. The existence or nonexistence of any factor, such as one of those set forth in this section, is not necessarily determinative of your present responsibility. In making a debarment decision, the debarring official may consider the following factors:
            (a) The actual or potential harm or impact that results or may result from the wrongdoing.
            (b) The frequency of incidents and/or duration of the wrongdoing.
            (c) Whether there is a pattern or prior history of wrongdoing. For example, if you have been found by another Federal agency or a State agency to have engaged in wrongdoing similar to that found in the debarment action, the existence of this fact may be used by the debarring official in determining that you have a pattern or prior history of wrongdoing.
            (d) Whether you are or have been excluded or disqualified by an agency of the Federal Government or have not been allowed to participate in State or local contracts or assistance agreements on a basis of conduct similar to one or more of the causes for debarment specified in this part.
            (e) Whether you have entered into an administrative agreement with a Federal agency or a State or local government that is not governmentwide but is based on conduct similar to one or more of the causes for debarment specified in this part.
            (f) Whether and to what extent you planned, initiated, or carried out the wrongdoing.
            (g) Whether you have accepted responsibility for the wrongdoing and recognize the seriousness of the misconduct that led to the cause for debarment.
            (h) Whether you have paid or agreed to pay all criminal, civil and administrative liabilities for the improper activity, including any investigative or administrative costs incurred by the government, and have made or agreed to make full restitution.
            (i) Whether you have cooperated fully with the government agencies during the investigation and any court or administrative action. In determining the extent of cooperation, the debarring official may consider when the cooperation began and whether you disclosed all pertinent information known to you.
            (j) Whether the wrongdoing was pervasive within your organization.
            (k) The kind of positions held by the individuals involved in the wrongdoing.
            (l) Whether your organization took appropriate corrective action or remedial measures, such as establishing ethics training and implementing programs to prevent recurrence.
            (m) Whether your principals tolerated the offense.
            (n) Whether you brought the activity cited as a basis for the debarment to the attention of the appropriate government agency in a timely manner.
            (o) Whether you have fully investigated the circumstances surrounding the cause for debarment and, if so, made the result of the investigation available to the debarring official.
            (p) Whether you had effective standards of conduct and internal control systems in place at the time the questioned conduct occurred.

            (q) Whether you have taken appropriate disciplinary action against the individuals responsible for the activity which constitutes the cause for debarment.
            (r) Whether you have had adequate time to eliminate the circumstances within your organization that led to the cause for the debarment.
            (s) Other factors that are appropriate to the circumstances of a particular case.
          
          
            § 19.865
            How long may my debarment last?
            (a) If the debarring official decides to debar you, your period of debarment will be based on the seriousness of the cause(s) upon which your debarment is based. Generally, debarment should not exceed three years. However, if circumstances warrant, the debarring official may impose a longer period of debarment.
            (b) In determining the period of debarment, the debarring official may consider the factors in § 19.860. If a suspension has preceded your debarment, the debarring official must consider the time you were suspended.
            (c) If the debarment is for a violation of the provisions of the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988, your period of debarment may not exceed five years.
          
          
            § 19.870
            When do I know if the debarring official debars me?
            (a) The debarring official must make a written decision whether to debar within 45 days of closing the official record. The official record closes upon the debarring official's receipt of final submissions, information and findings of fact, if any. The debarring official may extend that period for good cause.
            (b) The debarring official sends you written notice, pursuant to § 19.615 that the official decided, either—
            (1) Not to debar you; or
            (2) To debar you. In this event, the notice:
            (i) Refers to the Notice of Proposed Debarment;
            (ii) Specifies the reasons for your debarment;
            (iii) States the period of your debarment, including the effective dates; and
            (iv) Advises you that your debarment is effective for covered transactions and contracts that are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR chapter 1), throughout the executive branch of the Federal Government unless an agency head or an authorized designee grants an exception.
          
          
            § 19.875
            May I ask the debarring official to reconsider a decision to debar me?
            Yes, as a debarred person you may ask the debarring official to reconsider the debarment decision or to reduce the time period or scope of the debarment. However, you must put your request in writing and support it with documentation.
          
          
            § 19.880
            What factors may influence the debarring official during reconsideration?

            (a) Newly discovered material evidence;
            (b) A reversal of the conviction or civil judgment upon which your debarment was based;
            (c) A bona fide change in ownership or management;
            (d) Elimination of other causes for which the debarment was imposed; or
            (e) Other reasons the debarring official finds appropriate.
          
          
            § 19.885
            May the debarring official extend a debarment?
            (a) Yes, the debarring official may extend a debarment for an additional period, if that official determines that an extension is necessary to protect the public interest.
            (b) However, the debarring official may not extend a debarment solely on the basis of the facts and circumstances upon which the initial debarment action was based.
            (c) If the debarring official decides that a debarment for an additional period is necessary, the debarring official must follow the applicable procedures in this subpart, and subpart F of this part, to extend the debarment.

          Subpart A—Purpose and Coverage
          
            § 20.100
            What does this part do?

            This part carries out the portion of the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 (41 U.S.C. 701 et seq., as amended) that applies to grants. It also applies the provisions of the Act to cooperative agreements and other financial assistance awards, as a matter of Federal Government policy.
          
          
            § 20.105
            Does this part apply to me?
            (a) Portions of this part apply to you if you are either—
            (1) A recipient of an assistance award from the Department of the Treasury; or
            (2) A(n) Department of the Treasury awarding official. (See definitions of award and recipient in §§ 20.605 and 20.660, respectively.)
            (b) The following table shows the subparts that apply to you:
            
              
                If you are . . .
                see subparts . . .
              
              
                (1) A recipient who is not an individual
                A, B and E.
              
              
                (2) A recipient who is an individual
                A, C and E.
              
              
                (3) A(n) Department of the Treasury awarding official
                A, D and E.
              
            
          
          
            § 20.110
            Are any of my Federal assistance awards exempt from this part?
            This part does not apply to any award that the Secretary of the Treasury determines that the application of this part would be inconsistent with the international obligations of the United States or the laws or regulations of a foreign government.
          
          
            § 20.115
            Does this part affect the Federal contracts that I receive?
            It will affect future contract awards indirectly if you are debarred or suspended for a violation of the requirements of this part, as described in § 20.510(c). However, this part does not apply directly to procurement contracts. The portion of the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 that applies to Federal procurement contracts is carried out through the Federal Acquisition Regulation in chapter 1 of Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations (the drug-free workplace coverage currently is in 48 CFR part 23, subpart 23.5).
          
        
        
          Subpart B—Requirements for Recipients Other Than Individuals
          
            § 20.200
            What must I do to comply with this part?
            There are two general requirements if you are a recipient other than an individual.
            (a) First, you must make a good faith effort, on a continuing basis, to maintain a drug-free workplace. You must agree to do so as a condition for receiving any award covered by this part. The specific measures that you must take in this regard are described in more detail in subsequent sections of this subpart. Briefly, those measures are to—

            (1) Publish a drug-free workplace statement and establish a drug-free awareness program for your employees (see §§ 20.205 through 20.220); and
            (2) Take actions concerning employees who are convicted of violating drug statutes in the workplace (see § 20.225).
            (b) Second, you must identify all known workplaces under your Federal awards (see § 20.230).
          
          
            § 20.205
            What must I include in my drug-free workplace statement?
            You must publish a statement that—
            (a) Tells your employees that the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession, or use of a controlled substance is prohibited in your workplace;
            (b) Specifies the actions that you will take against employees for violating that prohibition; and
            (c) Lets each employee know that, as a condition of employment under any award, he or she:
            (1) Will abide by the terms of the statement; and
            (2) Must notify you in writing if he or she is convicted for a violation of a criminal drug statute occurring in the workplace and must do so no more than five calendar days after the conviction.
          
          
            § 20.210
            To whom must I distribute my drug-free workplace statement?
            You must require that a copy of the statement described in § 20.205 be given to each employee who will be engaged in the performance of any Federal award.
          
          
            § 20.215
            What must I include in my drug-free awareness program?
            You must establish an ongoing drug-free awareness program to inform employees about—
            (a) The dangers of drug abuse in the workplace;
            (b) Your policy of maintaining a drug-free workplace;
            (c) Any available drug counseling, rehabilitation, and employee assistance programs; and
            (d) The penalties that you may impose upon them for drug abuse violations occurring in the workplace.
          
          
            § 20.220
            By when must I publish my drug-free workplace statement and establish my drug-free awareness program?
            If you are a new recipient that does not already have a policy statement as described in § 20.205 and an ongoing awareness program as described in § 20.215, you must publish the statement and establish the program by the time given in the following table:
            
              
                If . . .
                then you . . .
              
              
                (a) The performance period of the award is less than 30 days
                must have the policy statement and program in place as soon as possible, but before the date on which performance is expected to be completed.
              
              
                (b) The performance period of the award is 30 days or more
                must have the policy statement and program in place within 30 days after award.
              
              
                (c) You believe there are extraordinary circumstances that will require more than 30 days for you to publish the policy statement and establish the awareness program
                may ask the Department of the Treasury awarding official to give you more time to do so. The amount of additional time, if any, to be given is at the discretion of the awarding official.
              
            
          
          
            § 20.225
            What actions must I take concerning employees who are convicted of drug violations in the workplace?
            There are two actions you must take if an employee is convicted of a drug violation in the workplace:
            (a) First, you must notify Federal agencies if an employee who is engaged in the performance of an award informs you about a conviction, as required by § 20.205(c)(2), or you otherwise learn of the conviction. Your notification to the Federal agencies must_
            (1) Be in writing;
            (2) Include the employee's position title;
            (3) Include the identification number(s) of each affected award;
            (4) Be sent within ten calendar days after you learn of the conviction; and

            (5) Be sent to every Federal agency on whose award the convicted employee was working. It must be sent to every awarding official or his or her official designee, unless the Federal agency has specified a central point for the receipt of the notices.
            (b) Second, within 30 calendar days of learning about an employee's conviction, you must either_
            (1) Take appropriate personnel action against the employee, up to and including termination, consistent with the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794), as amended; or
            (2) Require the employee to participate satisfactorily in a drug abuse assistance or rehabilitation program approved for these purposes by a Federal, State or local health, law enforcement, or other appropriate agency.
          
          
            § 20.230
            How and when must I identify workplaces?
            (a) You must identify all known workplaces under each Department of the Treasury award. A failure to do so is a violation of your drug-free workplace requirements. You may identify the workplaces_
            (1) To the Department of the Treasury official that is making the award, either at the time of application or upon award; or
            (2) In documents that you keep on file in your offices during the performance of the award, in which case you must make the information available for inspection upon request by Department of the Treasury officials or their designated representatives.
            (b) Your workplace identification for an award must include the actual address of buildings (or parts of buildings) or other sites where work under the award takes place. Categorical descriptions may be used (e.g., all vehicles of a mass transit authority or State highway department while in operation, State employees in each local unemployment office, performers in concert halls or radio studios).
            (c) If you identified workplaces to the Department of the Treasury awarding official at the time of application or award, as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and any workplace that you identified changes during the performance of the award, you must inform the Department of the Treasury awarding official.

            As a condition of receiving a(n) Department of the Treasury award, if you are an individual recipient, you must agree that—
            (a) You will not engage in the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession, or use of a controlled substance in conducting any activity related to the award; and
            (b) If you are convicted of a criminal drug offense resulting from a violation occurring during the conduct of any award activity, you will report the conviction:
            (1) In writing.
            (2) Within 10 calendar days of the conviction.
            (3) To the Department of the Treasury awarding official or other designee for each award that you currently have, unless § 20.301 or the award document designates a central point for the receipt of the notices. When notice is made to a central point, it must include the identification number(s) of each affected award.

            (b) Subpart C of this part, if the recipient is an individual.

            (a) The recipient has violated the requirements of subpart B of this part; or
            (b) The number of convictions of the recipient's employees for violating criminal drug statutes in the workplace is large enough to indicate that the recipient has failed to make a good faith effort to provide a drug-free workplace.
          
          
            § 20.505
            How are violations of this part determined for recipients who are individuals?

            (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, “professional and technical services” shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.
            (c) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.
            (d) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.
          
          
            § 21.210
            Reporting.
            No reporting is required with respect to payments of reasonable compensation made to regularly employed officers or employees of a person.
          
        
        
          Subpart C—Activities by Other Than Own Employees
          
            § 21.300
            Professional and technical services.
            (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 21.100 (a), does not apply in the case of any reasonable payment to a person, other than an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action, if the payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.

            (b) The reporting requirements in § 21.110 (a) and (b) regarding filing a disclosure form by each person, if required, shall not apply with respect to professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any commitment providing for the United States to insure or guarantee a loan.
            
            (c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, “professional and technical services” shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting or a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.
            (d) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.
            (e) Persons other than officers or employees of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action include consultants and trade associations.
            (f) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.
          
        
        
          Subpart D—Penalties and Enforcement
          
            § 21.400
            Penalties.
            (a) Any person who makes an expenditure prohibited herein shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than $100,000 for each such expenditure.
            (b) Any person who fails to file or amend the disclosure form (see Appendix B) to be filed or amended if required herein, shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than $100,000 for each such failure.
            (c) A filing or amended filing on or after the date on which an administrative action for the imposition of a civil penalty is commenced does not prevent the imposition of such civil penalty for a failure occurring before that date. An administrative action is commenced with respect to a failure when an investigating official determines in writing to commence an investigation of an allegation of such failure.
            (d) In determining whether to impose a civil penalty, and the amount of any such penalty, by reason of a violation by any person, the agency shall consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation, the effect on the ability of such person to continue in business, any prior violations by such person, the degree of culpability of such person, the ability of the person to pay the penalty, and such other matters as may be appropriate.
            (e) First offenders under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of $10,000, absent aggravating circumstances. Second and subsequent offenses by persons shall be subject to an appropriate civil penalty between $10,000 and $100,000, as determined by the agency head or his or her designee.
            (f) An imposition of a civil penalty under this section does not prevent the United States from seeking any other remedy that may apply to the same conduct that is the basis for the imposition of such civil penalty.
          
          
            
            § 21.405
            Penalty procedures.
            Agencies shall impose and collect civil penalties pursuant to the provisions of the Program Fraud and Civil Remedies Act, 31 U.S.C. sections 3803 (except subsection (c)), 3804, 3805, 3806, 3807, 3808, and 3812, insofar as these provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements herein.
          
          
            § 21.410
            Enforcement.
            The head of each agency shall take such actions as are necessary to ensure that the provisions herein are vigorously implemented and enforced in that agency.
          
        
        
          Subpart E—Exemptions
          
            § 21.500
            Secretary of Defense.
            (a) The Secretary of Defense may exempt, on a case-by-case basis, a covered Federal action from the prohibition whenever the Secretary determines, in writing, that such an exemption is in the national interest. The Secretary shall transmit a copy of each such written exemption to Congress immediately after making such a determination.
            (b) The Department of Defense may issue supplemental regulations to implement paragraph (a) of this section.
          
        
        
          Subpart F—Agency Reports
          
            § 21.600
            Semi-annual compilation.
            (a) The head of each agency shall collect and compile the disclosure reports (see appendix B) and, on May 31 and November 30 of each year, submit to the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives a report containing a compilation of the information contained in the disclosure reports received during the six-month period ending on March 31 or September 30, respectively, of that year.
            (b) The report, including the compilation, shall be available for public inspection 30 days after receipt of the report by the Secretary and the Clerk.
            (c) Information that involves intelligence matters shall be reported only to the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate, the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives, and the Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and the House of Representatives in accordance with procedures agreed to by such committees. Such information shall not be available for public inspection.
            (d) Information that is classified under Executive Order 12356 or any successor order shall be reported only to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives or the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives (whichever such committees have jurisdiction of matters involving such information) and to the Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and the House of Representatives in accordance with procedures agreed to by such committees. Such information shall not be available for public inspection.
            (e) The first semi-annual compilation shall be submitted on May 31, 1990, and shall contain a compilation of the disclosure reports received from December 23, 1989 to March 31, 1990.
            (f) Major agencies, designated by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), are required to provide machine-readable compilations to the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives no later than with the compilations due on May 31, 1991. OMB shall provide detailed specifications in a memorandum to these agencies.
            (g) Non-major agencies are requested to provide machine-readable compilations to the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives.
            (h) Agencies shall keep the originals of all disclosure reports in the official files of the agency.
          
          
            § 21.605
            Inspector General report.

            (a) The Inspector General, or other official as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, of each agency shall prepare and submit to Congress each year, commencing with submission of the President's Budget in 1991, an evaluation of the compliance of that agency with, and the effectiveness of, the requirements herein. The evaluation may include any recommended changes that may be necessary to strengthen or improve the requirements.
            (b) In the case of an agency that does not have an Inspector General, the agency official comparable to an Inspector General shall prepare and submit the annual report, or, if there is no such comparable official, the head of the agency shall prepare and submit the annual report.
            (c) The annual report shall be submitted at the same time the agency submits its annual budget justifications to Congress.
            (d) The annual report shall include the following: All alleged violations relating to the agency's covered Federal actions during the year covered by the report, the actions taken by the head of the agency in the year covered by the report with respect to those alleged violations and alleged violations in previous years, and the amounts of civil penalties imposed by the agency in the year covered by the report.

          § 22.1
          Purpose.
          The purpose of this part is to effectuate the provisions of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI) to the end that no person in the United States shall, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance from the Department of the Treasury.
        
        
          § 22.2
          Application.
          (a) This part applies to any program for which federal financial assistance is authorized under a law administered by the Department, including the types of federal financial assistance listed in appendix A to this part. It also applies to money paid, property transferred, or other federal financial assistance extended after the effective date of this part pursuant to an application approved before that effective date. This part does not apply to:
          (1) Any federal financial assistance by way of insurance or guaranty contracts;
          (2) Any assistance to any individual who is the ultimate beneficiary; or
          (3) Any employment practice, under any such program, of any employer, employment agency, or labor organization, except to the extent described in § 22.4(c). The fact that a type of federal financial assistance is not listed in appendix A to this part shall not mean, if Title VI is otherwise applicable, that a program is not covered. Other types of federal financial assistance under statutes now in force or hereinafter enacted may be added to appendix A to this part.
          (b) In any program receiving federal financial assistance in the form, or for the acquisition, of real property or an interest in real property, to the extent that rights to space on, over, or under any such property are included as part of the program receiving that assistance, the nondiscrimination requirement of this part shall extend to any facility located wholly or in part in that space.
        
        
          § 22.3
          Definitions.

          § 22.4
          Discrimination prohibited.
          (a) General. No person in the United States shall, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination under, any program to which this part applies.
          (b) Specific discriminatory actions prohibited. (1) A recipient to which this part applies may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin:
          (i) Deny a person any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided under the program;
          (ii) Provide any service, financial aid, or other benefit to a person which is different, or is provided in a different manner, from that provided to others under the program;
          (iii) Subject a person to segregation or separate treatment in any matter related to his receipt of any service, financial aid, or other benefit under the program;
          (iv) Restrict a person in any way in the enjoyment of any advantage or privilege enjoyed by others receiving any service, financial aid, or other benefit under the program;
          (v) Treat a person differently from others in determining whether he satisfies any admission, enrollment, quota, eligibility, membership, or other requirement or condition which persons must meet in order to be provided any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided under the program;

          (vi) Deny a person an opportunity to participate in the program through the provision of services or otherwise to afford him an opportunity to do so which is different from that afforded others under the program (including the opportunity to participate in the program as a volunteer or as an employee, but only to the extent set forth in paragraph (c) of this section); or
          (vii) Deny a person the opportunity to participate as a member of a planning, advisory, or similar body which is an integral part of the program.
          (2) A recipient, in determining the types of services, financial aid, or other benefits, or facilities which will be provided under any such program, or the class of persons to whom, or the situations in which, such services, financial aid, other benefits, or facilities will be provided under any such program, or the class of persons to be afforded an opportunity to participate in any such program, may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, use criteria or methods of administration which have the effect of subjecting persons to discrimination because of their race, color, or national origin or have the effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the program with respect to individuals of a particular race, color, or national origin.
          (3) In determining the site or location of facilities, a recipient or applicant may not make selections with the purpose or effect of excluding persons from, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting them to discrimination under any program to which this regulation applies, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin; or with the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of Title VI or this part.
          (4) As used in this section the services, financial aid, or other benefits provided under a program receiving federal financial assistance include any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided in or through a facility provided with the aid of federal financial assistance.
          (5) The enumeration of specific forms of prohibited discrimination in this paragraph does not limit the generality of the prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section.
          (6) This part does not prohibit the consideration of race, color, or national origin if the purpose and effect are to remove or overcome the consequences of practices or impediments which have restricted the availability of, or participation in, the program or activity receiving federal financial assistance, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin. Where prior discriminatory practice or usage tends, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin to exclude individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under any program or activity to which this part applies, the applicant or recipient must take affirmative action to remove or overcome the effects of the prior discriminatory practice or usage. Even in the absence of prior discriminatory practice or usage, a recipient in administering a program or activity to which this part applies, may take affirmative action to assure that no person is excluded from participation in or denied the benefits of the program or activity on the grounds of race, color, or national origin.
          (c) Employment practices. (1) Where a primary objective of the federal financial assistance to a program to which this part applies is to provide employment, a recipient subject to this part shall not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, subject a person to discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in its employment practices under such program (including recruitment or recruitment advertising, hiring, firing, upgrading, promotion, demotion, transfer, layoff, termination, rates of pay or other forms of compensation or benefits, selection for training or apprenticeship, and use of facilities). Such recipient shall take affirmative action to insure that applicants are employed, and employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, color, or national origin. The requirements applicable to construction employment under any such program shall be those specified in or pursuant to Part III of Executive Order 11246 or any Executive Order which supersedes it.

          (2) Where a primary objective of the federal financial assistance is not to provide employment, but discrimination on the grounds of race, color, or national origin in the employment practices of the recipient or other persons subject to the regulation tends, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, to exclude individuals from participation in, deny them the benefits of, or subject them to discrimination under any program to which this regulation applies, the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall apply to the employment practices of the recipient or other persons subject to the regulation, to the extent necessary to assure equality of opportunity to, and nondiscriminatory treatment of, beneficiaries.
        
        
          § 22.5
          Assurances required.
          (a) General. Either at the application stage or the award stage, federal agencies must ensure that applications for federal financial assistance or awards of federal financial assistance contain, be accompanied by, or be covered by a specifically identified assurance from the applicant or recipient, satisfactory to the designated agency official, that each program or activity operated by the applicant or recipient and to which these Title VI regulations apply will be operated in compliance with these Title VI regulations.
          (b) Duration of obligation. (1) In the case where the federal financial assistance is to provide or is in the form of personal property, or real property or interest therein or structures thereon, the assurance shall obligate the recipient, or, in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period during which the property is used for a purpose for which the federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits, or for as long as the recipient retains ownership or possession of the property, whichever is longer. In all other cases the assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which federal financial assistance is extended to the program.
          (2) In the case where federal financial assistance is provided in the form of a transfer of real property, structures, or improvements thereon, or interest therein, from the federal Government, the instrument effecting or recording the transfer shall contain a covenant running with the land assuring nondiscrimination for the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for which the federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits. Where no transfer of property or interest therein from the federal government is involved, but property is acquired or improved with federal financial assistance, the recipient shall agree to include such covenant in any subsequent transfer of such property. When the property is obtained from the federal government, such covenant may also include a condition coupled with a right to be reserved by the Department to revert title to the property in the event of a breach of the covenant where, in the discretion of the designated agency official, such a condition and right of reverter is appropriate to the statute under which the real property is obtained and to the nature of the grant and the grantee. In such event if a transferee of real property proposes to mortgage or otherwise encumber the real property as security for financing construction of new, or improvement of existing, facilities on such property for the purposes for which the property was transferred, the designated agency official may agree, upon request of the transferee and if necessary to accomplish such financing, and upon such conditions as the designated agency official deems appropriate, to subordinate such right of reversion to the lien of such mortgage or other encumbrance.
          (c) Continuing federal financial assistance. Every application by a State or a State agency for continuing federal financial assistance to which this part applies (including the types of federal financial assistance listed in appendix A to this part) shall as a condition to its approval and the extension of any federal financial assistance pursuant to the application:

          (1) Contain, be accompanied by, or be covered by a statement that the program is (or, in the case of a new program, will be) conducted in compliance with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part; and
          
          (2) Provide, be accompanied by, or be covered by provision for such methods of administration for the program as are found by the designated agency official to give reasonable guarantee that the applicant and all recipients of federal financial assistance under such program will comply with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part.
          (d) Assurance from institutions. (1) In the case of any application for federal financial assistance to an institution of higher education (including assistance for construction, for research, for special training projects, for student loans or for any other purpose), the assurance required by this section shall extend to admission practices and to all other practices relating to the treatment of students.
          (2) The assurance required with respect to an institution of higher education, hospital, or any other institution, insofar as the assurance relates to the institution's practices with respect to admission or other treatment of individuals as students, patients, or clients of the institution or to the opportunity to participate in the provision of services or other benefits to such individuals, shall be applicable to the entire institution.
          (e) Form. (1) The assurances required by paragraph (a) of this section, which may be included as part of a document that addresses other assurances or obligations, shall include that the applicant or recipient will comply with all applicable federal statutes relating to nondiscrimination. This includes but is not limited to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 2000d, et seq.
          
          (2) The designated agency official will specify the extent to which such assurances will be required of the applicant's or recipient's subgrantees, contractors, subcontractors, transferees, or successors in interest. Any such assurance shall include provisions which give the United States a right to seek its judicial enforcement.
        
        
          § 22.6
          Compliance information.
          (a) Cooperation and assistance. The designated Agency official shall to the fullest extent practicable seek the cooperation of recipients in obtaining compliance with this part and shall provide assistance and guidance to recipients to help them comply voluntarily with this part.
          (b) Compliance reports. Each recipient shall keep such records and submit to the designated Agency official timely, complete, and accurate compliance reports at such times, and in such form and containing such information, as the designated Agency official may determine to be necessary to enable the designated Agency official to ascertain whether the recipient has complied or is complying with this part. In the case in which a primary recipient extends federal financial assistance to any other recipient, such other recipient shall also submit such compliance reports to the primary recipient as may be necessary to enable the primary recipient to carry out its obligations under this part. In general recipients should have available for the designated Agency official racial and ethnic data showing the extent to which members of minority groups are beneficiaries of programs receiving Federal financial assistance.
          (c) Access to sources of information. Each recipient shall permit access by the designated Agency official during normal business hours to such of its books, records, accounts, and other sources of information, and its facilities as may be pertinent to ascertain compliance with this part. Where any information required of a recipient is in the exclusive possession of any other agency, institution, or person and this agency, institution, or person fails or refuses to furnish this information, the recipient shall so certify in its report and shall set forth what efforts it has made to obtain the information.
          (d) Information to beneficiaries and participants. Each recipient shall make available to participants, beneficiaries, and other interested persons such information regarding the provisions of this part and its applicability to the program for which the recipient receives federal financial assistance, and make such information available to them in such manner, as the designated Agency official finds necessary to apprise such persons of the protections against discrimination assured them by Title VI and this part.
        
        
          
          § 22.7
          Conduct of investigations.
          (a) Periodic compliance reviews. The designated Agency official shall from time to time review the practices of recipients to determine whether they are complying with this part.
          (b) Complaints. Any person who believes that he or she, or any specific class of persons, has been subjected to discrimination prohibited by this part may by himself or herself, or by a representative, file with the designated Agency official a written complaint. A complaint must be filed not later than 180 days after the date of the alleged discrimination, unless the time for filing is extended by the designated Agency official.
          (c) Investigations. The designated Agency official will make a prompt investigation whenever a compliance review, report, complaint, or any other information indicates a possible failure to comply with this part. The investigation will include, where appropriate, a review of the pertinent practices and policies of the recipient, the circumstances under which the possible noncompliance with this part occurred, and other factors relevant to a determination as to whether the recipient has failed to comply with this part.
          (d) Resolution of matters. (1) If an investigation pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section indicates a failure to comply with this part, the designated Agency official will so inform the recipient and the matter will be resolved by informal means whenever possible. If it has been determined that the matter cannot be resolved by informal means, action will be taken as provided for in § 22.8.
          (2) If an investigation does not warrant action pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section the designated Agency official will so inform the recipient and the complainant, if any, in writing.
          (e) Intimidatory or retaliatory acts prohibited. No recipient or other person shall intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by section 601 of Title VI or this part, or because the individual has made a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this part. The identity of complainants shall be kept confidential except to the extent necessary to carry out the purposes of this part, including the conduct of any investigation, hearing, or judicial proceeding arising thereunder.
        
        
          § 22.8
          Procedure for effecting compliance.
          (a) General. If there appears to be a failure or threatened failure to comply with this part, and if the noncompliance or threatened noncompliance cannot be corrected by informal means, compliance with this part may be effected by the suspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue federal financial assistance or by any other means authorized by law. Such other means may include, but are not limited to:
          (1) A referral to the Department of Justice with a recommendation that appropriate proceedings be brought to enforce any rights of the United States under any law of the United States (including other titles of the Civil Rights Act of 1964), or any assurance or other contractual undertaking; and
          (2) Any applicable proceeding under State or local law.
          (b) Noncompliance with § 22.5. If an applicant fails or refuses to furnish an assurance required under § 22.5 or otherwise fails or refuses to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to that section, federal financial assistance may be suspended, terminated, or refused in accordance with the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section. The Agency shall not be required to provide assistance in such a case during the pendency of the administrative proceedings under such paragraph. However, subject to § 22.12, the Agency shall continue assistance during the pendency of such proceedings where such assistance is due and payable pursuant to an application approved prior to the effective date of this part.
          (c) Termination of or refusal to grant or to continue federal financial assistance. (1) No order suspending, terminating, or refusing to grant or continue federal financial assistance shall become effective until:

          (i) The designated Agency official has advised the applicant or recipient of the applicant's or recipient's failure to comply and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means;
          (ii) There has been an express finding on the record, after opportunity for hearing, of a failure by the applicant or recipient to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to this part;
          (iii) The action has been approved by the designated Agency official pursuant to § 22.10(e); and
          (iv) The expiration of 30 days after the designated Agency official has filed with the committee of the House and the committee of the Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the program involved, a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action.
          (2) Any action to suspend or terminate or to refuse to grant or to continue federal financial assistance shall be limited to the particular political entity, or part thereof, or other applicant or recipient as to whom such a finding has been made and shall be limited in its effect to the particular program, or part thereof, in which such noncompliance has been so found.
          (d) Other means authorized by law. No action to effect compliance with Title VI by any other means authorized by law shall be taken by the Department of the Treasury until:
          (1) The designated Agency official has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means;
          (2) The recipient or other person has been notified of its failure to comply and of the action to be taken to effect compliance; and
          (3) The expiration of at least 10 days from the mailing of such notice to the recipient or other person. During this period of at least 10 days, additional efforts shall be made to persuade the recipient or other person to comply with the regulation and to take such corrective action as may be appropriate.
        
        
          § 22.9
          Hearings.
          (a) Opportunity for hearing. Whenever an opportunity for a hearing is required by § 22.8(c), reasonable notice shall be given by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the affected applicant or recipient. This notice shall advise the applicant or recipient of the action proposed to be taken, the specific provision under which the proposed action against it is to be taken, and the matters of fact or law asserted as the basis for this action, and either:
          (1) Fix a date not less than 20 days after the date of such notice within which the applicant or recipient may request of the designated agency official that the matter be scheduled for hearing; or
          (2) Advise the applicant or recipient that the matter in question has been set for hearing at a stated place and time. The time and place so fixed shall be reasonable and shall be subject to change for cause. The complainant, if any, shall be advised of the time and place of the hearing. An applicant or recipient may waive a hearing and submit written information and argument for the record. The failure of an applicant or recipient to request a hearing under this paragraph or to appear at a hearing for which a date has been set shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to a hearing under section 602 of Title VI and § 22.8(c) and consent to the making of a decision on the basis of such information as is available.
          (b) Time and place of hearing. Hearings shall be held at the offices of the Department of the Treasury component administering the program, at a time fixed by the designated Agency official unless the designated Agency official determines that the convenience of the applicant or recipient or of the Agency requires that another place be selected. Hearings shall be held before the designated Agency official, or at designated Agency official's discretion, before a hearing examiner appointed in accordance with section 3105 of title 5, United States Code, or detailed under section 3344 of title 5, United States Code.
          (c) Right to counsel. In all proceedings under this section, the applicant or recipient and the Agency shall have the right to be represented by counsel.
          (d) Procedures, evidence, and record. (1) The hearing, decision, and any administrative review thereof shall be conducted in conformity with sections 554 through 557 of title 5, United States Code, and in accordance with such rules of procedure as are proper (and not inconsistent with this section) relating to the conduct of the hearing, giving of notices subsequent to those provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, taking of testimony, exhibits, arguments and briefs, requests for findings, and other related matters. Both the designated Agency official and the applicant or recipient shall be entitled to introduce all relevant evidence on the issues as stated in the notice for hearing or as determined by the officer conducting the hearing at the outset of or during the hearing.
          (2) Technical rules of evidence do not apply to hearings conducted pursuant to this part, but rules or principles designed to assure production of the most credible evidence available and to subject testimony to test by cross-examination shall be applied where determined reasonably necessary by the officer conducting the hearing. The hearing officer may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. All documents and other evidence offered or taken for the record shall be open to examination by the parties and opportunity shall be given to refute facts and arguments advanced on either side of the issues. A transcript shall be made of the oral evidence except to the extent the substance thereof is stipulated for the record. All decisions shall be based upon the hearing record and written findings shall be made.
          (e) Consolidated or joint hearings. In cases in which the same or related facts are asserted to constitute noncompliance with this part with respect to two or more federal statutes, authorities, or other means by which federal financial assistance is extended and to which this part applies, or noncompliance with this part and the regulations of one or more other federal departments or agencies issued under Title VI, the designated Agency official may, by agreement with such other departments or agencies, where applicable, provide for the conduct of consolidated or joint hearings, and for the application to such hearings of rules or procedures not inconsistent with this part. Final decisions in such cases, insofar as this regulation is concerned, shall be made in accordance with § 22.10.
        
        
          § 22.10
          Decisions and notices.
          (a) Procedure on decisions by hearing examiner. If the hearing is held by a hearing examiner, the hearing examiner shall either make an initial decision, if so authorized, or certify the entire record including his recommended findings and proposed decision to the designated agency official for a final decision, and a copy of such initial decision or certification shall be mailed to the applicant or recipient. Where the initial decision is made by the hearing examiner the applicant or recipient may, within 30 days after the mailing of such notice of initial decision, file with the designated Agency official the applicant's or recipient's exceptions to the initial decision, with the reasons therefor. In the absence of exceptions, the designated Agency official may, on his or her own motion, within 45 days after the initial decision, serve on the applicant or recipient a notice that the designated Agency official will review the decision. Upon the filing of such exceptions or of notice of review, the designated Agency official shall review the initial decision and issue his or her own decision thereon including the reasons therefor. In the absence of either exceptions or a notice of review the initial decision shall, subject to paragraph (e) of this section, constitute the final decision of the designated Agency official.
          (b) Decisions on record or review by the designated Agency official. Whenever a record is certified to the designated Agency official for decision or he or she reviews the decision of a hearing examiner pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, or whenever the designated Agency official conducts the hearing, the applicant or recipient shall be given reasonable opportunity to file with the designated Agency official briefs or other written statements of its contentions, and a written copy of the final decision of the designated Agency official shall be sent to the applicant or recipient and to the complainant, if any.
          (c) Decisions on record where a hearing is waived. Whenever a hearing is waived pursuant to § 22.9, a decision shall be made by the designated Agency official on the record and a written copy of such decision shall be sent to the applicant or recipient, and to the complainant, if any.
          (d) Rulings required. Each decision of a hearing examiner or the designated Agency official shall set forth his or her ruling on each finding, conclusion, or exception presented, and shall identify the requirement or requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part with which it is found that the applicant or recipient has failed to comply.
          (e) Approval by designated Agency official. Any final decision by an official of the Agency, other than the designated Agency official personally, which provides for the suspension or termination of, or the refusal to grant or continue federal financial assistance, or the imposition of any other sanction available under this part or Title VI, shall promptly be transmitted to the designated Agency official personally, who may approve such decision, may vacate it, or remit or mitigate any sanction imposed.
          (f) Content of orders. The final decision may provide for suspension or termination of, or refusal to grant or continue federal financial assistance, in whole or in part, to which this regulation applies, and may contain such terms, conditions, and other provisions as are consistent with and will effectuate the purposes of Title VI and this part, including provisions designed to assure that no federal financial assistance to which this regulation applies will thereafter be extended to the applicant or recipient determined by such decision to be in default in its performance of an assurance given by it pursuant to this part, or to have otherwise failed to comply with this part, unless and until it corrects its noncompliance and satisfies the designated Agency official that it will fully comply with this part.
          (g) Post termination proceedings. (1) An applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall be restored to full eligibility to receive federal financial assistance if it satisfies the terms and conditions of that order for such eligibility or if it brings itself into compliance with this part and provides reasonable assurance that it will fully comply with this part.
          (2) Any applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order entered pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section may at any time request the designated Agency official to restore fully its eligibility to receive federal financial assistance. Any such request shall be supported by information showing that the applicant or recipient has met the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. If the designated Agency official determines that those requirements have been satisfied, he or she shall restore such eligibility.
          (3) If the designated Agency official denies any such request, the applicant or recipient may submit a request for a hearing in writing, specifying why it believes such official to have been in error. It shall thereupon be given an expeditious hearing, with a decision on the record in accordance with rules or procedures issued by the designated Agency official. The applicant or recipient will be restored to such eligibility if it proves at such a hearing that it satisfied the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. While proceedings under this paragraph are pending, the sanctions imposed by the order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall remain in effect.
        
        
          § 22.11
          Judicial review.
          Action taken pursuant to section 602 of the Title VI is subject to judicial review as provided in section 603 of the Title VI.
        
        
          § 22.12
          Effect on other regulations, forms, and instructions.
          (a) Effect on other regulations. All regulations, orders, or like directions issued before the effective date of this part by any officer of the Department of the Treasury which impose requirements designed to prohibit any discrimination against individuals on the grounds of race, color, or national origin under any program to which this part applies, and which authorize the suspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue federal financial assistance to any applicant for a recipient of such assistance for failure to comply with such requirements, are hereby superseded to the extent that such discrimination is prohibited by this part, except that nothing in this part may be considered to relieve any person of any obligation assumed or imposed under any such superseded regulation, order, instruction, or like direction before the effective date of this part. Nothing in this part, however, supersedes any of the following (including future amendments thereof):
          (1) Executive Order 11246 (3 CFR, 1965 Supp., p. 167) and regulations issued thereunder; or
          (2) Any other orders, regulations, or instructions, insofar as such orders, regulations, or instructions prohibit discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in any program or situation to which this part is inapplicable, or prohibit discrimination on any other ground.
          (b) Forms and instructions. The designated Agency official shall issue and promptly make available to all interested persons forms and detailed instructions and procedures for effectuating this part as applied to programs to which this part applies and for which the designated Agency official is responsible.
          (c) Supervision and coordination. The designated Agency official may from time to time assign to officials of the Agency, or to officials of other departments or agencies of the Government with the consent of such departments or agencies, responsibilities in connection with the effectuation of the purposes of Title VI and this part (other than responsibility for final decision as provided in § 22.10), including the achievement of effective coordination and maximum uniformity within the Agency and within the Executive Branch of the Government in the application of Title VI and this part to similar programs and in similar situations. Any action taken, determination made or requirement imposed by an official of another department or agency acting pursuant to an assignment of responsibility under this paragraph shall have the same effect as though such action had been taken by the designated Agency official of the Department.

            § 23.1
            What is the purpose of the Age Discrimination Act of 1975?
            The Age Discrimination Act of 1975, as amended, is designed to prohibit discrimination on the basis of age in programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance. The Act also permits federally assisted programs and activities, and recipients of Federal funds, to continue to use certain age distinctions and factors other than age that meet the requirements of the Act and these regulations.
          
          
            § 23.2
            What is the purpose of Treasury's age discrimination regulations?
            The purpose of these regulations is to set out Treasury's policies and procedures under the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 and the general age discrimination regulations at 45 CFR part 90. The Act and the general regulations prohibit discrimination on the basis of age in programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance. The Act and the general regulations permit federally assisted programs and activities, and recipients of Federal funds, to continue to use age distinctions and factors other than age that meet the requirements of the Act and its implementing regulations. These regulations do not apply to actions arising under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, Public Law 90-202, 29 U.S.C. 621 through 634 (ADEA), and do not in any way affect the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's regulations implementing the ADEA at 29 CFR 1625, 1626, and 1627.
          
          
            § 23.3

            (i) Provides any benefits or assistance to persons based on age; or
            (ii) Establishes criteria for participation in age-related terms; or
            (iii) Describes intended beneficiaries to target groups in age-related terms; or
            (2) Any employment practice of any employer, employment agency, labor organization, or any labor-management joint apprenticeship training program.

          Subpart B—Standards for Determining Age Discrimination
          
            § 23.11
            Rules against age discrimination.
            The rules stated in this section are limited by the exceptions contained in §§ 23.13 and 23.14.
            (a) General rule. No person in the United States shall, on the basis of age, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under, any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.
            (b) Specific rules. A recipient may not, in any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance, directly or through contractual licensing, or other arrangements, use age distinctions or take any other actions that have the effect, on the basis of age, of:
            (1) Excluding individuals from, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting them to discrimination under, a program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance; or
            (2) Denying or limiting individuals in their opportunity to participate in any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.
            (c) Non-exhaustive list. The specific forms of age discrimination listed in paragraph (b) of this section do not necessarily constitute a complete list.
          
          
            § 23.12
            Definitions of “normal operation” and “statutory objective.”
            For purposes of §§ 23.13 and 23.14, the terms “normal operation” and “statutory objective” shall have the following meaning:
            (a) Normal operation means the operation of a program or activity without significant changes that would impair its ability to meet its objectives.
            (b) Statutory objective means any purpose of a program or activity expressly stated in any Federal statute, State statute, or local statute or ordinance adopted by an elected, general purpose legislative body.
          
          
            § 23.13
            Exceptions to the rules against age discrimination: Normal operation or statutory objective of any program or activity.
            A recipient is permitted to take an action, otherwise prohibited by § 23.11, if the action reasonably takes into account age as a factor necessary to the normal operation or the achievement of any statutory objective of a program or activity. An action reasonably takes into account age as a factor necessary to the normal operation or the achievement of any statutory objective of a program or activity, if:
            (a) Age is used as a measure or approximation of one or more other characteristics; and
            (b) The other characteristic(s) must be measured or approximated for the normal operation of the program or activity to continue, or to achieve any statutory objective of the program or activity; and
            (c) The other characteristic(s) can be reasonably measured or approximated by the use of age; and
            (d) The other characteristic(s) are impractical to measure directly on an individual basis.
          
          
            § 23.14
            Exceptions to the rules against age discrimination: Reasonable factors other than age.
            A recipient is permitted to take an action otherwise prohibited by § 23.11 that is based on a factor other than age, even though that action may have a disproportionate effect on persons of different ages. An action may be based on a factor other than age only if the factor bears a direct and substantial relationship to the normal operation of the program or activity or to the achievement of a statutory objective.
          
          
            § 23.15
            Burden of proof.
            The burden of proving that an age distinction or other action falls within the exceptions outlined in §§ 23.13 and 23.14 is on the recipient of Federal financial assistance.
          
          
            § 23.16
            Affirmative action by recipient.
            Even in the absence of a finding of discrimination, a recipient may take affirmative action to overcome the effects of conditions that resulted in limited participation in the recipient's program or activity on the basis of age.
          
          
            § 23.17
            Special benefits for children and the elderly.
            If a recipient's operation of a program or activity provides special benefits to the elderly or to children, such use of age distinctions shall be presumed to be necessary to the normal operation of the program or activity, notwithstanding the provisions of § 23.13.
          
          
            § 23.18
            Age distinctions contained in Treasury regulations.
            Any age distinctions contained in a rule or regulation issued by Treasury shall be presumed to be necessary to the achievement of a statutory objective of the program or activity to which the rule or regulation applies, notwithstanding the provisions of § 23.13.
          
        
        
          Subpart C—Duties of Treasury Recipients
          
            § 23.31
            General responsibilities.
            Each Treasury recipient has primary responsibility to ensure that its programs and activities are in compliance with the Act and these regulations, and shall take steps to eliminate violations of the Act. A recipient also has responsibility to maintain records, provide information, and afford Treasury access to its records to the extent Treasury finds necessary to determine whether the recipient is in compliance with the Act and these regulations.
          
          
            § 23.32

            (b) Each recipient shall make necessary information about the Act and these regulations available to its program beneficiaries to inform them about the protections against discrimination provided by the Act and these regulations.

            (a) Written assurance. Each recipient of Federal financial assistance from Treasury shall sign a written assurance as specified by Treasury that it will comply with the Act and these regulations.
            (b) Recipient assessment of age distinctions. (1) As part of a compliance review under § 23.41 or a complaint investigation under § 23.44, Treasury may require a recipient employing the equivalent of 15 or more employees to complete a written self-evaluation, in a manner specified by the responsible Department official, of any age distinction imposed in its program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance from Treasury to assess the recipient's compliance with the Act.
            (2) Whenever an assessment indicates a violation of the Act or the Treasury regulations, the recipient shall take corrective action.
          
          
            § 23.34
            Information requirements.
            Each recipient shall:
            (a) Keep records in a form and containing information that Treasury determines may be necessary to ascertain whether the recipient is complying with the Act and these regulations.
            (b) Provide to Treasury, upon request, information and reports that Treasury determines are necessary to ascertain whether the recipient is complying with the Act and these regulations.
            (c) Permit reasonable access by Treasury to the books, records, accounts, and other recipient facilities and sources of information to the extent Treasury determines is necessary to ascertain whether the recipient is complying with the Act and these regulations.
          
        
        
          Subpart D—Investigation, Conciliation, and Enforcement Procedures
          
            § 23.41
            Compliance reviews.
            (a) Treasury may conduct compliance reviews and pre-award reviews or use other similar procedures that will permit it to investigate and correct violations of the Act and these regulations. Treasury may conduct these reviews even in the absence of a complaint against a recipient. The reviews may be as comprehensive as necessary to determine whether a violation of the Act or these regulations has occurred.
            (b) If a compliance review or pre-award review indicates a violation of the Act or these regulations, Treasury will attempt to achieve voluntary compliance. If voluntary compliance cannot be achieved, Treasury will arrange for enforcement as described in § 23.46.
          
          
            § 23.42
            Complaints.
            (a) Any person, individually or as a member of a class or on behalf of others, may file a complaint with Treasury, alleging discrimination prohibited by the Act or these regulations based on an action occurring on or after July 1, 1979. A complainant shall file a complaint within 180 days from the date the complainant first had knowledge of the alleged act of discrimination. However, for good cause shown, Treasury may extend this time limit.
            (b) Treasury will consider the date a complaint is filed to be the date upon which the complaint is sufficient to be processed.
            (c) Treasury will attempt to facilitate the filing of complaints wherever possible, including taking the following measures:
            (1) Accepting as a sufficient complaint any written statement that identifies the parties involved and the date the complainant first had knowledge of the alleged violation, describes generally the action or practice complained of, and is signed by the complainant.

            (2) Freely permitting a complainant to add information to the complaint to meet the requirements of a sufficient complaint.
            
            (3) Notifying the complainant and the recipient of their rights and obligations under the complaint procedure, including the right to have a representative at all stages of the complaint resolution process.
            (4) Notifying the complainant and the recipient (or their representatives) of their right to contact Treasury for information and assistance regarding the complaint resolution process.
            (d) Treasury will notify the complainant when the complaint falls outside the jurisdiction of these regulations, and will state the reason(s) why it is outside the jurisdiction of these regulations.
          
          
            § 23.43
            Mediation.
            (a) Treasury will promptly refer to a mediation agency designated by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) all sufficient complaints that:
            (1) Fall within the jurisdiction of the Act and these regulations, unless the age distinction complained of is clearly within an exception; and,
            (2) Contain all information necessary for further processing.
            (b) Both the complainant and the recipient shall participate in the mediation process to the extent necessary to reach an agreement or make an informed judgment that an agreement is not possible.
            (c) If the complainant and the recipient reach an agreement, the mediator shall prepare a written statement of the agreement and have the complainant and the recipient sign it. The mediator shall send a copy of the agreement to Treasury. Treasury will take no further action on the complaint unless the complainant or the recipient fails to comply with the agreement.
            (d) The mediator shall protect the confidentially of all information obtained in the course of the mediation process. No mediator shall testify in any adjudicative proceeding, produce any document, or otherwise disclose any information obtained in the course of the mediation process without prior approval of the head of the mediation agency.
            (e)(1) The mediation will proceed for a maximum of 60 days after a complaint is filed with Treasury. Mediation ends if:
            (i) 60 days elapse from the time the complaint is filed; or
            (ii) Prior to the end of that 60-day period, an agreement is reached; or
            (iii) Prior to the end of that 60-day period, the mediator determines that an agreement cannot be reached.
            (2) This 60-day period may be extended by the mediator, with the concurrence of Treasury, for not more than 30 days if the mediator determines that agreement likely will be reached during such extended period.
            (f) The mediator shall notify Treasury when mediation is not successful and Treasury will continue processing the complaint.
          
          
            § 23.44

            (2) As part of the initial investigation, Treasury will use informal fact finding methods, including joint or separate discussions with the complainant and recipient, to establish the facts and, if possible, settle the complaint on terms that are mutually agreeable to the parties. Treasury may seek the assistance of any involved State agency.
            (3) Any settlement agreement will be put in writing and the parties will sign it.
            (4) The settlement shall not affect the operation of any other enforcement effort of Treasury, including compliance reviews and investigation of other complaints that may involve the recipient.

            (b) Formal investigation. If Treasury cannot resolve the complaint through informal investigation, it will begin to develop formal findings through further investigation of the complaint. If the investigation indicates a violation of these regulations, Treasury will attempt to obtain voluntary compliance. If Treasury cannot obtain voluntary compliance, it will begin enforcement as described in § 23.46

            (b) Treasury will limit any termination under paragraph (a)(1) of this section to the particular recipient and particular program or activity or part of such program or activity Treasury finds in violation of these regulations. Treasury will not base any part of a termination on a finding with respect to any program or activity of the recipient that does not receive Federal financial assistance from Treasury.
            (c) Treasury will take no action under paragraph (a) of this section until:
            (1) The Secretary has advised the recipient of its failure to comply with theAct and these regulations and has determined that voluntary compliance cannot be obtained.
            (2) Thirty days have elapsed after the Secretary has sent a written report of the circumstances and grounds of the action to the committees of Congress having legislative jurisdiction over the Federal program or activity involved.

            (d) Treasury also may defer granting new Federal financial assistance to a recipient when a hearing under paragraph (a)(1) of this section is initiated.
            (1) New Federal financial assistance from Treasury includes all assistance for which Treasury requires an application or approval, including renewal or continuation of existing activities, or authorization of new activities, during the deferral period. New Federal financial assistance from Treasury does not include increases in funding as a result of changed computation of formula awards or assistance approved prior to the beginning of a hearing under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
            (2) Treasury will not begin a deferral until the recipient has received a notice of an opportunity for a hearing under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Treasury will not continue a deferral for more than 60 days unless a hearing has begun within that time or the time for beginning the hearing has been extended by mutual consent of the recipient and the Secretary. Treasury will not continue a deferral for more than 30 days after the close of the hearing, unless the hearing results in a finding against the recipient.
            (3) Treasury will limit any deferral to the particular recipient and particular program or activity or part of such program or activity Treasury finds in violation of these regulations. Treasury will not base any part of a deferral on a finding with respect to any program or activity of the recipient that does not, and would not in connection with the new funds, receive Federal financial assistance from Treasury.

            Loan provisions.
            (a) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, the principal and interest payment schedule and maturity of the Private Loan must be the same as the payment schedules and maturities of the Eligible FMS Loans or Eligible FMS Advances, as the case may be, which the Borrower has selected to prepay with the proceeds of the Private Loan.
            (b) Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, an Eligible Private Lender that proposes to make a Private Loan, the proceeds of which will be used to prepay Eligible FMS Loans or Eligible FMS Advances, as the case may be, having differing payment structures and maturities, may:
            (1) Consolidate the differing payment structures of the Eligible FMS Loans or the Eligible FMS Advances, as the case may be, into a single payment structure which complies with the following criteria:
            (i) The Private Loan shall have one set of semi-annual payment dates;
            (ii) Interest on and principal of the Private Loan shall be payable semi-annually; and
            (iii) The amount of principal to be paid each year on account of the Private Loan shall be equal (rounded to the nearest $1,000.00 if desired, except for the final payment) to the aggregate amount of principal that is scheduled to be paid in such year on account of the respective Eligible FMS Loans or Eligible FMS Advances; or
            (2) Consolidate the differing payment structures and maturities of the Eligible FMS Loans or the Eligible FMS Advances, as the case may be, into a single payment structure and maturity complying with the following criteria:
            (i) The final maturity date of the Private Loan shall be the approximate weighted average of the final maturity dates of the Eligible FMS Loans or the Eligible FMS Advances with respect to which the Borrower has selected to prepay amounts thereof permitted by this part to be prepaid;
            (ii) The initial principal payment date of the Private Loan shall occur no later than the earliest scheduled principal payment date of the Eligible FMS Loans or the Eligible FMS Advances with respect to which the Borrower has selected to prepay amounts thereof permitted by this part to be prepaid;
            (iii) The Private Loan shall have one set of semi-annual payment dates;
            (iv) Interest on the Private Loan shall be payable semi-annually; and

            § 25.402

            Each Private Loan Note, with the Guaranty attached, shall be fully and freely transferable to any Permitted Guaranty Holder.
          
          
            § 25.403
            Registration.
            The Guaranty shall cease to be effective with respect to the Private Loan or any Private Loan Portion or any Derivative to the extent that the Private Loan or the respective Private Loan Portion or the respective Derivative, as the case may be, is used to provide significant support for a Non-Registered Obligation.
          
          
            
            § 25.404
            Non-separability.
            (a) The Guaranty shall cease to be effective with respect to any Guaranteed Loan Amount or any Guaranteed Loan Portion Amount or any Guaranteed-Amount Equivalent to the extent that:
            (1) The Guaranteed Amount or the respective Guaranteed Loan Portion Amount or the respective Guaranteed-Amount Equivalent, as the case may be, is separated at any time from the Unguaranteed Loan Amount or the respective Unguaranteed Loan Portion Amount or the respective Unguaranteed-Amount Equivalent, as the case may be, in any way, directly or through the issuance of any Guaranteed-Amount Equity Derivative or any Guaranteed-Amount Debt Derivative; or
            (2) Any holder of the Private Loan Note or any Private Loan Portion Note or any Derivative, as the case may be, having a claim to payments on the Private Loan receives more than 90 percent of any payment due to such holder from payments made under the Guaranty at any time during the term of the Private Loan.
            (b) Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, if any Guaranteed-Amount Debt Derivative is issued, the Guaranty shall not cease to be effective with respect to any Guaranteed Loan Amount or any Guaranteed Loan Portion Amount or any Guaranteed-Amount Equivalent, as the case may be, if both of the circumstances described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section.
            (1) A Borrower shall have delivered to the Secretary of the treasury evidence, in form and substance satisfactory to the Secretary of the Treasury, that the Interest Rate Difference will be substantial.
            (i) To be considered, the evidence must meet the following requirements:
            (A) The Borrower must show that the Interest Rate Difference is directly attributable to paragraph (a) of this section being applied to the Private Loan, that is, that the Interest Rate Difference will exist even when all other financing terms of the Private Loan, including any collateralization of the Unguaranteed Loan Amount or the respective Unguaranteed Loan Portion Amount or the respective Unguaranteed-Amount Equivalent, as the case may be, are identical;
            (B) When calculating the Interest Rate Difference, the Borrower must assume that the Unguaranteed Loan Amount or the respective Unguaranteed Loan Portion Amount or the respective Unguaranteed-Amount Equivalent, as the case may be, will be collateralized by securities backed by the full faith and credit of the United States, unless the Borrower is legally prohibited from so collateralizing the Unguaranteed Loan Amount or the respective Unguaranteed Loan Portion Amount or the respective Unguaranteed-Amount Equivalent, as the case may be, or the Borrower has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the Treasury that the Borrower is unable to so collateralize the Unguaranteed Loan Amount or the respective Unguaranteed Loan Portion Amount or the respective Unguaranteed-Amount Equivalent;
            (C) If the Borrower is legally prohibited from collateralizing the Unguaranteed Loan Amount or the respective Loan Guaranteed Portion Amount or the respective Unguaranteed-Amount Equivalent, as the case may be, with securities backed by the full faith and credit of the United States or has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the Treasury that the Borrower is unable to so collateralize the Unguaranteed Loan Amount or the respective Unguaranteed Loan Portion Amount or the respective Unguaranteed-Amount Equivalent, as the case may be, then the Borrower may calculate the Interest Rate Difference using whatever collateralization assumptions the Borrower elects;

            (D) If the Borrower delivers evidence to the Secretary of the Treasury respecting the Interest Rate Difference, which evidence assumes either that the Unguaranteed Loan Amount or the respective Unguaranteed Loan Portion Amount or the respective Unguaranteed-Amount Equivalent, as the case may be, will not be collateralized at all or that the Unguaranteed Loan Amount or the respective Unguaranteed Loan Portion Amount or the respective Unguaranteed-Amount Equivalent, as the case may be, will be collateralized, but not by securities backed by the full faith and credit of the United States, then the Borrower must also deliver to the Secretary of the Treasury the written agreement of the Borrower, which agreement shall be in form and substance satisfactory to the Secretary of the Treasury, that the Borrower will not collateralize the Unguaranteed Loan Amount or the respective Unguaranteed Loan Portion Amount or the respective Unguaranteed-Amount Equivalent, as the case may be, at any time during the term of the Private Loan in any way different from the assumptions used in calculating the Interest Rate Difference; and
            (E) The Borrower must deliver to the Secretary of the Treasury the evidence pertaining to the Interest Rate Difference at the time that the Borrower submits to DSAA its plan for prepayment, if any, if no plan of prepayment is submitted, then no later than 10 days prior to the time that the Borrower submits to DSAA its prepayment application.
            (ii) If the Secretary of the Treasury determines that the evidence submitted by the Borrower pertaining to the Interest Rate Difference is satisfactory in form and in substance, and that the Interest Rate Difference is substantial, a modified version of the Guaranty (deleting therefrom the provision that the Guaranty shall cease to be effective if any Guaranteed-Amount Debt Derivative is issued) will be attached to the Private Loan Note or the Private Loan Portion Notes, as the case may be.
            (2) The Secretary of the Treasury shall have determined, in the sole discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury, that the respective Borrower's loan prepayment at par pursuant to subsection (a) of the Act through the issuance of any Guaranteed-Amount Debt Derivative is necessary to achieve the international economic policy interests of the United States.
          
          
            § 25.405
            Form of guaranty.

            (a) The Guaranty that will be attached to the Private Loan Note on the Closing Date shall be in the following form (except that the bracketed words shall be deleted if the conditions specified in § 25.404(b) shall have occurred):
            
            
              For Value Received, the Defense Security Assistance Agency of the Department of Defense (“DSAA”), hereby guarantees to (Name of Lender) (“Lender”), incorporated under the laws of (U.S. State or other U.S. jurisdiction) or if not so incorporated or organized, then the principal place of doing business is (U.S. location, address, and zip code), under the authority of Section 24 of the Arms Export Control Act, as amended (“Act”), the due and punctual payment of ninety percent (90%) of amounts due: (1) on the promissory note (“Note”) in the principal amount of up to $___ dated ___ issued to the Lender by the Government of (Name of Borrower) (“Borrower”) pursuant to the Loan Agreement between the Lender and the Borrower dated the __th day of ___ (“Agreement”); and (2) the Lender from the Borrower pursuant to the Agreement.
              This Guaranty is a guaranty of payment covering all political and credit risks of nonpayment, including any nonpayment arising out of any claim which the Borrower may now or hereafter have against any person, corporation, or other entity (including without limitation, the United States, the Lender, and any supplier of defense items) in connection with any transaction, for any reason whatsoever. This Guaranty shall inure to the benefit of and shall be enforceable by the Lender and any Permitted Guaranty Holder (as hereinafter defined). This Guaranty shall not be impaired by any law, regulation or decree of the Borrower now or hereafter in effect which might in any manner change any of the terms of the Note or Agreement. The obligation of DSAA hereunder shall be binding irrespective of the irregularity, invalidity or unenforceability under any laws, regulations or decrees of the Borrower of the Note, the Agreement or other instruments related thereto.
              DSAA hereby waives diligence, demand, protest, presentment and any requirement that the Lender exhaust any right or power to take any action against the Borrower and any notice of any kind whatsoever other than the demand for payment required to be given to DSAA hereunder in the event of default on a payment due under the Note.

              In the event of failure of the Borrower to make payment, when and as due, of any installment of principal or interest under the Note, the DSAA shall make payment immediately to the Lender upon demand to the DSAA after the Borrower's failure to pay has continued for 10 calendar days. The amount payable under this Guaranty shall be ninety percent (90%) of the amount of the overdue installment of principal and interest, plus ninety percent (90%) of any and all late charges and interest thereon as provided in the Agreement. Upon payment by DSAA to the Lender, the Lender will assign to DSAA, without recourse or warranty, ninety percent (90%) of all of its rights in the Note and the Agreement with respect to such payment.
              In the event of a default under the Agreement or the Note by the Borrower and so long as this Guaranty is in effect and the DSAA is not in default hereunder:
              (i) The Lender or other Permitted Guaranty Holder shall not accelerate or reschedule payment of the principal or interest on the Note or any other note of the Borrower guaranteed by DSAA except with the written approval of DSAA; and
              (ii) The Lender or other Permitted Guaranty Holder shall, if so directed by DSAA, invoke the default provisions of the Agreement.
              Subject to the limitations set forth below, the Lender's rights under this Guaranty may be assigned to any “Permitted Guaranty Holder,” that is: (1) An individual domiciled in the United States; (2) a corporation incorporated, chartered or otherwise organized in the United States; or (3) a partnership or other juridical entity doing business in the United States. In the event of such assignment DSAA shall be promptly notified. The Lender will not agree to any material amendment of the Agreement or Note or consent to any material deviation from the provisions thereof without the prior written consent of DSAA.
              Permitted Guaranty Holders shall be severally bound by, and shall be severally entitled to, the rights and obligations of the Lender under the Note, the Agreement, and this Guaranty. The Lender shall maintain a current, accurate written record of the names, addresses, amount of financial interest in the Note and Agreement, and date of acquisition of such interest of each Permitted Guaranty Holder and shall furnish DSAA a copy of such record on its demand without charge. No assignment by the Lender or by any Permitted Guaranty Holder shall be effective for purposes of this Guaranty unless and until so recorded by the Lender.
              The total amount of this Guaranty shall not at any time exceed ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding principal, unpaid accrued interest and arrearages, if any, under the Agreement and the Note, including any portion of the Note, or any derivative of the Note or any portion of the Note.
              This Guaranty shall cease to be effective with respect to the guaranteed amount of the total amount of the Note (the “Guaranteed Loan Amount”) or with respect to the guaranteed amount of any portion of the Note (the “Guaranteed Loan Portion Amount”) [or with respect to the amount of any derivative or derivatives of the Note or any portion of the Note equal, or in the aggregate equal, in principal amount to the total amount of the Note or such portion of the Note, as the case may be, which amount of such derivative or derivatives is equal to the respective Guaranteed Loan Amount or Guaranteed Loan Portion Amount, as the case may be (the “Guaranteed-Amount Equivalent”)] to the extent that (1) the Guaranteed Loan Amount or the respective Guaranteed Loan Portion Amount [or the respective Guaranteed-Amount Equivalent], as the case may be, is at any time separated from the unguaranteed amount of the total amount of the Note or the unguaranteed amount of the respective portion of the Note [or the amount of such derivative or derivatives of the Note which is not the amount which is equal to the Guaranteed Loan Amount or Guaranteed Loan Portion Amount, as the case may be], in any way, (a) directly, or (b) through the issuance of participation shares of, or undivided ownership or other equity interests in, the Note, or any portion of the Note, or any derivative of the Note or any portion of the Note, which have an exclusive or preferred claim to the Guaranteed Loan Amount or the respective Guaranteed Loan Portion Amount [or the respective Guaranteed-Amount Equivalent], as the case may be [or (c) through the issuance of notes, bonds or other debt instruments or obligations which are collateralized or otherwise secured by a pledge of, or security interest in, the Note, or any portion of the Note or any derivative of the Note or any portion of the Note, which has an exclusive or preferred claim to the Guaranteed Loan Amount or the respective Guaranteed Loan Portion Amount or the respective Guaranteed-Amount Equivalent, as the case may be]; or (2) any holder of the Note, or any portion of the Note, or any derivative of the Note or any portion of the Note, as the case may be, having claim to payment made on the Note, receives more than ninety percent of any payment due to such holder from payments made under this Guaranty at any time during the term of the Note or the Agreement.
              This Guaranty is fully and freely transferable to any Permitted Guaranty Holder, except that it shall cease to be effective with respect to the Agreement or the Note, or any portion of the Note, or any derivative of the Note or any portion of the Note, to the extent that the Agreement or the Note, or the respective portion of the Note, or the respective derivative of the Note or any portion of the Note, as the case may be, is used to provide significant support for any non-registered obligation.

              The full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the performance of this Guaranty. No claim which the United States may now or hereafter have against the Lender or any Permitted Guaranty Holder for any reason whatsoever shall affect in any way the right of the Lender or any Permitted Guaranty Holder to receive full and prompt payment of any amount otherwise due under this Guaranty. The United States represents and warrants that (a) it has full power, authority and legal right to execute, deliver and perform this Guaranty, (b) this Guaranty has been executed in accordance with and pursuant to the terms and provisions of section 24 of the Act, the provisions of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1988, under the hearing “Foreign Military Sales Debt Reform,” and title 31, part 25, of the Code of Federal Regulations, (c) this Guaranty has been duly executed and delivered by a duly authorized representative of DSAA, and (d) this Guaranty constitutes the valid and legally binding obligations of the United States, enforceable in accordance with the terms hereof.
              Any notice, demand, or other communication hereunder shall be deemed to have been given if in writing and actually delivered to the Comptroller, DSAA, the Pentagon, Washington, DC 20301-2800, or the successor, or such other place as may be designated in writing by the Comptroller, DSAA or the successor thereof.

              By acceptance of the Note, the Lender agrees to the terms and conditions of this Guaranty.
              
              Dated:
              
              By:

            (b) The obligations of DSAA under the Guaranty are expressly limited to those obligations contained in the form of Guaranty set forth in paragraph (a) of this section.

          § 26.1
          Purpose.
          This part prescribes procedures for the environmental review of, and comment by Federal agencies and the public on, proposed projects of multilateral development banks (MDBs).
        
        
          § 26.2
          Availability of project listings.
          (a) The Office of Multilateral Development Banks of the Department of the Treasury (hereinafter “MDB Office”) will ensure that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), the Department of State, the Agency for International Development (AID), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the Bank Information Center (BIC) (which is a private, nongovernmental organization located in Washington, DC), receive copies from each multilateral development bank (MDB) of project listings describing future MDB projects and assigning environmental categories based on the environmental impact of each project. If an MDB has not provided a project listing to one of these entities, these entities may obtain the project listing by contacting the MDB Office, 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20220, (202) 622-0765.
          (b)(1) Members of the public may obtain copies of project listings from the BIC, 2025 Eye Street NW., suite 522, Washington, DC 20006 ((202) 466-8191, not a toll-free call).

          (2) If a copy is not available from the BIC, members of the public may arrange to review and/or copy a project listing by contacting the MDB Office which will make a copy available at the Department of the Treasury Library, 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Washington, DC ((202) 622-0990, not a toll-free call). Members of the public are advised that they must make an appointment with the Treasury Library before they visit and that a charge (currently 15 cents per page) is imposed for the use of the library photocopier.
        
        
          § 26.3
          Availability of Environmental Impact Assessment Summaries (EIA Summaries) and Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs).
          (a) EIA summaries. (1) The MDB Office will provide for the distribution of EIA Summaries to the entities identified in section 26.2(a).
          (2) (i) Members of the public may obtain copies of EIA Summaries from the BIC, 2025 Eye Street, NW., suite 522, Washington, DC 20006 ((202) 466-8191, not a toll-free call).
          (ii) If a copy of an EIA Summary is not available from the BIC, members of the public may arrange to review and/or copy an EIA Summary by contacting the MDB Office at (202) 622-0765 (not a toll-free call), which will make a copy available at the Department of the Treasury Library, 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Washingon, DC. Members of the public are advised that they must make an appointment with the Treasury Library (202) 622-0990) before they visit, and that a charge (currently 15 cents per page) is imposed for the use of the library photocopier. To the extent possible, EIA Summaries will be available for review and copying at least 120 days before scheduled consideration of a project by the MDB Executive Directors.
          (b) EIAs—(1) The African Development Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the Asian Development Bank. Arrangements to review an EIA may be made by contacting the MDB Office ((202) 622-0765 (not a toll-free call)), which will obtain a copy of the EIA through the Office of the United States Executive Director of the appropriate MDB and make it available for review and copying in the Department of the Treasury Library. Members of the public are advised that they must make an appointment with the Treasury Library, ((202) 622-0900 (not a toll-free call), before they visit, and that a charge (currently 15 cents per page) is imposed for the use of the library photocopier.
          (2) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Development Association, and the Inter-American Development Bank. (i) Members of the public may review EIAs at the public reading room of the concerned MDB.
          (ii) If a particular MDB does not have a public reading room, members of the public may arrange to review and/or copy an EIA by contacting the MDB Office ((202) 622-0765 (not a toll-free call)), which will obtain a copy through the Office of the United States Executive Director of the concerned MDB and make it available in the Department of the Treasury Library, 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Washington, DC.

          § 26.4
          Comments on MDB projects.
          (a) Public comments—(1) Written comments (i) A member of the public wishing to provide written comments on a MDB project must provide 2 copies of the comments to the Office of Multilateral Development Banks, U.S. Department of the Treasury, 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue NW., room 5400, Washington, DC 20220. Written comments should be submitted not later than two weeks after the member of the public has access to the particular document on which it wishes to offer comments—either the project listing, the EIA Summary, or the EIA for a particular project. Written public comments will be provided by the MDB Office to the U.S. Government agencies participating in meetings of the Working Group for Multilateral Assistance (WGMA), which meetings are described in § 26.4(c). The WGMA is an intergovernmental subcommittee of the Development Coordination Committee whose functions are set forth in the Presidential announcement of May 19, 1978, Vol. 14, No. 20, p. 932 of the Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents. The WGMA meets to discuss the U.S. position on upcoming MDB projects.
          
          (ii) All written comments will be available for inspection and copying in their entirety in the Department of the Treasury Library, 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Washington, DC ((202) 622-0990). Members of the public are advised that they must make an appointment with the Treasury Library before they visit, and that a charge (currently 15 cents per page) is imposed for the use of the library photocopier.
          (2) Oral comments. Oral comments from a member of the public may be made in periodic meetings convened by the BIC. Information concerning these meetings may be obtained by contacting the BIC or the MDB Office. The MDB Office will summarize and present such comments in the WGMA meetings described in § 26.4(c).
          (b) U.S. agency comments. Comments from U.S. agencies shall be provided through the WGMA.
          (c) Consideration of comments. The WGMA will consider all comments made by the public and U.S. agencies. The WGMA may review a project up to three times. The first review will consider whether the project has been assigned the appropriate environmental category by the MDB. This review will take place as far in advance as possible of Board consideration of the project. The second review will consider the EIA Summary or the EIA (or information discussed in § 26.5(b)(1)), and comments received from the public on such documentation. The third WGMA review, which will take place shortly before Board consideration of the project, will consider the position of the U.S. Government on the project.
        
        
          § 26.5
          Upgrades and additional environmental information.
          (a) Environmental category upgrades. If the WGMA and the Department of the Treasury determine that a project would have a significant impact on the human environment, but that the level of environmental analysis planned by the MDB is insufficient, the Department of the Treasury will instruct the United States Executive Director of the concerned MDB to request that the MDB upgrade the project to an environmental category requiring additional environmental analysis. Members of the public may call the MDB Office to inquire about upgrade requests for specific projects.
          (b) Additional environmental information. (1) If the WGMA and the Department of the Treasury determine on the basis of the first WGMA review that:
          (i) A MDB project would have a significant impact on the human environment, and
          (ii) The MDB appears to have made an appropriate decision that such project merits environmental analysis, but less than a full-fledged environmental impact assessment as defined by that MDB's own procedures, the Department of the Treasury will obtain, through the United States Executive Director of the concerned MDB, such environmental information from the MDB (e.g., environmental chapters from project feasibility studies or environmental data sheets) which contains this environmental analysis. The MDB Office will provide this environmental information to the entities described in § 26.2(a).
          (2) If such environmental information is insufficient to provide an adequate basis for analyzing the environmental impact of the proposed project and alternatives to the proposed project, the Department of the Treasury will instruct the United States Executive Director of the concerned MDB not to vote in favor of the project.

          § 27.6
          Written response.
          (a)(1) A person served with an Initial Notice of Assessment may make a written response explaining why the civil penalty should not be imposed, explaining why a civil monetary penalty should be in a lesser amount than proposed and/or explaining why the terms of a proposed civil or equitable remedy should be modified. The written response must provide:
          (i) A reference to and specifically identify the Initial Notice of Assessment involved;
          (ii) The full name of the person charged;
          (iii) If not a natural person, the name and title of the head of the organization charged; and
          (iv) If a representative of the person charged is filing the written response, a copy of the duly executed designation as representative.
          (2) The written response must admit or deny each violation of § 27.3 charged in the Initial Notice of Assessment. Any charge not specifically denied will be presumed to be admitted. Where a charge is denied, the respondent shall specifically set forth the legal or factual basis upon which the charge is denied. If the basis of the written response is that the person charged is not the person responsible for the misuse(s) charged, the written response must set forth sufficient information to allow the agency to determine the truth of such an assertion. The written response should include any and all documents and/or other information that the respondent believes should be a part of the administrative record on the matter.
          (b) Time. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, any written response made under this paragraph must be received not later than 30 days after the date of the Initial Notice of Assessment.
          (2) If a request for documents or other evidence is made pursuant to § 27.5(d)(4), the written response must be received not later than 20 days after the date of the Department's response to the request.

          (3)(i) In computing the number of days allowed for filing a written response under this paragraph, the first day counted is the day after the date of the Initial Notice of Assessment. If the last date on which the response is required to be filed by this paragraph is a Saturday, Sunday or Federal holiday, the response will be due on the next weekday after that date.
          (ii) If a response is transmitted by United States mail, it will be deemed timely filed if postmarked on or before the due date.
          (4) The assessing official may extend the period for making a written response under paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) for good cause shown. Generally, failure to obtain representation in a timely manner will not be considered good cause.
          (c) Filing. A written response will be considered filed on the date received at the address specified in the Initial Notice of Assessment. The response may be sent by personal delivery, United States mail or commercial delivery. At the discretion of the assessing official, filing may be accomplished by facsimile or any other method deemed appropriate.
          (d) The assessing official will fully consider the facts and arguments submitted by the respondent in the written response and any other documents filed pursuant to this paragraph in determining whether to issue a Final Notice of Assessment under § 27.7, the appropriate amount of the civil monetary penalty imposed and the terms of any other appropriate civil or equitable remedy.
        
        
          § 27.7
          Final Notice of Assessment.
          (a) In making a final determination whether to impose a penalty, the assessing official shall take into consideration all available information in the administrative record on the matter, including all information provided in or with a written response timely filed by the respondent and any additional information provided pursuant to § 27.5(e)(2). The assessing official will determine whether:
          (1) The facts warrant a conclusion that no violation has occurred; or
          (2) The facts warrant a conclusion that one or more violations have occurred; and
          (3) The facts and violations found justify the conclusion that a civil penalty should be imposed.
          (b) If the assessing official determines that no violation has occurred, the official shall promptly send a letter indicating that determination to the person served with an Initial Notice of Assessment and to any designated representative of such person.
          (c)(1) If it has been determined that a violation has occurred, the assessing official shall issue a Final Notice of Assessment to the person served with an Initial Notice of Assessment and to any designated representative of such person.
          (2) The assessing official may, in his/her discretion:
          (i) Impose a civil monetary penalty and/or any civil or equitable remedy deemed necessary to rectify the potential for a continued misuse or harm from the violation(s);
          (ii) Not impose a civil monetary penalty and/or civil or equitable remedy; or
          (iii) Impose a civil monetary penalty and/or civil or equitable remedy and condition payment of the civil monetary penalty on the violator's future compliance with 31 U.S.C. 333, this part and any civil or equitable remedy contained in the Final Notice of Assessment. If a civil monetary penalty is imposed, the assessing official shall determine the appropriate amount of the penalty in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 333(c)(2).
          (3) The Final Notice of Assessment shall:
          (i) Include:
          (A) A specific reference to the provisions of § 27.3 found to have been violated;
          (B) A concise statement of the facts warranting a conclusion that a violations has occurred;
          (C) An analysis of how the facts and violation(s) justify the conclusion that a civil monetary penalty and/or civil or equitable remedy should be imposed; and
          (D) The amount of each civil monetary penalty imposed, a statement as to how the amount of each penalty was determined, and the terms of any civil or equitable remedy deemed necessary to rectify the potential for a continued misuse or harm from the violation(s); and
          (ii) Inform the person that:
          
          (A) Payment of a civil monetary penalty imposed by the Final Notice of Assessment must be made within 30 days of the date of the notice, and that any civil or equitable remedy imposed must be complied with as provided in the Final Notice of Assessment;
          (B) Payment of a civil monetary penalty imposed by the Final Notice of Assessment shall be by EFT in accordance with instructions provided in the notice, unless the assessing official has given written approval to have payment made by other means;
          (C) payment of a civil monetary penalty imposed by the Final Notice of Assessment constitutes consent by the person to comply with the terms of any civil or equitable remedy contained in the notice;
          (D) If payment of a civil monetary penalty imposed by the Final Notice of Assessment has been waived on the condition that the person comply with the terms of any civil or equitable remedy contained in the notice or comply in the future with 31 U.S.C. 333 and this part, failure by the person to so comply will make the civil monetary penalty payable on demand;

            § 28.110
            Remedial and affirmative action and self-evaluation.
            (a) Remedial action. If the designated agency official finds that a recipient has discriminated against persons on the basis of sex in an education program or activity, such recipient shall take such remedial action as the designated agency official deems necessary to overcome the effects of such discrimination.
            (b) Affirmative action. In the absence of a finding of discrimination on the basis of sex in an education program or activity, a recipient may take affirmative action consistent with law to overcome the effects of conditions that resulted in limited participation therein by persons of a particular sex.

            (3) Take appropriate remedial steps to eliminate the effects of any discrimination that resulted or may have resulted from adherence to these policies and practices.
            (d) Availability of self-evaluation and related materials. Recipients shall maintain on file for at least three years following completion of the evaluation required under paragraph (c) of this section, and shall provide to the designated agency official upon request, a description of any modifications made pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section and of any remedial steps taken pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
          
          
            § 28.115
            Assurance required.
            (a) General. Either at the application stage or the award stage, Federal agencies must ensure that applications for Federal financial assistance or awards of Federal financial assistance contain, be accompanied by, or be covered by a specifically identified assurance from the applicant or recipient, satisfactory to the designated agency official, that each education program or activity operated by the applicant or recipient and to which these Title IX regulations apply will be operated in compliance with these Title IX regulations. An assurance of compliance with these Title IX regulations shall not be satisfactory to the designated agency official if the applicant or recipient to whom such assurance applies fails to commit itself to take whatever remedial action is necessary in accordance with § 28.110(a) to eliminate existing discrimination on the basis of sex or to eliminate the effects of past discrimination whether occurring prior to or subsequent to the submission to the designated agency official of such assurance.
            (b) Duration of obligation. (1) In the case of Federal financial assistance extended to provide real property or structures thereon, such assurance shall obligate the recipient or, in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period during which the real property or structures are used to provide an education program or activity.
            (2) In the case of Federal financial assistance extended to provide personal property, such assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which it retains ownership or possession of the property.

            (3) In all other cases such assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which Federal financial assistance is extended.
            
            (c) Form. (1) The assurances required by paragraph (a) of this section, which may be included as part of a document that addresses other assurances or obligations, shall include that the applicant or recipient will comply with all applicable Federal statutes relating to nondiscrimination. These include but are not limited to: Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, as amended (20 U.S.C. 1681-1683, 1685-1688).
            (2) The designated agency official will specify the extent to which such assurances will be required of the applicant's or recipient's subgrantees, contractors, subcontractors, transferees, or successors in interest.
          
          
            § 28.120
            Transfers of property.
            If a recipient sells or otherwise transfers property financed in whole or in part with Federal financial assistance to a transferee that operates any education program or activity, and the Federal share of the fair market value of the property is not upon such sale or transfer properly accounted for to the Federal Government, both the transferor and the transferee shall be deemed to be recipients, subject to the provisions of §§ 28.205 through 28.235(a).
          
          
            § 28.125
            Effect of other requirements.
            (a) Effect of other Federal provisions. The obligations imposed by these Title IX regulations are independent of, and do not alter, obligations not to discriminate on the basis of sex imposed by Executive Order 11246, 3 CFR, 1964-1965 Comp., p. 339; as amended by Executive Order 11375, 3 CFR, 1966-1970 Comp., p. 684; as amended by Executive Order 11478, 3 CFR, 1966-1970 Comp., p. 803; as amended by Executive Order 12087, 3 CFR, 1978 Comp., p. 230; as amended by Executive Order 12107, 3 CFR, 1978 Comp., p. 264; sections 704 and 855 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 295m, 298b-2); Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq.); the Equal Pay Act of 1963 (29 U.S.C. 206); and any other Act of Congress or Federal regulation.
            (b) Effect of State or local law or other requirements. The obligation to comply with these Title IX regulations is not obviated or alleviated by any State or local law or other requirement that would render any applicant or student ineligible, or limit the eligibility of any applicant or student, on the basis of sex, to practice any occupation or profession.
            (c) Effect of rules or regulations of private organizations. The obligation to comply with these Title IX regulations is not obviated or alleviated by any rule or regulation of any organization, club, athletic or other league, or association that would render any applicant or student ineligible to participate or limit the eligibility or participation of any applicant or student, on the basis of sex, in any education program or activity operated by a recipient and that receives Federal financial assistance.
          
          
            § 28.130
            Effect of employment opportunities.
            The obligation to comply with these Title IX regulations is not obviated or alleviated because employment opportunities in any occupation or profession are or may be more limited for members of one sex than for members of the other sex.
          
          
            § 28.135
            Designation of responsible employee and adoption of grievance procedures.
            (a) Designation of responsible employee. Each recipient shall designate at least one employee to coordinate its efforts to comply with and carry out its responsibilities under these Title IX regulations, including any investigation of any complaint communicated to such recipient alleging its noncompliance with these Title IX regulations or alleging any actions that would be prohibited by these Title IX regulations. The recipient shall notify all its students and employees of the name, office address, and telephone number of the employee or employees appointed pursuant to this paragraph.
            (b) Complaint procedure of recipient. A recipient shall adopt and publish grievance procedures providing for prompt and equitable resolution of student and employee complaints alleging any action that would be prohibited by these Title IX regulations.
          
          
            § 28.140
            Dissemination of policy.
            (a) Notification of policy. (1) Each recipient shall implement specific and continuing steps to notify applicants for admission and employment, students and parents of elementary and secondary school students, employees, sources of referral of applicants for admission and employment, and all unions or professional organizations holding collective bargaining or professional agreements with the recipient, that it does not discriminate on the basis of sex in the educational programs or activities that it operates, and that it is required by Title IX and these Title IX regulations not to discriminate in such a manner. Such notification shall contain such information, and be made in such manner, as the designated agency official finds necessary to apprise such persons of the protections against discrimination assured them by Title IX and these Title IX regulations, but shall state at least that the requirement not to discriminate in education programs or activities extends to employment therein, and to admission thereto unless §§ 28.300 through 28.310 do not apply to the recipient, and that inquiries concerning the application of Title IX and these Title IX regulations to such recipient may be referred to the employee designated pursuant to § 28.135, or to the designated agency official.
            (2) Each recipient shall make the initial notification required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section within 90 days of September 29, 2000 or of the date these Title IX regulations first apply to such recipient, whichever comes later, which notification shall include publication in:
            (i) Newspapers and magazines operated by such recipient or by student, alumnae, or alumni groups for or in connection with such recipient; and
            (ii) Memoranda or other written communications distributed to every student and employee of such recipient.

(1) Each recipient shall prominently include a statement of the policy described in paragraph (a) of this section in each announcement, bulletin, catalog, or application form that it makes available to any person of a type, described in paragraph (a) of this section, or which is otherwise used in connection with the recruitment of students or employees.
            (2) A recipient shall not use or distribute a publication of the type described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section that suggests, by text or illustration, that such recipient treats applicants, students, or employees differently on the basis of sex except as such treatment is permitted by these Title IX regulations.

            § 28.225
            Educational institutions eligible to submit transition plans.
            (a) Application. This section applies to each educational institution to which §§ 28.300 through 28.310 apply that:

            (b) Provision for transition plans. An educational institution to which this section applies shall not discriminate on the basis of sex in admission or recruitment in violation of §§ 28.300 through 28.310.

            Transition plans.
            (a) Submission of plans. An institution to which § 28.225 applies and that is composed of more than one administratively separate unit may submit either a single transition plan applicable to all such units, or a separate transition plan applicable to each such unit.
            (b) Content of plans. In order to be approved by the Secretary of Education, a transition plan shall:

            (1) State the name, address, and Federal Interagency Committee on Education Code of the educational institution submitting such plan, the administratively separate units to which the plan is applicable, and the name, address, and telephone number of the person to whom questions concerning the plan may be addressed.

            (2) State whether the educational institution or administratively separate unit admits students of both sexes as regular students and, if so, when it began to do so.
            (3) Identify and describe with respect to the educational institution or administratively separate unit any obstacles to admitting students without discrimination on the basis of sex.
            (4) Describe in detail the steps necessary to eliminate as soon as practicable each obstacle so identified and indicate the schedule for taking these steps and the individual directly responsible for their implementation.

            (c) Nondiscrimination. No policy or practice of a recipient to which § 28.225 applies shall result in treatment of applicants to or students of such recipient in violation of §§ 28.300 through 28.310 unless such treatment is necessitated by an obstacle identified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section and a schedule for eliminating that obstacle has been provided as required by paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
            (d) Effects of past exclusion. To overcome the effects of past exclusion of students on the basis of sex, each educational institution to which § 28.225 applies shall include in its transition plan, and shall implement, specific steps designed to encourage individuals of the previously excluded sex to apply for admission to such institution. Such steps shall include instituting recruitment programs that emphasize the institution's commitment to enrolling students of the sex previously excluded.

            (i) The promotion of any Boys State conference, Boys Nation conference, Girls State conference, or Girls Nation conference; or
            (ii) The selection of students to attend any such conference;
            (3) Father-son or mother-daughter activities at an educational institution or in an education program or activity, but if such activities are provided for students of one sex, opportunities for reasonably comparable activities shall be provided to students of the other sex;
            (4) Any scholarship or other financial assistance awarded by an institution of higher education to an individual because such individual has received such award in a single-sex pageant based upon a combination of factors related to the individual's personal appearance, poise, and talent. The pageant, however, must comply with other nondiscrimination provisions of Federal law.
            (c) Program or activity or program means:
            (1) All of the operations of any entity described in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section, any part of which is extended Federal financial assistance:
            (i)(A) A department, agency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a State or of a local government; or
            (B) The entity of such State or local government that distributes such assistance and each such department or agency (and each other State or local government entity) to which the assistance is extended, in the case of assistance to a State or local government;

            (iii)(A) An entire corporation, partnership, or other private organization, or an entire sole proprietorship—
            
            (1) If assistance is extended to such corporation, partnership, private organization, or sole proprietorship as a whole; or
            (2) Which is principally engaged in the business of providing education, health care, housing, social services, or parks and recreation; or
            (B) The entire plant or other comparable, geographically separate facility to which Federal financial assistance is extended, in the case of any other corporation, partnership, private organization, or sole proprietorship; or
            (iv) Any other entity that is established by two or more of the entities described in paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section.
            (2)(i) Program or activity does not include any operation of an entity that is controlled by a religious organization if the application of 20 U.S.C. 1681 to such operation would not be consistent with the religious tenets of such organization.
            (ii) For example, all of the operations of a college, university, or other postsecondary institution, including but not limited to traditional educational operations, faculty and student housing, campus shuttle bus service, campus restaurants, the bookstore, and other commercial activities are part of a “program or activity” subject to these Title IX regulations if the college, university, or other institution receives Federal financial assistance.
            (d)(1) Nothing in these Title IX regulations shall be construed to require or prohibit any person, or public or private entity, to provide or pay for any benefit or service, including the use of facilities, related to an abortion. Medical procedures, benefits, services, and the use of facilities, necessary to save the life of a pregnant woman or to address complications related to an abortion are not subject to this section.
            (2) Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit a penalty to be imposed on any person or individual because such person or individual is seeking or has received any benefit or service related to a legal abortion. Accordingly, subject to paragraph (d)(1) of this section, no person shall be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any academic, extracurricular, research, occupational training, employment, or other educational program or activity operated by a recipient that receives Federal financial assistance because such individual has sought or received, or is seeking, a legal abortion, or any benefit or service related to a legal abortion.
          
        
        
          Subpart C—Discrimination on the Basis of Sex in Admission and Recruitment Prohibited
          
            § 28.300
            Admission.
            (a) General. No person shall, on the basis of sex, be denied admission, or be subjected to discrimination in admission, by any recipient to which §§ 28.300 through 28.310 apply, except as provided in §§ 28.225 and 28.230.
            (b) Specific prohibitions. (1) In determining whether a person satisfies any policy or criterion for admission, or in making any offer of admission, a recipient to which §§ 28.300 through 28.310 apply shall not:
            (i) Give preference to one person over another on the basis of sex, by ranking applicants separately on such basis, or otherwise;
            (ii) Apply numerical limitations upon the number or proportion of persons of either sex who may be admitted; or
            (iii) Otherwise treat one individual differently from another on the basis of sex.
            (2) A recipient shall not administer or operate any test or other criterion for admission that has a disproportionately adverse effect on persons on the basis of sex unless the use of such test or criterion is shown to predict validly success in the education program or activity in question and alternative tests or criteria that do not have such a disproportionately adverse effect are shown to be unavailable.
            (c) Prohibitions relating to marital or parental status. In determining whether a person satisfies any policy or criterion for admission, or in making any offer of admission, a recipient to which §§ 28.300 through 28.310 apply:

            (1) Shall not apply any rule concerning the actual or potential parental, family, or marital status of a student or applicant that treats persons differently on the basis of sex;
            
            (2) Shall not discriminate against or exclude any person on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, termination of pregnancy, or recovery therefrom, or establish or follow any rule or practice that so discriminates or excludes;
            (3) Subject to § 28.235(d), shall treat disabilities related to pregnancy, childbirth, termination of pregnancy, or recovery therefrom in the same manner and under the same policies as any other temporary disability or physical condition; and
            (4) Shall not make pre-admission inquiry as to the marital status of an applicant for admission, including whether such applicant is “Miss” or “Mrs.” A recipient may make pre-admission inquiry as to the sex of an applicant for admission, but only if such inquiry is made equally of such applicants of both sexes and if the results of such inquiry are not used in connection with discrimination prohibited by these Title IX regulations.
          
          
            § 28.305
            Preference in admission.
            A recipient to which §§ 28.300 through 28.310 apply shall not give preference to applicants for admission, on the basis of attendance at any educational institution or other school or entity that admits as students only or predominantly members of one sex, if the giving of such preference has the effect of discriminating on the basis of sex in violation of §§ 28.300 through 28.310.
          
          
            § 28.310

            (a) Nondiscriminatory recruitment. A recipient to which §§ 28.300 through 28.310 apply shall not discriminate on the basis of sex in the recruitment and admission of students. A recipient may be required to undertake additional recruitment efforts for one sex as remedial action pursuant to § 28.110(a), and may choose to undertake such efforts as affirmative action pursuant to § 28.110(b).
            (b) Recruitment at certain institutions. A recipient to which §§ 28.300 through 28.310 apply shall not recruit primarily or exclusively at educational institutions, schools, or entities that admit as students only or predominantly members of one sex, if such actions have the effect of discriminating on the basis of sex in violation of §§ 28.300 through 28.310.
          
        
        
          Subpart D—Discrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Prohibited

            (a) General. Except as provided elsewhere in these Title IX regulations, no person shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any academic, extracurricular, research, occupational training, or other education program or activity operated by a recipient that receives Federal financial assistance. Sections 28.400 through 28.455 do not apply to actions of a recipient in connection with admission of its students to an education program or activity of a recipient to which §§ 28.300 through 28.310 do not apply, or an entity, not a recipient, to which §§ 28.300 through 28.310 would not apply if the entity were a recipient.
            (b) Specific prohibitions. Except as provided in §§ 28.400 through 28.455, in providing any aid, benefit, or service to a student, a recipient shall not, on the basis of sex:
            (1) Treat one person differently from another in determining whether such person satisfies any requirement or condition for the provision of such aid, benefit, or service;
            (2) Provide different aid, benefits, or services or provide aid, benefits, or services in a different manner;
            (3) Deny any person any such aid, benefit, or service;
            (4) Subject any person to separate or different rules of behavior, sanctions, or other treatment;
            (5) Apply any rule concerning the domicile or residence of a student or applicant, including eligibility for in-state fees and tuition;

            (6) Aid or perpetuate discrimination against any person by providing significant assistance to any agency, organization, or person that discriminates on the basis of sex in providing any aid, benefit, or service to students or employees;
            
            (7) Otherwise limit any person in the enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity.
            (c) Assistance administered by a recipient educational institution to study at a foreign institution. A recipient educational institution may administer or assist in the administration of scholarships, fellowships, or other awards established by foreign or domestic wills, trusts, or similar legal instruments, or by acts of foreign governments and restricted to members of one sex, that are designed to provide opportunities to study abroad, and that are awarded to students who are already matriculating at or who are graduates of the recipient institution; Provided, that a recipient educational institution that administers or assists in the administration of such scholarships, fellowships, or other awards that are restricted to members of one sex provides, or otherwise makes available, reasonable opportunities for similar studies for members of the other sex. Such opportunities may be derived from either domestic or foreign sources.
            (d) Aids, benefits or services not provided by recipient. (1) This paragraph (d) applies to any recipient that requires participation by any applicant, student, or employee in any education program or activity not operated wholly by such recipient, or that facilitates, permits, or considers such participation as part of or equivalent to an education program or activity operated by such recipient, including participation in educational consortia and cooperative employment and student-teaching assignments.
            (2) Such recipient:
            (i) Shall develop and implement a procedure designed to assure itself that the operator or sponsor of such other education program or activity takes no action affecting any applicant, student, or employee of such recipient that these Title IX regulations would prohibit such recipient from taking; and
            (ii) Shall not facilitate, require, permit, or consider such participation if such action occurs.
          
          
            § 28.405
            Housing.
            (a) Generally. A recipient shall not, on the basis of sex, apply different rules or regulations, impose different fees or requirements, or offer different services or benefits related to housing, except as provided in this section (including housing provided only to married students).
            (b) Housing provided by recipient. (1) A recipient may provide separate housing on the basis of sex.

            (ii) Comparable in quality and cost to the student.
            (c) Other housing. (1) A recipient shall not, on the basis of sex, administer different policies or practices concerning occupancy by its students of housing other than that provided by such recipient.
            (2)(i) A recipient which, through solicitation, listing, approval of housing, or otherwise, assists any agency, organization, or person in making housing available to any of its students, shall take such reasonable action as may be necessary to assure itself that such housing as is provided to students of one sex, when compared to that provided to students of the other sex, is as a whole:
            (A) Proportionate in quantity; and
            (B) Comparable in quality and cost to the student.
            (ii) A recipient may render such assistance to any agency, organization, or person that provides all or part of such housing to students of only one sex.
          
          
            § 28.410
            Comparable facilities.
            A recipient may provide separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities on the basis of sex, but such facilities provided for students of one sex shall be comparable to such facilities provided for students of the other sex.
          
          
            § 28.415
            Access to course offerings.

            (a) A recipient shall not provide any course or otherwise carry out any of its education program or activity separately on the basis of sex, or require or refuse participation therein by any of its students on such basis, including health, physical education, industrial, business, vocational, technical, home economics, music, and adult education courses.
            (b)(1) With respect to classes and activities in physical education at the elementary school level, the recipient shall comply fully with this section as expeditiously as possible but in no event later than one year from September 29, 2000. With respect to physical education classes and activities at the secondary and post-secondary levels, the recipient shall comply fully with this section as expeditiously as possible but in no event later than three years from September 29, 2000.

            (4) Where use of a single standard of measuring skill or progress in a physical education class has an adverse effect on members of one sex, the recipient shall use appropriate standards that do not have such effect.
            (5) Portions of classes in elementary and secondary schools, or portions of education programs or activities, that deal exclusively with human sexuality may be conducted in separate sessions for boys and girls.
            (6) Recipients may make requirements based on vocal range or quality that may result in a chorus or choruses of one or predominantly one sex.
          
          
            § 28.420
            Access to schools operated by LEAs.
            A recipient that is a local educational agency shall not, on the basis of sex, exclude any person from admission to:

Recipients shall develop and use internal procedures for ensuring that such materials do not discriminate on the basis of sex. Where the use of a counseling test or other instrument results in a substantially disproportionate number of members of one sex in any particular course of study or classification, the recipient shall take such action as is necessary to assure itself that such disproportion is not the result of discrimination in the instrument or its application.
            (c) Disproportion in classes. Where a recipient finds that a particular class contains a substantially disproportionate number of individuals of one sex, the recipient shall take such action as is necessary to assure itself that such disproportion is not the result of discrimination on the basis of sex in counseling or appraisal materials or by counselors.
          
          
            § 28.430
            Financial assistance.
            (a) General. Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, in providing financial assistance to any of its students, a recipient shall not:

            (1) On the basis of sex, provide different amounts or types of such assistance, limit eligibility for such assistance that is of any particular type or source, apply different criteria, or otherwise discriminate;
            (2) Through solicitation, listing, approval, provision of facilities, or other services, assist any foundation, trust, agency, organization, or person that provides assistance to any of such recipient's students in a manner that discriminates on the basis of sex; or
            (3) Apply any rule or assist in application of any rule concerning eligibility for such assistance that treats persons of one sex differently from persons of the other sex with regard to marital or parental status.
            (b) Financial aid established by certain legal instruments. (1) A recipient may administer or assist in the administration of scholarships, fellowships, or other forms of financial assistance established pursuant to domestic or foreign wills, trusts, bequests, or similar legal instruments or by acts of a foreign government that require that awards be made to members of a particular sex specified therein; Provided, that the overall effect of the award of such sex-restricted scholarships, fellowships, and other forms of financial assistance does not discriminate on the basis of sex.
            (2) To ensure nondiscriminatory awards of assistance as required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, recipients shall develop and use procedures under which:
            (i) Students are selected for award of financial assistance on the basis of nondiscriminatory criteria and not on the basis of availability of funds restricted to members of a particular sex;
            (ii) An appropriate sex-restricted scholarship, fellowship, or other form of financial assistance is allocated to each student selected under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section; and
            (iii) No student is denied the award for which he or she was selected under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section because of the absence of a scholarship, fellowship, or other form of financial assistance designated for a member of that student's sex.
            (c) Athletic scholarships. (1) To the extent that a recipient awards athletic scholarships or grants-in-aid, it must provide reasonable opportunities for such awards for members of each sex in proportion to the number of students of each sex participating in interscholastic or intercollegiate athletics.
            (2) A recipient may provide separate athletic scholarships or grants-in-aid for members of each sex as part of separate athletic teams for members of each sex to the extent consistent with this paragraph (c) and § 28.450.
          
          
            § 28.435
            Employment assistance to students.
            (a) Assistance by recipient in making available outside employment. A recipient that assists any agency, organization, or person in making employment available to any of its students:
            (1) Shall assure itself that such employment is made available without discrimination on the basis of sex; and
            (2) Shall not render such services to any agency, organization, or person that discriminates on the basis of sex in its employment practices.
            (b) Employment of students by recipients. A recipient that employs any of its students shall not do so in a manner that violates §§ 28.500 through 28.550.
          
          
            § 28.440
            Health and insurance benefits and services.
            Subject to § 28.235(d), in providing a medical, hospital, accident, or life insurance benefit, service, policy, or plan to any of its students, a recipient shall not discriminate on the basis of sex, or provide such benefit, service, policy, or plan in a manner that would violate §§ 28.500 through 28.550 if it were provided to employees of the recipient. This section shall not prohibit a recipient from providing any benefit or service that may be used by a different proportion of students of one sex than of the other, including family planning services. However, any recipient that provides full coverage health service shall provide gynecological care.
          
          
            § 28.445
            Marital or parental status.
            (a) Status generally. A recipient shall not apply any rule concerning a student's actual or potential parental, family, or marital status that treats students differently on the basis of sex.
            (b) Pregnancy and related conditions. (1) A recipient shall not discriminate against any student, or exclude any student from its education program or activity, including any class or extracurricular activity, on the basis of such student's pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, or recovery therefrom, unless the student requests voluntarily to participate in a separate portion of the program or activity of the recipient.
            (2) A recipient may require such a student to obtain the certification of a physician that the student is physically and emotionally able to continue participation as long as such a certification is required of all students for other physical or emotional conditions requiring the attention of a physician.
            (3) A recipient that operates a portion of its education program or activity separately for pregnant students, admittance to which is completely voluntary on the part of the student as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, shall ensure that the separate portion is comparable to that offered to non-pregnant students.
            (4) Subject to § 28.235(d), a recipient shall treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy and recovery therefrom in the same manner and under the same policies as any other temporary disability with respect to any medical or hospital benefit, service, plan, or policy that such recipient administers, operates, offers, or participates in with respect to students admitted to the recipient's educational program or activity.
            (5) In the case of a recipient that does not maintain a leave policy for its students, or in the case of a student who does not otherwise qualify for leave under such a policy, a recipient shall treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, and recovery therefrom as a justification for a leave of absence for as long a period of time as is deemed medically necessary by the student's physician, at the conclusion of which the student shall be reinstated to the status that she held when the leave began.
          
          
            § 28.450
            Athletics.
            (a) General. No person shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, be treated differently from another person, or otherwise be discriminated against in any interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics offered by a recipient, and no recipient shall provide any such athletics separately on such basis.
            (b) Separate teams. Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, a recipient may operate or sponsor separate teams for members of each sex where selection for such teams is based upon competitive skill or the activity involved is a contact sport. However, where a recipient operates or sponsors a team in a particular sport for members of one sex but operates or sponsors no such team for members of the other sex, and athletic opportunities for members of that sex have previously been limited, members of the excluded sex must be allowed to try out for the team offered unless the sport involved is a contact sport. For the purposes of these Title IX regulations, contact sports include boxing, wrestling, rugby, ice hockey, football, basketball, and other sports the purpose or major activity of which involves bodily contact.
            (c) Equal opportunity. (1) A recipient that operates or sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics shall provide equal athletic opportunity for members of both sexes. In determining whether equal opportunities are available, the designated agency official will consider, among other factors:
            (i) Whether the selection of sports and levels of competition effectively accommodate the interests and abilities of members of both sexes;
            (ii) The provision of equipment and supplies;
            (iii) Scheduling of games and practice time;
            (iv) Travel and per diem allowance;
            (v) Opportunity to receive coaching and academic tutoring;
            (vi) Assignment and compensation of coaches and tutors;
            (vii) Provision of locker rooms, practice, and competitive facilities;
            (viii) Provision of medical and training facilities and services;
            (ix) Provision of housing and dining facilities and services;
            (x) Publicity.
            
            (2) For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, unequal aggregate expenditures for members of each sex or unequal expenditures for male and female teams if a recipient operates or sponsors separate teams will not constitute noncompliance with this section, but the designated agency official may consider the failure to provide necessary funds for teams for one sex in assessing equality of opportunity for members of each sex.
            (d) Adjustment period. A recipient that operates or sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics at the elementary school level shall comply fully with this section as expeditiously as possible but in no event later than one year from September 29, 2000. A recipient that operates or sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics at the secondary or postsecondary school level shall comply fully with this section as expeditiously as possible but in no event later than three years from September 29, 2000.
          
          
            § 28.455
            Textbooks and curricular material.
            Nothing in these Title IX regulations shall be interpreted as requiring or prohibiting or abridging in any way the use of particular textbooks or curricular materials.
          
        
        
          Subpart E—Discrimination on the Basis of Sex in Employment in Education Programs or Activities Prohibited

            (a) General. (1) No person shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination in employment, or recruitment, consideration, or selection therefor, whether full-time or part-time, under any education program or activity operated by a recipient that receives Federal financial assistance.
            (2) A recipient shall make all employment decisions in any education program or activity operated by such recipient in a nondiscriminatory manner and shall not limit, segregate, or classify applicants or employees in any way that could adversely affect any applicant's or employee's employment opportunities or status because of sex.
            (3) A recipient shall not enter into any contractual or other relationship which directly or indirectly has the effect of subjecting employees or students to discrimination prohibited by §§ 28.500 through 28.550, including relationships with employment and referral agencies, with labor unions, and with organizations providing or administering fringe benefits to employees of the recipient.
            (4) A recipient shall not grant preferences to applicants for employment on the basis of attendance at any educational institution or entity that admits as students only or predominantly members of one sex, if the giving of such preferences has the effect of discriminating on the basis of sex in violation of these Title IX regulations.
            (b) Application. The provisions of §§ 28.500 through 28.550 apply to:
            (1) Recruitment, advertising, and the process of application for employment;

            Employment criteria.

            (b) Alternative tests or criteria for such purpose, which do not have such disproportionately adverse effect, are shown to be unavailable.

            Recruitment.
            (a) Nondiscriminatory recruitment and hiring. A recipient shall not discriminate on the basis of sex in the recruitment and hiring of employees. Where a recipient has been found to be presently discriminating on the basis of sex in the recruitment or hiring of employees, or has been found to have so discriminated in the past, the recipient shall recruit members of the sex so discriminated against so as to overcome the effects of such past or present discrimination.
            (b) Recruitment patterns. A recipient shall not recruit primarily or exclusively at entities that furnish as applicants only or predominantly members of one sex if such actions have the effect of discriminating on the basis of sex in violation of §§ 28.500 through 28.550.
          
          
            § 28.515
            Compensation.
            A recipient shall not make or enforce any policy or practice that, on the basis of sex:
            (a) Makes distinctions in rates of pay or other compensation;
            (b) Results in the payment of wages to employees of one sex at a rate less than that paid to employees of the opposite sex for equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and that are performed under similar working conditions.
          
          
            § 28.520

            § 28.525
            Fringe benefits.
            (a) “Fringe benefits” defined.

            § 28.530
            Marital or parental status.
            (a) General. A recipient shall not apply any policy or take any employment action:

            (1) Concerning the potential marital, parental, or family status of an employee or applicant for employment that treats persons differently on the basis of sex; or
            
            (2) Which is based upon whether an employee or applicant for employment is the head of household or principal wage earner in such employee's or applicant's family unit.
            (b) Pregnancy. A recipient shall not discriminate against or exclude from employment any employee or applicant for employment on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, or recovery therefrom.
            (c) Pregnancy as a temporary disability.

            (d) Pregnancy leave. In the case of a recipient that does not maintain a leave policy for its employees, or in the case of an employee with insufficient leave or accrued employment time to qualify for leave under such a policy, a recipient shall treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, and recovery therefrom as a justification for a leave of absence without pay for a reasonable period of time, at the conclusion of which the employee shall be reinstated to the status that she held when the leave began or to a comparable position, without decrease in rate of compensation or loss of promotional opportunities, or any other right or privilege of employment.
          
          
            § 28.535
            Effect of state or local law or other requirements.
            (a) Prohibitory requirements. The obligation to comply with §§ 28.500 through 28.550 is not obviated or alleviated by the existence of any State or local law or other requirement that imposes prohibitions or limits upon employment of members of one sex that are not imposed upon members of the other sex.
            (b) Benefits. A recipient that provides any compensation, service, or benefit to members of one sex pursuant to a State or local law or other requirement shall provide the same compensation, service, or benefit to members of the other sex.
          
          
            § 28.540

            § 28.550
            Sex as a bona fide occupational qualification.
            A recipient may take action otherwise prohibited by §§ 28.500 through 28.550 provided it is shown that sex is a bona fide occupational qualification for that action, such that consideration of sex with regard to such action is essential to successful operation of the employment function concerned. A recipient shall not take action pursuant to this section that is based upon alleged comparative employment characteristics or stereotyped characterizations of one or the other sex, or upon preference based on sex of the recipient, employees, students, or other persons, but nothing contained in this section shall prevent a recipient from considering an employee's sex in relation to employment in a locker room or toilet facility used only by members of one sex.

            (a) Cooperation and assistance. The designated agency official shall to the fullest extent practicable seek the cooperation of recipients in obtaining compliance with these Title IX regulations and shall provide assistance and guidance to recipients to help them comply voluntarily with these Title IX regulations.
            (b) Compliance reports. Each recipient shall keep such records and submit to the designated agency official (or designee) timely, complete, and accurate compliance reports at such times, and in such form and containing such information, as the designated agency official (or designee) may determine to be necessary to enable the official to ascertain whether the recipient has complied or is complying with these Title IX regulations. In the case of any program under which a primary recipient extends Federal financial assistance to any other recipient, such other recipient shall also submit such compliance reports to the primary recipient as may be necessary to enable the primary recipient to carry out its obligations under these Title IX regulations.
            (c) Access to sources of information. Each recipient shall permit access by the designated agency official (or designee) during normal business hours to such of its books, records, accounts, and other sources of information, and its facilities as may be pertinent to ascertain compliance with these Title IX regulations. Where any information required of a recipient is in the exclusive possession of any other agency, institution or person and this agency, institution or person shall fail or refuse to furnish this information the recipient shall so certify in its report and shall set forth what efforts it has made to obtain the information. Asserted considerations of privacy or confidentiality may not operate to bar the Department from evaluating or seeking to enforce compliance with these Title IX regulations. Information of a confidential nature obtained in connection with compliance evaluation or enforcement shall not be disclosed except where necessary in formal enforcement proceedings or where otherwise required by law.
            (d) Information to beneficiaries and participants. Each recipient shall make available to participants, beneficiaries, and other interested persons such information regarding the provisions of these Title IX regulations and their applicability to the program for which the recipient receives Federal financial assistance, and make such information available to them in such manner, as the designated agency official finds necessary to apprise such persons of the protections against discrimination assured them by Title IX and these Title IX regulations.

            § 28.610
            Conduct of investigations.

            (2) If an investigation does not warrant action pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section the designated agency official (or designee) will so inform the recipient and the complainant, if any, in writing.
            (e) Intimidatory or retaliatory acts prohibited. No recipient or other person shall intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by Title IX or these Title IX regulations, or because he or she has made a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding or hearing under these Title IX regulations. The identity of complainants shall be kept confidential except to the extent necessary to carry out the purposes of these Title IX regulations, including the conduct of any investigation, hearing, or judicial proceeding arising under these Title IX regulations.

            § 28.615
            Procedure for effecting compliance.
            (a) General. If there appears to be a failure or threatened failure to comply with these Title IX regulations, and if the noncompliance or threatened noncompliance cannot be corrected by informal means, compliance with these Title IX regulations may be effected by the suspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance or by any other means authorized by law. Such other means may include, but are not limited to:
            (1) A reference to the Department of Justice with a recommendation that appropriate proceedings be brought to enforce any rights of the United States under any law of the United States, or any assurance or other contractual undertaking; and
            (2) Any applicable proceeding under State or local law.
            (b) Noncompliance with § 28.115. If an applicant fails or refuses to furnish an assurance or otherwise fails or refuses to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to § 28.115, Federal financial assistance may be refused in accordance with the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section. The Department shall not be required to provide assistance in such a case during the pendency of the administrative proceedings under paragraph (c) of this section except that the Department shall continue assistance during the pendency of such proceedings where such assistance is due and payable pursuant to an application therefor approved prior to September 29, 2000.
            (c) Termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance. (1) No order suspending, terminating or refusing to grant or continue Federal financial assistance shall become effective until:
            (i) The designated agency official has advised the applicant or recipient of its failure to comply and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means;
            (ii) There has been an express finding on the record, after opportunity for hearing, of a failure by the applicant or recipient to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to these Title IX regulations; and
            (iii) The expiration of 30 days after the Secretary has filed with the committee of the House, and the committee of the Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the program involved, a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action.

            (2) Any action to suspend or terminate or to refuse to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance shall be limited to the particular political entity, or part thereof, or other applicant or recipient as to whom such a finding has been made and shall be limited in its effect to the particular program, or part thereof, in which such noncompliance has been so found.
            
            (d) Other means authorized by law. (1) No action to effect compliance by any other means authorized by law shall be taken until:
            (i) The designated agency official has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means;
            (ii) The recipient has been notified of its failure to comply and of the action to be taken to effect compliance; and

            § 28.620
            Hearings.
            (a) Opportunity for hearing. Whenever an opportunity for a hearing is required by § 28.615(c), reasonable notice shall be given by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the affected applicant or recipient. This notice shall advise the applicant or recipient of the action proposed to be taken, the specific provision under which the proposed action against it is to be taken, and the matters of fact or law asserted as the basis for this action, and either:
            (1) Fix a date not less than 20 days after the date of such notice within which the applicant or recipient may request of the designated agency official that the matter be scheduled for hearing; or
            (2) Advise the applicant or recipient that the matter in question has been set down for hearing at a stated place and time. The time and place so fixed shall be reasonable and shall be subject to change for cause. The complainant, if any, shall be advised of the time and place of the hearing. An applicant or recipient may waive a hearing and submit written information and argument for the record. The failure of an applicant or recipient to request a hearing for which a date has been set shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to a hearing under 20 U.S.C. 1682 and § 28.615(c) and consent to the making of a decision on the basis of such information as may be filed as the record.
            (b) Time and place of hearing. Hearings shall be held at the offices of the Department in Washington, DC, at a time fixed by the designated agency official unless the official determines that the convenience of the applicant or recipient or of the Department requires that another place be selected. Hearings shall be held before a hearing officer designated in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 556(b).
            (c) Right to counsel. In all proceedings under this section, the applicant or recipient and the Department shall have the right to be represented by counsel.
            (d) Procedures, evidence, and record. (1) The hearing, decision, and any administrative review thereof shall be conducted in conformity with 5 U.S.C. 554-557 (sections 5-8 of the Administrative Procedure Act), and in accordance with such rules of procedure as are proper (and not inconsistent with this section) relating to the conduct of the hearing, giving of notices subsequent to those provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, taking of testimony, exhibits, arguments and briefs, requests for findings, and other related matters. Both the Department and the applicant or recipient shall be entitled to introduce all relevant evidence on the issues as stated in the notice for hearing or as determined by the hearing officer at the outset of or during the hearing. Any person (other than a Government employee considered to be on official business) who, having been invited or requested to appear and testify as a witness on the Government's behalf, attends at a time and place scheduled for a hearing provided for by these Title IX regulations, may be reimbursed for his or her travel and actual expenses of attendance in an amount not to exceed the amount payable under the standardized travel regulations to a Government employee traveling on official business.

            (2) Technical rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings conducted pursuant to these Title IX regulations, but rules or principles designed to assure production of the most credible evidence available and to subject testimony to test by cross-examination shall be applied where reasonably necessary by the hearing officer. The hearing officer may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. All documents and other evidence offered or taken for the record shall be open to examination by the parties and opportunity shall be given to refute facts and arguments advanced on either side of the issues. A transcript shall be made of the oral evidence except to the extent the substance thereof is stipulated for the record. All decisions shall be based upon the hearing record and written findings shall be made.
            (e) Consolidated or Joint Hearings. In cases in which the same or related facts are asserted to constitute noncompliance with these Title IX regulations with respect to two or more programs to which these Title IX regulations apply, or noncompliance with these Title IX regulations and the regulations of one or more other Federal departments or agencies issued under Title IX, the designated agency official may, by agreement with such other departments or agencies where applicable, provide for the conduct of consolidated or joint hearings, and for the application to such hearings of rules of procedures not inconsistent with these Title IX regulations. Final decisions in such cases, insofar as these Title IX regulations are concerned, shall be made in accordance with § 28.625.

            § 28.625
            Decisions and notices.
            (a) Decisions by hearing officers. After a hearing is held by a hearing officer such hearing officer shall either make an initial decision, if so authorized, or certify the entire record including recommended findings and proposed decision to the reviewing authority for a final decision, and a copy of such initial decision or certification shall be mailed to the applicant or recipient and to the complainant, if any. Where the initial decision referred to in this paragraph or in paragraph (c) of this section is made by the hearing officer, the applicant or recipient or the counsel for the Department may, within the period provided for in the rules of procedure issued by the designated agency official, file with the reviewing authority exceptions to the initial decision, with the reasons therefor. Upon the filing of such exceptions the reviewing authority shall review the initial decision and issue its own decision thereof including the reasons therefor. In the absence of exceptions the initial decision shall constitute the final decision, subject to the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section.
            (b) Decisions on record or review by the reviewing authority. Whenever a record is certified to the reviewing authority for decision or it reviews the decision of a hearing officer pursuant to paragraph (a) or (c) of this section, the applicant or recipient shall be given reasonable opportunity to file with it briefs or other written statements of its contentions, and a copy of the final decision of the reviewing authority shall be given in writing to the applicant or recipient and to the complainant, if any.
            (c) Decisions on record where a hearing is waived. Whenever a hearing is waived pursuant to § 28.620, the reviewing authority shall make its final decision on the record or refer the matter to a hearing officer for an initial decision to be made on the record. A copy of such decision shall be given in writing to the applicant or recipient, and to the complainant, if any.
            (d) Rulings required. Each decision of a hearing officer or reviewing authority shall set forth a ruling on each finding, conclusion, or exception presented, and shall identify the requirement or requirements imposed by or pursuant to these Title IX regulations with which it is found that the applicant or recipient has failed to comply.
            (e) Review in certain cases by the Secretary of the Treasury. If the Secretary has not personally made the final decision referred to in paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section, a recipient or applicant or the counsel for the Department may request the Secretary to review a decision of the reviewing authority in accordance with rules of procedure issued by the designated agency official. Such review is not a matter of right and shall be granted only where the Secretary determines there are special and important reasons therefor. The Secretary may grant or deny such request, in whole or in part. The Secretary also may review such a decision upon his own motion in accordance with rules of procedure issued by the designated agency official. In the absence of a review under this paragraph (e), a final decision referred to in paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section shall become the final decision of the Department when the Secretary transmits it as such to congressional committees with the report required under 20 U.S.C. 1682. Failure of an applicant or recipient to file an exception with the reviewing authority or to request review under this paragraph (e) shall not be deemed a failure to exhaust administrative remedies for the purpose of obtaining judicial review.
            (f) Content of orders. The final decision may provide for suspension or termination of, or refusal to grant or continue Federal financial assistance, in whole or in part, to which these Title IX regulations apply, and may contain such terms, conditions, and other provisions as are consistent with and will effectuate the purposes of Title IX and these Title IX regulations, including provisions designed to assure that no Federal financial assistance to which these Title IX regulations apply will thereafter be extended under such law or laws to the applicant or recipient determined by such decision to be in default in its performance of an assurance given by it pursuant to these Title IX regulations, or to have otherwise failed to comply with these Title IX regulations unless and until it corrects its noncompliance and satisfies the designated agency official that it will fully comply with these Title IX regulations.
            (g) Post-termination proceedings. (1) An applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance if it satisfies the terms and conditions of that order for such eligibility or if it brings itself into compliance with these Title IX regulations and provides reasonable assurance that it will fully comply with these Title IX regulations. An elementary or secondary school or school system that is unable to file an assurance of compliance shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance if it files a court order or a plan for desegregation that meets the applicable requirements and provides reasonable assurance that it will comply with the court order or plan.
            (2) Any applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order entered pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section may at any time request the designated agency official to restore fully its eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance. Any such request shall be supported by information showing that the applicant or recipient has met the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. If the designated agency official determines that those requirements have been satisfied, the official shall restore such eligibility.
            (3) If the designated agency official denies any such request, the applicant or recipient may submit a request for a hearing in writing, specifying why it believes such official to have been in error. It shall thereupon be given an expeditious hearing, with a decision on the record, in accordance with rules of procedure issued by the designated agency official. The applicant or recipient will be restored to such eligibility if it proves at such hearing that it satisfied the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. While proceedings under this paragraph (g) are pending, the sanctions imposed by the order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall remain in effect.

            (a) Forms and instructions. The designated agency official shall issue and promptly make available to interested persons forms and detailed instructions and procedures for effectuating these Title IX regulations.
            (b) Supervision and coordination. The designated agency official may from time to time assign to officials of the Department, or to officials of other departments or agencies of the Government with the consent of such departments or agencies, responsibilities in connection with the effectuation of the purposes of Title IX and these Title IX regulations (other than responsibility for review as provided in § 28.625(e)), including the achievements of effective coordination and maximum uniformity within the Department and within the Executive Branch of the Government in the application of Title IX and these Title IX regulations to similar programs and in similar situations. Any action taken, determination made, or requirement imposed by an official of another department or agency acting pursuant to an assignment of responsibility under this section shall have the same effect as though such action had been taken by the designated official of this Department.

            § 29.104
            Schedule for Federal Benefit Payments.
            Federal Benefit Payments are payable on the first business day of the month following the month in which the benefit accrues. (See § 29.105(b).)
          
          
            § 29.105
            Computation of time.
            (a) For filing documents. In computing the number of days allowed for filing a document, the first day counted is the day after the action or event from which the period begins to run. If the date that ordinarily would be the last day for filing falls on a Saturday, a Sunday, a Federal holiday, or a District holiday, the period runs until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, a Sunday, or a Federal or a District holiday.
            (b) For benefit accrual. (1) Annuity accrues on a daily basis; one-thirtieth of the monthly rate constitutes the daily rate.
            (2) Annuity does not accrue on the 31st day of any month except that annuity accrues on the 31st day of the initial month if the employee's annuity commences on the 31st day of a 31-day month.
            (3) For accrual purposes the last day of a 28-day month counts as 3 days and the last day of a 29-day month counts as 2 days.
            (c) For counting unused sick leave. (1) For annuity computation purposes—
            (i) The service of a participant under the Police and Firefighters Plan who retires on an immediate annuity is increased by the number of days of unused sick leave to the participant's credit under a formal leave system; and
            (ii) The service of a participant under the Teachers Plan who retires on an immediate annuity or dies leaving a survivor entitled to an annuity is increased by the number of days of unused sick leave to the participant's credit under a formal leave system.
            (2) In general, 8 hours of unused sick leave increases total service by 1 day. In cases where more or less than 8 hours of sick leave would be charged for a day's absence, total service is increased by the number of days in the period between the date of separation and the date that the unused sick leave would have expired had the employee used it (except that holidays falling within the period are treated as work days, and no additional leave credit is earned for that period).
            (3) If an employee's tour of duty changes from part time to full time or full time to part time within 180 days before retirement, the credit for unused sick leave is computed as though no change had occurred.
            (d) For counting leave without pay (LWOP) that is creditable service. (1) Under the Police and Firefighters Plan, credit is allowed for no more than 6 months of LWOP in each calendar year.
            (2)(i) Under the Teachers Plan, credit is allowed for no more than 6 months of LWOP in each fiscal year.
            (ii)(A) For years prior to fiscal year 1976, each fiscal year started on July 1 and ended on the following June 30.
            (B) Fiscal year 1976 started on July 1, 1975, and ended on September 30, 1976.
            (C) For years starting in fiscal year 1977, each fiscal year starts on October 1 and ends on the following September 30.
          
          
            
            § 29.106
            Representative payees.
            For Federal Benefit Payments, representative payees will be authorized to the same extent and under the same circumstances as each plan permits for non-Federal Benefit Payments under the plan. (See e.g., section 4-629(b) of the D.C. Code (1997) (applicable to the Police and Firefighters Plan).)

            (a) Satisfies the age and service requirements for optional retirement, the Federal Benefit Payment commences immediately, that is, the Federal Benefit Payment is calculated as though the employee retired under optional retirement rules using only service through June 30, 1997 (See examples 7A and 7B of appendix A of this subpart); or
            (b) Does not satisfy the age and service requirements for optional retirement, the Federal Benefit Payment begins when the disability retiree reaches deferred retirement age. (See § 29.343.)

            General principle.
            (a) Where service is creditable both before and after June 30, 1997, Federal Benefit Payments are computed under the rules of the applicable plan as though—
            (1) The employee were eligible to retire effective July 1, 1997, under the same conditions as the actual retirement (that is, using the annuity computation formula that applies under the plan in effect on June 29, 1997, and the retirement age, including any applicable age reduction, based on the age at actual retirement);
            (2) The service that became creditable after June 30, 1997, did not exist; and
            (3) The average salary is the average salary at separation.
            (b) Exceptions to the general principle apply where:
            (1) Congress amends the terms of the District Retirement Program in effect on June 29, 1997. For example, see section 11012(e) & (f) of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, as amended by Public Laws 106-554, 107-290, and 108-133 (codified at D.C. Code section 1-803.02(e) and (f));

            Computed annuity exceeds the statutory maximum.
            (a) In cases in which the total computed annuity exceeds the statutory maximum:
            (1) Federal Benefit Payments may equal total benefits even if the employee had service after June 30, 1997.
            (2) If the employee had sufficient service as of June 30, 1997, to qualify for the maximum annuity under the plan, the Federal Benefit Payment is the maximum annuity under the plan. This will be the entire benefit except for any amount in excess of the normal maximum due to unused sick leave, which is the responsibility of the District. (See example 3, of appendix A of this subpart.)
            (b) If the employee did not perform sufficient service as of June 30, 1997, to reach the statutory maximum benefit, but has sufficient service at actual retirement to exceed the statutory maximum, the Federal Benefit Payment is the amount earned through June 30, 1997. The District benefit payment is the amount by which the total benefit payable exceeds the Federal Benefit Payment.
          
          
            § 29.343
            Disability benefits.
            (a) The general rule that Federal Benefit Payments are calculated under the applicable retirement plan as though the employee were eligible for optional retirement and separated on June 30, 1997, does not apply to disability benefits prior to optional retirement age.
            (b) In cases involving disability benefits prior to optional retirement age, no Federal Benefit Payment is payable until the retiree reaches the age of eligibility to receive a deferred annuity (age 55 under the Police and Firefighters Plan and age 62 under the Teachers Plan). When the age for deferred annuity is reached, the Federal Benefit Payment is paid using creditable service accrued as of June 30, 1997, and average salary (computed under the rules for the applicable plan) as of the date of separation. (See examples 6 and 7 of appendix A of this subpart.)
            (c) In no case will the amount of the Federal Benefit Payment exceed the amount of the total disability annuity.
          
          
            
            § 29.344
            Survivor benefits.
            (a) The general rule that Federal Benefit Payments are calculated under the applicable retirement plan as though the employee were eligible for optional retirement and separated on June 30, 1997, applies to death benefits that are determined by length of service. In these cases, the survivor's Federal Benefit Payment is calculated by multiplying the survivor's total benefit by the ratio of the deceased retiree or employee's Federal Benefit Payment to the deceased retiree or employee's total annuity. (See examples 13A and B of appendix A of this subpart.)
            (b) The general rule that Federal Benefit Payments are calculated under the applicable retirement plan as though the employee were eligible for optional retirement and separated on June 30, 1997, does not apply to death benefits that are not determined by length of service. In these cases, the survivor's Federal Benefit Payment is calculated by multiplying the survivor's total benefit by the deceased retiree or employee's number of full months of service through June 30, 1997, and then dividing by the retiree or employee's number of months of total service at retirement. (See examples 13C-F of appendix A of this subpart.)
            (c) In cases involving a disability or early voluntary retiree who dies before reaching the age at which a Federal Benefit Payment is payable, the survivor's Federal Benefit Payment is calculated as though the employee had not retired from service, but had separated from service with eligibility to receive a deferred annuity. (See examples 13G and 13H of appendix A of this subpart.)
          
          
            § 29.345
            Annuity adjustments.
            (a) In cases in which the total annuity and the Federal Benefit Payment are equally impacted by a cost-of-living adjustment, the new Federal Benefit Payment is determined by applying the federal percentage of the total annuity to the new total annuity. (See examples 14A-G of appendix A of this subpart.)
            (b) In cases in which the total annuity and the Federal Benefit Payment are not equally impacted by a change, such as a new plan provision or service-based adjustment, the Federal Benefit Payment is recalculated where applicable, and the federal percentage of the total annuity used to determine subsequent Federal Benefit Payments is recalculated. (See example 14H of appendix A of this subpart.)
          
          
            § 29.346
            Reduction for survivor benefits.
            If a retiree elects a reduction for a survivor annuity, the ratio of the unreduced Federal Benefit Payment to the unreduced total annuity is multiplied by the reduced total annuity to determine the reduced Federal Benefit Payment. (See example 10 of appendix A of this subpart.)
            Calculation of the Split of Refunds of Employee Contributions and Deposits
          
          
            § 29.351
            General principle.
            Treasury will fund refunds of employee contributions and purchase of service deposits paid by or on behalf of a covered employee to the District of Columbia Police Officers' and Firefighters' Retirement Fund or District of Columbia Teachers' Retirement Fund on or before June 30, 1997.
          
          
            § 29.352
            Refunded contributions.

            For any given pay period, employee contributions are considered to have been made before the freeze date if the pay date was on or before June 30, 1997. As a result, for calendar year 1997, Treasury will fund refunds of employee contributions made by teachers through pay period 12 and fund refunds of employee contributions made by police officers and firefighters through pay period 13. If pay period records are unavailable for calendar year 1997, and the participant separated on or before June 30, 1997, Treasury will fund 100 percent of the refund of retirement contributions. If pay period records are unavailable for calendar year 1997, and the participant was hired before January 1, 1997, and separated after December 31, 1997, Treasury will fund 50 percent of the refund of retirement contributions made to teachers in calendar year 1997, and 48 percent of the retirement contributions made to police officers or firefighters in calendar year 1997. Otherwise, if the participant separated after June 30, 1997, the percent of contributions made in calendar year 1997 funded by Treasury is assumed to be the ratio where the numerator is the number of days before July 1 the participant was employed in calendar year 1997 and the denominator is the number of days the participant was employed in calendar year 1997.
          
          
            § 29.353
            Refunded deposits.
            Treasury will fund refunds of purchase of service deposits made by employees by lump sum payment or by installment payments on or before June 30, 1997.
          
          
            Pt. 29, Subpt. C, App. A
            Appendix A to Subpart C of Part 29—Examples
            This appendix contains sample calculations of Federal Benefit Payments in a variety of situations.
            Optional Retirement Examples
            Example 1: No Unused Sick Leave
            A. In this example, an individual covered by the Police and Firefighters Plan hired before 1980 retires in October 1997. At retirement, he is age 51 with 20 years and 3 days of departmental service plus 3 years, 4 months, and 21 days of military service that preceded the departmental service. The Federal Benefit Payment begins at retirement. It is based on the 19 years, 8 months, and 22 days of departmental service and 3 years, 4 months, and 21 days of military service performed as of June 30, 1997. Thus, the Federal Benefit Payment is based on 23 years and 1 month of service, all at the 2.5 percent accrual rate. The total annuity is based on 23 years and 4 months of service, all at the 2.5 percent accrual rate.

                .03 service:
              
              
                Average salary: $45,680.80
              
              
                Total: $26,361.61
              
              
                Total/month: $2,197.00
              
              
                Total federal/month ÷ total/month: 0.989194
              
            
            B. In this example, the individual covered by the Police and Firefighters Plan was hired earlier than in example 1A and thus performed more service as of both June 30, 1997, and retirement in October 1997. At retirement, he is age 51 with 21 years, 11 months and 29 days of departmental service plus 3 years, 4 months, and 21 days of military service that preceded the departmental service. The Federal Benefit Payment begins at retirement. It is based on the 21 years, 8 months, and 18 days of departmental service and 3 years, 4 months, and 21 days of military service performed as of June 30, 1997. Thus, the Federal Benefit Payment is based on 25 years and 1 month of service, 1 year and 8 months at the 3.0 percent accrual rate and 23 years and 5 months at the 2.5 percent accrual rate (including 1 month consisting of 18 days of departmental service and 21 days of other service). The total annuity is based on 25 years and 4 months of service, 1 year and 11 months at the 3.0 percent accrual rate and 23 years and 5 months at the 2.5 percent accrual rate (including 1 month consisting of 29 days of departmental service and 21 days of other service).

                Total federal/month ÷ total/month: 0.988557
              
            
            Example 2: Unused Sick Leave Credit
            In this example, an individual covered by the Police and Firefighters Plan and hired before 1980 retires in March 1998. At retirement, she is age 48 with 24 years, 8 months, and 6 days of departmental service plus 6 months and 4 days of other service (deposit paid before June 30, 1997) and 11 months and 11 days of unused sick leave. For a police officer (or a non-firefighting division firefighter) such an amount of sick leave would be 1968 hours (246 days, based on a 260-day year, times 8 hours per day). For a firefighting division firefighter, such an amount would be 2,069 hours (341 days divided by 360 days per year times 2,184 hours per year). The Federal Benefit Payment begins at retirement. It is based on the 23 years, 11 months, and 23 days of departmental service performed as of June 30, 1997, and 6 months and 4 days of other service. Thus, the Federal Benefit Payment is based on 20 years departmental and 6 months of other service at the 2.5 percent accrual rate and 3 years and 11 months of service at the 3.0 percent accrual rate. The total annuity is based on 20 years and 6 months of service at the 2.5 percent accrual rate and 5 years and 7 months of service at the 3 percent accrual rate.

            Example 3: Calculated Benefit Exceeds Statutory Maximum
            A. In this example, an individual covered by the Police and Firefighters Plan hired before 1980 retires in March 1998. At retirement, he is age 55 with 32 years and 17 days of departmental service. The Federal Benefit Payment begins at retirement. It is based on the 31 years, 3 months, and 17 days of departmental service performed as of June 30, 1997. Thus, the Federal Benefit Payment is based on 20 years of service at the 2.5 percent accrual rate and 11 years and 3 months of service at the 3.0 percent accrual rate. However, the annuity is limited to 80 percent of the average salary at time of retirement. (This limitation does not apply to the unused sick leave credit.) The annuity computed as of June 30, 1997, equals the full benefit payable; therefore, the Federal Benefit Payment is the total benefit.

            B. In this example, the individual in example 3A also has 6 months of unused sick leave at retirement. The sick leave credit is not subject to the 80% limitation and does not become creditable service until the date of separation. For a police officer (or a non-firefighting division firefighter) such an amount of sick leave would be 1040 hours (130 days, based on a 260-day year, times 8 hours per day). For a firefighting division firefighter, such an amount would be 1092 hours (180 days divided by 360 days per year times 2184 hours per year). Six months of unused sick leave increases the annual total benefit by 1.5 percent of the average salary, or in the example by $94 per month. The District is responsible for the portion of the annuity attributable to the unused sick leave because it became creditable at retirement, that is, after June 30, 1997.

            Example 4: Excess Leave Without Pay

            In this example, an individual covered by the Teachers Plan hired before 1996 retires in February 1998. At retirement, she is age 64 with 27 years of departmental service and 6 years, 7 months, and 28 days of other service (creditable before June 30, 1997). However, only 6 months of leave in a fiscal year without pay may be credited toward retirement under the Teachers Plan. She had 3 months and 18 days of excess leave without pay as of June 30, 1997. Since the excess leave without pay occurred before June 30, 1997, the time attributable to the excess leave without pay is subtracted from the service used in both the Federal Benefit Payment and the total benefit computations. The Federal Benefit Payment begins at retirement. It is based on the 32 years and 8 months of service (32 years, 11 months, and 28 days minus 3 months and 18 days and the partial month dropped); 5 years of service at the 1.5 percent accrual rate, 5 years of service at the 1.75 percent accrual rate, and 22 years and 8 months of service at the 2 percent accrual rate. The total annuity is based on 33 years and 4 months of service (33 years, 7 months and 28 days minus 3 months and 18 days and the partial month dropped) 5 years of service at the 1.5 percent accrual rate, 5 years of service at the 1.75 percent accrual rate and 23 years and 4 months of service at the 2 percent accrual rate.
            
            
              Note:

              For the Teachers Plan, section 1230(a) of title 31 of the D.C. Code (1997) allows for 6 months leave without pay in any fiscal year. For the Police and Firefighters Plan, section 610(d) of title 4 of the D.C. Code (1997) allows for 6 months leave without pay in any calendar year.

            Example 5: Service Credit Deposits
            A. An individual covered by the Teachers Plan hired before 1996 retires in October 1997. At retirement, he is age 61 with 30 years and 3 days of departmental service plus 3 years, 4 months, and 21 days of other service that preceded the departmental service for which the deposit was fully paid on or before June 30, 1997. The Federal Benefit Payment begins at retirement. It is based on the 29 years, 8 months, and 22 days of departmental service and 3 years, 4 months, and 21 days of service performed as of June 30, 1997. Thus, the Federal Benefit Payment is based on 33 years and 1 month of service; 5 years of service at the 1.5 percent accrual rate, 5 years of service at the 1.75 percent accrual rate, and 23 years and 1 month of service at the 2 percent accrual rate. The total annuity is based on 33 years and 4 months of service; 5 years of service at the 1.5 percent accrual rate, 5 years of service at the 1.75 percent accrual rate and 23 years and 4 months of service at the 2 percent accrual rate.

            B. In this example, the employee in example 5A did not pay any of the deposit to obtain credit for the 3 years, 4 months, and 21 days of other service as of June 30, 1997. Thus, none of the other service is used in the computation of the Federal Benefit Payment. An individual covered by the Teachers Plan hired before 1996 retires in October 1997. At retirement, he is age 61 with 30 years and 3 days of departmental service plus 3 years, 4 months, and 21 days of other service that preceded the departmental service for which the deposit was paid in full in October 1997 (at retirement). The Federal Benefit Payment begins at retirement. It is based on only the 29 years, 8 months, and 22 days of departmental service performed as of June 30, 1997; 5 years of service at the 1.5 percent accrual rate, 5 years of service at the 1.75 percent accrual rate, and 19 years and 8 months of service at the 2 percent accrual rate. The total annuity is based on 33 years and 4 months of service; 5 years of service at the 1.5 percent accrual rate, 5 years of service at the 1.75 percent accrual rate and 23 years and 4 months of service at the 2 percent accrual rate.

            C. In this example, the employee in examples 5A and B began installment payments on the deposit to obtain credit for the 3 years, 4 months, and 21 days of other service as of June 30, 1997, but did not complete the deposit until October 1997 (at retirement). The other service is not used in the computation of the Federal Benefit Payment because the payment was not completed as of June 30, 1997. Thus, the result is the same as in example 5B.

            Disability Retirement Examples
            Example 6: Disability Occurs Before Eligibility for Optional Retirement

            A. In this example, an individual covered by the Police and Firefighters Plan hired before 1980 retires based on a disability in the line of duty in October 1997. At retirement, he is age 45 with 18 years, 5 months, and 11 days of departmental service. Since he had performed less than 20 years of service and had not reached the age of eligibility for an optional retirement, the Federal Benefit Payment does not begin at retirement. When the disability annuitant reaches age 55, he satisfies the age and service requirements for deferred retirement. At that time (August 20, 2007), the Federal Benefit Payment begins. It is based on the 18 years, 1 month, and 17 days of departmental service performed as of June 30, 1997, all at the 2.5 percent accrual rate.

            B. In this example, an individual covered by the Teachers Plan hired before 1996 retires based on a disability in December 1997. At retirement, she is age 49 with 27 years and 4 months of departmental service which includes 3 years, 3 months and 14 days of excess leave without pay (prior to June 30, 1997). Since she does not qualify for optional retirement at separation, the Federal Benefit Payment does not begin at separation. When the disability annuitant reaches age 62, she will satisfy the age and service requirements for deferred retirement. At that time (March 9, 2010), the Federal Benefit Payment begins. The time attributable to the excess leave without pay is subtracted from the service used to compute the Federal Benefit Payment. Since the excess leave without pay occurred before June 30, 1997, the deferred Federal Benefit Payment is based on the 23 years and 6 months of service; 5 years of service at the 1.5 percent accrual rate, 5 years of service at the 1.75 percent accrual rate, and 13 and 6 months of service at the 2 percent accrual rate.

            Example 7: Disability Occurs After Eligibility for Optional Retirement

            A. In this example, an individual covered by the Police and Firefighters Plan hired before 1980 retires based on a disability in the line of duty in October 1997. At retirement, she is age 55 with 24 years, 5 months, and 11 days of departmental service. Since she was also eligible for optional retirement at the time of separation, the Federal Benefit Payment commences at retirement. It is based on the 24 years, 1 month, and 17 days of departmental service performed as of June 30, 1997. Thus, the Federal Benefit Payment is based on 20 years of service at the 2.5 percent accrual rate and 4 years and 1 month of service at the 3 percent accrual rate. The total annuity is based on the disability formula and is equal to two-thirds of average pay because that amount is higher than the 63.25 percent payable based on total service.

            B. In this example, an individual covered by the Teachers Plan hired before 1996 retires based on a disability in December 1997. At retirement, he is age 60 with 27 years and 4 months of departmental service which includes 3 years, 3 months and 14 days of excess leave without pay (prior to June 30, 1997). Since he qualifies for optional retirement at separation, the Federal Benefit Payment begins at retirement. Since the excess leave without pay occurred before June 30, 1997, and the total annuity is based on actual service (that is, exceeds the guaranteed disability minimum), the time attributable to the excess leave without pay is subtracted from the service used to compute the Federal Benefit Payment and total benefit. The Federal Benefit Payment is based on 23 years and 6 months of service; 5 years of service at the 1.5 percent accrual rate, 5 years of service at the 1.75 percent accrual rate, and 13 years and 6 months of service at the 2 percent accrual rate. The total annuity payable is based on 24 years of service; 5 years of service at the 1.5 percent accrual rate, 5 years of service at the 1.75 percent accrual rate, and 14 years of service at the 2 percent accrual rate.

            Deferred Retirement Examples
            Example 8: All Service Before June 30, 1997

            In this example, an individual covered by the Police and Firefighters Plan hired before 1980 separated in March 1986 with title to a deferred annuity. In November 1997, he reaches age 55 and becomes eligible for the deferred annuity based on his 15 years, 9 months, and 8 days of departmental service, all at the 2.5 percent accrual rate. The total annuity is based on the same 15 years, 9 months, and 8 days of service all at the 2.5 percent accrual rate. Since all the service is creditable as of June 30, 1997, the Federal Benefit Payment equals the total annuity.

            Reduction To Provide a Survivor Annuity Examples
            Example 10: Survivor Reduction Calculations
            Both of the following examples involve a former teacher who elected a reduced annuity to provide a survivor benefit:
            A. In this example, the employee elects to provide full survivor benefits of 55% of the employee's unreduced annuity. The total annuity is reduced by 21/2 percent of the first $3600 and 10 percent of the balance. The reduced Federal Benefit Payment is determined by multiplying the reduced total annuity (rounded) by the ratio of the unreduced Federal Benefit Payment to the unreduced total annuity. Military service occurred prior to June 30, 1997 and purchase of other service was completed prior to June 30, 1997.

            Early Optional or Involuntary Retirement Examples
            Example 11: Early Optional With Age Reduction

            In this example, an individual covered by the Teachers Plan hired before 1996 retires voluntarily in February 1998, under a special program that allows early retirement with at least 20 years of service at age 50 older, or at least 25 years of service at any age. At retirement, she is 6 full months short of age 55. She has 25 years and 5 months of departmental service; 6 years, 2 months, and 19 days of other service (creditable before June 30, 1997); and 2 months and 9 days of unused sick leave. Since she is not eligible for optional retirement and she is eligible to retire voluntarily only because of the District-approved special program, the Federal Benefit Payment is calculated similar to a disability retirement. It does not begin until she becomes eligible for a deferred annuity at age 62. When it commences the Federal Benefit Payment will be based on the service creditable as of June 30, 1997: 30 years and 11 months of service; 5 years of service at the 1.5 percent accrual rate, 5 years of service at the 1.75 percent accrual rate, and 20 years and 11 months of service at the 2 percent accrual rate. The total annuity is based on 5 years of service at the 1.5 percent accrual rate, 5 years of service at the 1.75 percent accrual rate and 21 years and 9 months of service at the 2 percent accrual rate (including the unused sick leave). Because the Federal Benefit Payment is based on the deferred annuity, rather than the early voluntary retirement, it is not reduced by the age reduction factor used to compute the total benefit.

            Example 12: Involuntary With Age Reduction
            In this example, an individual covered by the Teachers Plan hired before 1996 retires involuntarily in February 1998. At retirement, she is 6 full months short of age 55. She has 25 years and 5 months of departmental service; 6 years, 2 months, and 19 days of other service (creditable before June 30, 1997); and 2 months and 9 days of unused sick leave. The Federal Benefit Payment begins at retirement. It is based on the 30 years and 11 months of service; 5 years of service at the 1.5 percent accrual rate, 5 years of service at the 1.75 percent accrual rate, and 20 years and 11 months of service at the 2 percent accrual rate. The total annuity is based on 5 years of service at the 1.5 percent accrual rate, 5 years of service at the 1.75 percent accrual rate and 21 years and 9 months of service at the 2 percent accrual rate (including the unused sick leave). Both the Federal Benefit Payment and the total benefit are reduced by the age reduction factor.

            Death Benefits Example
            Example 13: Death Benefits Calculation
            Examples A and B involve service-based death benefits calculations. Examples C-F involve non-service-based death benefits calculations. Examples G and H involve disability death benefit calculations.

            A. In this example, an individual covered by the Teachers Plan retires in December 1997 and elects to provide a full survivor annuity. He dies in June 1998. The survivor's Federal Benefit Payment is 98.4 percent ($3,483 ÷ $3,539) of the total survivor benefit.

            B. In this example, a teacher dies in service on June 30, 1998 after 31 years of departmental service. Since the survivor annuity is based on actual service, the Federal Benefit Payment is 96.5 percent ($1,818 ÷ $1,883) of the total survivor benefit.

            C. In this example, as in Example A, an individual covered by the Teachers Plan retires in December 1997 but elects to provide a survivor annuity of $12,000. He dies in June 1998. Because the amount of the survivor annuity is not service-based, the Federal Benefit Payment is a prorated portion of the total benefit. Since the teacher had 398 months of service as of the freeze date and 404 months of service, at retirement, the Federal Benefit Payment equals 398/404ths of the total benefit.

            D. In this example, a teacher dies in service on April 1, 1998 after 14 years and 6 months of departmental service. Because the survivor annuity is based on the guaranteed minimum, the Federal Benefit Payment is a prorated portion of the total benefit. Since the teacher had 165 months of service as of the freeze date and 180 months of service, including unused sick leave, at death, the Federal Benefit Payment equals 165/180ths of the total benefit.

            E. In this example, as in the prior example, a teacher dies in service on April 1, 1998 after 15 years of departmental service. However, in this example, the teacher was age 40 on the hire date. The amount of service used in the survivor annuity calculation equals the amount of service that the teacher would have had if the teacher continued covered employment until age 60. Because the survivor annuity is based on projected service, a form of the guaranteed minimum, the Federal Benefit Payment is a prorated portion of the total benefit. Since the teacher had 171 months of service as of the freeze date and 180 months of service at death, the Federal Benefit Payment equals 171/180ths of the total benefit.

            F. In this example, a police officer dies in the line of duty on July 31, 2001 after 18 years of departmental service. The survivor annuity is equal to 100 percent of the officer's pay at the time of death, as provided by District legislation effective October 1, 2000. However, the Federal Benefit Payment is calculated based on plan provisions in effect on June 29, 1997, which provided for a survivor annuity equal to 40 percent of the officer's pay at the time of death. Because the Federal Benefit Payment is not service-based and the officer had 167 months of service as of the freeze date and 216 months of service, including unused sick leave, at death, the Federal Benefit Payment equals 167/216ths of the total benefit calculated according to plan provisions in effect on July 1, 1997. The difference between the total benefit paid and the Federal Benefit Payment calculated according to plan provisions in effect on June 29, 1997 is the responsibility of the District government.

            G. In this example, a firefighter dies on July 1, 1999 at age 47 after retiring based on a disability in the line of duty in November 1997. At separation, the firefighter was not eligible for optional retirement but was eligible to receive a deferred retirement annuity at age 55. Therefore, the survivor's Federal Benefit Payment is calculated based on the plan rules for deferred retirees. Under the Police and Firefighters Plan, if a separated police officer or firefighter eligible for deferred retirement dies before reaching age 55, the survivor is eligible to receive an annuity. The survivor annuity is based on the firefighter's adjusted average pay. Therefore, the survivor's Federal Benefit Payment is a prorated portion of the survivor annuity. Since the firefighter had 217 months of service as of the freeze date and 222 months of service at retirement, the survivor's Federal Benefit Payment equals 217/222nds of the total survivor benefit.

            H. In this example, a teacher dies on August 3, 1999 at age 58 after retiring based on a disability in April 1998. At separation, the teacher was not eligible for optional retirement but was eligible to receive a deferred retirement annuity at age 62. Therefore, the survivor's Federal Benefit Payment is calculated based on the plan rules for deferred retirees. Under the Teachers Plan, if a separated teacher eligible for deferred retirement dies before reaching age 62, the survivor is not eligible to receive an annuity. Therefore, the survivor's Federal Benefit Payment is zero and the survivor annuity is the full responsibility of the District.

                Note: This method also applies to a percentage survivor election by a retiree whose annuity was based on a guaranteed minimum.
            

            D. In this example, a survivor of a deceased teacher receives a cost of living adjustment that is the same for the federal and District portions of the total benefit. Since the survivor annuity is service related, the federal percentage based on the deceased teacher's service is applied to the new total benefit of the survivor after the adjustment to determine the new Federal Benefit Payment after the adjustment.

            H. In this example, a new District plan provision applies a different cost of living adjustment than is provided for the Federal Benefit Payment. In Variation 1, the federal cost of living adjustment is applied to the Federal Benefit Payment and the District cost of living adjustment is applied to the total benefit. In Variation 2, the federal cost of living adjustment is applied to the Federal Benefit Payment and the District cost of living adjustment is applied to the District benefit payment. A new federal percentage equal to the ratio of the Federal Benefit Payment to the total benefit is established after the adjustments.

            Retroactive Payment of Accrued Annuity Example
            Example 15: Accrual of Federal Benefit Payment
            The Federal Benefit Payment begins to accrue on the annuity commencing date, regardless of whether the employee is added to the annuity roll in time for the regular payment cycle. If the employee is due a retroactive payment of accrued annuity, the portion of the retroactive payment that would have been a Federal Benefit Payment (if it were made in the regular payment cycle) is still a Federal Benefit Payment. In this example, a teacher retired effective September 11, 1998. She was added to the retirement rolls on the pay date November 1, 1998 (October 1 to October 31 accrual cycle). Her Federal Benefit Payment is $3000 per month and her total benefit payment is $3120 per month. Her initial check is $5200 because it includes a prorated payment for 20 days (September 11 to September 30). The Federal Benefit Payment is $5000 of the initial check ($3000 for the October cycle and $2000 for the September cycle).

            § 29.403

            § 29.404
            Initial benefit determinations and reconsideration by the Benefits Administrator.
            (a) Initial benefit determinations. The Benefits Administrator will process applications for Federal Benefit Payments and determine the eligibility for and the amount and form of Federal Benefit Payments. All initial benefit determination decisions which may reasonably be construed as a denial (in whole or part) of a claim for Federal Benefit Payments must be in writing, must advise claimants of their right to request reconsideration under paragraph (b), of this section and must state the time limits applicable to such a request.
            (b) Claimant's right to reconsideration of benefit denials. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, claimants who disagree with the amount or form of a Federal Benefit Payment determination and wish to contest the determination must first request the Benefits Administrator to reconsider its determination.
            (2) A decision to collect a debt is not a denial of a benefit claim under this section.
            (c) Form and timing of requests for reconsideration. (1) A request for reconsideration must be in writing, must include the claimant's name, address, date of birth and claim number, if applicable, and must state the basis for the request.
            (2) A request for reconsideration must be received by the Benefits Administrator within 30 calendar days from the date of the written notice of the initial benefit determination.
            (d) Reconsideration decisions. A reconsideration decision by the Benefits Administrator denying (in whole or part) a claim for a Federal Benefit Payment must—
            (1) Be in writing;
            (2) Provide adequate notice of such denial, setting forth the specific reason for the denial in a manner calculated to be understood by the average participant; and
            (3) Provide notice of the right to appeal the Benefit Administrator's decision to the Department, the address to which such an appeal must be submitted, and the time limits applicable to such an appeal.
            (e) Appeal of reconsideration decisions. The Department will review an appeal of a reconsideration decision under § 29.405.
          
          
            § 29.405
            Appeals to the Department.
            (a) Who may file. Any claimant whose claim for a Federal Benefit Payment has been denied (in whole or part) by the Benefits Administrator in a reconsideration decision under § 29.404(d) may appeal that decision to the Department.
            (b) Form of appeal. An appeal must be in writing, must include the claimant's name, address, date of birth and claim number, if applicable, and must state the basis for the appeal.
            (c) Time limits on Appeals. (1) An appeal must be received by the Department within 30 calendar days from the date of the reconsideration decision under § 29.404(d).
            (2) The Department may extend the time limit for filing when the claimant shows that he or she was not notified of the time limit and was not otherwise aware of it, or that he or she was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from making the request within the time limit, or for other good and sufficient reason.
            (d) Final decision. After consideration of the appeal, the Department will issue a final decision. The Department's decision must be in writing, must fully set forth the Department's findings and conclusions on the appeal, and must contain notice of the right to judicial review provided in § 29.406. Copies of the final decision must be sent to the claimant seeking appeal, to any competing claimants (see § 29.407) and to the Benefits Administrator.
          
          
            § 29.406
            Judicial review.
            An individual whose claim for a Federal Benefit Payment has been denied (in whole or part) in a final decision by the Department under § 29.405 may, within 180 days of the date of the final decision, file a civil action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. Any such civil action must be filed in accordance with the rules of that court.
          
          
            § 29.407
            Competing claimants.
            (a) Competing claimants are applicants for survivor benefits based on the service of a participant when—
            (1) A benefit is payable based on the service of the participant;
            (2) Two or more claimants have applied for benefits based on the service of the participant; and

            (3) A decision in favor of one claimant will adversely affect another claimant(s).
            
            (b)(1) When a competing claimant files a request for reconsideration under this section, the other competing claimants shall be notified of the request and given an opportunity to submit written substantiation of their claim.
            (2) When the Benefits Administrator receives an application from a competing claimant(s) before any payments are made based upon the service of the participant, and an initial determination of benefits in favor of one claimant adversely affects another claimant, all known claimants concerned will be notified in writing of that decision and those adversely affected will be given an opportunity to request reconsideration under the procedures and time limitations set forth in § 29.404(c). The Benefits Administrator must not execute its decision until the time limit for filing a request for reconsideration has expired, or, if a reconsideration decision is made, until the time limit for filing an appeal to the Department has expired or the Department has issued a final decision on a timely appeal, whichever is later.
            (3) When the Benefits Administrator does not receive an application from a competing claimant(s) until after another person has begun to receive payments based upon the service of the participant, the payments will continue until the time limit for filing a request for reconsideration has expired, or, if a reconsideration decision is made, until the time limit for filing an appeal to the Department has expired or the Department has issued a final decision on a timely appeal, whichever is later.

            § 29.501
            Purpose; incorporation by reference; scope.
            (a) This subpart regulates—
            (1) The recovery of overpayments of Federal Benefit Payments;

            (b) The regulations of this subpart incorporate by this reference all provisions of the Federal Claims Collection Standards (FCCS) (parts 900-904 of Title 31, Code of Federal Regulations), and supplement those regulations by the prescription of procedures and directives necessary and appropriate for the operation and administration of the Retirement Funds. To the extent they are not inconsistent with the regulations contained in this subpart, the regulations in part 5 of title 31, Code of Federal Regulations, also apply to the collection of debts under this subpart.
            (c)(1) Debts based on fraud, misrepresentation, or the presentation of a false claim. This subpart does not apply to any overpayments of Federal Benefit Payments which arose, in whole or in part, due to fraud, misrepresentation, or the presentation of a false claim by the debtor or any party having an interest in the claim. Such debts should be referred by the Benefits Administrator immediately to the U.S. Justice Department for action pursuant to 31 CFR 900.3.
            (2) Tax debts. This subpart does not apply to tax debts.

            (e) This part does not apply to debt collection claims asserted and requests for waivers of collection initiated before October 1, 1997.

            § 29.502

            For purposes of this subpart—

              Change of position for the worse means an individual would be left in a worse financial position after recovery of the overpayment than prior to the receipt of the overpayment because the individual reasonably relied on the amount of the overpayment to his or her detriment.

            (2) Under the Judges Plan, “lump-sum credit for survivor annuity” is defined in section 11-1561(10) of the D.C. Code.
            
              Offset means to withhold the amount of a debt, or a portion of that amount, from one or more payments due the debtor. Offset also means the amount withheld in this manner.

              Substantially all, as used in § 29.524, means that a debtor's income is less than or equal to his or her ordinary and necessary expenses plus a reasonable monthly allowance for unexpected or emergency expenses and does not allow for the deduction of a reasonable monthly installment payment to recover the debt.

            A payment of a Federal Benefit Payment to a debtor because of an error on the part of the Department or Benefits Administrator, or the failure of the creditor agency to properly and/or timely submit a debt claim, does not erase the debt or affect the validity of the claim by the creditor agency.
          
          
            § 29.505
            Compromise of debts; termination and suspension of collection actions.

            Recovery of other debts owed to the United States.
            (a) Procedures for Creditor Agencies. Agencies seeking to recover a debt by offset of Federal Benefit Payments payable to the debtor must comply with the offset procedures set forth in 31 U.S.C. 3716 and the FCCS. A creditor agency may seek to collect a debt through offset of Federal Benefit Payments pursuant to the Department's procedures for administrative offset set forth in 31 CFR part 5.
            (b) Offset by the Benefits Administrator. As required by 31 U.S.C. 3716(c), the Benefits Administrator must compare payment records of the Retirement Funds with records of debts submitted to the Financial Management Service for collection by administrative offset, and must offset payments to satisfy, in whole or in part, debts owed by any annuitant.
          
          
            Collection of Overpayments
            
              § 29.511
              Demand letters.
              Except as provided in § 29.516(e), before starting collection action to recover an overpayment, the Benefits Administrator must send a demand letter that informs the debtor in writing—
              (a) That an overpayment has occurred, the amount of the overpayment, and the facts giving rise to the overpayment;

              (b) The date by which payment of the debt should be made to avoid additional charges (i.e., interest, penalties and administrative costs) permitted by the FCCS and enforced collection;
              (c) The requirement that any overpayment debt delinquent for more than 180 days be transferred to the Department of the Treasury's Financial Management Service for collection;
              (d) The name, address, and phone number of the appropriate person or office the debtor may contact about the debt;
              (e) The remedies which may be used to enforce payment of the debt, including assessment of interest, administrative costs and penalties; administrative wage garnishment; the use of collection agencies; Federal salary offset; tax refund offset; administrative offset; and litigation.
              (f) Whether offset is available and, if so, the types of payment(s) to be offset or eligible for offset, the repayment schedule (if any), the right to request an adjustment in the repayment schedule, and the right to request a voluntary repayment agreement in lieu of offset;
              (g) An explanation of the Department's policy on interest, penalties, and administrative costs as set forth in 31 CFR part 5, the FCCS, and 31 U.S.C. 3717, including a statement that such assessments must be made unless excused in accordance with the FCCS;
              (h) The debtor's opportunity to request repayment in installments if the debtor can show an inability to repay the debt in one lump sum;
              (i) The debtor's opportunity to inspect and/or receive a copy of the records relating to the overpayment;
              (j) The method and time period (60 calendar days) for requesting reconsideration, waiver, and/or compromise of the overpayment;
              (k) That all requests for waiver or compromise must be accompanied by a disclosure of the debtor's financial condition and ability to pay the debt;
              (l) The standards used by the Department in deciding requests for waiver (set forth in §§ 29.521 through 29.526) and compromise (set forth in 31 CFR 902.2); and
              (m) The fact that a timely filing of a request for reconsideration, waiver and/or compromise, or a subsequent timely appeal of a reconsideration decision, will stop collection proceedings, unless—
              (1) Failure to take the offset would substantially prejudice the Federal Government's ability to collect the debt; and
              (2) The time before the payment is to be made does not reasonably permit the completion of these procedures.
            
            
              § 29.512
              Reconsideration by the Benefits Administrator.
              (a) Right to reconsideration of overpayment determinations. Individuals who receive a demand letter and who wish to contest the existence or amount of the overpayment may ask the Benefits Administrator to reconsider the determination.
              (b) Requests for waiver or compromise. Individuals who wish to seek waiver or compromise of the overpayment may file such requests with the Department under § 29.514. An individual may file a request for reconsideration in addition to a request for waiver or compromise.
              
              (c) Form and timing of requests for reconsideration. (1) A request for reconsideration must be in writing and must state the basis for the request. Individuals requesting reconsideration will be given a full opportunity to present any pertinent information and documentation supporting their position and should, to the extent possible, include such information and documentation in their request.
              (2) A request for reconsideration must be received by the Benefits Administrator within 60 calendar days of the date of the demand letter. The Department may extend the time limit for filing when the individual shows that he or she was not notified of the time limit and was not otherwise aware of it, or that he or she was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from making the request within the time limit, or for other good and sufficient reason.
              (3) When a request for reconsideration covered by this subpart is properly filed before the death of the debtor, it will be processed to completion unless the relief sought is nullified by the debtor's death.
              (d) Reconsideration decisions. (1) The Benefits Administrator's decision on a request for reconsideration will be based upon the individual's written submissions, evidence of record, and other pertinent available information.
              (2) A reconsideration decision by the Benefits Administrator must—
              (i) Be in writing;
              (ii) Provide notice of the extent of the individual's liability for the overpayment, if any;
              (iii) If the individual is determined to be liable for all or a portion of the overpayment, reaffirm or modify the conditions for the collection of the overpayment previously proposed in the demand letter;
              (iv) Provide notice of the right to appeal the Benefits Administrator's decision to the Department, the address to which such an appeal must be submitted, and the time limits applicable to such an appeal; and
              (v) State that a timely appeal of the Benefits Administrator's decision to the Department will suspend action to collect the debt.
              (e) Appeal of reconsideration decisions. The Department will review an appeal of a reconsideration decision under § 29.513.
            
            
              § 29.513
              Appeals to the Department.
              (a) Form of appeal. An appeal of a reconsideration decision under § 29.512 must be in writing and must state the basis for the appeal.
              (b) Time limits on appeals. (1) An appeal must be received by the Department within 60 calendar days from the date of the reconsideration decision.
              (2) The Department may extend the time limit for filing when the individual shows that he or she was not notified of the time limit and was not otherwise aware of it, or that he or she was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from making the request within the time limit, or for other good and sufficient reason.
              (c) Final decision. After consideration of the appeal, the Department will issue a final decision. The Department's decision will be in writing, will fully set forth the Department's findings and conclusions on the appeal, and will contain notice of the right to judicial review provided in § 29.515. If the Department determines that the individual is liable for all or a portion of the overpayment, the decision also will contain the conditions for the collection of the overpayment. Copies of the final decision will be sent to the individual seeking appeal and to the Benefits Administrator.
            
            
              § 29.514
              Requests for waiver and/or compromise.
              (a) Right to request waiver and/or compromise. Individuals who receive a demand letter regarding an overpayment may ask the Department to waive and/or compromise, in whole or part, the amount of the overpayment.
              (b) Requests for reconsideration. Individuals who have filed a request for reconsideration under § 29.512 may also request a waiver and/or compromise under this section.
              (c) Form and timing of requests for waiver and/or compromise. (1) A request for waiver and/or compromise must be in writing and must state the basis for the request. Individuals making such requests will be given a full opportunity to present any pertinent information and documentation supporting their position and should, to the extent possible, include such information and documentation in their request. Individuals seeking waiver or compromise of an overpayment must also submit required financial information identified in the demand letter.
              (2) A request for waiver or compromise must be filed with the Department. If the request is sent by mail, it must be postmarked within 60 calendar days of the date of the demand letter. If the request is hand delivered or delivered electronically, it must be received within 60 calendar days of the date of the demand letter. The Department may extend the time limit for filing when the individual shows that he or she was not notified of the time limit and was not otherwise aware of it, or that he or she was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from making the request within the time limit, or for other good and sufficient reason.
              (3) When a request for waiver and/or compromise under this section is properly filed before the death of the debtor, it will be processed to completion unless the relief sought is nullified by the debtor's death.
              (d) Waiver and/or compromise decisions. (1) The Department's decision on a request for waiver and/or compromise will be based upon the individual's written submissions, evidence of record, and other pertinent available information. An individual's request for waiver will be evaluated by the standards set forth in §§ 29.521 through 29.526. An individual's request for compromise will be evaluated by the standards set forth in the FCCS in 31 CFR part 902.
              (2) A waiver or compromise decision by the Department will—
              (i) Be in writing;
              (ii) Provide notice of whether the overpayment will be waived or compromised, and the extent to which the individual is still liable for the overpayment, if at all;
              (iii) If the individual is determined to be liable for all or a portion of the overpayment, reaffirm or modify the conditions for the collection of the overpayment previously proposed in the demand letter; and
              (iv) Be issued within 120 calendar days from the Department's receipt of a timely request for waiver and/or compromise. This time limit does not apply to requests for compromise that are referred to the Department of Justice for consideration pursuant to 31 CFR 902.1(b).
            
            
              § 29.515
              Judicial review.
              An individual whose request for reconsideration has been denied (in whole or part) in a final decision by the Department under § 29.513 may, within 180 days of the date of the final decision, file a civil action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. Any such civil action must be filed in accordance with the rules of that court.
            
            
              § 29.516
              Collection of overpayments.
              (a) Means of collection. Collection of an overpayment may be made by means of offset under § 29.517, or under any statutory provision providing for offset of money due the debtor from the Federal Government including, but not limited to, Federal Benefit Payments. Collection may also be effected by referral to the Justice Department for litigation, as provided in § 29.520, or referral to a collection agency as provided in § 29.519, or by other means authorized by federal law.
              (b) Additional charges. Interest, penalties, and administrative costs will be assessed on the overpayment in accordance with standards established in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and 31 CFR 901.9. Additional charges will be waived when required by the FCCS. The Department will waive the collection of interest on the overpayment pending the Benefits Administrator's consideration of a request for reconsideration and the Department's consideration of a request for waiver and/or compromise or the appeal of a reconsideration decision. In addition, such charges may be waived when the Department determines—

              (1) Collection of those charges would be against equity and good conscience under the standards prescribed in §§ 29.523 through 29.525; or
              
              (2) Waiver of those charges would be in the best interest of the United States.
              (c) Collection in installments. (1) Whenever feasible, overpayments will be collected in one lump sum.
              (2) However, installment payments may be effected when—
              (i) The debtor establishes that he or she is financially unable to pay in one lump sum; or
              (ii)(A) The benefit payable is insufficient to make collection in one lump sum;
              (B) The debtor fails to respond to a demand for full payment; and
              (C) Offset is available.
              (d) Offset Amount. (1) The amount offset from a monthly Federal Benefit Payment will be the lesser of:
              (i) The amount of the debt, including any interest, penalties and administrative costs;
              (ii) An amount equal to 15 percent of the monthly Federal Benefit Payment; or
              (iii) The amount, if any, by which the monthly Federal Benefit Payment exceeds $750.
              (2) For purposes of this subsection, the “monthly Federal Benefit Payment” is the amount of the gross monthly benefit after any reductions or deductions required under law, including reductions made to recover overpayments of Federal Benefit Payments.
              (e) Commencement of collection. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, collection will begin after the time limits for requesting further rights stated in §§ 29.512 through 29.514 expire and no such requests have been made, or after the Benefits Administrator and/or the Department have issued decisions on all timely requests for or appeals of those rights, unless failure to make an offset would substantially prejudice the Department's ability to collect the overpayment and the time before the payment is to be made does not reasonably permit the completion of the proceedings in §§ 29.511 through 29.514 or litigation. When offset begins without completion of the administrative review process, these procedures will be completed promptly, and amounts recovered by offset but later found not owed will be refunded promptly.
              (2) The procedures identified in §§ 29.511 through 29.514 will not be applied when the overpayment is caused by—
              (i) A retroactive adjustment in the periodic rate of annuity or any deduction taken from annuity when the adjustment is a result of the annuitant's election of different entitlements under law, if the adjustment is made within 120 days of the effective date of the election; or
              (ii) interim estimated payments made before the formal determination of entitlement to annuity, if the amount is recouped from the total annuity payable on the first day of the month following the later of—
              (A) The last interim payment or
              (B) The date the formal determination is made.
              (f) Collection of delinquent debts—(1) Debts delinquent over 180 days. The Benefits Administrator must refer all overpayment debts that are over 180 days delinquent to the Secretary for collection pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3711(g) and 3716, and 31 CFR part 901.
              (2) Debts delinquent less than 180 days. Once an overpayment debt becomes delinquent, the Benefits Administrator should refer it to the Secretary for collection by centralized administrative offset pursuant to 31 CFR 901.3, unless collection of the debt by some other means is likely to occur in a more timely and efficient manner.
              (3) Once a debt is referred under this subsection, the Benefits Administrator has no further obligation to collect the debt.
            
            
              § 29.517
              Collection by offset.
              (a) Offset from retirement payments. An overpayment may be collected in whole or in part from any refund payment or recurring Federal Benefit Payments.
              (b) Offset from other payments—(1) Administrative offset. When offset under subsection (a) is not available, an overpayment may be offset from other Federal payments due the debtor from other agencies under the procedures set forth in 31 CFR part 5 and 31 CFR 901.3(c).
              
              (2) Salary offset. When the debtor is an employee of the Federal Government, the Department may effect collection of an overpayment by offset of the debtor's pay in accordance with regulations published to implement such offsets under 5 U.S.C. 5514 (see 5 CFR part 550, subpart K; 31 CFR 285.7; and 31 CFR part 5). Due process described in the federal salary offset regulations of 31 CFR part 5 will apply. When the debtor did not receive a hearing under those regulations and requests such a hearing, one will be conducted in accordance with 5 CFR part 550, subpart K and 31 CFR part 5.
              (3) Tax refund offset. The Department may effect collection of an overpayment by offset of the debtor's tax refund in accordance with the Department's tax refund offset regulations found at 31 CFR part 5.
            
            
              § 29.518
              Reporting delinquent debts to credit bureaus.
              (a) Notice. If a debtor's response to the demand letter does not result in payment in full, payment by offset, or payment in accordance with a voluntary repayment agreement or other repayment schedule acceptable to the Benefits Administrator, and the debtor's rights under §§ 29.512 through 29.514 have been exhausted, the Benefits Administrator must report the debtor to a credit bureau. In addition, a debtor's failure to make subsequent payments in accordance with a repayment schedule must result in a report to a credit bureau. Before making a report to a credit bureau, the Benefits Administrator must notify the debtor in writing that—
              (1) The payment is overdue;
              (2) The Benefits Administrator intends, after 60 days, to make a report as described in paragraph (b) of this section to a credit bureau;
              (3) The debtor's right to dispute the liability has been exhausted under §§ 29.512 through 29.514; and
              (4) The debtor may avoid having the Benefits Administrator report the debtor to a credit bureau by paying the debt in one lump sum or making payments current under a repayment schedule.
              (b) Report. If, after being sent the notice described in paragraph (a) of this section, the debtor does not pay the overpayment debt or make payments current under a repayment schedule or fails to respond to the notice, and 60 days have elapsed since the notice was mailed, the Benefits Administrator will report to a credit bureau that the debtor is responsible for an unpaid debt and provide the following information:
              (1) The debtor's name, address, taxpayer identification number, and any other information necessary to establish the identity of the individual;
              (2) The amount, status, and history of the debt; and
              (3) The fact that the debt arose in connection with the administration of Federal Benefit Payments under a District Retirement Fund.
              (c) Subsequent reports. The Benefits Administrator must update its report to the credit bureau whenever it has knowledge of events that substantially change the status or the amount of the liability.
              (d) Other reporting of delinquent debts. Pursuant to 31 CFR 901.4, delinquent overpayment debts should be reported to the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Credit Alert Interactive Voice Response System (CAIVRS).
              (e) Privacy Act considerations. A delinquent debt may not be reported under this section unless a notice issued pursuant to the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4), authorizes the disclosure of information about the debtor to a credit bureau or CAIVRS.
            
            
              § 29.519
              Referral to a collection agency.
              (a) The Department retains the responsibility for resolving disputes, compromising debts, referring overpayment debts for litigation, and suspending or terminating collection action.
              (b) The Department may not refer overpayment debts to commercial collection agencies until all procedures required by or requested under §§ 29.511 through 29.514 have been completed.
            
            
              
              § 29.520
              Referral for litigation.
              The Department may refer to the Justice Department for litigation overpayment debts which cannot be compromised or waived, or on which collection activity cannot be suspended or terminated, and which the Department has been unable to recover pursuant to the collection activity described in §§ 29.511 through 29.519. (See 31 CFR part 904.) Such debts should be referred to the Justice Department as early as possible, but at least within 1 year of the date such debts last became delinquent. In the case of overpayments arising from fraud, misrepresentation, or the presentation of a false claim, referral should be made to the Justice Department immediately. (See 31 CFR 900.3(a).) Referral of a debt to the Justice Department will suspend processing under §§ 29.511 through 29.519 of this subpart.
            
          
          
            Standards for Waiver of Overpayments
            
              § 29.521
              Conditions for waiver and other adjustments.
              (a) General. Overpayments made from the Retirement Funds will be recovered unless there is substantial evidence that the individual from whom recovery is to be made is eligible for waiver.
              (b) Waiver. The Department may waive an overpayment from the Retirement Funds (provided there is no indication of fraud, misrepresentation, or lack of good faith on the part of the debtor) under sections 11021(3) or 11251(c)(2)(B) of the Act when it is established by substantial evidence that the individual from whom recovery is to be made—
              (1) Is not at fault in causing or contributing to the overpayment, and
              (2) Recovery would be against equity and good conscience.
              (c) Adjustment in the installment schedule. (1)(i) An overpayment will not be waived because of financial hardship if a reasonable installment schedule can be established for repayment of the debt by adjusting the installment schedule originally established.
              (ii) For example, if the Department finds that the original installment schedule—24 installments at $125 each—causes the debtor financial hardship, but that repayment in 60 installments at $50 each does not, it may adjust the installments and recover the debt in full.
              (2) Where it has been determined that an individual is ineligible for a waiver, but the individual has shown that collection action pursuant to the original installment schedule would cause him or her financial hardship, the Department may—
              (i) Adjust the installment schedule if the individual shows that it would cause him or her financial hardship to make payments at the rate initially scheduled by the Department; or
              (ii) Terminate the collection action under 31 CFR 903.3 if the costs of collecting the debt are anticipated to exceed the amount recoverable.
            
            
              § 29.522
              Fault.
              (a) General rule. A debtor is considered to be at fault if he or she, or any other person having an interest in obtaining a waiver of the claim, caused or contributed to the accrual of the overpayment. The Department considers a debtor or any other person having an interest in obtaining a waiver of the claim to have caused or contributed to the accrual of an overpayment if—
              (1) Payment resulted from the individual's incorrect but not fraudulent statement, which the individual knew or should have known to be incorrect; or
              (2) Payment resulted from the individual's failure to disclose facts in his or her possession which the individual knew or should have known were material, when the Department has identified that the individual has a duty to report and has clearly notified the individual of this reporting requirement.
              (3) The following factors may affect the decision as to whether the debtor is or is not at fault where the debtor submitted an incorrect statement, or the debtor failed to disclose material facts in his or her possession—
              (i) The debtor's age;
              (ii) The debtor's physical and/or mental condition; and
              (iii) The availability and nature of the information provided to the debtor by the Department.
              (b) Knowledge of an overpayment. (1) Individuals who are aware that they are not entitled to a payment or are aware that a payment is higher than the payment to which they are entitled are not considered to have contributed to the overpayment if they promptly contact the Benefits Administrator and question the correctness of the payment and take no further action in reliance of the overpayment.
              (2) Any contact made with the Benefits Administrator concerning the overpayment within 60 days of receipt (if the overpayment is a recurring payment, contact must be made within 60 days of the initial payment) will satisfy the prompt notification requirement.
              (c) Reasonable person standard. The Department will use a reasonable person standard to determine whether an individual should have known that a statement was incorrect or that material facts in the individual's possession should have been disclosed. The reasonable person standard will take into account the objective factors set forth is paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
            
            
              § 29.523
              Equity and good conscience.
              Recovery is against equity and good conscience when there is substantial evidence that—
              (a) It would cause financial hardship to the person from whom it is sought no matter what the amount and length of the proposed installment;
              (b) The recipient of the overpayment can show (regardless of his or her financial circumstances) that due to the notice that such payment would be made or because of the incorrect payment he or she either has relinquished a valuable right or has changed positions for the worse; or
              (c) Recovery would be unconscionable under the circumstances.
            
            
              § 29.524
              Financial hardship.

              Financial hardship may be deemed to exist when the debtor needs substantially all of his or her current and anticipated income and liquid assets to meet current and anticipated ordinary and necessary living expenses during the projected period of collection. Financial hardship will not be found to exist when the debtor merely establishes that the repayment causes a financial burden, i.e., when it is inconvenient to repay the debt. If there are anticipated changes in income or expenses that would allow for the recovery of the overpayment at a later date, the Department may suspend collection action until a future date.
              (a) Considerations. Pertinent considerations in determining whether recovery would cause financial hardship include the following:
              (1) The debtor's financial ability to pay at the time collection is scheduled to be made, and
              (2) Income to other family member(s), if such member's ordinary and necessary living expenses are included in expenses reported by the debtor.
            
            
              § 29.525
              Ordinary and necessary living expenses.
              An individual's ordinary and necessary living expenses include rent, mortgage payments, utilities, maintenance, transportation, food, clothing, insurance (life, health, and accident), taxes, installment payments for which the individual is already liable, medical expenses, support expenses for which the individual is legally responsible, and other miscellaneous expenses that the individual can establish as being ordinary and necessary.
            
            
              § 29.526
              Waiver precluded.
              Waivers will not be offered or granted when—
              (1) The overpayment was obtained by fraud, misrepresentation, or by improper negotiation of checks or withdrawal of electronic fund transfer payments after the death of the payee; or
              (2) The overpayment was made to an estate and a timely demand for repayment is made prior to the final disbursement by the administrator or executor of the estate.

          § 30.0
          Executive compensation and corporate governance.
          The following questions and answers reflect the executive compensation and corporate governance requirements of section 111 of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, as amended (12 U.S.C. 5221) (EESA), with respect to participation in the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) established by the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) thereunder.
        
        
          § 30.1
          Q-1: What definitions apply in this part?
          
            Affiliate. The term “affiliate” means an “affiliate” as that term is defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act of 1933 (17 CFR 230.405).
          
            Annual compensation. (1) General rule. The term “annual compensation” means, except as otherwise explicitly provided in this part, the dollar value for total compensation for the applicable fiscal year as determined pursuant to Item 402(a) of Regulation S-K under the Federal securities laws (17 CFR 229.402(a)). Accordingly, for this purpose the amounts required to be disclosed pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(viii) of Item 402(a) of Regulation S-K (actuarial increases in pension plans and above market earnings on deferred compensation) are not required to be included in annual compensation.
          (2) Application to private TARP recipients. For purposes of determining annual compensation, a TARP recipient that does not have securities registered with the SEC pursuant to the Federal securities laws must follow the requirements set forth in paragraph (1) of this definition.
          
            ARRA. The term “ARRA” means the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub. L. 111-5).
          
          
            Benefit plan. The term “benefit plan” means any plan, contract, agreement or other arrangement that is an “employee welfare benefit plan” as that term is defined in section 3(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (29 U.S.C. 1002(1)), or other usual and customary plans such as dependent care, tuition reimbursement, group legal services or cafeteria plans; provided, however, that this term does not include:
          (1) Any plan that is a deferred compensation plan; or
          (2) Any severance pay plan, whether or not nondiscriminatory, or any other arrangement that provides for payment of severance benefits to eligible employees upon voluntary termination for good reason, involuntary termination, or termination under a window program as defined in 26 CFR 1.409A-1(b)(9)(vi).
          
            Bonus. The term “bonus” means any payment in addition to any amount payable to an employee for services performed by the employee at a regular hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or similar periodic rate. Such term generally does not include payments to or on behalf of an employee as contributions to any qualified retirement plan (as defined in section 4974(c) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 4974(c)), benefits under a broad-based benefit plan, bona fide overtime pay, or bona fide and routine expense reimbursements. In addition, provided that the rate of commission is pre-established and reasonable, and is applied consistently to the sale of substantially similar goods or services, commission compensation will not be treated as a bonus. For this purpose, a bonus may include a contribution to, or other increase in benefits under, a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, regardless of when the actual payment will be made under the plan. A bonus may also qualify as a retention award or as incentive compensation.
          
            Bonus payment. For purposes of this part, except where otherwise noted, the term “bonus payment” includes a payment that is, or is in the nature of, a bonus, incentive compensation, or retention award. Whether a payment is a bonus payment, or whether the right to a payment is a right to a bonus payment, is determined based upon all the facts and circumstances, and a payment may be a bonus payment regardless of the characterization of such payment by the TARP recipient or the employee. For purposes of this part, a bonus payment may include the forgiveness of a loan or other amount that otherwise may be required to be paid by the employee to the employer.
          
            Commission compensation. (1) Definition. The term “commission compensation” means:
          (i) Compensation or portions of compensation earned by an employee consistent with a program in existence for that type of employee as of February 17, 2009, if a substantial portion of the services provided by this employee consists of the direct sale of a product or service to an unrelated customer, these sales occur frequently and in the ordinary course of business of the TARP recipient (but not a specified transaction, such as an initial public offering or sale or acquisition of a specified entity or entities), the compensation paid by the TARP recipient to the employee consists of either a portion of the purchase price for the product or service sold to the unrelated customer or an amount substantially all of which is calculated by reference to the volume of sales to the unrelated customers, and payment of the compensation is either contingent upon the TARP recipient receiving payment from the unrelated customer for the product or service or, if applied consistently to all similarly situated employees, is contingent upon the closing of the sales transaction and such other requirements as may be specified by the TARP recipient before the closing of the sales transaction with the unrelated customer;

          (ii) Compensation or portions of compensation earned by an employee that meet the requirements of paragraph (1)(i) of this definition except that the transaction occurs with a related customer, provided that substantial sales from which commission compensation arises are made, or substantial services from which commission compensation arises are provided, to unrelated customers by the service recipient, the sales and service arrangement and the commission arrangement with respect to the related customer are bona fide, arise from the service recipient's ordinary course of business, and are substantially the same, both in term and in practice, as the terms and practices applicable to unrelated customers to which individually or in the aggregate substantial sales are made or substantial services provided by the service recipient; or
          (iii) Compensation or portions of compensation earned by an employee consistent with a program in existence for that type of employee as of February 17, 2009, if a substantial portion of the services provided by this employee to the TARP recipient consists of sales of financial products or other direct customer services with respect to unrelated customer assets or unrelated customer asset accounts that are generally intended to be held indefinitely (and not customer assets intended to be used for a specific transaction, such as an initial public offering, or sale or acquisition of a specified entity or entities), the unrelated customer retains the right to terminate the customer relationship and may move or liquidate the assets or asset accounts without undue delay (which may be subject to a reasonable notice period), the compensation consists of a portion of the value of the unrelated customer's overall assets or asset account balance, an amount substantially all of which is calculated by reference to the increase in the value of the overall assets or account balance during a specified period, or both, or is calculated by reference to a contractual benchmark (such as a securities index or peer results), and the value of the overall assets or account balance and commission compensation is determined at least annually. For purposes of this definition, a customer is treated as an unrelated customer if the person would not be treated as related to the TARP recipient under 26 CFR 1.409A-1(f)(2)(ii) and the person would not be treated as providing management services to the TARP recipient under 26 CFR 1.409A-1(f)(2)(iv).
          (2) Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of paragraph (1) of this definition:
          
          
            Example 1.
            Employee A is an employee of TARP recipient. Among TARP recipient's businesses is the sale of life insurance policies, and TARP recipient buys and sells such policies frequently as part of its ordinary course of business. Employee A's primary duties consist of selling life insurance policies to customers unrelated to the TARP recipient. Under a commission program existing for all TARP Recipient employees selling life insurance policies as of February 17, 2009, Employee A is entitled to receive an amount equal to 75% of the total first year's premium paid by an unrelated customer to whom Employee A has sold a life insurance policy. The payments to Employee A under the program constitute commission compensation.
          
          
            Example 2.
            The same facts as Example 1, except that under the program, the rate of commission increases to 80% of the total first year's premium paid by a customer once Employee A has sold $10 million in policies in a year. Provided that 80% is a reasonable commission, the payments to Employee A under the program constitute commission compensation.
          
          
            Example 3.
            Employee B is an employee of TARP recipient. Among TARP recipient's businesses is the investment management of unrelated customer asset accounts, and TARP recipient provides such services routinely and in the ordinary course of business. Employee B's primary duties as an employee consist of managing the investments of the asset accounts of specified unrelated customers who have deposited amounts with the TARP recipient. Under a program in existence on February 17, 2009, Employee B is entitled to receive an amount equal to 1% of the aggregate account balances of the assets under management, as determined each December 31. The payments to Employee B constitute commission compensation.
          
          
            Example 4.
            TARP recipient employs Employee C. As part of Employee C's duties, Employee C is responsible for specified aspects of any acquisition of an unrelated entity by TARP Recipient. As part of an acquisition in 2009, Employee C is entitled to 1% of the purchase price if and when the transaction closes. Regardless of whether such an arrangement was customary or established under a specific program as of February 17, 2009, the amount is not commission compensation because the compensation relates to a specified transaction, in this case the purchase of the entity. Accordingly, the compensation is incentive compensation.
          
          
            Example 5.

            TARP recipient employs Employee D. As part of Employee D's duties, Employee D is responsible for managing the initial public offerings of securities of unrelated customers of TARP recipient. As part of an initial public offering in 2009, Employee D is entitled to 1% of the purchase price if and when the initial public offering closes. Regardless of whether such an arrangement was customary or established under a specific program as of February 17, 2009, the amount is not commission compensation because the compensation relates to a specified transaction, in this case the initial public offering. Accordingly, the compensation is incentive compensation.
          
          
          
            Compensation means all remuneration for employment, including but not limited to salary, commissions, tips, welfare benefits, retirement benefits, fringe benefits and perquisites.
          
            Compensation committee. (1) General rule. The term “compensation committee” means a committee of independent directors, whose independence is determined pursuant to Item 407(a) of Regulation S-K under the Federal securities laws (17 CFR 229.407(a)).
          (2) Application to private TARP recipients. For purposes of determining director independence, a TARP recipient that does not have securities registered with the SEC pursuant to the Federal securities laws must follow the requirements set forth in Item 407(a)(1)(ii) of Regulation S-K under the Federal securities laws (17 CFR 229.407(a)(1)(ii)).
          
            Compensation structure. The term “compensation structure” means the characteristics of the various forms of total compensation that an employee receives or may receive, including the amounts of such compensation or potential compensation relative to the amounts of other types of compensation or potential compensation, the amounts of such compensation or potential compensation relative to the total compensation over the relevant period, and how such various forms of compensation interrelate to provide the employee his or her ultimate total compensation. These characteristics include, but are not limited to, whether the compensation is provided as salary, short-term incentive compensation, or long-term incentive compensation, whether the compensation is provided as cash compensation, equity-based compensation, or other types of compensation (such as executive pensions, other benefits or perquisites), and whether the compensation is provided as current compensation or deferred compensation.
          
            Deferred compensation plan. The term “deferred compensation plan” means
          (1) Any plan, contract, agreement, or other arrangement under which an employee voluntarily elects to defer all or a portion of the reasonable compensation, wages, or fees paid for services rendered which otherwise would have been paid to the employee at the time the services were rendered (including a plan that provides for the crediting of a reasonable investment return on such elective deferrals), provided that the TARP recipient either:
          (i) Recognizes a compensation expense and accrues a liability for the benefit payments according to GAAP; or
          (ii) Segregates or otherwise sets aside assets in a trust which may only be used to pay plan and other benefits, except that the assets of this trust may be available to satisfy claims of the TARP recipient's creditors in the case of insolvency; or
          (2) A nonqualified deferred compensation or supplemental retirement plan, other than an elective deferral plan established by a TARP recipient:
          (i) Primarily for the purpose of providing benefits for a select group of directors, management, or highly compensated employees in excess of the limitations on contributions and benefits imposed by sections 415, 401(a)(17), 402(g) or any other applicable provision of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 415, 401(a)(17), 402(g)); or
          (ii) Primarily for the purpose for providing supplemental retirement benefits or other deferred compensation for a select group of directors, management or highly compensated employees (excluding severance payments).
          
            EESA. The term “EESA” means the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, as amended.
          
            Employee. The term “employee” means an individual serving as a servant in the conventional master-servant relationship as understood by the common-law agency doctrine. In general, a partner of a partnership, a member of a limited liability company, or other similar owner in a similar type of entity, will not be treated as an employee for this purpose. However, to the extent that the primary purpose for the creation or utilization of such partnership, limited liability company, or other similar type of entity is to avoid or evade any or all of the requirements of section 111 of EESA or these regulations with respect to a partner, member or other similar owner, the partner, member or other similar owner will be treated as an employee. In addition, a personal service corporation or similar intermediary between the TARP recipient and an individual providing services to the TARP recipient will be disregarded for purposes of determining whether such individual is an employee of the TARP recipient.
          
            Employee compensation plan. The term “employee compensation plan” means “plan” as that term is defined in Item 402(a)(6)(ii) of Regulation S-K under the Federal securities laws (17 CFR 229.402(a)(6)(ii)), but only any employee compensation plan in which two or more employees participate and without regard to whether an executive officer participates in the employee compensation plan.
          
            Exceptional financial assistance. The term “exceptional financial assistance” means any financial assistance provided under the Programs for Systemically Significant Failing Institutions, the Targeted Investment Program, the Automotive Industry Financing Program, and any new program designated by the Secretary as providing exceptional financial assistance.
          
            Excessive or luxury expenditures. The term “excessive or luxury expenditures” means excessive expenditures on any of the following to the extent such expenditures are not reasonable expenditures for staff development, reasonable performance incentives, or other similar reasonable measures conducted in the normal course of the TARP recipient's business operations:
          (1) Entertainment or events;
          (2) Office and facility renovations;
          (3) Aviation or other transportation services; and
          (4) Other similar items, activities, or events for which the TARP recipient may reasonably anticipate incurring expenses, or reimbursing an employee for incurring expenses.
          
            Excessive or luxury expenditures policy. The term “excessive or luxury expenditures policy” means written standards applicable to the TARP recipient and its employees that address the four categories of expenses set forth in the definition of “excessive or luxury expenditures” (entertainment or events, office and facility renovations, aviation or other transportation services, and other similar items, activities or events), and that are reasonably designed to eliminate excessive and luxury expenditures. Such written standards must:
          (1) Identify the types or categories of expenditures which are prohibited (which may include a threshold expenditure amount per item, activity, or event or a threshold expenditure amount per employee receiving the item or participating in the activity or event);
          (2) Identify the types or categories of expenditures for which prior approval is required (which may include a threshold expenditure amount per item, activity, or event or a threshold expenditure amount per employee receiving the item or participating in the activity or event);
          (3) Provide reasonable approval procedures under which an expenditure requiring prior approval may be approved;
          (4) Require PEO and PFO certification that the approval of any expenditure requiring the prior approval of any SEO, any executive officer of a substantially similar level of responsibility, or the TARP recipient's board of directors (or a committee of such board of directors), was properly obtained with respect to each such expenditure;
          (5) Require the prompt internal reporting of violations to an appropriate person or persons identified in this policy; and
          (6) Mandate accountability for adherence to this policy.
          
            Executive officer. The term “executive officer” means an “executive officer” as that term is defined in Rule 3b-7 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) (17 CFR 240.3b-7).
          
            Financial assistance. (1) Definition. The term “financial assistance” means any funds or fund commitment provided through the purchase of troubled assets under the authority granted to Treasury under section 101 of EESA or the insurance of troubled assets under the authority granted to Treasury under section 102 of EESA, provided that the term “financial assistance” does not include any loan modification under sections 101 and 109 of EESA. A change in the form of previously received financial assistance, such as a conversion of convertible preferred stock to common stock, is not treated as new or additional financial assistance.
          (2) Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of paragraph (1) of this definition:
          
          
            Example 1.
            Company A sells $500,000,000 of preferred stock to Treasury through the Capital Purchase Program. Company A has received financial assistance.
          
          
            Example 2.
            Company B posts collateral to and receives a loan from the Federal Reserve special purpose vehicle under the Term Asset-Backed Security Loan Facility program. Company B has neither sold troubled assets to Treasury, nor insured troubled assets through Treasury, and therefore has not received financial assistance.
          
          
            Example 3.
            LP C is a limited partnership established for the purpose of participating in the Public Private Investment Program. LP C has a general partner (GP) that makes management decisions on behalf of LP C. A limited liability company controlled by an affiliate of GP (LLC partner) raises $55,000,000 from twenty investors, with each investing equal shares, joins LP C as a limited partner, and invests those funds for a 55% equity interest in LP C. LP C sells a $45,000,000 equity interest to Treasury. LP C, at the direction of the GP, will buy and sell securities as investments and manage those investments. LP C will contract for investment advice from an investment advisor that is an affiliate of GP. LP C has received financial assistance. LLC partner has received financial assistance because it is treated as the same employer as LP C according to the standards set forth in paragraph (1)(ii) of the definition of “TARP recipient”. The investors in the LLC partner have not received financial assistance because they are not treated as the same employer as LP C according to the standards set forth in paragraph (1)(ii) of the definition of “TARP recipient”. GP is not an employee of LP C pursuant to the definition of “employee” in this rule, and is not treated as the same employer as LP C according to the standards set forth in paragraph (1)(ii) of the definition of “TARP recipient”. The investment advisor-contractor to LP C has not received financial assistance. Entities that sell securities to or buy securities from LP C have neither sold troubled assets to Treasury nor insured troubled assets through Treasury, and therefore have not received financial assistance.
          
          
            Example 4.
            Company D, a servicer of mortgage loans or mortgaged-backed securities, issues a financial instrument to Treasury's financial agent in which Company D commits to modify mortgages it is servicing consistent with guidelines established by Treasury under the Home Affordable Modification Program. Treasury, through its financial agent, commits to pay up to $800,000,000 in incentive payments and credit enhancements for Company E's commitment to modify mortgages. Company E has not received financial assistance.
          
          
          
            GAAP. The term “GAAP” means U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
          
            Golden parachute payment. (1) General rule. The term “golden parachute payment” means any payment for the departure from a TARP recipient for any reason, or any payment due to a change in control of the TARP recipient or any entity that is included in a group of entities treated as one TARP recipient, except for payments for services performed or benefits accrued. For this purpose, a change in control includes any event that would qualify as a change in control event as defined in 26 CFR 1.280G-1, Q&A-27 through Q&A-29 or as a change in control event as defined in 26 CFR 1.409A-3(i)(5)(i). For this purpose, a golden parachute payment includes the acceleration of vesting due to the departure or the change in control event, as applicable. A golden parachute payment is treated as paid at the time of departure or change in control event, and is equal to the aggregate present value of all payments made for a departure or a change in control event (including the entire aggregate present value of the payment if the vesting period was not otherwise completed but was accelerated due to departure, regardless of whatever portion of the required vesting period the employee had completed). Thus, a golden parachute payment may include a right to amounts actually payable after the TARP period.
          (2) Exclusions. For purposes of this part, a golden parachute payment does not include any of the following:

          (i) Any payment made pursuant to a pension or retirement plan which is qualified (or is intended within a reasonable period of time to be qualified) under section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 401) or pursuant to a pension or other retirement plan which is governed by the laws of any foreign country;
          
          (ii) Any payment made by reason of the departure of the employee due to the employee's death or disability; or
          (iii) Any severance or similar payment which is required to be made pursuant to a State statute or foreign law (independent of any terms of a contract or other agreement) which is applicable to all employers within the appropriate jurisdiction (with the exception of employers that may be exempt due to their small number of employees or other similar criteria).
          (3) Payments for services performed or benefits accrued—(i) General rules. Except as otherwise provided for payments made under a deferred compensation plan or a benefit plan in paragraph (4) of this definition, a payment made, or a right to a payment arising under a plan, contract, agreement, or other arrangement (including the acceleration of any vesting conditions) is for services performed or benefits accrued only if the payment was made, or the right to the payment arose, for current or prior services to the TARP recipient (except that an appropriate allowance may be made for services for a predecessor employer). Whether a payment is for services performed or benefits accrued is determined based on all the facts and circumstances. However, a payment, or a right to a payment, generally will be treated as a payment for services performed or benefits accrued only if the payment would be made regardless of whether the employee departs or the change in control event occurs, or if the payment is due upon the departure of the employee, regardless of whether the departure is voluntary or involuntary (other than reasonable restrictions, such as the forfeiture of the right to a payment for an involuntary departure for cause, but not restrictions relating to whether the departure was a voluntary departure for good reason or subsequent to a change in control).
          (ii) Examples. The following examples illustrate the general rules in paragraph (3)(i) of this definition:
          
          
            Example 1.
            Employee A is a SEO of Entity B at all relevant times. On September 1, 2007, Employee A received a stock appreciation right granting him the right to appreciation on the underlying shares that would vest 25% for every twelve months of continued services. Under the terms of the grant, the stock appreciation right would be immediately exercised and payable upon termination of employment. Entity B becomes a TARP recipient in December 2008. On September 1, 2009, Entity B involuntarily terminates Employee A, at which time Employee A receives a payment equal to the post-September 1, 2007 appreciation on 50% of the shares under the stock appreciation right (the portion of the shares that had vested before the termination of employment). The payment is treated as a payment for services performed and does not constitute a golden parachute payment.
          
          
            Example 2.
            The facts are the same as the facts in Example 1, except that under Employee A's employment agreement, Employee A is entitled to accelerate vesting if Employee A is terminated involuntarily other than for cause. If Entity B pays Employee A the post-September 1, 2007 appreciation on 100% of the shares under the stock appreciation right, the portion of the payment representing the additional 50% accelerated vesting due to the termination of employment would not be for services performed and would be a golden parachute payment.
          
          
          (4) Payments from benefit plans and deferred compensation plans. A payment from a benefit plan or a deferred compensation plan is treated as a payment for services performed or benefits accrued only if the following conditions are met:
          (i) The plan was in effect at least one year prior to the employee's departure;
          (ii) The payment is made pursuant to the plan and is made in accordance with the terms of the plan as in effect no later than one year before the departure and in accordance with any amendments to the plan during this one year period that do not increase the benefits payable hereunder;
          (iii) The employee has a vested right, as defined under the applicable plan document, at the time of the departure or the change in control event (but not due to the departure or the change in control event) to the payments under the plan;

          (iv) Benefits under the plan are accrued each period only for current or prior service rendered to the TARP recipient (except that an appropriate allowance may be made for service for a predecessor employer);
          
          (v) Any payment made pursuant to the plan is not based on any discretionary acceleration of vesting or accrual of benefits which occurs at any time later than one year before the departure or the change in control event; and
          (vi) With respect to payments under a deferred compensation plan, the TARP recipient has previously recognized compensation expense and accrued a liability for the benefit payments according to GAAP or segregated or otherwise set aside assets in a trust which may only be used to pay plan benefits, except that the assets of this trust may be available to satisfy claims of the TARP recipient's creditors in the case of insolvency and payments pursuant to the plan are not in excess of the accrued liability computed in accordance with GAAP.
          
            Gross-up. The term “gross-up” means any reimbursement of taxes owed with respect to any compensation, provided that a gross-up does not include a payment under a tax equalization agreement, which is an agreement, method, program, or other arrangement that provides payments intended to compensate an employee for some or all of the excess of the taxes actually imposed by a foreign jurisdiction on the compensation paid by the TARP recipient to the employee over the taxes that would be imposed if the compensation were subject solely to U.S. Federal, State, and local income tax, or some or all of the excess of the U.S. Federal, State, and local income tax actually imposed on the compensation paid by the TARP recipient to the employee over the taxes that would be imposed if the compensation were subject solely to taxes in the applicable foreign jurisdiction, provided that the payment made under such agreement, method, program, or other arrangement may not exceed such excess and the amount necessary to compensate for the additional taxes on the amount paid under the agreement, method, program, or other arrangement.
          
            Incentive compensation. The term “incentive compensation” means compensation provided under an incentive plan.
          
            Incentive plan. (1) Definition. The term “incentive plan” means an “incentive plan” as that term is defined in Item 402(a)(6)(iii) of Regulation S-K under the Federal securities laws (17 CFR 229.402(a)(6)(iii)), and any plan providing stock or options as defined in Item 402(a)(6)(i) of Regulation S-K under the Federal securities laws (17 CFR 229.402(a)(6)(i)) or other equity-based compensation such as restricted stock units or stock appreciation rights, except for the payment of salary or other permissible payments in stock, stock units, or other property as described in paragraph (2) of this definition. An incentive plan does not include the payment of salary, but does include an arrangement under which an employee would earn compensation in the nature of a commission, unless such compensation qualifies as commission compensation (as defined above). Accordingly, an incentive plan includes an arrangement under which an employee receives compensation only upon the completion of a specified transaction, such as an initial public offering or sale or acquisition of a specified entity or entities, regardless of how such compensation is measured. For examples, see the definition of “commission compensation,” above. An incentive plan, or a grant under an incentive plan, may also qualify as a bonus or a retention award.
          (2) Salary or other permissible payments paid in property. The term “incentive plan” does not include an arrangement under which an employee receives salary or another permissible payment in property, such as TARP recipient stock, provided that such property is not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture (as defined in 26 CFR 1.83-3(c)) or other future period of required services, the amount of the payment is determinable as a dollar amount through the date such compensation is earned (for example, an agreement that salary payments will be made in stock equal to the value of the cash payment that would otherwise be due), and the amount of stock or other property accrues at the same time or times as the salary or other permissible payments would otherwise be paid in cash. The term “incentive plan” also does not include an arrangement under which an employee receives a restricted stock unit that is analogous to TARP recipient stock, that otherwise meets the requirements of the previous sentence. For this purpose, a unit is analogous to stock if the unit is based upon stock of the TARP recipient, or is applied as if the applicable entity, division, or other unit were a corporation with one class of stock and the number of units of stock granted is determined based on a fixed percentage of the overall value of this corporation, and the term “TARP recipient stock” with respect to a particular employee recipient means the stock of a corporation (or the entity, division, or other unit the value of which forms the basis for the unit) that is an “eligible issuer of service recipient stock” under 26 CFR 1.409A-1(b)(5)(iii)(E) (applied by analogy to non-corporate entities).
          (3) Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of paragraph (2) of this definition.
          
          
            Example 1.
            Employee is an employee of TARP recipient. For 2010, TARP recipient agrees to pay a salary of $15,000, payable monthly. At each salary payment date Employee will receive a $10,000 payment in cash, and be transferred a number of shares of common stock of TARP recipient equal to $5,000 divided by the fair market value of a share of common stock on the salary payment date. The arrangement is for the payment of salary, and is not an incentive plan.
          
          
            Example 2.
            Same facts as Example 1, except that pursuant to a valid elective deferral election, Employee elects to defer 20% of each salary payment into a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. At each salary payment date Employee will receive an $8,000 payment in cash, be transferred a number of shares of common stock of TARP recipient equal to $4,000 divided by the fair market value of a share of common stock on the salary payment date, and a $3,000 contribution to an account under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. The arrangement is for the payment of salary, and is not an incentive plan.
          
          
            Example 3.
            Employee is an employee of TARP recipient. For 2010, TARP recipient agrees to pay a salary of $15,000, payable monthly. At each salary payment date, Employee will receive a $10,000 payment in cash, and accrue a right to a number of shares of common stock of TARP recipient equal to $5,000 divided by the fair market value of a share of common stock on the salary payment date. At the end of the year, TARP recipient will transfer the total number of accrued shares to Employee, subject to a multi-year holding period (a restriction that the shares may not be transferred or otherwise disposed of by Employee for a specified number of years). If Employee's employment with the TARP recipient terminates during the holding period, the termination will not affect the duration or application of the holding period or Employee's right to retain the shares and to transfer or otherwise dispose of them at the end of the holding period. The arrangement is for the payment of salary, and is not an incentive plan. The arrangement would also be for the payment of salary, and not an incentive plan, if the arrangement provided that the holding period was to last until the later of a specified time period or a specified time following Employee's retirement or other termination of employment.
          
          
            Example 4.
            Employee is an employee of TARP recipient. For 2010, TARP recipient agrees to pay a salary of $15,000, payable monthly. At each salary payment date, Employee will receive a $10,000 payment in cash, and accrue a right to a contribution to an account equal to $5,000 divided by the fair market value of a share on the salary payment date. The account balance will be subject to notional gains and losses based on the investment return on TARP recipient common stock. The amount will be payable upon the last day of the second year immediately following the year the services are performed. The arrangement is for the payment of salary, and is not an incentive plan. However, the arrangement generally will provide deferred compensation for purposes of section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.
          
          
          
            Internal Revenue Code. The term “Internal Revenue Code” means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
          
            Long-term restricted stock. The term “long-term restricted stock” means restricted stock or restricted stock units that include the following features:

          (1) The restricted stock or restricted stock units are issued with respect to common stock of the TARP recipient. For this purpose, a restricted stock unit includes a unit that is payable, or may be payable, in cash or stock, provided that the value of the payment is equal to the value of the underlying stock. With respect to a specified division or other unit within a TARP recipient or a TARP recipient that is not a stock corporation, a unit analogous to common stock may be used. For this purpose, a unit is analogous to common stock if applied as if the entity, division, or other unit were a corporation with one class of common stock and the number of units of common stock granted is determined based on a fixed percentage of the overall value of this corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to a particular employee recipient, the corporation the stock of which is utilized (or the entity, division, or other unit the value of which forms the basis for the unit) must be an “eligible issuer of service recipient stock” under 26 CFR 1.409A-1(b)(5)(iii)(E) (applied by analogy to non-corporate entities).
          (2) The restricted stock or restricted stock unit may not become transferable (as defined in 26 CFR 1.83-3(d)), or payable as applied to a restricted stock unit, at any time earlier than permitted under the following schedule (except as necessary to reflect a merger or acquisition of the TARP recipient):
          (i) 25% of the shares or units granted at the time of repayment of 25% of the aggregate financial assistance received.
          (ii) An additional 25% of the shares or units granted (for an aggregate total of 50% of the shares or units granted) at the time of repayment of 50% of the aggregate financial assistance received.
          (iii) An additional 25% of the shares or units granted (for an aggregate total of 75% of the shares or units granted) at the time of repayment of 75% of the aggregate financial assistance received.
          (iv) The remainder of the shares or units granted at the time of repayment of 100% of the aggregate financial assistance received.
          (3) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of restricted stock for which the employee does not make an election under section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 83(b)), at any time beginning with the date upon which the stock becomes substantially vested (as defined in 26 CFR 1.83-3(b)) and ending on December 31 of the calendar year including that date, a portion of the restricted stock may be made transferable as may reasonably be required to pay the Federal, State, local, or foreign taxes that are anticipated to apply to the income recognized due to this vesting, and the amounts made transferable for this purpose shall not count toward the percentages in the schedule above.
          (4) The employee must be required to forfeit the restricted stock or restricted stock unit if the employee does not continue performing substantial services for the TARP recipient for at least two years from the date of grant, other than due to the employee's death or disability, or a change in control event (as defined in 26 CFR 1.280G-1, Q&A-27 through Q&A-29 or as defined in 26 CFR 1.409A-3(i)(5)(i)) with respect to the TARP recipient before the second anniversary of the date of grant.
          (5) Nothing in paragraphs (1), (2), (3), and (4) of this definition is intended to prevent the placement on such restricted stock or restricted stock unit of any additional restrictions, conditions, or limitations that are not inconsistent with the requirements of these paragraphs.
          
            Most highly compensated employee. (1) In general. The terms “most highly compensated employee” or “most highly compensated employees” mean the employee or employees of the TARP recipient whose annual compensation is determined to be the highest among all employees of the TARP recipient, provided that, solely for purposes of identifying the employees who are subject to any rule applicable to both the SEOs and one or more of the most highly compensated employees of the TARP recipient, SEOs of the TARP recipient are excluded when identifying the most highly compensated employee(s). For this purpose, a former employee who is no longer employed as of the first date of the relevant fiscal year of the TARP recipient is not a most highly compensated employee unless it is reasonably anticipated that such employee will return to employment with the TARP recipient during such fiscal year.
          (2) Application to new entities. For an entity that is created or organized in the same year that the entity becomes a TARP recipient, a most highly compensated employee for the first year includes the person that the TARP recipient determines will be the most highly compensated employee for the next year based upon a reasonable, good faith determination of the projected annual compensation of such person earned during that year. This determination must be made as of the later of the date the entity is created or organized or the date the entity becomes a TARP recipient, and must be made only once. However, a person need not yet be an employee to be treated as a most highly compensated employee, if it is reasonably anticipated that the person will become an employee of the TARP recipient during the first year.
          
            Obligation. (1) Definition. The term “obligation” means a requirement for, or an ability of, a TARP recipient to repay financial assistance received from Treasury, as provided in the terms of the applicable financial instrument and related agreements, through the repayment of a debt obligation or the redemption or repurchase of an equity security, but not including warrants to purchase common stock of the TARP recipient.
          (2) Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of paragraph (1) of this definition.
          
          
            Example 1.
            TARP recipient sells $500 million of preferred stock to Treasury, and provides warrants to Treasury for the purchase of $75 million of common stock. The TARP recipient has an ability to redeem the preferred stock and thus maintains an outstanding obligation to Treasury.
          
          
            Example 2.
            Same facts as Example 1, except that TARP recipient redeems the $500 million of preferred stock, so that Treasury holds only the $75 million of warrants to purchase common stock outstanding. TARP recipient does not maintain an outstanding obligation to Treasury.
          
          
            Example 3.
            TARP recipient sells $120 million of securities backed by Small Business Administration-guaranteed loans to Treasury through the Consumer and Business Lending initiative, and provides warrants to Treasury for the purchase of $10 million of common stock. Because the TARP recipient does not as a result of this transaction owe a debt obligation or have a requirement or right to redeem or repurchase an equity security (other than the warrants to purchase common stock provided to the Treasury), the TARP recipient does not have an outstanding obligation to Treasury as a result of this transaction.
          
          
          
            PEO. The term “PEO” means the principal executive officer or an employee acting in a similar capacity.
          
            Perquisite. The term “perquisite” means a “perquisite or other personal benefit” the amount of which is required to be included in the amount reported under Item 402(c)(2)(ix)(A) of Regulation S-K under the Federal securities laws (17 CFR 229.402(c)(2)(ix)(A)) (Column (i) of the Summary Compensation Table (All Other Compensation)), modified to also include any such perquisite or other personal benefit provided to a most highly compensated employee subject to § 30.11(b) (Q-11).
          
            PFO. The term “PFO” means the principal financial officer or an employee acting in a similar capacity.
          
            Primary regulatory agency. The term “primary regulatory agency” means the Federal regulatory agency that has primary supervisory authority over the TARP recipient. For a TARP recipient that is a State-chartered bank that does not have securities registered with the SEC pursuant to the Federal securities laws, the primary regulatory agency is the TARP recipient's primary Federal banking regulator. If a TARP recipient is not subject to the supervision of a Federal regulatory agency, the term “primary regulatory agency” means the Treasury.
          
            Repayment. The term “repayment” means satisfaction of an obligation.
          
            Retention award. (1) General definition. The term “retention award” means any payment to an employee, other than a payment of commission compensation, a payment made pursuant to a pension or retirement plan which is qualified (or is intended within a reasonable period of time to be qualified) under section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 401), a payment made pursuant to a benefit plan, or a payment of a fringe benefit, overtime pay, or reasonable expense reimbursement that:
          (i) Is not payable periodically to an employee for services performed by the employee at a regular hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or similar periodic rate (or would not be payable in such manner absent an elective deferral election);

          (ii) Is contingent on the completion of a period of future service with the TARP recipient or the completion of a specific project or other activity of the TARP recipient; and
          
          (iii) Is not based on the performance of the employee (other than a requirement that the employee not be separated from employment for cause) or the business activities or value of the TARP recipient.
          (2) New hires. With respect to newly hired employees, a payment that will be made only if the new hire continues providing services for a specified period generally constitutes a retention award. For example, a signing bonus that must be repaid unless the newly hired employee completes a certain period of service is a retention award. Similarly, a “make-whole” agreement under which a newly hired employee is provided benefits intended to make up for benefits foregone at his former employer, where these new benefits are subject to a continued service period vesting requirement (such as a continuation of the vesting period at the former employer), is a retention award.
          (3) Deferred compensation plans. Whether a benefit under a deferred compensation plan that is subject to a service vesting period is a retention award depends on all the facts and circumstances. However, to the extent an employee continues to accrue, or becomes eligible to accrue, a benefit under a plan the benefits under which have not been materially enhanced for a significant period of time prior to the employee becoming an SEO or most highly compensated employee (including through expansion of the eligibility for such plan), the benefits accrued generally will not be a retention award. However, to the extent the plan is amended to materially enhance the benefits provided under the plan or to make such employee eligible to participate in such plan, and such benefits are subject to a requirement of a continued period of service, such an amendment generally will be a retention award.
          
            SEC. The term “SEC” means the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
          
            Senior executive officer or SEO. (1) General definition. The term “senior executive officer” or “SEO” means a “named executive officer” as that term is determined pursuant to Instruction 1 to Item 402(a)(3) of Regulation S-K under the Federal securities laws (17 CFR 229.402(a)) who is an employee of the TARP recipient.
          (2) Application to smaller reporting company. A TARP recipient that is a smaller reporting company must identify SEOs pursuant to paragraph (1) of this definition. Such a TARP recipient must identify at least five SEOs, even if only three named executive officers are provided in the disclosure pursuant to Item 402(m)(2) of Regulation S-K under the Federal securities laws (17 CFR 229.402(m)(2)), provided that no employee must be identified as a SEO if the employee's total annual compensation does not exceed $100,000 as defined in Item 402(a)(3)(1) of Regulation S-K under the Federal securities laws (17 CFR 229.402(a)(3)(1)).
          (3) Application to private TARP recipients. A TARP recipient that does not have securities registered with the SEC pursuant to the Federal securities laws must identify SEOs in accordance with rules analogous to the rules in paragraph (1) of this definition.
          
            SEO compensation plan. The term “SEO compensation plan” means “plan” as that term is defined in Item 402(a)(6)(ii) of Regulation S-K under the Federal securities laws (17 CFR 229.402(a)(6)(ii)), but only with regard to a SEO compensation plan in which a SEO participates.
          
            Senior risk officer. The term “senior risk officer” means a senior risk executive officer or employee acting in a similar capacity.
          
            Smaller reporting company. The term “smaller reporting company” means a “smaller reporting company” as that term is defined in Item 10(f) of Regulation S-K under the Federal securities laws (17 CFR 229.10(f)).
          
            Sunset date. The term “sunset date” means the date on which the authorities provided under EESA section 101 and 102 terminate, pursuant to EESA section 120, taking into account any extensions pursuant to EESA section 120(b).
          
            TARP. The term “TARP” means the Troubled Asset Relief Program, established pursuant to EESA.
          
            TARP fiscal year. The term “TARP fiscal year” means a fiscal year of a TARP recipient, or the portion of a fiscal year of a TARP recipient, that is also a TARP period.
          
            TARP period. The term “TARP period” means the period beginning with the TARP recipient's receipt of any financial assistance and ending on the last date upon which any obligation arising from financial assistance remains outstanding (disregarding any warrants to purchase common stock of the TARP recipient that the Treasury may hold).
          
            TARP recipient. (1) General definition. The term “TARP recipient” means
          (i) Any entity that has received or holds a commitment to receive financial assistance; and
          (ii) Any entity that would be treated as the same employer as an entity receiving financial assistance based on the rules in sections 414(b) and 414(c) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 414(b) or (c)), but modified by substituting “50%” for “80%” in each place it appears in section 414(b) or 414(c) and the accompanying regulations. However, for purposes of applying the aggregation rules to determine the applicable employer, the rules for brother-sister controlled groups and combined groups are disregarded (including disregarding the rules in section 1563(a)(2) and (a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 1563(a)(2) and (a)(3)) with respect to corporations and the parallel rules that are in 26 CFR 1.414(c)-2(c) with respect to other organizations conducting trades or businesses).
          (2) Certain excluded entities. Neither any entity receiving funds under TARP pursuant to section 109 of EESA nor any Federal Reserve bank as that term is used in the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 221 et seq.) will be treated as a TARP recipient subject to section 111 of EESA and any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
          (3) Anti-abuse rule. Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of this definition, the term “TARP recipient” means any entity that has received, or holds a commitment to receive, financial assistance; and any entity related to such TARP recipient to the extent that the primary purpose for the creation or utilization of such entity is to avoid or evade any or all of the requirements of section 111 of EESA or these regulations.
          
            Treasury. The term “Treasury” means the U.S. Department of the Treasury.
          
            Valid employment contract. The term “valid employment contract” means a written employment contract that is:
          (1)(i) A material contract as determined pursuant to Item 601(b)(10)(iii)(A) of Regulation S-K under the Federal securities laws (17 CFR 229.601(b)(10)(iii)(A)); or
          (ii) A contract that would be deemed a material contract as determined pursuant to Item 601(b)(10)(iii) of Regulation S-K under the Federal securities laws (17 CFR 229.601(b)(10)(iii)), but for the fact that the material contract relates to one or more employee who is not an executive officer; and
          (2) Is enforceable under the law of the applicable jurisdiction.

          § 30.2
          Q-2: To what entities does this part apply?

          This part applies to any TARP recipient, provided that the requirements of sections 111(b) (portions of § 30.4 (Q-4), § 30.5 (Q-5) and § 30.7 (Q-7), as applicable, § 30.6 (Q-6), and § 30.8 (Q-8) through § 30.11 (Q-11), and § 30.15 (Q-15)), and section 111(e) (§ 30.13 (Q-13)) apply only during the period during which any obligation to the Federal government arising from financial assistance provided under the TARP remains outstanding. For a TARP recipient that has had an obligation to the Federal government arising from financial assistance provided under the TARP, and no further financial assistance under the TARP, the requirements of section 111(c) (including portions of § 30.4 (Q-4), § 30.5 (Q-5) and § 30.7 (Q-7), as applicable) and section 111(d) (§ 30.12 (Q-12)) apply through the last day of the period during which that obligation remains outstanding; for a TARP recipient that has never had an obligation to the Federal government arising from financial assistance provided under the TARP, the requirements of section 111(c) (including portions of § 30.4 (Q-4), § 30.5 (Q-5) and § 30.7 (Q-7), as applicable) and section 111(d) (§ 30.12 (Q-12)) apply through the last day of the TARP recipient's fiscal year including the sunset date. For this purpose, an obligation includes the ownership by the Federal government of common stock of a TARP recipient.
          [74 FR 28405, June 15, 2009, as amended at 74 FR 63992, Dec. 7, 2009]
        
        
          § 30.3
          Q-3: How are the SEOs and most highly compensated employees identified for purposes of compliance with this part?
          (a) Identification. The SEOs for a year are the “named executive officers” who are employees and are identified in the TARP recipient's annual report on Form 10-K or annual meeting proxy statement for that year (reporting the SEOs' compensation for the immediately preceding year). These employees are considered the SEOs throughout that entire year. For purposes of the standards in this part applicable to the most highly compensated employees, the determination of whether an employee is a most highly compensated employee in a current fiscal year looks back to the annual compensation for the last completed fiscal year without regard to whether the compensation is includible in the employee's gross income for Federal income tax purposes.
          (b) Compliance. Regardless of when during the current fiscal year the TARP recipient determines the SEOs or the most highly compensated employees, the TARP recipient must ensure that any of the SEOs or employees potentially subject to the requirements in this part for the current fiscal year complies with the requirements in this part as applicable.
        
        
          § 30.4
          Q-4: What actions are necessary for a TARP recipient to comply with the standards established under sections 111(b)(3)(A), 111(b)(3)(E), 111(b)(3)(F) and 111(c) of EESA (evaluation of employee plans and potential to encourage excessive risk or manipulation of earnings)?
          (a) General rule. To comply with the standards established under sections 111(b)(3)(A), 111(b)(3)(E), 111(b)(3)(F) and 111(c) of EESA, a TARP recipient must establish a compensation committee by the later of ninety days after the closing date of the agreement between the TARP recipient and Treasury or September 14, 2009, and maintain a compensation committee during the remainder of the TARP period. If a compensation committee is already established before the later of the closing date or September 14, 2009, the TARP recipient must maintain its compensation committee. During the remainder of the TARP period after the later of ninety days after the closing date of the agreement between the TARP recipient and Treasury or September 14, 2009, the compensation committee must:
          (1) Discuss, evaluate, and review at least every six months with the TARP recipient's senior risk officers the SEO compensation plans to ensure that the SEO compensation plans do not encourage SEOs to take unnecessary and excessive risks that threaten the value of the TARP recipient;
          (2) Discuss, evaluate, and review with senior risk officers at least every six months employee compensation plans in light of the risks posed to the TARP recipient by such plans and how to limit such risks;
          (3) Discuss, evaluate, and review at least every six months the employee compensation plans of the TARP recipient to ensure that these plans do not encourage the manipulation of reported earnings of the TARP recipient to enhance the compensation of any of the TARP recipient's employees;
          (4) At least once per TARP recipient fiscal year, provide a narrative description of how the SEO compensation plans do not encourage the SEOs to take unnecessary and excessive risks that threaten the value of the TARP recipient, including how these SEO compensation plans do not encourage behavior focused on short-term results rather than long-term value creation, the risks posed by employee compensation plans and how these risks were limited, including how these employee compensation plans do not encourage behavior focused on short-term results rather than long-term value creation, and how the TARP recipient has ensured that the employee compensation plans do not encourage the manipulation of reported earnings of the TARP recipient to enhance the compensation of any of the TARP recipient's employees; and

          (5) Certify the completion of the reviews of the SEO compensation plans and employee compensation plans required under paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (3) of this section.
          (b) Exclusion of TARP recipients with no employees or no affected employees. For any period during which a TARP recipient has no employees, or has no SEO or compensation plan subject to the review process, the TARP recipient is not subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.
          (c) Application to private TARP recipients. The rules provided in paragraph (a) of this section are also applicable to TARP recipients that do not have securities registered with the SEC pursuant to the Federal securities laws. A TARP recipient that does not have securities registered with the SEC pursuant to the Federal securities laws and has received $25,000,000 or less in financial assistance is subject to paragraph (a) of this section, except that, in lieu of establishing and maintaining a compensation committee, such a TARP recipient is permitted to ensure that all the members of the board of directors carry out the duties of the compensation committee as described in paragraph (a) of this section. However, such a TARP recipient will be required to establish and maintain a compensation committee satisfying the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section for the first fiscal year following a fiscal year during which the TARP recipient either registers securities with the SEC pursuant to the Federal securities laws or has received more than $25,000,000 in financial assistance, and during subsequent years of the TARP period.
          (d) Application to TARP recipients that have never had an outstanding obligation. For TARP recipients that have never had an outstanding obligation, only paragraphs (a)(2), (a)(4), (a)(5) (but for the narrative and certification requirements of (a)(4) and (a)(5), applied only to the requirements of paragraph (a)(2)), (b) and (c) of this § 30.4 (Q-4) shall apply.
        
        
          § 30.5
          Q-5: How does a TARP recipient comply with the requirements under § 30.4 (Q-4) of this part that the compensation committee discuss, evaluate, and review the SEO compensation plans and employee compensation plans to ensure that the SEO compensation plans do not encourage the SEOs to take unnecessary and excessive risks that threaten the value of the TARP recipient, or that the employee compensation plans do not pose unnecessary risks to the TARP recipient?
          At least every six months, the compensation committee must discuss, evaluate, and review with the TARP recipient's senior risk officers any risks (including long-term as well as short-term risks) that the TARP recipient faces that could threaten the value of the TARP recipient. The compensation committee must identify the features in the TARP recipient's SEO compensation plans that could lead SEOs to take these risks and the features in the employee compensation plans that pose risks to the TARP recipient, including any features in the SEO compensation plans and the employee compensation plans that would encourage behavior focused on short-term results and not on long-term value creation. The compensation committed is required to limit these features to ensure that the SEOs are not encouraged to take risks that are unnecessary or excessive and that the TARP recipient is not unnecessarily exposed to risks.
        
        
          § 30.6
          Q-6: How does a TARP recipient comply with the requirement under § 30.4 (Q-4) of this part that the compensation committee discuss, evaluate, and review the employee compensation plans to ensure that these plans do not encourage the manipulation of reported earnings of the TARP recipient to enhance the compensation of any of the TARP recipient's employees?
          The compensation committee must discuss, evaluate, and review at least every six months the terms of each employee compensation plan and identify and eliminate the features in these plans that could encourage the manipulation of reported earnings of the TARP recipient to enhance the compensation of any employee.
        
        
          
          § 30.7
          Q-7: How does a TARP recipient comply with the certification and disclosure requirements under § 30.4 (Q-4) of this part?
          (a) Certification. The compensation committee must provide the certifications required by § 30.4 (Q-4) of this part stating that it has reviewed, with the TARP recipient's senior risk officers, the SEO compensation plans to ensure that these plans do not encourage SEOs to take unnecessary and excessive risks, the employee compensation plans to limit any unnecessary risks these plans pose to the TARP recipient, and the employee compensation plans to eliminate any features of these plans that would encourage the manipulation of reported earnings of the TARP recipient to enhance the compensation of any employee. For any period during which no obligation arising from financial assistance provided under the TARP remains outstanding, the requirements under this paragraph shall be modified to be consistent with § 30.4(d) (Q-4(d)). Providing a statement similar to the following and in the manner provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, as applicable, would satisfy this standard: “The compensation committee certifies that:
          (1) It has reviewed with senior risk officers the senior executive officer (SEO) compensation plans and has made all reasonable efforts to ensure that these plans do not encourage SEOs to take unnecessary and excessive risks that threaten the value of [identify TARP recipient];
          (2) It has reviewed with senior risk officers the employee compensation plans and has made all reasonable efforts to limit any unnecessary risks these plans pose to the [identify TARP recipient]; and
          (3) It has reviewed the employee compensation plans to eliminate any features of these plans that would encourage the manipulation of reported earnings of [identify TARP recipient] to enhance the compensation of any employee.”
          (b) Disclosure. At least once per TARP recipient fiscal year, the compensation committee must provide a narrative description identifying each SEO compensation plan and explaining how the SEO compensation plan does not encourage the SEOs to take unnecessary and excessive risks that threaten the value of the TARP recipient. The compensation committee must also identify each employee compensation plan, explain how any unnecessary risks posed by the employee compensation plan have been limited, and further explain how the employee compensation plan does not encourage the manipulation of reported earnings to enhance the compensation of any employee.
          (c) Location. For TARP recipients with securities registered with the SEC pursuant to the Federal securities law, the compensation committee must provide these certifications and disclosures in the Compensation Committee Report required pursuant to Item 407(e) of Regulation S-K under the Federal securities laws (17 CFR 229.407(e)) and to Treasury. These disclosures must be provided in the Compensation Committee Report for any disclosure pertaining to any fiscal year any portion of which is a TARP period (for a TARP recipient with an obligation), or for any disclosure pertaining to any fiscal year including a date on or before the sunset date (for a TARP recipient that has never had an obligation). Within 120 days of the completion of a fiscal year during any part of which is a TARP period (for a TARP recipient with an obligation), or the completion of a fiscal year including a date on or before the sunset date (for a TARP recipient that has never had an obligation), a TARP recipient that is a smaller reporting company must provide the certifications of the compensation committee to its primary regulatory agency and to Treasury.
          (d) Application to private TARP recipients. The rules provided in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section are also applicable to TARP recipients that do not have securities registered with the SEC pursuant to the Federal securities laws. Within 120 days of the completion of the fiscal year during any part of which is a TARP period (for a TARP recipient with an obligation), or the completion of a fiscal year including a date on or before the sunset date (for a TARP recipient that has never had an obligation), a private TARP recipient must provide the certification of the compensation committee (or board of directors, as applicable under § 30.4 (Q-4)) to its primary regulatory agency and to Treasury.
        
        
          § 30.8
          Q-8: What actions are necessary for a TARP recipient to comply with the standards established under section 111(b)(3)(B) of EESA (the “clawback” provision requirement)?
          To comply with the standards established under section 111(b)(3)(B) of EESA, a TARP recipient must ensure that any bonus payment made to a SEO or the next twenty most highly compensated employees during the TARP period is subject to a provision for recovery or “clawback” by the TARP recipient if the bonus payment was based on materially inaccurate financial statements (which includes, but is not limited to, statements of earnings, revenues, or gains) or any other materially inaccurate performance metric criteria. Whether a financial statement or performance metric criteria is materially inaccurate depends on all the facts and circumstances. However, for this purpose, a financial statement or performance metric criteria shall be treated as materially inaccurate with respect to any employee who knowingly engaged in providing inaccurate information (including knowingly failing to timely correct inaccurate information) relating to those financial statements or performance metrics. Otherwise, with respect to a performance criteria, whether the inaccurate measurement of the performance or inaccurate application of the performance to the performance criteria is material depends on whether the actual performance or accurate application of the actual performance to the performance criteria is materially different from the performance required under the performance criteria or the inaccurate application of the actual performance to the performance criteria. The TARP recipient must exercise its clawback rights except to the extent it demonstrates that it is unreasonable to do so, such as, for example, if the expense of enforcing the rights would exceed the amount recovered. For the purpose of this section, a bonus payment is deemed to be made to an individual when the individual obtains a legally binding right to that payment.
        
        
          § 30.9
          Q-9: What actions are necessary for a TARP recipient to comply with the standards established under section 111(b)(3)(C) of EESA (the prohibition on golden parachute payments)?
          (a) Prohibition on golden parachute payments. To comply with the standards established under section 111(b)(3)(C) of EESA, a TARP recipient must prohibit any golden parachute payment to a SEO and any of the next five most highly compensated employees during the TARP period. A golden parachute payment is treated as paid at the time of departure and is equal to the aggregate present value of all payments made for a departure. Thus, a golden parachute payment during the TARP period may include a right to amounts actually payable after the TARP period.
          (b) Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section:
          
          
            Example 1.
            Employee A is a SEO of a TARP recipient. Employee A is entitled to a payment of three times his annual compensation upon an involuntary termination of employment or voluntary termination of employment for good reason, but such amount is not payable unless and until the TARP period expires with respect to TARP recipient. Employee A terminates employment during the TARP period. Because, for purposes of the prohibition on golden parachute payments, the payment is made at the time of departure, Employee A may not obtain the right to the payment upon the termination of employment.
          
          
            Example 2.

            Employee B involuntarily terminated employment on July 1, 2008, at which time Employee B was a SEO of a financial institution. Employee B's employment agreement provided that if Employee B were involuntarily terminated or voluntarily terminated employment for good reason, Employee B would be entitled to a series of five equal annual payments. After the first payment, but before any subsequent payment, the entity became a TARP recipient. Because, for purposes of the prohibition on golden parachute payments, all of the five payments are deemed to have occurred at termination of employment and because, in this case, termination of employment occurred before the beginning of the applicable TARP period, the payment of the four remaining payments due under the agreement will not violate the requirements of this section.
          
        
        
          § 30.10
          Q-10: What actions are necessary for a TARP recipient to comply with section 111(b)(3)(D) of EESA (the limitations on bonus payments)?
          (a) General rule. To comply with section 111(b)(3)(D) of EESA, pursuant to the schedule under paragraph (b) of this section and subject to the exclusions under paragraph (e) of this section, a TARP recipient must prohibit the payment or accrual of any bonus payment during the TARP period to or by the employees identified pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.
          (b)(1) Schedule. The prohibition required under paragraph (a) of this section applies as follows to:
          (i) The most highly compensated employee of any TARP recipient receiving less than $25,000,000 in financial assistance;
          (ii) At least the five most highly compensated employees of any TARP recipient receiving $25,000,000 but less than $250,000,000 in financial assistance;
          (iii) The SEOs and at least the ten next most highly compensated employees of any TARP recipient receiving $250,000,000 but less than $500,000,000 in financial assistance; and
          (iv) The SEOs and at least the twenty next most highly compensated employees of any TARP recipient receiving $500,000,000 or more in financial assistance.
          (2) Changes in level of financial assistance. The determination of which schedule in paragraph (b) of this section is applicable to a TARP recipient during the TARP period is determined by the gross amount of all financial assistance provided to the TARP recipient, valued at the time the financial assistance was received. Whether a TARP recipient's financial assistance has increased during a fiscal year to the point in the schedule under paragraph (b) of this section that the SEOs or a greater number of the most highly compensated employees will be subject to the requirements under paragraph (a) of this section is determined as of the last day of the TARP recipient's fiscal year, and the increase in coverage is effective for the subsequent fiscal year.
          (3) Application to first year of financial assistance. For employers who become TARP recipients after June 15, 2009, the bonus payment limitation provision under this paragraph (b) does not apply to bonus payments paid or accrued by TARP recipients or their employees before the first date of the TARP period. Certain bonus payments may relate to a service period beginning before and ending after the first date of the TARP period. In these circumstances, the employee will not be treated as having accrued the bonus payment on or after the first date of the TARP period if the bonus payment is reduced to reflect at least the portion of the service period that occurs on or after the first date of the TARP period. However, if the employee is a SEO or most highly compensated employee at the time the amount would otherwise be paid, the bonus payment amount as reduced in accordance with the previous sentence still may not be paid until such time as bonus payments to that employee are permitted.
          (c) Accrual—(1) General rule. Whether an employee has accrued a bonus payment is determined based on the facts and circumstances. An accrual may include the granting of service credit (whether toward the calculation of the benefit or any vesting requirement) or credit for the compensation received (or that otherwise would have been received) during the period the employee was subject to the restriction under paragraph (a) of this section. For application of this rule to the fiscal year including June 15, 2009, see § 30.17 (Q-17).
          (2) Payments or accruals after the employee is no longer a SEO or most highly compensated employee. If after the employee is no longer a SEO or most highly compensated employee, the employee is paid a bonus payment or provided a legally binding right to a bonus payment that is based upon services performed or compensation received during the period the employee was a SEO or most highly compensated employee, the employee will be treated as having accrued such bonus payment during the period the employee was a SEO or most highly compensated employee. For example, if the employee is retroactively granted service credit under an incentive plan (whether for vesting or benefit calculation purposes) for the period in which the employee was a SEO or most highly compensated employee, the employee will be treated as having accrued that benefit during the period the employee was a SEO or most highly compensated employee.
          (3) Multi-year service periods. Certain bonus payments may relate to a multi-year service period, during some portion of which the employee is a SEO or most highly compensated employee subject to paragraph (a) of this section, and during some portion of which the employee is not. In these circumstances, the employee will not be treated as having accrued the bonus payment during the period the employee was a SEO or most highly compensated employee if the bonus payment is at least reduced to reflect the portion of the service period that the employee was a SEO or most highly compensated employee. If the employee is a SEO or most highly compensated employee at the time the net bonus payment amount after such reduction would otherwise be paid, the amount still may not be paid until such time as bonus payments to that employee are permitted.
          (d) Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section:
          
          
            Example 1.
            Employee A is a SEO of a TARP recipient in 2010, but not in 2011. The TARP recipient maintains an annual bonus program, generally paying bonus payments in March of the following year. Employee A may not be paid a bonus payment in 2010 (for services performed in 2009 or any other year). In addition, Employee A may not be paid a bonus payment in 2011 to the extent such bonus payment is based on services performed in 2010.
          
          
            Example 2.
            Same facts as in Example 1, provided further that Employee A receives a salary increase for 2011. The salary increase equals the same percentage as similarly situated executive officers, with an additional percentage increase which, over the course of twelve months, equals the bonus that would have been payable to Employee A in 2011 (for services performed in 2010), except for application of paragraph (a) of this section. Under these facts and circumstances, the additional percentage increase will be treated as a bonus payment accrued in 2010 and Employee A may not be paid this bonus payment.
          
          
            Example 3.
            Same facts as in Example 1, provided further that on March 1, 2011, Employee A is granted a stock option under the TARP recipient stock incentive plan with a value approximately equal to the bonus that would have been payable to Employee A in 2011 (for services performed in 2010), except for application of paragraph (a) of this section. Other similarly situated employee not covered by the bonus limitation for 2010 do not receive such a grant. Under these facts and circumstances, the stock option grant will be treated as a bonus payment accrued in 2010 and will not be permitted to be paid to Employee A.
          
          
            Example 4.
            Employee B is not a SEO or a most highly compensated employee of a TARP recipient during 2009. On July 1, 2009, Employee B is granted the right to a bonus payment of $50,000 if Employee B is employed by the TARP recipient through July 1, 2011 (two years). Employee B is a SEO of a TARP recipient during 2010, but is not a SEO or a most highly compensated employee of the TARP recipient during 2011. Employee B is employed by the TARP recipient on July 1, 2011. Thus, Employee B was a SEO or most highly compensated employee during one-half of the two-year required service period. Provided that Employee B is paid not more than half of the otherwise payable bonus payment, or $25,000, Employee B will not be treated as having accrued a bonus payment while Employee B was a SEO or a most highly compensated employee.
          
          
          (e) Exclusions—(1) Long-term restricted stock—(i) General rule. The TARP recipient is permitted to award long-term restricted stock to the employees whose compensation is limited according to the schedule under paragraph (b) of this section, provided that the value of this grant may not exceed one third of the employee's annual compensation as determined for that fiscal year (that is, not using the look-back method for the prior year). For purposes of this paragraph, in determining an employee's annual compensation, all equity-based compensation granted in fiscal years ending after June 15, 2009 will only be included in the calculation in the year in which it is granted at its total fair market value on the grant date, and all equity-based compensation granted in fiscal years ending prior to June 15, 2009 will not be included in the calculation of annual compensation for any subsequent fiscal year. For purposes of this paragraph, in determining the value of the long-term restricted stock grant, the long-term restricted stock granted in accordance with this paragraph will only be included in the calculation in the year in which the restricted stock is granted at its total fair market value on the grant date.
          
          (ii) Example. During 2008, Employee A receives compensation of $1 million salary and a $1,200,000 long-term restricted stock grant subject to a three-year vesting period. During 2009, Employee A received compensation of $1 million salary and no grant of long-term restricted stock. During 2010, Employee A receives compensation of $600,000 salary and a $300,000 long-term restricted stock grant subject to a three-year vesting period. Under the general SEC compensation disclosure rules used to define annual compensation in § 30.1 (Q-1) of this part, the compensation related to the long-term restricted stock grants would be allocated over the vesting period. Assume for this purpose, that for 2010, $400,000 of the 2008 long-term restricted stock grant is allocated as compensation, and $100,000 of the 2010 long-term restricted stock grant is allocated as compensation, so that the total annual compensation is $1,100,000 ($600,000 salary + $400,000 + $100,000). However, for purposes of determining Employee A's annual compensation to apply the limit on the value of the long-term restricted stock that may be granted to Employee A in 2010, the entire $300,000 value of the 2010 grant is included but the $400,000 value attributed to the 2008 grant is excluded. Accordingly, Employee A's adjusted annual compensation is $900,000 ($1,100,000 − $100,000 + $300,000 − $400,000). In addition, the entire fair market value of the 2010 long-term restricted stock grant is included for purposes of determining whether the limit has been exceeded. Because the $300,000 adjusted value of the long-term restricted stock grant does not exceed one-third of the $900,000 adjusted annual compensation, the grant complies with paragraph (e)(1)(i).
          (2) Legally binding right under valid employment contracts—(i) General rule. The prohibition under paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to bonus payments required to be paid under a valid employment contract if the employee had a legally binding right under the contract to a bonus payment as of February 11, 2009. For purposes of determining whether an employee had a legally binding right to a bonus payment, see 26 CFR 1.409A-1(b)(i). In addition, the bonus payment must be made in accordance with the terms of the contract as of February 11, 2009 (which may include application of an elective deferral election under a qualified retirement plan or a nonqualified deferred compensation plan), such that any subsequent amendment to the contract to increase the amount payable, accelerate any vesting conditions, or otherwise materially enhance the benefit available to the employee under the contract will result in the bonus payment being treated as not made under the employment contract executed on or before February 11, 2009. However, amendment of a valid employment contract executed on or before February 11, 2009 under which an employee has a legally binding right to a bonus payment to reduce the amount of the bonus payment or to enhance or include service-based or performance-based vesting requirements or holding period requirements will not result in this treatment. The amended employment contract would still be deemed a valid employment contract and the employee would still be treated as having a legally binding right to the bonus payment under the original employment contract. The TARP recipient and the employees of the TARP recipient should be cognizant of the restrictions under section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 409A) in the case of an amendment described in the preceding sentence.
          (ii) Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (2).
          
          
            Example 1.

            TARP recipient sponsors a written restricted stock unit plan. Under the plan, restricted stock units are traditionally granted each July 1, and are subject to a three-year vesting requirement. Employee A, a SEO of TARP recipient, received grants on July 1, 2007, July 1, 2008, and July 1, 2009. The July 1, 2007 and July 1, 2008 grants are excluded from the limitation on payments, because although the awards were subject to a continuing service vesting requirement, Employee A retained a legally binding right to the restricted stock units as of February 11, 2009. However, regardless of the fact that the restricted stock unit program was in existence on February 11, 2009, Employee A did not retain a legally binding right to a restricted stock unit for 2009 as of February 11, 2009, but rather obtained the legally binding right only when the restricted stock unit was granted on July 1, 2009. Accordingly, the July 1, 2009 grant is subject to the limitation and is not permitted to be accrued or paid (unless such grant complies with the exception for certain grants of long-term restricted stock).
          
          
            Example 2.
            TARP recipient sponsors an annual bonus program documented in a written plan. Under the bonus program, the board of directors retains the discretion to eliminate or reduce the bonus of any employee in the bonus pool. Employees B and C, both SEOs, are in the bonus pool for 2008. On January 15, 2009, the compensation committee determines the bonuses to which the employees of the division in which Employee B works are entitled, and awards Employee B a $10,000 bonus payable on June 1. Employee B has a legally binding right to the bonus as of February 11, 2009 and payment of the bonus is not subject to the limitation. However, as of February 11, 2009, the board of directors has not met to determine which employees of the division in which Employee C works will be entitled to a bonus or the amount of such bonus. Accordingly, Employee C did not have a legally binding right to a bonus as of February 11, 2009 and may be subject to the bonus payment limitation.
          
          
            Example 3.
            TARP recipient sponsors a written stock option plan under which stock options may be granted to SEOs designated by the compensation committee. Designations and grants typically occur at a meeting in August of every year, and no meeting occurred in 2009 before August. Regardless of the existence of the general plan, no SEO had a legally binding right to a stock option grant for 2009 as of February 11, 2009 because no grants had been made under the plan. Accordingly, any 2009 grant will be subject to the limitation and is not permitted to be made.
          
          
            Example 4.
            Employee D is an SEO of a TARP recipient. Under Employee D's written employment agreement executed before February 11, 2009, Employee D is entitled to the total of whatever bonuses are made available to Employee E and Employee F. As of February 11, 2009, Employee E had a legally binding right to a $100,000 bonus. Employees E and F are never at any time SEOs or highly compensated employees subject to the limitation. As of February 11, 2009, Employee F had no legally binding right to a bonus, but was eligible to participate in a bonus pool and was ultimately awarded a bonus of $50,000. As of February 11, 2009, Employee D had a legally binding right to a $100,000 bonus, so that bonus is not subject to the limitation. However, as of February 11, 2009, Employee D did not have a legally binding right to the additional $50,000 bonus, so that bonus is subject to the bonus payment limitation and, if not paid before June 15, 2009 is not permitted to be paid.
          
          
          (f) Application to private TARP recipients. The rules set forth in this section are also applicable to TARP recipients that do not have securities registered with the SEC pursuant to the Federal securities laws.
        
        
          § 30.11
          Q-11: Are TARP recipients required to meet any other standards under the executive compensation and corporate governance standards in section 111 of EESA?
          (a) Approval of compensation payments to, and compensation structures for, certain employees of TARP recipients receiving exceptional financial assistance. For any period during which a TARP recipient is designated as a TARP recipient that has received exceptional financial assistance, the TARP recipient must obtain the approval by the Special Master of all compensation payments to, and compensation structures for, SEOs and most highly compensated employees subject to paragraph (b) of § 30.10 (Q-10). TARP recipients that receive exceptional financial assistance must also receive approval by the Special Master for all compensation structures for other employees who are executive officers (as defined under the Securities and Exchange Act, Rule 3b-7) or one of the 100 most highly compensated employees of a TARP recipient receiving exceptional assistance (or both), who are not subject to the bonus limitations under § 30.10 (Q-10). For this purpose, compensation payments and compensation structures may include awards or other rights to compensation which an employee has already received but not yet been paid or, in some instances, fully accrued. Accordingly, the Special Master has the authority to require that such compensation payments or compensation structures be altered to meet the standards set forth in § 30.16 (Q-16). However, this approval requirement is not applicable to payments that are not subject to paragraph (a) of § 30.10 (Q-10) due to the application of paragraph (e)(2) of § 30.10 (Q-10) or the effective date provisions of § 30.17 (Q-17), though the Special Master will take such payments into account in reviewing the compensation structure and amounts payable, as applicable, that are subject to review. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, approval is not required with respect to an employee not subject to the bonus payment limitations to the extent that the employee's annual compensation, as modified in § 30.16 (Q-16) to include certain deferred compensation and pension accruals but to disregard any grant of long-term restricted stock, is limited to $500,000 or less, and any further compensation is provided in the form of long-term restricted stock. For details, see § 30.16 (Q-16).
          (b) Perquisite disclosure—(1) General rule. TARP recipients must annually disclose during the TARP period any perquisite whose total value for the TARP recipient's fiscal year exceeds $25,000 for each of the SEOs and most highly compensated employees that are subject to paragraph (a) of § 30.10 (Q-10). TARP recipients must provide a narrative description of the amount and nature of these perquisites, the recipient of these perquisites, and a justification for offering these perquisites (including a justification for offering the perquisite, and not only for offering the perquisite with a value that exceeds $25,000). Such disclosure must be provided within 120 days of the completion of a fiscal year any part of which is a TARP period.
          (2) Location. A TARP recipient must provide this disclosure to Treasury and to its primary regulatory agency.
          (c) Compensation consultant disclosure—(1) General rule. The compensation committee of the TARP recipient must provide annually a narrative description of whether the TARP recipient, the board of directors of the TARP recipient, or the compensation committee has engaged a compensation consultant; and all types of services, including non-compensation related services, the compensation consultant or any of its affiliates has provided to the TARP recipient, the board, or the compensation committee during the past three years, including any “benchmarking” or comparisons employed to identify certain percentile levels of compensation (for example, entities used for benchmarking and a justification for using these entities and the lowest percentile level proposed for compensation). Such disclosure must be provided within 120 days of the completion of a fiscal year any part of which is a TARP period.
          (2) Application to TARP recipients not required to maintain compensation committees. For those TARP recipients not required to establish and maintain compensation committees under § 30.4(c) (Q-4), the board of directors must provide the disclosure under § 30.4(c)(1).
          (3) Location. A TARP recipient must provide this disclosure to Treasury and to its primary regulatory agency.
          (d) Prohibition on gross-ups. Except as explicitly permitted under this part, TARP recipients are prohibited from providing (formally or informally) gross-ups to any of the SEOs and next twenty most highly compensated employees during the TARP period. For this purpose, providing a gross-up includes providing a right to a payment of such a gross-up at a future date, for example a date after the TARP period.
        
        
          § 30.12
          Q-12: What actions are necessary for a TARP recipient to comply with section 111(d) of EESA (the excessive or luxury expenditures policy requirement)?

          To comply with section 111(d) of EESA, by the later of ninety days after the closing date of the agreement between the TARP recipient and Treasury or September 14, 2009, the board of directors of the TARP recipient must adopt an excessive or luxury expenditures policy, provide this policy to Treasury and its primary regulatory agency, and post the text of this policy on its Internet Web site, if the TARP recipient maintains a company Web site. After adoption of the policy, the TARP recipient must maintain the policy during the remaining TARP period (if the TARP recipient has an obligation), or through the last day of the TARP recipient's fiscal year including the sunset date (if the TARP recipient has never had an obligation). If, after adopting an excessive or luxury expenditures policy, the board of directors of the TARP recipient makes any material amendments to this policy, within ninety days of the adoption of the amended policy, the board of directors must provide the amended policy to Treasury and its primary regulatory agency and post the amended policy on its Internet Web site, if the TARP recipient maintains a company Web site. This disclosure must continue through the TARP period (if the TARP recipient has an obligation), or through the last day of the TARP recipient's fiscal year that includes the sunset date (if the TARP recipient has never had an obligation).
        
        
          § 30.13
          Q-13: What actions are necessary for a TARP recipient to comply with section 111(e) of EESA (the shareholder resolution on executive compensation requirement)?
          As provided in section 111(e) of EESA, any proxy or consent or authorization for an annual or other meeting of the shareholders of any TARP recipient that occurs during the TARP period must permit a separate shareholder vote to approve the compensation of executives, as required to be disclosed pursuant to the Federal securities laws (including the compensation discussion and analysis, the compensation tables, and any related material). To meet this standard, a TARP recipient must comply with any rules, regulations, or guidance promulgated by the SEC that are applicable to the TARP recipient.
          [74 FR 63992, Dec. 7, 2009]
        
        
          § 30.14
          Q-14: How does section 111 of EESA operate in connection with an acquisition, merger, or reorganization?
          (a) Special rules for acquisitions, mergers, or reorganizations. In the event that a TARP recipient (target) is acquired by an entity that is not an affiliate of the target (acquirer) in an acquisition of any form, including a purchase of substantially all of the assets of the target, such that the acquirer after the transaction would have been treated as a TARP recipient if the target had received the TARP funds immediately after the transaction, acquirer will not become subject to section 111 of EESA merely as a result of the acquisition. If the acquirer is not subject to section 111 of EESA immediately after the transaction, then any employees of the acquirer immediately after the transaction (including target employees who were SEOs or most highly compensated employees immediately prior to the transaction and became acquirer employees as a result of the transaction) will not be subject to section 111 of EESA.
          (b) Anti-abuse rule. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, if the primary purpose of a transaction involving the acquisition, in any form, of a TARP recipient is to avoid or evade the application of any of the requirements of section 111 of EESA, the acquirer will be treated as a TARP recipient immediately upon such acquisition. In such a case, the SEOs and the most highly compensated employees to whom any of the requirements of section 111 of EESA and this Interim Final Rule apply shall be redetermined as of the date of the acquisition. The redetermined SEOs and most highly compensated employees of the post-acquisition acquirer shall consist of the PEO and PFO of the post-acquisition acquirer, plus the applicable number of next most highly compensated employees determined by aggregating the post-acquisition employees of the acquirer (to include the pre-acquisition employees of the target employed by the acquirer, or anticipated to be employed by the acquirer), and ranking such employees in order of compensation for the immediately preceding fiscal year of the pre-acquisition target or pre-acquisition acquirer, as appropriate. In the case of an asset acquisition, the entity or entities to whom the target's assets are transferred shall be treated as the direct recipient of the financial assistance for purposes of determining which other related entities are treated, in the aggregate, as the TARP recipient under the definition of “TARP recipient” in § 30.1 (Q-1).
        
        
          § 30.15
          Q-15: What actions are necessary for a TARP recipient to comply with certification requirements of section 111(b)(4) of EESA?
          (a) Certification Requirements—(1) General. To comply with section 111(b)(4) of EESA, the PEO and the PFO of the TARP recipient must provide the following certifications with respect to the compliance of the TARP recipient with section 111 of EESA as implemented under this part:
          
          (2) First Fiscal Year Certification. (i) Within ninety days of the completion of the first annual fiscal year of the TARP recipient any portion of which is a TARP period, the PEO and the PFO of the TARP recipient must provide certifications similar to the model provided in appendix A to this section.
          (ii) If the first annual fiscal year of a TARP recipient any portion of which is a TARP period ends within thirty days after the closing date of the applicable agreement between the TARP recipient and Treasury, the TARP recipient shall have an additional sixty days beginning on the day after the end of the fiscal year during which it can establish the compensation committee, if not already established, and during which the compensation committee shall meet with senior risk officers to discuss, review, and evaluate the SEO compensation plans and employee compensation plans in accordance with § 30.4 (Q-4) of this part. The certifications of the PEO and the PFO of the TARP recipient must be amended to reflect the timing of the establishment and reviews of the compensation committee.
          (3) Years Following First Fiscal Year Certification. Within ninety days of the completion of each TARP fiscal year of the TARP recipient after the first TARP fiscal year, the PEO and the PFO of the TARP recipient must provide a certification similar to the model provided in appendix B to this section.
          (4) Location. A TARP recipient with securities registered with the SEC pursuant to the Federal securities law must provide these certifications as an exhibit (pursuant to Item 601(b)(99)(i) of Regulation S-K under the Federal securities laws (17 CFR 229.601(b)(99)(i)) to the TARP recipient's annual report on Form 10-K and to Treasury. To the extent that the PEO or the PFO of the TARP recipient is unable to provide any of these certifications in a timely manner, the PEO or the PFO must provide Treasury an explanation of the reason such certification has not been provided. These certifications are in addition to the compensation committee certifications required by § 30.5 (Q-5) of this part.
          (5) Application to private TARP recipients. The rules provided in this section are also applicable to TARP recipients that do not have securities registered with the SEC pursuant to the Federal securities laws, except that the certifications under appendix A, paragraph (x) and appendix B, paragraph (x) of this section are not required for such TARP recipients. A private TARP recipient must provide these certifications to its primary regulatory agency and to Treasury.
          (6) Application to TARP recipients that have never had an obligation. For those TARP recipients that have never had an obligation, the PEO and PFO must provide the certifications pursuant to this paragraph (a) only with respect to the requirements applicable to a TARP recipient that has never had an obligation (generally certain compensation committee reviews of employee compensation plans and the issuance of, and compliance with, an excessive or luxury expenses policy).
          (b) Recordkeeping requirements. The TARP recipient must preserve appropriate documentation and records to substantiate each certification required under paragraph (a) of this section for a period of not less than six years after the date of the certification, the first two years in an easily accessible place. The TARP recipient must furnish promptly to Treasury legible, true, complete, and current copies of the documentation and records that are required to be preserved under paragraph (b) of this section that are requested by any representative of Treasury.
          (c) Penalties for making or providing false or fraudulent Statements. Any individual or entity that provides information or makes a certification to Treasury pursuant to the Interim Final Rule or as required pursuant to 31 CFR part 30 may be subject to 18 U.S.C. 1001, which generally prohibits the making of any false or fraudulent statement in a matter within the jurisdiction of the Federal government. Upon receipt of information indicating that any individual or entity has violated any provision of title 18 of the U.S. Code or other provision of Federal law, Treasury shall refer such information to the Department of Justice and the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program.

          [74 FR 28405, June 15, 2009, as amended at 74 FR 63992, Dec. 7, 2009]
        
        
          § 30.16
          Q-16: What is the Office of the Special Master for TARP Executive Compensation, and what are its powers, duties and responsibilities?
          (a) The Office of the Special Master for TARP Executive Compensation. The Secretary of the Treasury shall establish the Office of the Special Master for TARP Executive Compensation (Special Master). The Special Master shall serve at the pleasure of the Secretary, and may be removed by the Secretary without notice, without cause, and prior to the naming of any successor Special Master. The Special Master shall have the following powers, duties and responsibilities:
          (1) Interpretative authority. The Special Master shall have responsibility for interpreting section 111 of EESA, these regulations, and any other applicable guidance, to determine how the requirements under section 111 of EESA, these regulations, and any other applicable guidance, apply to particular facts and circumstances. Accordingly, the Special Master shall make all determinations, as required, as to the meaning of such guidance and whether such requirements have been met in any particular circumstances. In addition, a TARP recipient or a TARP recipient employee may submit a request, in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section, for an advisory opinion with respect to the requirements under section 111 of EESA, these regulations and any other applicable guidance.
          (2) Review of prior payments to employees. Section 111(f) of EESA provides that the Secretary shall review bonuses, retention awards, and other compensation paid before February 17, 2009, to employees of each entity receiving TARP assistance before February 17, 2009, to determine whether any such payments were inconsistent with the purposes of section 111 of EESA or TARP, or otherwise contrary to the public interest. Section 111(f) of EESA provides that, if the Secretary makes such a determination, the Secretary shall seek to negotiate with the TARP recipient and the subject employee for appropriate reimbursements to the Federal Government with respect to compensation or bonuses. The Special Master shall have the responsibility for administering these provisions, including the identification of the payments that are inconsistent with the purposes of EESA or TARP, or otherwise contrary to the public interest, and the Special Master shall have responsibility for the negotiation with the TARP recipient and the subject employee for appropriate reimbursements to the Federal Government with respect to compensation or bonuses. The Special Master shall make this determination by application of the principles outlined in paragraph (b) of this section. The Special Master's administration of these provisions may provide for the scope of review by the Special Master of a payment, including a limited review or no review, depending on the payment amount, the type of payment, the overall compensation earned by the employee during the relevant period, a combination thereof, or such other factors as the Special Master may determine, where the Special Master determines that such factors demonstrate that such payments are not, or are highly unlikely to be, inconsistent with the purposes of section 111 of EESA or TARP, or otherwise contrary to the public interest, or that renegotiation of such payments is not in the public interest. The Special Master may request in writing any information from TARP recipients necessary to carry out the review of prior compensation required under section 111(f) of EESA. TARP recipients must submit any requested information to the Special Master within 30 days of the request.
          (3) Approval of certain payments to employees of TARP recipients receiving exceptional financial assistance—(i) SEOs and most highly compensated employees. The Special Master shall determine whether the compensation structure for each SEO or most highly compensated employee of a TARP recipient receiving exceptional assistance, including the amounts payable or potentially payable under such compensation structure, will or may result in payments that are inconsistent with the purposes of section 111 of EESA or TARP, or are otherwise contrary to the public interest. The Special Master shall make such determinations by applying the principles outlined in paragraph (b) of this section, subject to the requirement that the compensation structure and payments satisfy the applicable limitations under § 30.10 (Q-10). This requirement shall apply to any compensation accrued or paid during any period the SEO or most highly compensated employee is subject to the limitations under § 30.10 (Q-10). Initial requests for such approval must be submitted no later than August 14, 2009. The Special Master's administration of these provisions may provide for the Special Master's scope of review, including a limited review or no review, of a portion of a compensation structure or payment depending on the amount of such payments, the type of such payments, the overall compensation earned by the employee during the relevant period, a combination thereof, or such other factors as the Special Master determines, if the Special Master has determined that such factors demonstrate that such payments are not, or are highly unlikely to be, inconsistent with the purposes of section 111 of EESA or TARP, or otherwise contrary to the public interest. The Special Master shall issue a determination within 60 days of the receipt of a substantially complete submission. The TARP recipient must make a further request for approval to the extent the compensation structure for any SEO or most highly compensated employee, including the amounts that are or may be payable, for any SEO or highly compensated employee is materially modified. In reviewing compensation structures and compensation payments for any period subject to Special Master review, the Special Master may take into account other compensation structures and other compensation earned, accrued or paid, including such compensation and compensation structures that are not subject to the restrictions of Section 111 of EESA pursuant to section 111(b)(3)(D)(iii) (see § 30.10(e)(2) (Q-30.10(e)(2) (certain legally binding rights under valid written employment contracts)), and amounts that were accrued or paid prior to June 15, 2009 and are therefore not subject to review by the Special Master.
          (ii) Other executive officers and most highly compensated employees. With respect to any employee who is either an executive officer (as defined under the Securities and Exchange Act Rule 3b-7) or one of the 100 most highly compensated employees of a TARP recipient receiving exceptional assistance (or both), who is not subject to the bonus limitations under § 30.10 (Q-10), the Special Master shall determine whether the compensation structure for such employees will or may result in payments that are inconsistent with the purposes of section 111 of EESA or TARP, or are otherwise contrary to the public interest. The Special Master shall make such determination through application of the principles outlined in paragraph (b) of this section. With respect to the scope of the required review, the Special Master shall determine only whether the compensation arrangements are adequately structured, and is not required to rule with respect to the amounts that are or may be payable thereunder. However, the TARP recipient may also request an advisory opinion with respect to the amounts that are or may be payable, which the Special Master may provide in his sole discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the total annual compensation to an employee complies with the rules applicable to an SEO under § 30.10 (Q-10) applied without any limits on the grant of long-term restricted stock, and the annual compensation other than long-term restricted stock does not exceed $500,000 (or for 2009, $500,000 prorated to reflect the remaining portion of 2009 after June 15, 2009), the compensation structure will automatically be deemed to meet the requirements and no prior approval by the Special Master will be required. For purposes of the $500,000 limit, in determining annual compensation, all equity-based compensation granted in fiscal years ending after June 15, 2009 will be included in the calculation only in the year in which they are granted at their total fair market value on the grant date and all equity-based compensation granted in fiscal years ending prior to June 15, 2009 will not be included in the calculation of annual compensation. In addition, solely for purposes of applying the limit (and not for purposes of identifying the most highly compensated employees), the term annual compensation includes amounts required to be disclosed under paragraph (viii) of Item 402(a) of Regulation S-K of the Federal securities laws (change in the actuarial present value of benefits under a pension plan and above-market earnings on deferred compensation). The Special Master's administration of these provisions may provide for limited or no review of a portion of a compensation structure by the Special Master depending on the amount of potential payments, the type of such payments, the overall compensation earned by the employee during the relevant period, a combination thereof, or such other factors as the Special Master determines, where the Special Master has determined that such factors demonstrate that such payments are not, or are highly unlikely to be, inconsistent with the purposes of section 111 of EESA or TARP, or otherwise contrary to the public interest. Initial requests for such approval must be submitted no later than 120 days after publication of the final rule. Separate requests need not be submitted for each individual covered employee, but should be submitted for identified groups of employees subject to the same compensation structures to the extent possible as long as sufficient detail regarding individual compensation awards are provided as necessary to evaluate such employee's compensation structure. The Special Master shall issue a determination within 60 days of the receipt of a substantially complete submission. The TARP recipient must make a further request for approval to the extent the compensation structure, including the amounts that are or may be payable, for any executive officer is materially amended. In reviewing compensation structures for any period subject to Special Master review, the Special Master may take into account other compensation structures and other compensation earned, accrued or paid, including such compensation and compensation structures that are not subject to the restrictions of Section 111 of EESA pursuant to section 111(b)(3)(D)(iii) (see § 30.10(e)(2) (Q-30.10(e)(2) (certain legally binding rights under valid written employment contracts)), and amounts that were accrued or paid prior to June 15, 2009 and are therefore not subject to review by the Special Master.
          (iii) Period from June 15, 2009 through final determination. For the period from June 15, 2009 through the date of the Special Master's final determination, the TARP recipient will be treated as complying with this section if, with respect to employees covered by paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, the TARP recipient continues to pay compensation to such employees in accordance with the terms of employment as of June 14, 2009 to the extent otherwise permissible under this Interim Final Rule (for example, continued salary payments but not any bonus payments) and if, with respect to employees covered by paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, the TARP recipient continues to pay compensation to such employees under the compensation structure established as of June 14, 2009, and if in addition the TARP recipient promptly complies with any modifications that may be required by the Special Master's final determination. However, the Special Master may take into account the amounts paid to an employee during such period in determining the appropriate compensation amounts and compensation structures, as applicable, for the remainder of the year.
          (4) Advisory opinions on compensation structures or compensation payments to employees of TARP recipients. A TARP recipient or TARP recipient employee may request an advisory opinion from the Special Master as to whether a compensation structure is, or will or may result in payments that are, inconsistent with the purposes of EESA or TARP, or otherwise contrary to the public interest. In addition, the Special Master may become aware of compensation structures or payments at any TARP recipient for which it may be useful to provide an advisory opinion as to whether such structure or payments meets this standard. Accordingly, the Special Master shall have the authority to render advisory opinions upon request or at the Special Master's initiative, as to whether a compensation structure is, or will or may result in payments to an employee that are inconsistent with the purposes of section 111 of EESA or TARP, or otherwise contrary to the public interest, or whether a compensation payment made, or to be made, was or will be inconsistent with the purposes of section 111 of EESA or TARP, or otherwise contrary to the public interest. If the Special Master renders an adverse opinion, the Special Master shall have the authority to seek to negotiate with the TARP recipient and the subject employee for appropriate reimbursements to the TARP recipient or the Federal government. Any advisory opinion shall reflect the Special Master's application of the principles outlined in paragraph (b) of this section. The Special Master shall not be required to render an advisory opinion in every instance, but may do so only where the Special Master deems appropriate and feasible in the context of the Special Master's other responsibilities. In any case, the Special Master shall render an opinion, or affirmatively decline to render an advisory opinion, within 60 days of the receipt of a substantially complete submission. The Special Master shall not be required to explain any decision to decline to render an advisory opinion.
          (5) Other designated duties and powers. The Special Master shall have such other duties and powers related to the application of compensation issues arising in the administration of EESA or TARP as the Secretary or the Secretary's designate may delegate to the Special Master, including, but not limited to, the interpretation or application of contractual provisions between the Federal government and a TARP recipient as those provisions relate to the compensation paid to, or accrued by, an employee of such TARP recipient.
          (b) Determination of whether compensation is inconsistent with the purposes of section 111 of EESA or TARP or is otherwise contrary to the public interest—(1) Principles. In reviewing a compensation structure or a compensation payment to determine whether it is inconsistent with the purposes of section 111 of EESA or TARP or is otherwise contrary to the public interest, the Special Master shall apply the principles enumerated below. The principles are intended to be consistent with sound compensation practices appropriate for TARP recipients, and to advance the purposes and considerations described in EESA sections 2 and 103, including the maximization of overall returns to the taxpayers of the United States and providing stability and preventing disruptions to financial markets. The Special Master has discretion to determine the appropriate weight or relevance of a particular principle depending on the facts and circumstances surrounding the compensation structure or payment under consideration, such as whether a payment occurred in the past or is proposed for the future, the role of the employee within the TARP recipient, the situation of the TARP recipient within the marketplace and the amount and type of financial assistance provided. To the extent that two or more principles may appear inconsistent in a particular situation, the Special Master will determine the relative weight to be accorded each principle. In the case of any review of payments already made under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, or of any rights to bonuses, awards, or other compensation already granted, the Special Master shall apply these principles by considering the facts and circumstances at the time the compensation was granted, earned, or paid, as appropriate.
          (i) Risk. The compensation structure should avoid incentives to take unnecessary or excessive risks that could threaten the value of the TARP recipient, including incentives that reward employees for short-term or temporary increases in value, performance, or similar measure that may not ultimately be reflected by an increase in the long-term value of the TARP recipient. Accordingly, incentive payments or similar rewards should be structured to be paid over a time horizon that takes into account the risk horizon so that the payment or reward reflects whether the employee's performance over the particular service period has actually contributed to the long-term value of the TARP recipient.
          (ii) Taxpayer return. The compensation structure, and amount payable where applicable, should reflect the need for the TARP recipient to remain a competitive enterprise, to retain and recruit talented employees who will contribute to the TARP recipient's future success, and ultimately to be able to repay TARP obligations.
          (iii) Appropriate allocation. The compensation structure should appropriately allocate the components of compensation such as salary, short-term and long-term incentives, as well as the extent to which compensation is provided in cash, equity or other types of compensation such as executive pensions, other benefits, or perquisites, based on the specific role of the employee and other relevant circumstances, including the nature and amount of current compensation, deferred compensation, or other compensation and benefits previously paid or awarded. The appropriate allocation may be different for different positions and for different employees, but generally, in the case of an executive or other senior level position a significant portion of the overall compensation should be long-term compensation that aligns the interest of the employee with the interests of shareholders and taxpayers.
          (iv) Performance-based compensation. An appropriate portion of the compensation should be performance-based over a relevant performance period. Performance-based compensation should be determined through tailored metrics that encompass individual performance and/or the performance of the TARP recipient or a relevant business unit taking into consideration specific business objectives. Performance metrics may relate to employee compliance with relevant corporate policies. In addition, the likelihood of meeting the performance metrics should not be so great that the arrangement fails to provide an adequate incentive for the employee to perform, and performance metrics should be measurable, enforceable, and actually enforced if not met. The appropriate allocation and the appropriate performance metrics may be different for different positions and for different employees, but generally a significant portion of total compensation should be performance-based compensation, and generally that portion should be greater for positions that exercise higher levels of responsibility.
          (v) Comparable structures and payments. The compensation structure, and amount payable where applicable, should be consistent with, and not excessive, taking into account compensation structures and amounts for persons in similar positions or roles at similar entities that are similarly situated, including, as applicable, entities competing in the same markets and similarly situated entities that are financially distressed or that are contemplating or undergoing reorganization.
          (vi) Employee contribution to TARP recipient value. The compensation structure, and amount payable where applicable, should reflect the current or prospective contributions of an employee to the value of the TARP recipient, taking into account multiple factors such as revenue production, specific expertise, compliance with company policy and regulation (including risk management), and corporate leadership, as well as the role the employee may have had with respect to any change in the financial health or competitive position of the TARP recipient.
          (2) Further guidance. The Secretary reserves the discretion to modify or amend the foregoing principles through notice, announcement or other generally applicable guidance, provided that such guidance shall apply only prospectively from its date of publication and shall not provide a basis for reconsideration of a determination of the Special Master, except as the Special Master deems appropriate in light of such modification or amendment.
          (c) Special Master determinations—(1) Initial determinations. The Special Master shall provide an initial determination in writing, within 60 days of the receipt of a substantially complete submission, setting forth the facts and analysis that formed the basis for the determination. The TARP recipient shall have 30 days to request in writing that the Special Master reconsider the initial determination. The request for reconsideration must specify a factual error or relevant new information not previously considered, and must demonstrate that such error or lack of information resulted in a material error in the initial determination. The Special Master must provide a final determination in writing within 30 days, setting forth the facts and analysis that formed the basis for the determination. If a TARP recipient does not request reconsideration within 30 days, the initial determination shall be treated as a final determination.
          (2) Final determinations. In the case of any final determination that the TARP recipient is required to receive, the final determination of the Special Master shall be final and binding and treated as the determination of the Treasury.
          (3) Advisory Opinions. An advisory opinion of the Special Master shall not be binding upon any TARP recipient or employee, but may be relied upon by a TARP recipient or employee if the advisory opinion applies to the TARP recipient and the employee and the TARP recipient and employee comply in all respects with the advisory opinion.
          
          (d) Submissions to the Special Master—(1) Submission procedures. Submissions to the Special Master may be made under such procedures as the Special Master shall determine. The Special Master may reserve the right to request further information at any time and a submission shall not be treated as substantially complete unless the Special Master has so designated.
          (2) Disclosure procedures. Materials submitted to the Special Master and the initial and final determinations of the Special Master are subject to disclosure under the standards provided in the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA, (5 U.S.C. 552 et seq.)). In addition, the final determinations of the Special Master shall be disclosed to the public. The Special Master shall promulgate procedures for ensuring that disclosed materials have been subject to appropriate redaction to protect personal privacy, privileged or confidential commercial or financial information or other appropriate redactions permissible under the FOIA, which may include a procedure for the person or entity making the submission to request redactions and to review and request reconsideration of any proposed redactions before such redacted materials are released.
        
        
          § 30.17
          Q-17: How do the effective date provisions apply with respect to the requirements under section 111 of EESA?
          (a) General rule. The requirements under this part with respect to sections 111(b), 111(c), 111(d) and 111(f) are effective upon June 15, 2009. The guidance under this part with respect to those sections supersedes any previous guidance applicable to a TARP recipient to the extent that guidance is inconsistent with those requirements, but supersedes that guidance only as of June 15, 2009. To the extent previous contractual provisions are not inconsistent with ARRA or the guidance under this part, those contractual provisions remain in effect and continue to apply in accordance with their terms.
          (b) Bonus payment limitation. The bonus payment limitation provision under § 30.10 (Q-10) of this part does not apply to bonus payments paid or accrued by TARP recipients or their employees before June 15, 2009. Certain bonus payments may relate to a service period beginning before and ending after June 15, 2009. In these circumstances, the employee will not be treated as having accrued the bonus payment on or after June 15, 2009 if the bonus payment is at least reduced to reflect the portion of the service period that occurs after June 15, 2009. If the employee is an SEO or most highly compensated employee at the time the net bonus payment after such reduction would otherwise be paid, the amount still may not be paid until such time as bonus payments to that employee are permitted.

          General.
          This part sets forth regulations to implement and administer the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (Pub. L. 110-343; 122 Stat. 3765).

          Subpart B—Conflicts of Interest
          
            § 31.200
            Purpose and scope.
            (a) Purpose. This regulation sets forth standards to address and manage or to prohibit conflicts of interest that may arise in connection with the administration and execution of the authorities under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), established under sections 101 and 102 of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA).
            (b) Scope. This regulation addresses actual and potential conflicts of interest, or circumstances that give rise to the appearance of a conflict of interest, that may arise from contracts and financial agency agreements between private sector entities and the Treasury for services under the TARP, other than administrative services identified by the TARP Chief Compliance Officer.
          
          
            § 31.201
            Definitions.
            As used in this part:
            
              Arrangement means a contract or financial agency agreement between a private sector entity and the Treasury for services under the TARP, other than administrative services identified by the TARP Chief Compliance Officer.
            
              Dependent child means a son, daughter, stepson or stepdaughter who is either (a) Unmarried, under age 21, and living in the individual's house, or (b) considered a “dependent” of the individual under the U.S. tax code.
            
              EESA means the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, as amended.
            
              Key individual means an individual providing services to a private sector entity who participates personally and substantially, through, for example, decision, approval, disapproval, recommendation, or the rendering of advice, in the negotiation or performance of, or monitoring for compliance under, the arrangement with the Treasury. For purposes of the definition of key individual, the words “personally and substantially” shall have the same meaning and interpretation as such words have in 5 CFR 2635.402(b)(4).
            
              Organizational conflict of interest means a situation in which the retained entity has an interest or relationship that could cause a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts to question the retained entity's objectivity or judgment to perform under the arrangement, or its ability to represent the Treasury. Without limiting the scope of this definition, organizational conflicts of interest may include the following situations:
            (1) A prior or current arrangement between the Treasury and the retained entity that may give the retained entity an unfair competitive advantage in obtaining a new arrangement with Treasury.
            (2) The retained entity is, or represents, a party in litigation against the Treasury relating to activities under the EESA.
            (3) The retained entity provides services for Treasury relating to the acquisition, valuation, disposition, or management of troubled assets at the same time it provides those services for itself or others.
            (4) The retained entity gains, or stands to gain, an unfair competitive advantage in private business arrangements or investments by using information provided under an arrangement or obtained or developed pursuant to an arrangement with Treasury.

              Related entity means the parent company and subsidiaries of a retained entity, any entity holding a controlling interest in the retained entity, and any entity in which the retained entity holds a controlling interest.
            
              Retained entity means the individual or entity seeking an arrangement with the Treasury or having such an arrangement with the Treasury, but does not include special government employees. A “retained entity” includes the subcontractors and consultants it hires to perform services under the arrangement.
            
            
              Special government employee means an officer or employee serving the Treasury, serving with or without compensation, for a period not to exceed 130 days during any 365-day period on a full-time or intermittent basis.

            § 31.211
            Organizational conflicts of interest.
            (a) Retained entity's responsibility. A retained entity working under an arrangement shall not permit an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest (including a situation in which the retained entity has an interest or relationship that could cause a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts to question the retained entity's objectivity or judgment to perform under the arrangement or its ability to represent the Treasury), unless the conflict has been disclosed to Treasury under this Section and mitigated under a plan approved by Treasury, or Treasury has waived the conflict. With respect to arrangements for the acquisition, valuation, management, or disposition of troubled assets, the retained entity shall maintain a compliance program reasonably designed to detect and prevent violations of federal securities laws and organizational conflicts of interest.
            (b) Information required about the retained entity. As early as possible before entering an arrangement to perform services for Treasury under the EESA, a retained entity shall provide Treasury with sufficient information to evaluate any organizational conflicts of interest. The information shall include the following:
            (1) The retained entity's relationship to any related entities.
            (2) The categories of troubled assets owned or controlled by the retained entity and its related entities, if the arrangement relates to the acquisition, valuation, disposition, or management of troubled assets.
            (3) Information concerning all other business or financial interests of the retained entity, its proposed subcontractors, or its related entities, which could conflict with the retained entity's obligations under the arrangement with Treasury.
            (4) A description of all organizational conflicts of interest and potential conflicts of interest.
            (5) A written detailed plan to mitigate all organizational conflicts of interest, along with supporting documents.
            (6) Any other information or documentation about the retained entity, its proposed subcontractors, or its related entities that Treasury may request.
            (c) Plans to mitigate organizational conflicts of interest. The steps necessary to mitigate a conflict may depend on a variety of factors, including the type of conflict, the scope of work under the arrangement, and the organizational structure of the retained entity. Some conflicts may be so substantial and pervasive that they cannot be mitigated. Retained entities should consider the following measures when designing a mitigation plan:
            (1) Adopting, implementing, and enforcing appropriate information barriers to prevent unauthorized people from learning nonpublic information relating to the arrangement and isolate key individuals from learning how their performance under the arrangement could affect the financial interests of the retained entity, its clients, and related entities.
            (2) Divesting assets that give rise to conflicts of interest.
            (3) Terminating or refraining from business relationships that give rise to conflicts of interest.
            (4) If consistent with the terms of the arrangement and permitted by Treasury, refraining from performing specific types of work under the arrangement.
            (5) Any other steps appropriate under the circumstances.
            (d) Certification required. When the retained entity provides the information required by paragraph (b) of this section, the retained entity shall certify that the information is complete and accurate in all material respects.
            (e) Determination required. Prior to entering into any arrangement, the Treasury must conclude that no organizational conflict of interest exists that has not been adequately mitigated, or if a conflict cannot be adequately mitigated, that Treasury has expressly waived it. Once Treasury has approved a conflicts mitigation plan, the plan becomes an enforceable term under the arrangement.
            (f) Subsequent notification. The retained entity has a continuing obligation to search for, report, and mitigate any and all potential organizational conflicts of interest that have not already been disclosed to Treasury under a plan approved by Treasury or previously waived by Treasury. The retained entity shall search regularly for conflicts and shall, within five (5) business days after learning of a potential organizational conflict of interest, disclose the potential conflict of interest in writing to the TARP Chief Compliance Officer. The disclosure shall describe the steps it has taken or proposes to take to mitigate the potential conflict or request a waiver from Treasury.
            (g) Periodic Certification. No later than one year after the arrangement's effective date, and at least annually thereafter, the retained entity shall certify in writing that it has no organizational conflicts of interest, or explain in detail the extent to which it can certify, and describe the actions it has taken and plans to take to mitigate any conflicts. Treasury may require more frequent certifications, depending on the arrangement.
            (h) Retention of information. A retained entity shall retain the information needed to comply with this section and to support the certifications required by this section for three (3) years following termination or expiration of the arrangement, and shall make that information available to Treasury upon request. Such retained information shall include, but is not limited to, written documentation regarding the factors the retained entity considered in its mitigation plan as well as written documentation addressing the results of the retained entities' periodic review of the mitigation plan.
          
          
            § 31.212
            Personal conflicts of interest.
            (a) Retained entity's responsibility. A retained entity shall ensure that all key individuals have no personal conflicts of interest (including a situation that would cause a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts to question the individual's ability to perform, his or her objectivity or judgment in such performance, or his or her ability to represent the interests of the Treasury), unless mitigation measures have neutralized the conflict, or Treasury has waived the conflict.
            (b) Information required. Before key individuals begin work under an arrangement, a retained entity shall obtain information from each of them in writing about their personal, business, and financial relationships, as well as those of their spouses and dependent children that would cause a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts to question the individual's ability to perform, his or her objectivity or judgment in such performance, or his or her ability to represent the interests of the Treasury. When the arrangement concerns the acquisition, valuation, management, or disposition of troubled assets, the information shall be no less extensive than that required of certain new federal employees under Office of Government Ethics Form 450. Treasury may extend the time necessary to meet these requirements in urgent and compelling circumstances.
            (c) Disqualification. The retained entity shall disqualify key individuals with personal conflicts of interest from performing work pursuant to the arrangement unless mitigation measures have neutralized the conflict to the satisfaction of the TARP Chief Compliance Officer. The retained entity may seek a waiver from the TARP Chief Compliance Officer to allow a key individual with a personal conflict of interest to work under the arrangement.
            (d) Initial certification. No later than ten business days after the effective date of the arrangement, the retained entity shall certify to the Treasury that all key individuals performing services under the arrangement have no personal conflicts of interest, or are subject to a mitigation plan or waiver approved by Treasury. In making this certification, the retained entity may rely on the information obtained pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, unless the retained entity knows or should have known that the information provided is false or inaccurate. Treasury may extend the time necessary to meet these requirements where the retained entity has a large number of key individuals, or in other appropriate circumstances.
            (e) Periodic certification. No later than one year after the arrangement's effective date, and at least annually thereafter, the retained entity shall renew the certification required by paragraph (d) of this section. The retained entity shall provide more frequent certifications to Treasury when requested.
            (f) Retained entities' responsibilities. The retained entity shall adopt and implement procedures designed to search for, report, and mitigate personal conflicts of interest on a continuous basis.
            (g) Subsequent notification. Within five business days after learning of a personal conflict of interest, the retained entity shall notify Treasury of the conflict and describe the steps it has taken and will take in the future to neutralize the conflict.
            (h) Retention of information. A retained entity shall retain the information needed to comply with this section and to support the certifications required by this section for three years following termination or expiration of the arrangement, and shall make that information available to Treasury upon request.
          
          
            § 31.213
            General standards.
            (a) During the time period in which a retained entity is seeking an arrangement and during the term of any arrangement:
            (1) The retained entity's officers, partners, or employees performing work under the arrangement shall not accept or solicit favors, gifts, or other items of monetary value above $20 from any individual or entity whom the retained entity, officer, partner, or employee knows is seeking official action from the Treasury in connection with the arrangement or has interests which may be substantially affected by the performance or nonperformance of duties to the Treasury under the arrangement, provided that the total value of gifts from the same person or entity does not exceed $50 in any calendar year.
            (2) The retained entity and its officers and partners, and its employees shall not improperly use or allow the improper use of Treasury property for the personal benefit of any individual or entity other than the Treasury.
            (3) The retained entity and its officers and partners, and its employees shall not make any unauthorized promise or commitment on behalf of the Treasury.
            (b) Any individual who acts for or on behalf of the Treasury pursuant to an arrangement shall comply with 18 U.S.C. 201, which generally prohibits the direct or indirect acceptance by a public official of anything of value in return for being influenced in, or because of, an official act. Violators are subject to criminal penalties.
            (c) Any individual or entity that provides information or makes a certification to the Treasury that is relating to services under EESA or required pursuant to 31 CFR part 31 is subject to 18 U.S.C. 1001, which generally prohibits the making of any false or fraudulent statement to a federal officer. Upon receipt of information indicating that any individual or entity has violated any provision of title 18 of the U.S. Code or other provision of criminal law, Treasury shall refer such information to the Department of Justice and the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP).
            (d) A retained entity shall disclose to the SIGTARP, any credible evidence, in connection with the designation, services, or closeout of the arrangement, that an employee, or contractor of the retained entity has committed a violation of Federal criminal law involving fraud, conflict of interest, bribery, or gratuity violations found in Title 18 of the United States Code, or a violation of the civil False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. 3729-3733).
          
          
            
            § 31.214
            Limitations on concurrent activities.
            Treasury has determined that certain market activities by a retained entity during the arrangement are likely to cause impermissible conflicts of interest. Accordingly, the following restrictions shall apply unless waived pursuant to section 31.215, or Treasury agrees in writing to specific mitigation measures.
            (a) If the retained entity assists Treasury in the acquisition, valuation, management, or disposition of specific troubled assets, the retained entity and key individuals shall not purchase or offer to purchase such assets from Treasury, or assist anyone else in purchasing or offering to purchase such troubled assets from the Treasury, during the term of its arrangement.
            (b) If the retained entity advises Treasury with respect to a program for the purchase of troubled assets, the retained entity and key individuals shall not, during the term of the arrangement, sell or offer to sell, or act on behalf of anyone with respect to a sale or offer to sell, any asset to Treasury under the terms of that program.
          
          
            § 31.215
            Grant of waivers.
            The TARP Chief Compliance Officer may waive a requirement under this part that is not otherwise imposed by law when it is clear from the totality of the circumstances that a waiver is in the government's interest.
          
          
            § 31.216
            Communications with Treasury employees.
            (a) Prohibitions. During the course of any process for selecting a retained entity (including any process using non-competitive procedures), a retained entity participating in the process and its representatives shall not:
            (1) Directly or indirectly make any offer or promise of future employment or business opportunity to, or engage directly or indirectly in any discussion of future employment or business opportunity with, any Treasury employee with personal or direct responsibility for that procurement.
            (2) Offer, give, or promise to offer or give, directly or indirectly, any money, gratuity, or other thing of value to any Treasury employee, except as permitted by the Standards of Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch, 5 CFR part 2635.
            (3) Solicit or obtain from any Treasury employee, directly or indirectly, any information that is not public and was prepared for use by Treasury for the purpose of evaluating an offer, quotation, or response to enter into an arrangement.
            (b) Certification. Before a retained entity enters a new arrangement, the retained entity must certify to the following:
            (1) The retained entity is aware of the prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section and, to the best of its knowledge after making reasonable inquiry, the retained entity has no information concerning a violation or possible violation of paragraph (a) of this section.
            (2) Each officer, employee, and representative of the retained entity who participated personally and substantially in preparing and submitting a bid, offer, proposal, or request for modification of the arrangement has certified that he or she:
            (i) Is familiar with and will comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section; and
            (ii) Has no information of any violations or possible violations of paragraph (a) of this section, and will report immediately to the retained entity any subsequently gained information concerning a violation or possible violation of paragraph (a) of this section.
          
          
            § 31.217
            Confidentiality of information.
            (a) Nonpublic information defined. Any information that Treasury provides to a retained entity under an arrangement, or that the retained entity obtains or develops pursuant to the arrangement, shall be deemed nonpublic until the Treasury determines otherwise in writing, or the information becomes part of the body of public information from a source other than the retained entity.
            (b) Prohibitions. The retained entity shall not:

            (1) Disclose nonpublic information to anyone except as required to perform the retained entity's obligations pursuant to the arrangement, or pursuant to a lawful court order or valid subpoena after giving prior notice to Treasury.
            (2) Use or allow the use of any nonpublic information to further any private interest other than as contemplated by the arrangement.
            (c) Retained entity's responsibility. A retained entity shall take appropriate measures to ensure the confidentiality of nonpublic information and to prevent its inappropriate use. The retained entity shall document these measures in sufficient detail to demonstrate compliance, and shall maintain this documentation for three years after the arrangement has terminated. The retained entity shall notify the TARP Chief Compliance Officer in writing within five business days of detecting a violation of the prohibitions in paragraph (b), above. The security measures required by this paragraph shall include:
            (1) Security measures to prevent unauthorized access to facilities and storage containers where nonpublic information is stored.
            (2) Security measures to detect and prevent unauthorized access to computer equipment and data storage devices that store or transmit nonpublic information.
            (3) Periodic training to ensure that persons receiving nonpublic information know their obligation to maintain its confidentiality and to use it only for purposes contemplated by the arrangement.
            (4) Programs to ensure compliance with federal securities laws, including laws relating to insider trading, when the arrangement relates to the acquisition, valuation, management, or disposition of troubled assets.
            (5) A certification from each key individual stating that he or she will comply with the requirements in section 31.217(b). The retained entity shall obtain this certification, in the form of a nondisclosure agreement, before a key individual performs work under the arrangement, and then annually thereafter.
            (d) Certification. No later than ten business days after the effective date of the arrangement, the retained entity shall certify to the Treasury that it has received a certification form from each key individual stating that he or she will comply with the requirements in § 31.217(b). In making this certification, the retained entity may rely on the information obtained pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, unless the retained entity knows or should have known that the information provided is false or inaccurate.
          
          
            § 31.218
            Enforcement.
            (a) Compliance with these rules concerning conflicts of interest is of the utmost importance. In the event a retained entity or any individual or entity providing information pursuant to 31 U.S.C. part 31 violates any of these rules, Treasury may impose or pursue one or more of the following sanctions:
            (1) Rejection of work tainted by an organizational conflict of interest or a personal conflict of interest and denial of payment for that work.
            (2) Termination of the arrangement for default.
            (3) Debarment of the retained entity for Federal government contracting and/or disqualification of the retained entity from future financial agency agreements.
            (4) Imposition of any other remedy available under the terms of the arrangement or at law.
            (5) In the event of violation of a criminal statute, referral to the Department of Justice for prosecution of the retained entity and/or its officers or employees. In such cases, the Department of Justice may make direct and derivative use of any statements and information provided by any entity, its representatives and employees or any individual, to the extent permitted by law.
            (b) To the extent Treasury has discretion in selecting or imposing a remedy, it will give significant consideration to a retained entity's prompt disclosure of any violation of these rules.

          § 33.100
          Basis and purpose.
          (a) Statutory basis. This part implements provisions of section 1332 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act), Public Law 111-148, relating to Waivers for State Innovation, which the Secretary may authorize for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2017. Section 1332 of the Affordable Care Act requires the Secretary to issue regulations that provide for all of the following:
          (1) A process for public notice and comment at the State level, including public hearings, sufficient to ensure a meaningful level of public input.
          (2) A process for the submission of an application that ensures the disclosure of all of the following:
          (i) The provisions of law that the State involved seeks to waive.
          (ii) The specific plans of the State to ensure that the waiver will meet all requirements specified in section 1332 of the Affordable Care Act.
          (3) A process for the provision of public notice and comment after a waiver application is received by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, that is sufficient to ensure a meaningful level of public input and that does not impose requirements that are in addition to, or duplicative of, requirements imposed under the Administrative Procedures Act, or requirements that are unreasonable or unnecessarily burdensome with respect to State compliance.
          (4) A process for the submission of reports to the Secretary by a State relating to the implementation of a waiver.
          (5) A process for the periodic evaluation by the Secretary of programs under waivers.
          (b) Purpose. This part sets forth certain procedural requirements for Waivers for State Innovation under section 1332 of the Affordable Care Act.
        
        
          § 33.102
          Coordinated waiver process.
          (a) Coordination with applications for waivers under other Federal laws. A State may submit a single application to the Secretary of Health and Human Services for a waiver under section 1332 of the Affordable Care Act and a waiver under one or more of the existing waiver processes applicable under titles XVIII, XIX, and XXI of the Social Security Act, or under any other Federal law relating to the provision of health care items or services, provided that such application is consistent with the procedures described in this part, the procedures for demonstrations under section 1115 of the Social Security Act, if applicable, and the procedures under any other applicable Federal law under which the State seeks a waiver.
          (b) Coordinated process for section 1332 waivers. A State seeking a section 1332 waiver must submit a waiver application to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Any application submitted to the Secretary of Health and Human Services that requests to waive sections 36B, 4980H, or 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code, in accordance with section 1332(a)(2)(D) of the Affordable Care Act, shall upon receipt be transmitted by the Secretary of Health and Human Services to the Secretary to be reviewed in accordance with this part.
        
        
          § 33.104
          Definitions.
          For the purposes of this part:
          
            Complete application means an application that has been submitted and for which the Secretary and the Secretary of Health and Human Services have made a preliminary determination that it includes all required information and satisfies all requirements that are described in § 33.108(f).
          
            Public notice means a notice issued by a government agency or legislative body that contains sufficient detail to notify the public at large of a proposed action consistent with § 33.112.
          
            Section 1332 waiver means a Waiver for State Innovation under section 1332 of the Affordable Care Act.
        
        
          § 33.108
          Application procedures.
          (a) Acceptable formats for applications. Applications for initial approval of a section 1332 waiver shall be submitted in electronic format to the Secretary of Health and Human Services.
          (b) Application timing. Applications for initial approval of a section 1332 waiver must be submitted sufficiently in advance of the requested effective date to allow for an appropriate implementation timeline.
          (c) Preliminary review. Each application for a section 1332 waiver will be subject to a preliminary review by the Secretary and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, who will make a preliminary determination that the application is complete. A submitted application will not be deemed received until the Secretary and the Secretary of Health and Human Services have made the preliminary determination that the application is complete.
          (1) The Secretary and the Secretary of Health and Human Services will complete the preliminary review of the application within 45 days after it is submitted.
          (2) If the Secretary and the Secretary of Health and Human Services determine that the application is not complete, the Secretary of Health and Human Services will send the State a written notice of the elements missing from the application.
          (3) The preliminary determination that an application is complete does not preclude a finding during the 180-day Federal decision-making period that a necessary element of the application is missing or insufficient.
          (d) Notification of preliminary determination.

            (a)(1) Of the amounts received by a Gulf Coast State, coastal political subdivision, or coastal zone parish from Treasury under the Direct Component, or from the Council under the Comprehensive Plan Component or Spill Impact Component, not more than three percent may be used for administrative costs. The three percent limit on administrative costs may be applied to the total amount of funds received by a recipient under each of the three components either on a grant-by-grant basis or on an aggregate basis. For the latter method, amounts used for administrative costs under each of the three components may not at any time exceed three percent of the aggregate of:
            (i) The amounts received under a component by a recipient, beginning with the first grant through the most recent grant, and
            (ii) The amounts in the Trust Fund that are allocated to, but not yet received under such component by a Gulf Coast State, coastal political subdivision, or coastal zone parish under § 34.103, consistent with the definition of administrative costs in § 34.2.

            (3) Treasury will conduct a retrospective analysis of this provision no later than seven years after the date it becomes effective. This review will consider whether the revision ensures that the Gulf Coast States, coastal political subdivisions, and coastal zone parishes have the necessary funding to efficiently and effectively oversee and manage projects and programs for ecological and economic restoration of the Gulf Coast Region while ensuring compliance with the statutory three percent administrative cost cap.
            (b) Of the amounts received by the Council under the Comprehensive Plan Component, not more than three percent may be used for administrative expenses. The three percent limit is applied to the amounts it receives under the Comprehensive Plan Component before termination of the Trust Fund. Amounts used for administrative expenses may not at any time exceed three percent of the total of the amounts received by the Council and the amounts in the Trust Fund that are allocated to, but not yet received by, the Council under § 34.103.

            (g) None of the Trust Fund amounts may be used to acquire land in fee title by the Federal Government unless the land is acquired by exchange or donation or the acquisition is necessary for the restoration and protection of the natural resources, ecosystems, fisheries, marine and wildlife habitats, beaches, and coastal wetlands of the Gulf Coast Region and has the concurrence of the Governor of the state in which the acquisition will take place.
          
          
            § 34.804
            Noncompliance.
            (a) If Treasury determines that a Gulf Coast State, coastal political subdivision, or coastal zone parish has expended funds received under the Direct Component, Comprehensive Plan Component, or Spill Impact Component on an ineligible activity, Treasury will make no additional funds available to that recipient from any part of the Trust Fund until the recipient has deposited in the Trust Fund an amount equal to the amount expended for an ineligible activity, or Treasury has authorized the recipient to expend an equal amount from the recipient's own funds for an activity that meets the requirements of the Act.
            (b) If Treasury determines that a Gulf Coast State, coastal political subdivision, or coastal zone parish has materially violated a grant agreement under the Direct Component, Comprehensive Plan Component, or Spill Impact Component, Treasury will make no additional funds available to that recipient from any part of the Trust Fund until the recipient corrects the violation.
            (c) As a condition of receiving funds, recipients and subrecipients shall make available their records and personnel to Treasury in order to carry out the purposes of this section.

            Responsible office.
            The office responsible for the administration of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act in the Department of the Treasury is the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Office within the Federal Insurance Office. The Treasury Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions prescribes the regulations under the Act.
          
          
            § 50.3
            Mandatory participation in program.

            § 50.4
            Definitions.
            For purposes of this part:
            (a) Act means the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (as amended).
            (b) Act of terrorism—(1) In general. The term act of terrorism means any act that is certified by the Secretary, in consultation with the Attorney General of the United States and the Secretary of Homeland Security:
            (i) To be an act of terrorism;

            (ii) To be a violent act or an act that is dangerous to human life, property, or infrastructure;
            
            (iii) To have resulted in damage within the United States, or outside of the United States in the case of:
            (A) An air carrier (as defined in 49 U.S.C. 40102) or a United States flag vessel (or a vessel based principally in the United States, on which United States income tax is paid and whose insurance coverage is subject to regulation in the United States); or
            (B) The premises of a United States mission; and
            (iv) To have been committed by an individual or individuals as part of an effort to coerce the civilian population of the United States or to influence the policy or affect the conduct of the United States Government by coercion.
            (2) Limitations. The Secretary is not authorized to certify an act as an act of terrorism if:
            (i) The act is committed as part of the course of a war declared by the Congress (except with respect to any coverage for workers' compensation); or
            (ii) Property and casualty insurance losses resulting from the act, in the aggregate, do not exceed $5,000,000.
            (3) Judicial review precluded. The Secretary's certification of an act of terrorism, or determination not to certify an act as an act of terrorism, is final and is not subject to judicial review.
            (c)(1) Affiliate means, with respect to an insurer, any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the insurer. An affiliate must itself meet the definition of insurer to participate in the Program.
            (2)(i) For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, an insurer has control over another insurer for purposes of the Program if:
            (A) The insurer directly or indirectly or acting through one or more other persons owns, controls, or has power to vote 25 percent or more of any class of voting securities of the other insurer;
            (B) The insurer controls in any manner the election of a majority of the directors or trustees of the other insurer; or
            (C) The Secretary determines, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that an insurer directly or indirectly exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of the other insurer, even if there is no control as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) or (c)(2)(i)(B) of this section.
            (ii) An entity, including any affiliate thereof, does not have control or exercise controlling influence over a reciprocal insurer under this section if, as of January 12, 2015, the entity, including any affiliate thereof, was acting as an attorney-in-fact for the reciprocal insurer, provided that the entity does not, for reasons other than activities it may perform under the attorney-in-fact relationship, have control over the reciprocal insurer as otherwise defined under this section.
            (3) An insurer described in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) or (B) of this section is conclusively deemed to have control.
            (4) For purposes of a determination of controlling influence under paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C) of this section, if an insurer is not described in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) or (B) of this section, the following rebuttable presumptions will apply:
            (i) If an insurer controls another insurer under the laws of a state, and at least one of the factors listed in paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section applies, there is a rebuttable presumption that the insurer that has control under state law exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of the other insurer for purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C) of this section.
            (ii) If an insurer provides 25 percent or more of another insurer's capital (in the case of a stock insurer), policyholder surplus (in the case of a mutual insurer), or corporate capital (in the case of other entities that qualify as insurers), and at least one of the factors listed in paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section applies, there is a rebuttable presumption that the insurer providing such capital, policyholder surplus, or corporate capital exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of the receiving insurer for purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C) of this section.

            (iii) If an insurer, at any time during a calendar year, supplies 25 percent or more of the underwriting capacity for that year to an insurer that is a syndicate consisting of one or more incorporated or individual unincorporated underwriters, and at least one of the factors in paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section applies, there is a rebuttable presumption that the insurer exercises a controlling influence over the syndicate for purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C) of this section.
            (iv) If paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section are not applicable, but two or more of the following factors apply to an insurer, with respect to another insurer, there is a rebuttable presumption that the insurer exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of the other insurer for purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C) of this section:
            (A) The insurer is one of the two largest shareholders of any class of voting stock;
            (B) The insurer holds more than 35 percent of the combined debt securities and equity of the other insurer;
            (C) The insurer is party to an agreement pursuant to which the insurer possesses a material economic stake in the other insurer resulting from a profit-sharing arrangement, use of common names, facilities or personnel, or the provision of essential services to the other insurer;
            (D) The insurer is party to an agreement that enables the insurer to influence a material aspect of the management or policies of the other insurer;
            (E) The insurer would have the ability, other than through the holding of revocable proxies, to direct the votes of more than 25 percent of the other insurer's voting stock in the future upon the occurrence of an event;
            (F) The insurer has the power to direct the disposition of more than 25 percent of a class of voting stock of the other insurer in a manner other than a widely dispersed or public offering;
            (G) The insurer and/or the insurer's representative or nominee constitute more than one member of the other insurer's board of directors; or
            (H) The insurer or its nominee or an officer of the insurer serves as the chairman of the board, chairman of the executive committee, chief executive officer, chief operating officer, chief financial officer or in any position with similar policymaking authority in the other insurer.
            (5) An insurer that is not described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section may request a hearing in which the insurer may rebut a presumption of controlling influence under paragraph (c)(4)(i) through (iv) of this section or otherwise request a determination of controlling influence by presenting and supporting its position through written submissions to Treasury, and in Treasury's discretion, through informal oral presentations, in accordance with the procedure in § 50.7.
            (6) An insurer's affiliates for a calendar year, for purposes of subpart H of this part, shall be determined in accordance with the timing requirements laid out in § 50.75 of this part.
            (d) Aggregate Federal share of compensation means the aggregate amount paid by Treasury for the Federal share of compensation for insured losses in a calendar year.
            (e) Assessment period means a period, established by Treasury, during which policyholders of property and casualty insurance policies must pay, and insurers must collect, the Federal terrorism policy surcharge for remittance to Treasury.
            (f) Attorney-in-fact means a person or entity appointed by the subscribers or members of a reciprocal insurer to act for and bind the reciprocal insurer under relevant state law for the benefit of its subscribers or members.
            (g) Captive insurer means an insurer licensed under the captive insurance laws or regulations of any state.
            (h) Direct earned premium means direct earned premium for all property and casualty insurance issued by any insurer for insurance against all losses, including losses from an act of terrorism, occurring at the locations described in section 102(5)(A) and (B) of the Act.
            (1) State-licensed or admitted insurers. For a state licensed or admitted insurer that reports to the NAIC, direct earned premium is the premium information for property and casualty insurance reported by the insurer on column 2 of the Exhibit of Premiums and Losses of the NAIC Annual Statement (commonly known as Statutory Page 14).

            (i) Premium information as reported to state regulators through the NAIC should be included in the calculation of direct earned premiums for purposes of the Program only to the extent it reflects premiums for property and casualty insurance issued by the insurer against losses occurring at the locations described in section 102(5)(A) and (B) of the Act.
            (ii) Premiums for personal property and casualty lines of insurance (insurance primarily designed to cover personal, family or household risk exposures, with the exception of insurance written to insure 1 to 4 family rental dwellings owned for the business purpose of generating income for the property owner), or premiums for any other insurance coverage that does not meet the definition of property and casualty insurance, should be excluded in the calculation of direct earned premiums for purposes of the Program.
            (iii) Personal property and casualty lines of insurance coverage that includes incidental coverage for commercial purposes are primarily personal coverage, and therefore premiums may be fully excluded by an insurer from the calculation of direct earned premium. For purposes of this section, commercial coverage is incidental if less than 25 percent of the total direct earned premium is attributable to commercial coverage. Property and casualty insurance against losses occurring at locations other than the locations described in section 102(5)(A) and (B) of the Act, or other insurance coverage that does not meet the definition of property and casualty insurance, but that includes incidental coverage for commercial risk exposures at such locations, is primarily not commercial, and therefore premiums for such insurance may also be fully excluded by an insurer from the calculation of direct earned premium. For purposes of this section, property and casualty insurance for losses occurring at the locations described in section 102(5)(A) and (B) of the Act is incidental if less than 25 percent of the total direct earned premium for the insurance policy is attributable to coverage at such locations. Also for purposes of this section, coverage for commercial risk exposures is incidental if it is combined with coverages that otherwise do not meet the definition of property and casualty insurance and less than 25 percent of the total direct earned premium for the insurance policy is attributable to the coverage for commercial risk exposures.
            (iv) If an insurance policy covers both commercial and personal property and casualty exposures, insurers may allocate the premiums in accordance with the proportion of risk between commercial and personal components in order to ascertain direct earned premium. If a policy includes insurance coverage that meets the definition of property and casualty insurance for losses occurring at the locations described in section 102(5)(A) and (B) of the Act, but also includes other coverage, insurers may allocate the premiums in accordance with the proportion of risk attributable to the components in order to ascertain direct earned premium.
            (2) Insurers that do not report to NAIC. An insurer that does not report to the NAIC, but that is licensed or admitted by any state (such as certain farm or county mutual insurers), should use the guidance provided in paragraph (h)(1) of this section to assist in ascertaining its direct earned premium.
            (i) Direct earned premium may be ascertained by adjusting data maintained by such insurer or reported by such insurer to its state regulator to reflect a breakdown of premiums for commercial and personal property and casualty exposure risk as described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section and, if necessary, re-stated to reflect the accrual method of determining direct earned premium versus direct premium.
            (ii) Such an insurer should consider other types of payments that compensate the insurer for risk of loss (contributions, assessments, etc.) as part of its direct earned premium.
            (3) Certain eligible surplus line carrier insurers. An eligible surplus line carrier insurer listed on the NAIC Quarterly Listing of Alien Insurers must ascertain its direct earned premium by pricing separately its premium for insurance that meets the definition of property and casualty insurance for losses occurring at the locations described in section 102(5)(A) and (B) of the Act.
            (4) Federally approved insurers. A federally approved insurer, defined under section 102(6)(A)(iii) of the Act, should use a methodology similar to that specified for eligible surplus line carrier insurers in paragraph (h)(3) of this section to calculate its direct earned premium. Such calculation should be adjusted to reflect the limitations on scope of insurance coverage under the Program (i.e., to the extent of Federal approval of property and casualty insurance in connection with maritime, energy or aviation activities).
            (i) Direct written premium means the premium information for property and casualty insurance that is included by an insurer in column 1 of the Exhibit of Premiums and Losses of the NAIC Annual Statement or in an equivalent reporting requirement. The Federal terrorism policy surcharge is not included in amounts reported as direct written premium.
            (j) Discretionary recoupment amount means such amount of the aggregate Federal share of compensation in excess of the mandatory recoupment amount that the Secretary has determined will be recouped pursuant to section 103(e)(7)(D) of the Act.
            (k) Federal Insurance Office means the Federal Insurance Office within the U.S. Department of the Treasury.
            (l) Federal terrorism policy surcharge means the amount established by Treasury under subpart J of this part that is imposed as a policy surcharge on property and casualty insurance policies, expressed as a percentage of the written premium.
            (m) Insurance marketplace aggregate retention amount means an amount for a calendar year as calculated under section 103(e)(6) of the Act.
            (1) For calendar years beginning with 2015 through 2019, such amount is the lesser of the aggregate amount, for all insurers, of insured losses once there has been a Program Trigger Event during the calendar year and:
            (i) For calendar year 2015: $29,500,000,000;
            (ii) For calendar year 2016: $31,500,000,000;
            (iii) For calendar year 2017: $33,500,000,000;
            (iv) For calendar year 2018: $35,500,000,000; and
            (v) For calendar year 2019: $37,500,000,000.
            (2) For calendar years beginning with 2020 and any calendar year thereafter as may be necessary, such amount is the lesser of the aggregate amount, for all insurers, of insured losses once there has been a Program Trigger Event during the calendar year and the annual average of the sum of insurer deductibles for all insurers for the prior 3 years, to be calculated by taking
            (i) the total amount of direct earned premium reported by insurers to Treasury pursuant to section 50.51 for the three calendar years prior to the calendar year in question, and then dividing that figure by three; and
            (ii) Multiplying the resulting three-year average figure by 20%.
            (3) Beginning in 2020, Treasury shall publish in the Federal Register the insurance marketplace aggregate retention amount for that calendar year no later than April 30, 2020, and by every April 30 thereafter for any subsequent calendar years as necessary. To the extent the Secretary certifies an act as an act of terrorism prior to April 30 of any calendar year after 2019, Treasury will publish the relevant insurance marketplace aggregate retention amount as soon as practicable thereafter.
            (n) Insured loss. (1) The term insured loss means any loss resulting from an act of terrorism (including an act of war, in the case of workers' compensation) that is covered by primary or excess property and casualty insurance issued by an insurer if the loss:
            (i) Occurs within the United States;
            (ii) Occurs to an air carrier (as defined in 49 U.S.C. 40102), or to a United States flag vessel (or a vessel based principally in the United States, on which United States income tax is paid and whose insurance coverage is subject to regulation in the United States), regardless of where the loss occurs; however, to the extent a loss occurs to such an air carrier or vessel outside the United States, the insured loss does not include losses covered by third party insurance contracts that are separate from the insurance coverage provided to the air carrier or vessel; or

            (iii) Occurs at the premises of any United States mission.
            
            (2) The term insured loss includes reasonable loss adjustment expenses, incurred by an insurer in connection with insured losses, that are allocated and identified by claim file in insurer records, including expenses incurred in the investigation, adjustment, and defense of claims, but excluding staff salaries, overhead, and other insurer expenses that would have been incurred notwithstanding the insured loss.
            (3) The term insured loss does not include:
            (i) Punitive or exemplary damages awarded or paid in connection with the Federal cause of action specified in section 107(a)(1) of the Act. The term “punitive or exemplary damages” means damages that are not compensatory but are an award of money made to a claimant solely to punish or deter; or
            (ii) Extra-contractual damages awarded against, or paid by, an insurer; or
            (iii) Payments by an insurer in excess of policy limits.
            (o) Insurer means any entity, including any affiliate of the entity, that meets the following requirements:
            (1)(i) The entity must fall within at least one of the following categories:

            (3) Be managed independently from other insurers participating in the program;
            (B) It is not licensed or admitted to engage in the business of providing primary or excess insurance in any state, but is an eligible surplus line carrier listed on the NAIC Quarterly Listing of Alien Insurers;
            (C) It is approved or accepted for the purpose of offering property and casualty insurance by a Federal agency in connection with maritime, energy, or aviation activity, but only to the extent of such Federal approval of property and casualty insurance coverage offered by the insurer in connection with maritime, energy, or aviation activity;
            (D) It is a state residual market insurance entity or state workers' compensation fund; or
            (E) As determined by the Secretary, it falls within any of the classes or types of captive insurers or other self-insurance arrangements by municipalities and other entities.
            (ii) If an entity falls within more than one category described in paragraph (o)(1)(i) of this section, the entity is considered to fall within the first category within which it falls for purposes of the program.
            (2) The entity must receive direct earned premium, except in the case of:
            (i) State residual market insurance entities and state workers' compensation funds, to the extent provided in subpart D of this part; and
            (ii) Other classes or types of captive insurers and other self-insurance arrangements by municipalities and other entities to the extent provided for in subpart E of this part.

            (p) Insurer deductible means:
            (1) For an insurer that has had a full year of operations during the calendar year immediately preceding the applicable calendar year, the value of an insurer's direct earned premiums during the immediately preceding calendar year, multiplied by 20 percent; and

            (2) For an insurer that has not had a full year of operations during the immediately preceding calendar year, the insurer deductible will be based on data for direct earned premiums for the applicable calendar year multiplied by 20 percent. If the insurer does not have a full year of operations during the applicable calendar year, the direct earned premiums for the applicable calendar year will be annualized to determine the insurer deductible.

            § 50.7
            Procedure for requesting determinations of controlling influence.
            (a) An insurer or insurers not having control over another insurer under § 50.4(c)(2)(i) or (ii) may make a written submission to Treasury to rebut a presumption of controlling influence under § 50.4(c)(4)(i) through (iv) or otherwise to request a determination of controlling influence. Such submissions shall be made to the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Office, Department of the Treasury, Room 1410, 1500 Pennsylvania Ave. NW., Washington, DC 20220. The submission should be entitled, “Controlling Influence Submission,” and should provide the full name and address of the submitting insurer(s) and the name, title, address and telephone number of the designated contact person(s) for such insurer(s).
            (b) Treasury will review submissions and determine whether Treasury needs additional written or orally presented information. In its discretion, Treasury may schedule a date, time, and place for an oral presentation by the insurer(s).
            (c) An insurer or insurers must provide all relevant facts and circumstances concerning the relationship(s) between or among the affected insurers and the control factors in § 50.4(c)(4)(i) through (iv); and must explain in detail any basis for why the insurer believes that no controlling influence exists (if a presumption is being rebutted) in light of the particular facts and circumstances, as well as the Act's language, structure and purpose. Any confidential business or trade secret information submitted to Treasury should be clearly marked. Treasury will handle any subsequent request for information designated by an insurer as confidential business or trade secret information in accordance with Treasury's Freedom of Information Act regulations at 31 CFR part 1.
            (d) Treasury will review and consider the insurer submission and other relevant facts and circumstances. Unless otherwise extended by Treasury, within 60 days after receipt of a complete submission, including any additional information requested by Treasury, and including any oral presentation, Treasury will issue a final determination of whether one insurer has a controlling influence over another insurer for purposes of the Program. The determination shall set forth Treasury's basis for its determination.

            § 50.8
            Procedure for requesting general interpretations of statute.
            Persons actually or potentially affected by the Act or regulations in this Part may request an interpretation of the Act or regulations by writing to the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Office, Room 1410, Department of the Treasury, 1500 Pennsylvania Ave. NW., Washington, DC 20220, giving a detailed explanation of the facts and circumstances and the reason why an interpretation is needed. A requester should segregate and mark any confidential business or trade secret information clearly. Treasury in its discretion will provide written responses to requests for interpretation.

          Subpart B—Disclosures as Conditions for Federal Payment
          
            § 50.10
            General disclosure requirements.
            (a) Content of disclosure. As a condition for Federal payments under section 103(b) of the Act, the Act requires that an insurer provide clear and conspicuous disclosure to the policyholder of:
            (1) The premium charged for insured losses covered by the Program; and
            (2) The Federal share of compensation for insured losses under the Program.
            (b) Form and timing of disclosure. The disclosure required by the Act must be made on a separate line item in the policy, at the time of offer and of renewal of the policy.
          
          
            § 50.11
            Definition.
            For purposes of this Subpart, unless the context indicates otherwise, the term “disclosure” or “disclosures” refers to the disclosure described in section 103(b)(2) of the Act and § 50.10. The term “cap disclosure” refers to the disclosure required by section 103(b)(3) of the Act and § 50.15.
          
          
            § 50.12
            Clear and conspicuous disclosure.
            (a) General. Whether a disclosure is clear and conspicuous depends on the totality of the facts and circumstances of the disclosure. See § 50.16 for model forms.
            (b) Description of premium. An insurer may describe the premium charged for insured losses covered by the Program as a portion or percentage of a policy premium, if consistent with standard business practice and provided that the amount of policy premium or the method of determining the policy premium is also stated. An insurer may not describe the premium in a manner that is misleading in the context of the Program, such as by characterizing the premium as a “surcharge.”
            (c) Method of disclosure. Subject to § 50.10(b), an insurer may provide disclosures using normal business practices, including forms and methods of communication used to communicate similar policyholder information to policyholders.
            (d) Use of producer. If an insurer normally communicates with a policyholder through an insurance producer or other intermediary, an insurer may provide disclosures through such producer or other intermediary. If an insurer elects to make the disclosures through an insurance producer or other intermediary, the insurer remains responsible for ensuring that the disclosures are provided by the insurance producer or other intermediary to policyholders in accordance with the Act.
            (e) Demonstration of compliance. An insurer may demonstrate that it has satisfied the requirement to provide clear and conspicuous disclosure as described in § 50.10 through use of appropriate systems and normal business practices that demonstrate a practice of compliance.
            (f) Certification of compliance. An insurer must certify that it has complied with the requirement to provide disclosure to the policyholder on all policies that form the basis for any claim that is submitted by an insurer for Federal payment under the Program.
          
          
            § 50.13
            Offer and renewal.
            An insurer is deemed to be in compliance with the requirement of providing disclosure “at the time of offer and of renewal of the policy” under § 50.10(b) if the insurer makes the disclosure no later than the time the insurer first formally offers to provide insurance coverage or renew a policy for a current policyholder.
          
          
            § 50.14
            Separate line item.
            An insurer is deemed to be in compliance with the requirement of providing disclosure on a “separate line item in the policy” under § 50.10(b) if the insurer makes the disclosure:
            (a) On the declarations page of the policy;
            (b) Elsewhere within the policy itself; or
            (c) In any rider or endorsement, or other document that is made a part of the policy.
          
          
            § 50.15
            Cap disclosure.
            (a) General. Under section 103(e)(2) of the Act, if the aggregate insured losses exceed $100,000,000,000 during any calendar year, the Secretary shall not make any payment for any portion of the amount of such losses that exceeds $100,000,000,000, and no insurer that has met its insurer deductible shall be liable for the payment of any portion of the amount of such losses that exceeds $100,000,000,000.
            (b) Other requirements. As a condition for Federal payments under section 103(b) of the Act, an insurer must provide clear and conspicuous disclosure to the policyholder of the existence of the $100,000,000,000 cap under section 103(e)(2). The cap disclosure must be made at the time of offer, purchase, and renewal of the policy.
            (c) Offer, purchase, and renewal. An insurer is deemed to be in compliance with the requirement of providing disclosure “at the time of offer, purchase, and renewal of the policy” under § 50.15(b) if the insurer:
            (1) Makes the disclosure no later than the time the insurer first formally offers to provide insurance coverage or renew a policy for a current policyholder; and
            (2) If terrorism risk coverage is purchased, the insurer makes clear and conspicuous reference back to that disclosure, as well as the final terms of terrorism insurance coverage, at the time the transaction is completed.
            (d) Other applicable rules. The cap disclosure is covered by the rules in § 50.12(a), (c), (d), (e), and (f) (relating to clear and conspicuous disclosure).
          
          
            § 50.16
            Use of model forms.
            (a) General. An insurer that is required to make the disclosure under § 50.10(b) or § 50.15(b) is deemed to be in compliance with the disclosure requirements if the insurer uses NAIC Model Disclosure Form No. 1 or NAIC Model Disclosure Form No. 2, as appropriate.
            (b) Not exclusive means of compliance. An insurer is not required to use NAIC Model Disclosure Form No. 1 or NAIC Model Disclosure Form No. 2 to satisfy the disclosure requirements. An insurer may use other means to comply with the disclosure requirements, as long as the disclosures comport with the requirements of the Act.
            (c) Definitions. For purposes of this section, references to NAIC Model Disclosure Form No. 1 and NAIC Model Disclosure Form No. 2 refer to such forms as revised in January 2015, or as subsequently modified by the NAIC, provided Treasury has stated that usage by insurers of the subsequently modified forms is deemed to satisfy the disclosure requirements of the Act and the insurer uses the most current forms, so approved by Treasury, that are available at the time of disclosure. These forms may be found on the Treasury Web site at https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/fin-mkts/Pages/program.aspx.
            
          
          
            § 50.17
            General disclosure requirements for State residual market insurance entities and State workers' compensation funds.
            (a) Residual market mechanism disclosure. A state residual market insurance entity or state workers' compensation fund may provide the disclosures required by this subpart B to policyholders using normal business practices, including forms and methods of communication used to communicate similar information to policyholders. The disclosures may be made by the state residual market insurance entity or state workers' compensation fund itself, the individual insurers that participate in the state residual market insurance entity or state workers' compensation fund, or its servicing carriers. The ultimate responsibility for ensuring that the disclosure requirements have been met rests with the insurer filing a claim under the Program.
            (b) Other requirements. Except as provided in this section, all other disclosure requirements set out in this subpart B apply to state residual insurance market entities and state workers' compensation funds.
          
        
        
          Subpart C—Mandatory Availability
          
            § 50.20
            General mandatory availability requirements.
            (a) General requirements. Under section 103(c) of the Act, an insurer must:
            (1) Make available, in all of its property and casualty insurance policies, coverage for insured losses; and

            (2) Make available property and casualty insurance coverage for insured losses that does not differ materially from the terms, amounts, and other coverage limitations applicable to losses arising from events other than acts of terrorism.
            (b) Compliance through 2020. Under section 108(a) of the Act, an insurer must comply with paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section through calendar year 2020.
            (c) Beyond 2020. Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(2) of this section and § 50.22(a), property and casualty insurance coverage for insured losses does not have to be made available beyond December 31, 2020, even if the policy period of insurance coverage for losses from events other than acts of terrorism extends beyond that date.
          
          
            § 50.21
            Make available.
            (a) General. The requirement to make available coverage as provided in § 50.20 applies at the time an insurer makes the initial offer of coverage as well as at the time an insurer makes an initial offer of renewal of an existing policy.
            (b) Offer consistent with definition of act of terrorism. An insurer must make available coverage for insured losses in a policy of property and casualty insurance consistent with the definition of an act of terrorism as defined in § 50.4(b).
            (c) Changes negotiated subsequent to initial offer. If an insurer satisfies the requirement to make available coverage as described in § 50.20 by first making an offer with coverage for insured losses that does not differ materially from the terms, amounts, and other coverage limitations applicable to losses arising from events other than acts of terrorism, which the policyholder or prospective policyholder declines, the insurer may negotiate with the policyholder or prospective policyholder an option of partial coverage for insured losses at a lower amount of coverage if permitted by any applicable state law. An insurer is not required by the Act to offer partial coverage if the policyholder or prospective policyholder declines full coverage. See § 50.23.
            (d) Demonstrations of compliance. If an insurer makes an offer of insurance but no contract of insurance is concluded, the insurer may demonstrate that it has satisfied the requirement to make available coverage as described in § 50.20 through use of appropriate systems and normal business practices that demonstrate a practice of compliance.
          
          
            § 50.22
            No material difference from other coverage.
            (a) Terms, amounts, and other coverage limitations. As provided in § 50.20(a)(2), an insurer must offer coverage for insured losses arising from an act of terrorism that does not differ materially from the terms, amounts, and other coverage limitations (including deductibles) applicable to losses arising from events other than acts of terrorism. For purposes of this requirement, “terms” excludes price.
            (b) Limitations on types of risk. An insurer is not required to cover risks that it typically excludes or does not write to satisfy the requirement to make available coverage for losses resulting from an act of terrorism that does not differ materially from the terms, amounts, and other coverage limitations applicable to losses arising from events other than acts of terrorism. For example, if an insurer does not cover all types of risks, either because the insurer is outside of direct state regulatory oversight, or because a state permits certain exclusions for certain types of losses, such as nuclear, biological, or chemical events, then the insurer is not required to make such coverage available.
          
          
            § 50.23
            Applicability of State law requirements.
            (a) General. After satisfying the requirement to make available coverage for insured losses that does not differ materially from the terms, amounts, and other coverage limitations applicable to losses arising from events other than acts of terrorism, if coverage is rejected an insurer may then offer coverage that is on different terms, amounts, or coverage limitations, as long as such an offer does not violate any applicable state law requirements.
            (b) Examples. (1) If an insurer subject to state regulation first makes available coverage in accordance with § 50.20 and the state has a requirement that an insurer offer full coverage without any exclusion, then the requirement would continue to apply and the insurer may not subsequently offer less than full coverage or coverage with exclusions.
            (2) If an insurer subject to state regulation first makes available coverage in accordance with § 50.20 and the state permits certain exclusions or allows for other limitations, or an insurance policy is not governed by state law requirements, then the insurer may subsequently offer limited coverage or coverage with exclusions.
          
        
        
          Subpart D—State Residual Market Insurance Entities; State Workers' Compensation Funds
          
            § 50.30
            General participation requirements.
            (a) Insurers. As defined in § 50.4(o), all state residual market insurance entities and state workers' compensation funds are insurers under the Program even if such entities do not receive direct earned premiums.
            (b) Mandatory participation. State residual market insurance entities and State workers' compensation funds are mandatory participants in the Program subject to the rules issued in this Subpart.
            (c) Identification. Treasury maintains a list of state residual market insurance entities and state workers' compensation funds at https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/fin-mkts/Pages/program.aspx. Procedures for providing comments and updates to that list are posted with the list.
          
          
            § 50.31
            Entities that do not share profits and losses with private sector insurers.
            (a) Treatment. A state residual market insurance entity or a state workers' compensation fund that does not share profits and losses with a private sector insurer is deemed to be a separate insurer under the Program.
            (b) Premium calculation. A state residual market insurance entity or a state workers' compensation fund that is deemed to be a separate insurer should follow the guidelines specified in § 50.4(h)(1) or (2) for the purposes of calculating the appropriate measure of direct earned premium.
          
          
            § 50.32
            Entities that share profits and losses with private sector insurers.
            (a) Treatment. A State residual market insurance entity or a State workers' compensation fund that shares profits and losses with a private sector insurer is deemed not to be a separate insurer under the Program.
            (b) Premium and loss calculation. A state residual market insurance entity or a State workers' compensation fund that is deemed not to be a separate insurer should continue to report, in accordance with normal business practices, to each participant insurer its share of premium income and insured losses, which shall then be included respectively in the participant insurer's direct earned premium or insured loss calculations.
          
          
            § 50.33
            Allocation of premium income associated with entities that do share profits and losses with private sector insurers.
            (a) Servicing carriers. For purposes of this subpart, a servicing carrier is an insurer that enters into an agreement to place and service insurance contracts for a state residual market insurance entity or a state workers' compensation fund and to cede premiums associated with such insurance contracts to the State residual market insurance entity or State workers' compensation fund. Premiums written by a servicing carrier on behalf of a state residual market insurance entity or State workers' compensation fund that are ceded to such an entity or fund shall not be included as direct earned premium (as described in § 50.4(h)(1) or (2)) of the servicing carrier.
            (b) Participant insurers. For purposes of this Subpart, a participant insurer is an insurer that shares in the profits and losses of a state residual market insurance entity or a state workers' compensation fund. Premium income that is distributed to or assumed by participant insurers in a state residual market insurance entity or state workers' compensation fund (whether directly or as quota share insurers of risks written by servicing carriers), shall be included in direct earned premium (as described in § 50.4(h)(1) or (2)) of the participant insurer.
          
        
        
          
          Subpart E [Reserved]
        
        
          Subpart F—Data Collection
          
            § 50.50
            General.
            Treasury may request from insurers such data and information as may be reasonably required in support of Treasury's administration of the Program.
          
          
            § 50.51
            Annual data reporting.
            (a) General. No later than May 15 of each calendar year, all insurers shall provide specified data and information respecting their Program participation.
            (b) Scope. Except as otherwise provided by Treasury, the information to be provided shall address: the lines of property and casualty insurance subject to the Program, the premiums earned for terrorism risk insurance within those lines and for those lines generally, the geographical location of exposures covered under terrorism risk insurance, the pricing of terrorism risk insurance, the take-up rate for terrorism risk insurance, the amount of private reinsurance obtained by participating insurers in connection with such policies, and other matters concerning the Program as may be identified by Treasury.
            (c) Method of reporting. (1) Treasury will promulgate forms defining the specific data and information that each insurer must submit and make these forms available on its Web site. Treasury may adopt different data reporting forms for different types of insurers that participate in the Program, which modify the requested information by each different category of participating insurer based upon the manner and scope of the participation of those insurers in the Program. Each insurer shall submit the required data and information by electronic submission through the forms and data portal(s) identified on Treasury's Web site. All data and information provided as part of such electronic submission shall be certified by the insurer as a full and true statement of the information provided to the best of its knowledge, information and belief.
            (2) The data and information required to be provided under this subsection may be modified annually by Treasury. Any modification shall be made during the prior calendar year, and Treasury shall provide insurers at least 90 days before requiring collection of any newly specified data or information.
            (d) Supplemental requests. Treasury may issue supplemental requests, to some or all participating insurers, in connection with the annual data request provided for under this section, to the extent Treasury determines that it requires additional or clarifying information in order to analyze the effectiveness of the Program. Insurers shall respond to any such supplemental requests as may be made within the timeframe and in the manner specified by Treasury.
            (e) Small insurer exception. The Secretary may exempt a small insurer that meets the definition in § 50.4(z) from any or all data calls under this section, or may modify the requests as applicable to such small insurer.
          
          
            § 50.52
            Small insurer data.
            (a) General. The Secretary may collect information relating to small insurers, as defined in § 50.4(z), in order to conduct a study of small insurers participating in the Program, and identify any competitive challenges small insurers face in the terrorism risk insurance marketplace.
            (b) Scope. Information collected concerning small insurers may include information necessary for Treasury to identify:
            (1) Changes to the market share, premium volume, and policyholder surplus of small insurers relative to large insurers;
            (2) How the property and casualty insurance market for terrorism risk differs between small and large insurers, and whether such a difference exists within other perils;
            (3) The impact on small insurers of the Program's mandatory availability requirement under section 103(c) of the Act;
            (4) The effect on small insurers of increasing the trigger amount for the Program under section 103(e)(1)(B) of the Act;

            (5) The availability and cost of private reinsurance for small insurers; and
            
            (6) The impact that state workers compensation laws have on small insurers and workers compensation carriers in the terrorism risk insurance marketplace.
          
          
            § 50.53
            Collection of claims data.
            (a) General. Subsequent to any certification by the Secretary of an act of terrorism, insurers shall report to Treasury information respecting insured losses arising from the act of terrorism.
            (b) Contents of periodic reporting. Reporting under this subsection shall be by a form prescribed by Treasury and made available on the Treasury Web site, which provides basic information about each claim established by an insurer that involves or potentially involves an insured loss. Information to be reported for any claims by or against a policyholder shall identify paid and reserved amounts associated with the claim. In the case of an affiliated group of insurers, the form required by this subsection shall be submitted by a single insurer designated within the affiliated group, which shall report on a consolidated basis. Data and information reported under this subsection will include:
            (1) A listing of each claim by name of insured, catastrophe code, line of business, and in the case of an affiliated group of insurers, the particular insurer or insurers within the group associated with each claim;
            (2) Amounts paid, both loss and loss adjustment expenses, in connection with the claim as of the effective date of the report; and
            (3) Amounts reserved, both loss and loss adjustment expenses, in connection with the claim as of the effective date of the report.
            (c) Timing of reporting. To the extent that an insurer has established one or more claims that it believes involve insured losses arising from an act of terrorism, the insurer shall submit its first report within 60 days of establishing the first of such claims. An updated report shall be submitted each month thereafter, reporting data as of the prior month, until all claims arising from the act of terrorism have been resolved.
            (d) Interrelationship with other reporting requirements. The reporting requirements under this subsection are independent of the Initial Notice of Deductible Erosion, Initial Certification of Loss, and Supplementary Certifications of Loss requirements in subpart H.
            (e) Other sources of information. Subsequent to any certification of an act of terrorism, Treasury may also seek information respecting loss estimates and projections from one or more organizations that are not participants in the Program, such as state insurance regulators, insurance modeling organizations, rating agencies, insurance brokers and producers, and insurance data aggregators. A data request may also be directed to insurers identified in connection with such inquiries. An insurer subject to such a data call shall respond to this request within the time frame specified in the request.
          
          
            § 50.54
            Handling of data.
            (a) General. All nonpublic information submitted to the Secretary under subparts F and G of this part shall be considered proprietary information and shall:
            (1) Be handled and stored by Treasury in an appropriately secure manner;
            (2) Be considered, where appropriate, to be trade secrets or commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential; and
            (3) Not be publicly released in any unaggregated form in which a consumer, policyholder, or insurer is identifiable.
            (b) Use of insurance statistical aggregator. To the extent Treasury utilizes an insurance statistical aggregator in connection with any data collection under subparts F and G, such insurance statistical aggregator shall keep any nonpublic information that it collects confidential, consistent with the requirements of this section.
            (c) Confidentiality. (1) The submission of any non-publicly available data and information to the Secretary under subparts F and G of this part, and the sharing of any non-publicly available data with or by the Secretary among other Federal agencies, the state insurance regulatory authorities, or any other entities shall not constitute a waiver of, or otherwise affect, any privilege or immunity arising under Federal or state law (including the rules of any Federal or state court) to which the data or information is otherwise subject.
            (2) Any requirement under Federal or state law to the extent otherwise applicable, or any requirement pursuant to a written agreement in effect between the original source of any non-publicly available data or information and the source of such data or information to the Secretary, regarding privacy or confidentiality of any data or information in the possession of the source to the Secretary, shall continue to apply to such data or information after the data or information has been provided pursuant to this subpart.
            (3) Any data or information obtained by the Secretary under subparts F or G of this part may be made available to state insurance regulatory authorities, individually or collectively through an information-sharing agreement that:
            (i) Shall comply with applicable Federal law; and
            (ii) Shall not constitute a waiver of, or otherwise affect, any privilege or immunity under Federal or state law (including any privilege referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and the rules of any Federal or State court) to which the data or information is otherwise subject.
            (4) Section 552 of title 5, United States Code, including any exceptions thereunder, shall apply to any data or information submitted under this Subpart by an insurer or affiliate of an insurer.
          
        
        
          Subpart G—Certification
          
            § 50.60
            Certification.
            (a) Certification decision. The Secretary, in consultation with the Attorney General of the United States and the Secretary of Homeland Security, is responsible for determining whether to certify an act as an act of terrorism.
            (b) Timeline for eligibility. An act is eligible for certification as an act of terrorism at the end of the following timeline:
            (1) The Secretary commences review of whether an act satisfies the definition in § 50.4(b);
            (2) Within 30 days of the Secretary commencing review, Treasury publishes the notice required by § 50.61(a). During such review, the schedule of public notifications in § 50.61(b) shall apply, as appropriate;
            (3) The Secretary's review finds that the act satisfies the elements for certification under § 50.4(b)(1)(i) through (iv), and that it is not otherwise precluded from certification by § 50.4(b)(2); and
            (4) Within 30 days or as soon as otherwise practicable after the review identified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section concludes that the act satisfies the necessary criteria, the Secretary consults with the Attorney General of the United States and the Secretary of Homeland Security pursuant to section 102(1)(A) of the Act.
            (c) Other consultation. Nothing in this section shall prevent the Secretary from consulting and coordinating with the Attorney General of the United States, the Secretary of Homeland Security, or any other government official prior to the consultation identified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
            (d) Finality. Any decision by the Secretary to certify, or determination not to certify, an act as an act of terrorism under this subpart shall be final, and shall not be subject to judicial review.
            (e) Nondelegation. The Secretary may not delegate or designate to any other officer, employee, or person, the determination of whether to certify an act as an act of terrorism.
          
          
            § 50.61
            Public communication.
            (a) Initial notification. After the Secretary commences review of whether an act may satisfy the definition in § 50.4(b), Treasury shall publish a notice in the Federal Register within 30 days of the Secretary commencing review notifying the public that the act is under review for certification as an act of terrorism. Treasury may also announce that an act is not under review for certification.
            (b) Update notification. Not later than 30 days following the publication of a notice under paragraph (a) of this section that an act is under review for certification, and not later than every 60 days thereafter until the Secretary determines whether to certify an act as an act of terrorism, Treasury shall publish a notice in the Federal Register notifying the public whether the act is still under review for certification as an act of terrorism.
            (c) Contents of notification. Nothing in this section shall require Treasury to provide any information other than whether the act is under review for certification as an act of terrorism (or is no longer under such review) or shall limit Treasury from providing further information of relevance.
            (d) Rules of construction. Nothing in this section shall be construed to preclude the Secretary from certifying or determining not to certify an act as an act of terrorism before notifying the public that the act is under review for certification. If, in the discretion of the Secretary, circumstances relating to an act render timely notification under this section by Treasury impracticable, Treasury shall provide the notification as soon as practicable, in a manner the Secretary determines is appropriate.
            (e) Nonbinding decision. A notification made under this section shall not be construed to be a final determination by the Secretary of whether to certify an act as an act of terrorism.

            Certification data collection.
            (a) General. (1) The Secretary, when evaluating an act for certification as an act of terrorism, may at any time direct one or more insurers to submit information regarding projected and actual losses in connection with an act and any other information the Secretary determines appropriate. The information sought by the Secretary shall be specified in the data request, and any insurer subject to the data request shall respond to the request within the time frame specified by the Secretary at the time of the request. The data requested may include actual loss reserves established by insurers in connection with the act under consideration, loss estimates generated by insurers in connection with the act under consideration which have not yet been established as actual loss reserves, and information respecting an insurer's property and casualty exposures in a particular geographic area associated with the act under consideration.
            (2) An insurer not required by Treasury to submit information under paragraph (a)(1) of this section may voluntarily submit information to the Secretary as specified in public notifications issued by Treasury.
            (b) Other sources of information. The Secretary may request information with respect to loss estimates and likely affected insurers from organizations, including state insurance regulators, insurance modeling organizations, rating agencies, insurance brokers and producers, and insurance data aggregators.

          Subpart H—Claims Procedures
          
            § 50.70
            Federal share of compensation.
            (a) General. (1) Treasury will pay the Federal share of compensation for insured losses as provided in section 103 of the Act once a Certification of Loss required by § 50.73 is deemed sufficient. The Federal share of compensation under the Program shall be:
            (i) 85 percent of that portion of the insurer's aggregate insured losses that exceeds its insurer deductible during calendar year 2015;
            (ii) 84 percent of that portion of the insurer's aggregate insured losses that exceeds its insurer deductible during calendar year 2016;
            (iii) 83 percent of that portion of the insurer's aggregate insured losses that exceeds its insurer deductible during calendar year 2017;
            (iv) 82 percent of that portion of the insurer's aggregate insured losses that exceeds its insurer deductible during calendar year 2018;
            (v) 81 percent of that portion of the insurer's aggregate insured losses that exceeds its insurer deductible during calendar year 2019; and
            (vi) 80 percent of that portion of the insurer's aggregate insured losses that exceeds its insurer deductible during calendar year 2020 and any calendar year thereafter.
            (2) The percentages in paragraph (a)(1) of this section are subject to any adjustments described in § 50.71 and to the cap of $100 billion as provided in section 103(e)(2) of the Act.
            (b) Program Trigger amounts. Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section or anything in this subpart to the contrary, Federal compensation will not be paid by Treasury unless the aggregate industry insured losses resulting from one or more certified acts of terrorism exceed the following amounts:
            (1) For insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism taking place in calendar year 2015: $100 million;
            (2) For insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism taking place in calendar year 2016: $120 million;
            (3) For insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism taking place in calendar year 2017: $140 million;
            (4) For insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism taking place in calendar year 2018: $160 million;
            (5) For insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism taking place in calendar year 2019: $180 million;
            (6) For insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism taking place in calendar year 2020 and any calendar year thereafter: $200 million.
            (c) Conditions for payment of Federal share. Subject to paragraph (d) of this section, Treasury shall pay the appropriate amount of the Federal share of compensation for an insured loss to an insurer upon a determination that:
            (1) The insurer is an entity, including an affiliate thereof, that meets the requirements of § 50.4(o);
            (2) The insurer's insured losses, as defined in § 50.4(n) and limited by paragraph (d) of this section (including the allocated dollar value of the insurer's proportionate share of insured losses from a state residual market insurance entity or a state workers' compensation fund as described in § 50.33), have exceeded its insurer deductible as defined in § 50.4(p);
            (3) The insurer has paid or is prepared to pay an insured loss, based on a filed claim for the insured loss;
            (4) Neither the insurer's claim for Federal payment nor any underlying claim for an insured loss is fraudulent, collusive, made in bad faith, dishonest or otherwise designed to circumvent the purposes of the Act and regulations;
            (5) The insurer has provided a clear and conspicuous disclosure as required by §§ 50.10 through 50.14 and a cap disclosure as required by § 50.15;
            (6) The insurer offered coverage for insured losses and the offer was accepted by the insured prior to the act which results in the insured loss;
            (7) The insurer took all steps reasonably necessary to properly and carefully investigate the insured loss and otherwise processed the insured loss using practices appropriate for the business of insurance;

            (8) The insured loss is within the scope of coverage issued by the insurer under the terms and conditions of one or more policies for commercial property and casualty insurance as defined in § 50.4(w); and
            
            (9) The procedures specified in this Subpart have been followed and all conditions for payment have been met.
            (d) Adjustments. Treasury may subsequently adjust, including requiring repayment of, any payment made under paragraph (c) of this section in accordance with its authority under the Act.
            (e) Suspension of payment for other insured losses. Upon a determination by Treasury that an insurer has failed to meet any of the requirements for payment specified in paragraph (c) of this section for a particular insured loss, Treasury may suspend payment of the Federal share of compensation for all other insured losses of the insurer pending investigation and audit of the insurer's insured losses.
            (f) Aggregate industry losses. Treasury will determine the amount of aggregate industry insured losses resulting from a certified act of terrorism. If aggregate industry insured losses in a calendar year resulting from one or more certified acts of terrorism exceed the applicable Program Trigger amounts specified in paragraph (b) of this section, Treasury will publish a document in the Federal Register of a Program Trigger Event.
          
          
            § 50.71
            Adjustments to the Federal share of compensation.
            (a) Aggregate amount of insured losses. The aggregate amount of insured losses of an insurer in a calendar year used to calculate the Federal share of compensation shall be reduced by any amounts recovered by the insurer as salvage or subrogation for its insured losses in the calendar year.
            (b) Amount of Federal share of compensation. The Federal share of compensation shall be adjusted as follows:
            (1) No excess recoveries. For any calendar year, the sum of the Federal share of compensation paid by Treasury to an insurer and the insurer's recoveries for insured losses from other sources shall not be greater than the insurer's aggregate amount of insured losses for acts of terrorism in that calendar year. Amounts recovered for insured losses in excess of an insurer's aggregate amount of insured losses for acts of terrorism in a calendar year shall be repaid to Treasury within 45 days after the end of the month in which total recoveries of the insurer, from all sources, become excess. For purposes of this paragraph, amounts recovered from a reinsurer pursuant to an agreement whereby the reinsurer's right to any excess recovery has priority over the rights of Treasury shall not be considered a recovery subject to repayment to Treasury.
            (2) Reduction of amount payable. The Federal share of compensation for insured losses under the Program shall be reduced by the amount of other compensation provided by other Federal programs to an insured or a third party to the extent such other compensation duplicates the insurance indemnification for those insured losses.
            (i) Other Federal program compensation. For purposes of this section, compensation provided by other Federal programs for insured losses means compensation that is provided by Federal programs established for the purpose of compensating persons for losses in the event of emergencies, disasters, acts of terrorism, or similar events. Compensation provided by Federal programs for insured losses excludes benefit or entitlement payments, such as those made under the Social Security Act, under laws administered by the Secretary of Veteran Affairs, railroad retirement benefit payments, and other similar types of benefit payments.
            (ii) Insurer due diligence. With respect to any underlying claim for insured losses, each insurer shall inquire of all involved policyholders, insureds, and claimants whether the person receiving insurance proceeds for an insured loss has received, expects to receive, or is entitled to receive compensation from another Federal program for the insured loss, and if so, the source and the amount of the compensation received or expected. The response, source, and such amounts shall be reported with each underlying claim on the form specified in § 50.73(b)(1).
          
          
            § 50.72
            Notice of deductible erosion.

            Each insurer shall submit to Treasury a Notice on a form prescribed by Treasury whenever the insurer's aggregate insured losses (including reserves for “incurred but not reported” losses) within a calendar year exceed an amount equal to 50 percent of the insurer's deductible as specified in § 50.4(p). Insurers are advised that the form for the Notice of Deductible Erosion will include an initial estimate of aggregate insured losses for the calendar year, the amount of the insurer deductible, and an estimate of the Federal share of compensation for the insurer's aggregate insured losses. In the case of an affiliated group of insurers, the Notice will include the name and address of a single designated insurer within the affiliated group that will serve as the single point of contact for the purpose of providing loss and compliance certifications as required in § 50.73 and for receiving, disbursing, and distributing payments of the Federal share of compensation in accordance with § 50.74. An insurer, at its option, may elect to include with its Notice of Deductible Erosion the certification of direct earned premium required by § 50.73(b)(3).
          
          
            § 50.73
            Loss certifications.
            (a) General. When an insurer has paid aggregate insured losses that exceed its insurer deductible for a calendar year, the insurer may make claim upon Treasury for the payment of the Federal share of compensation for its insured losses. The insurer shall file an Initial Certification of Loss, on a form prescribed by Treasury, and thereafter such Supplementary Certifications of Loss, on a form prescribed by Treasury, as may be necessary to receive payment for the Federal share of compensation for its insured losses.
            (b) Initial certification of loss. An insurer shall use its best efforts to file with the Program the Initial Certification of Loss within 45 days following the last calendar day of the month when an insurer has paid aggregate insured losses that exceed its insurer deductible. The Initial Certification of Loss will include the following:
            (1) Basic information, on a form prescribed by Treasury, about each insured loss paid (or to be paid pursuant to § 50.73(b)(2)(i)) by the insurer. The form will include:
            (i) A listing of each insured loss paid (or to be paid pursuant to § 50.73(b)(2)(i)) by the insurer by catastrophe code and line of business;
            (ii) The total amount of reinsurance recovered from other sources;
            (iii) A calculation of the aggregate insured losses sustained by the insurer above its insurer deductible for the calendar year; and
            (iv) The amount the insurer claims as the Federal share of compensation for its aggregate insured losses.
            (2) A certification that the insurer is in compliance with the provisions of section 103(b) of the Act and this part, including certifications that:
            (i) The underlying insured losses reported pursuant to § 50.73(b)(1) either: Have been paid by the insurer; or will be paid by the insurer upon receipt of an advance payment of the Federal share of compensation as soon as possible, consistent with the insurer's normal business practices, but not longer than five business days after receipt of the Federal share of compensation;
            (ii) The underlying claims for insured losses were filed by persons who suffered an insured loss, or by persons acting on behalf of such persons;
            (iii) The underlying claims for insured losses were processed in accordance with appropriate business practices and the procedures specified in this subpart;
            (iv) The insurer has complied with the disclosure requirements of §§ 50.10 through 50.14, and the cap disclosure requirement of § 50.15, for each underlying insured loss that is included in the amount of the insurer's aggregate insured losses; and
            (v) The insurer has complied with the mandatory availability requirements of subpart C of this part.
            (3) A certification of the amount of the insurer's direct earned premium, together with the calculation of its insurer deductible (provided this certification was not submitted previously with the Notice of Deductible Erosion).
            (4) A certification that the insurer will disburse payment of the Federal share of compensation in accordance with this Subpart.
            (5) A certification that if Treasury has determined a Pro Rata Loss Percentage (PRLP) (see § 50.112), the insurer has complied with applying the PRLP to insured loss payments, where required.
            
            (c) Supplementary certifications of loss. If the total amount of the Federal share of compensation due an insurer for insured losses under the Act has not been determined at the time an Initial Certification of Loss has been filed, the insurer shall file monthly, or on a schedule otherwise determined by Treasury, Supplementary Certifications of Loss updating the amount of the Federal share of compensation due for the insurer's insured losses. Supplementary Certifications of Loss will include the following:
            (1) A form as described in § 50.73(b)(1); and
            (2) A certification as described in § 50.73(b)(2).
            (d) Supplementary information. In addition to the information required in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, Treasury may require such additional supporting documentation as required to ascertain the Federal share of compensation for the insured losses of any insurer.
            (e) State Residual Market Insurance Entities and State Workers' Compensation Funds. A state residual market insurance entity or a state workers' compensation fund described in § 50.32 shall provide the Certifications of Loss described in § 50.73(b) and (c) for all of its insured losses to each participating insurer at the time it provides the allocated dollar value of the participating insurer's proportionate share of insured losses. In addition, at such time the state residual market insurance entity or state workers' compensation fund shall provide the certification described in § 50.73(b)(2) to Treasury. Participating insurers shall treat the allocated dollar value of their proportionate share of insured losses from a state residual market insurance entity or state workers' compensation fund as an insured loss for the purpose of their own reporting to Treasury in seeking the Federal share of compensation.
          
          
            § 50.74
            Payment of Federal share of compensation.
            (a) Timing. Treasury will promptly pay to an insurer the Federal share of compensation due the insurer for its insured losses. Payment shall be made in such installments and on such conditions as determined by the Treasury to be appropriate. Any overpayments by Treasury of the Federal share of compensation will be offset from future payments to the insurer or returned to Treasury within 45 days.
            (b) Payment process. Payment of the Federal share of compensation for insured losses will be made to the insurer designated on the Notice of Deductible Erosion required by § 50.72. An insurer that requests payment of the Federal share of compensation for insured losses must receive payment through electronic funds transfer. The insurer must establish either an account for reimbursement as described in paragraph (c) of this section (if the insurer only seeks reimbursement) or a segregated account as described in paragraph (d) of this section (if the insurer seeks advance payments or a combination of advance payments and reimbursement). Applicable procedures will be posted at https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/fin-mkts/Pages/program.aspx or otherwise will be made publicly available.
            (c) Account for reimbursement. An insurer shall designate an account for the receipt of reimbursement of the Federal share of compensation at an institution eligible to receive payments through the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network.
            (d) Segregated account for advance payments. An insurer that seeks advance payments of the Federal share of compensation as certified according to § 50.73(b)(2)(i) shall establish a segregated account into which Treasury will make advance payments as well as reimbursements to the insurer.
            (1) Definition of segregated account. For purposes of this section, a segregated account is an interest-bearing separate account established by an insurer at a financial institution eligible to receive payments through the ACH network. Such an account is limited to the purposes of:
            (i) Receiving payments of the Federal share of compensation;
            (ii) Disbursing payments to insureds and claimants; and
            (iii) Transferring payments to the insurer or affiliated insurers for insured losses reported as already paid.
            (2) Remittance of interest. All interest earned on advance payments in the segregated account must be remitted at least quarterly to Treasury's Bureau of the Fiscal Service or as otherwise prescribed in applicable procedures.
            (e) Denial or withholding of advance payment. Treasury may deny or withhold advance payments of the Federal share of compensation to an insurer if Treasury determines that the insurer has not properly disbursed previous advances of the Federal share of compensation or otherwise has not complied with the requirements for advance payment as provided in this Subpart.
            (f) Affiliated group. In the case of an affiliated group of insurers, Treasury will make payment of the Federal share of compensation for the insured losses of the affiliated group to the insurer designated in the Notice of Deductible Erosion to receive payment on behalf of the affiliated group. The designated insurer receiving payment from Treasury must distribute payment to affiliated insurers in a manner that ensures that each insurer in the affiliated group is compensated for its share of insured losses, taking into account a reasonable and fair allocation of the group deductible among affiliated insurers. Upon payment of the Federal share of compensation to the designated insurer, Treasury's payment obligation to the insurers in the affiliated group with respect to any insured losses covered is discharged to the extent of the payment.
          
          
            § 50.75
            Determination of affiliations.
            For the purposes of this subpart, an insurer's affiliates for any calendar year shall be determined by the circumstances existing on the date of the act which is the Program Trigger Event for that calendar year.
          
          
            § 50.76
            Final netting.
            (a) General. Pursuant to section 103(e)(4) of the Act, the Secretary shall have sole discretion to determine the time at which claims relating to any insured loss or act of terrorism shall become final.
            (b) Final Netting Date. The Secretary may determine a Final Netting Date for a calendar year, which for purposes of this part is the date on or before which an insurer must report to Treasury on the insurer's Certifications of Loss (both Initial Certification of Loss and any Supplemental Certifications of Loss) all insured losses that have been reported by its policyholders for the calendar year.
            (1) Criteria for Final Netting Date. The establishment of a Final Netting Date will be based on factors and considerations including:
            (i) Amounts of case reserves reported by insurers to Treasury for open underlying insured losses;
            (ii) The rate at which claims for the Federal share of compensation for insured losses are being made by insurers to Treasury;
            (iii) The rate at which new underlying insured losses are being added by insurers to their Supplementary Certifications of Loss and reported;
            (iv) The predominant lines of business for which underlying insured losses are being reported;
            (v) Tort and contract statutes of limitations relevant to insured losses and the manner in which they are being applied by the Federal courts;
            (vi) Common business practices;
            (vii) Issues that are delaying final resolution of insured losses;

            (viii) The application of the liability limitations and procedures under the Support Anti-terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 441 et seq.) that may affect final resolution of insured losses;
            (ix) Issues related to the cap on annual liability for insurer losses, including whether a projection that the cap on annual liability will be reached in connection with any calendar year indicates that no Final Netting Date should be set for that calendar year;
            (x) Treasury's claims administration costs; and
            (xi) [Reserved]
            (xii) Such other factors as the Secretary considers appropriate to take into account.
            (2) Notice of Final Netting Date. Treasury shall announce and publish in the Federal Register notice of a proposed Final Netting Date and its application to a specific calendar year, and will solicit comments from the public regarding the appropriateness of the proposed Final Netting Date. After receipt and evaluation of comments respecting its proposed Final Netting Date, Treasury will publish in the Federal Register a Final Netting Date, which is at least 180 days after the date of publication. The Secretary's determination of a Final Netting Date is final and not subject to judicial review.
            (c) Post-Final Netting Date claims. After the Final Netting Date, insurers may only make further claims for the Federal share of compensation for insured losses by submission of Supplemental Certifications of Loss with updated information on underlying insured losses previously reported to Treasury. Such updated information may reflect a decision by a court of competent jurisdiction concerning a limitation of liability under the Support Anti-terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies Act of 2002. In the case of workers' compensation losses, the insurer may provide updated information based on the number of workers' compensation claimants previously reported. An insurer may not report any new underlying insured losses, or increased workers' compensation loss amounts based on an increase in the number of workers' compensation claimants, to Treasury after a Final Netting Date, except as provided in this section.
            (d) Commutation. A commutation is the payment by Treasury of a lump sum present value of future payments to an insurer in lieu of making payments in the future, as provided in this section.
            (1) In lieu of continued submission of Supplemental Certifications of Loss after the Final Netting Date as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, Treasury may require, or consider an insurer's request for, a commutation of an insurer's future claims for the Federal share of compensation based on estimates for the underlying insured losses reported to Treasury on or before the Final Netting Date. The payment by Treasury of a final commuted amount to an insurer will discharge Treasury from all future liabilities to the insurer for the Federal share of compensation for insured losses for the applicable calendar year. In the case of an affiliated group of insurers, the requirements of § 50.74(f) apply, and payment of the final commuted amount to the designated insurer of the affiliated group discharges Treasury's payment obligation to the insurers in the affiliated group for insured losses for the applicable calendar year.
            (2) If future claims are to be commuted, Treasury may require additional information from the insurer, including an insurer's justification for a final payment amount with necessary actuarial factors and methodology, and pertinent information regarding the insurer's business relationships and other reinsurance recoverables. Insurers will be required to justify discount and other factors from which final payment amounts are derived. If Treasury notifies an insurer of a requirement to submit additional information to inform its commutation decision, the insurer will be provided (depending upon the complexity of the material sought) no less than 90 days from the date of notification to submit material required in the notice. If the insurer fails to provide the requested information, it will forfeit the right to future payments from Treasury. Treasury will evaluate such information in order to determine a final payment amount or (if applicable) an amount to be repaid to Treasury. Treasury may determine that it will not consider commutation until it has completed an audit of an insurer's insured losses pursuant to the authority set forth in subpart I of these regulations.
            (3) Payments of commuted amounts are not considered to be advance payments requiring a segregated account as described in § 50.74(d).
            (4) Notwithstanding § 50.70(d), a payment by Treasury of a final commuted amount to an insurer is final unless:
            (i) Treasury is put on notice that an insurer's claim was fraudulent or that other conditions for Federal payment were not met, in which case the insurer will be required to repay amounts that were not due; or
            (ii) The exception in paragraph (e) of this section applies, in which case Treasury may make additional payments for insured losses, but only under the conditions described in paragraph (e).
            (e) Exception. If within one year after the Final Netting Date, and regardless of commutation, an insurer has additional underlying reported insured losses that, in the absence of a Final Netting Date, would result in an increase of the Federal share of compensation to that insurer by 20% of the total amount already paid to that insurer, the insurer may request Treasury to allow those underlying insured losses to be submitted as part of a certification of loss. Under such circumstances and provided that all other conditions for payment have been met, Treasury may reopen or extend the insurer's claim for the Federal share of compensation for insured losses for the pertinent calendar year.
          
        
        
          Subpart I—Audit and Investigative Procedures
          
            § 50.80
            Audit authority.
            The Secretary of the Treasury, or an authorized representative, shall have, upon reasonable notice, access to all books, documents, papers and records of an insurer that are pertinent to amounts paid to the insurer as the Federal share of compensation for insured losses, or pertinent to any Federal terrorism policy surcharge that is imposed pursuant to subpart J of this part, for the purposes of investigation, confirmation, audit, and examination.
          
          
            § 50.81
            Recordkeeping.
            (a) Each insurer that seeks payment of a Federal share of compensation under subpart H of this part shall retain such records as are necessary to fully disclose all material matters pertinent to insured losses and the Federal share of compensation sought under the Program, including, but not limited to, records regarding premiums and insured losses for all commercial property and casualty insurance issued by the insurer and information relating to any adjustment in the amount of the Federal share of compensation payable. Insurers shall maintain detailed records for not less than five (5) years from the termination dates of all reinsurance agreements involving property and casualty insurance subject to the Act. Records relating to premiums shall be retained and available for review for not less than three (3) years following the conclusion of the policy year. Records relating to underlying claims shall be retained for not less than five (5) years following the final adjustment of the claim.
            (b) Each insurer that collects a Federal terrorism policy surcharge as required by subpart J of this part shall retain records related to such surcharge, including records of the property and casualty insurance premiums subject to the surcharge, the amount of the surcharge imposed on each policy, aggregate Federal terrorism policy surcharges collected, and aggregate Federal terrorism policy surcharges remitted to Treasury during each assessment period. Such records shall be retained and kept available for review for not less than three (3) years following the conclusion of the assessment period or settlement of accounts with Treasury, whichever is later.
          
          
            § 50.82
            Civil penalties.
            (a) General. The Secretary may assess a civil monetary penalty, in an amount not exceeding the amount specified under § 50.83, against any insurer that the Secretary determines, on the record after opportunity for a hearing:
            (1) Has failed to charge, collect, or remit the Federal terrorism policy surcharge under subpart J;
            (2) Has intentionally provided to Treasury erroneous information regarding premium or loss amounts;
            (3) Submits to Treasury fraudulent claims under the Program for insured losses;
            (4) Has failed to provide any disclosures or other information required by Treasury; or
            (5) Has otherwise failed to comply with provisions of the Act or these regulations.
            (b) Recovery of amount in dispute. A penalty under this section for any failure to pay, charge, collect, or remit amounts in accordance with the Act or under these regulations shall be in addition to any such amounts recovered by Treasury.
            (c) Procedure. Treasury shall notify in writing any insurer that it believes has committed one or more of the acts identified in paragraph (a) of this section. In that notification, Treasury shall identify the act or acts that it believes has been violated, and its basis for that belief, and shall set a schedule for further proceedings which shall include:
            (1) The opportunity for a written submission by the insurer that provides all relevant facts and circumstances concerning the alleged conduct, including any information that the insurer wishes Treasury to consider in connection with the alleged conduct; and
            (2) A hearing on the record, unless waived by the insurer, during which Treasury and the insurer may present further information respecting the conduct in question.
            (d) Other remedies preserved. Treasury's assessment and collection of a civil monetary penalty under this section shall be in addition and without prejudice to any other civil remedies or criminal penalties that may arise on account of the conduct in question under any other laws or regulations of the United States.

            [81 FR 93765, Dec. 21, 2016, as amended at 84 FR 15956, Apr. 17, 2019]
          
        
        
          Subpart J—Recoupment and Surcharge Procedures
          
            § 50.90
            Mandatory and discretionary recoupment.
            (a) Pursuant to section 103(e) of the Act, the Secretary shall impose, and insurers shall collect, such Federal terrorism policy surcharges as needed to recover 140 percent of the mandatory recoupment amount for any calendar year.
            (b) In the Secretary's discretion, the Secretary may recover any portion of the aggregate Federal share of compensation that exceeds the mandatory recoupment amount through a Federal terrorism policy surcharge based on the factors set forth in section 103(e)(7)(D) of the Act.
            (c) If the Secretary imposes a Federal terrorism policy surcharge as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, then the required amounts, based on the extent to which payments for the Federal share of compensation have been made by the collection deadlines in section 103(e)(7)(E) of the Act, shall be collected in accordance with such deadlines:
            (1) For any act of terrorism that occurs on or before December 31, 2017, the Secretary shall collect all required amounts by September 30, 2019;
            (2) For any act of terrorism that occurs between January 1 and December 31, 2018, the Secretary shall collect 35 percent of any required amounts by September 30, 2019, and the remainder by September 30, 2024; and
            (3) For any act of terrorism that occurs on or after January 1, 2019, the Secretary shall collect all required amounts by September 30, 2024.
          
          
            § 50.91
            Determination of recoupment amounts.
            (a) If payments for the Federal share of compensation have been made for a calendar year, and Treasury determines that insured loss information is sufficiently developed and credible to serve as a basis for calculating recoupment amounts, Treasury will make an initial determination of any mandatory or discretionary recoupment amounts for that calendar year.

            (b)(1) Within 90 days after certification of an act of terrorism, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register an estimate of aggregate insured losses which shall be used as the basis for initially determining whether mandatory recoupment will be required.

            (2) If at any time Treasury projects that payments for the Federal share of compensation will be made for a calendar year, and that in order to meet the collection timing requirements of section 103(e)(7)(E) of the Act it is necessary to use an estimate of such payments as a basis for calculating recoupment amounts, Treasury will make an initial determination of any mandatory recoupment amounts for that calendar year.
            (c) Following the initial determination of recoupment amounts for a calendar year, Treasury will recalculate any mandatory or discretionary recoupment amount as necessary and appropriate, and at least annually, until a final recoupment amount for the calendar year is determined. Treasury will compare any recalculated recoupment amount to amounts already remitted and/or to be remitted to Treasury for a Federal terrorism policy surcharge previously established to determine whether any additional amount will be recouped by Treasury.
            (d) For the purpose of determining initial or recalculated recoupment amounts, Treasury may issue a data call to insurers for insurer deductible and insured loss information by calendar year. Treasury's determination of the aggregate amount of insured losses from Program Trigger Events of all insurers for a calendar year will be based on the amounts reported in response to a data call and any other information Treasury in its discretion considers appropriate. Submission of data in response to a data call shall be on a form promulgated by Treasury.
          
          
            § 50.92
            Establishment of Federal terrorism policy surcharge.
            (a) Treasury will establish the Federal terrorism policy surcharge based on the following factors and considerations:
            (1) In the case of a mandatory recoupment amount, the requirement to collect 140 percent of that amount;
            (2) The total dollar amount to be recouped as a percentage of the latest available annual aggregate industry direct written premium information;
            (3) The adjustment factors for terrorism loss risk-spreading premiums described in section 103(e)(8)(D) of the Act;
            (4) The annual 3 percent limitation on terrorism loss risk-spreading premiums collected on a discretionary basis as provided in section 103(e)(8)(C) of the Act;
            (5) A preferred minimum initial assessment period of one full year and subsequent extension periods in full year increments;
            (6) The collection timing requirements of section 103(e)(8)(E) of the Act;
            (7) The likelihood that the amount of the Federal terrorism policy surcharge may result in the collection of an aggregate recoupment amount in excess of the planned recoupment amount; and
            (8) Such other factors as the Secretary considers appropriate to take into account.
            (b) The Federal terrorism policy surcharge shall be the obligation of the policyholder and is payable to the insurer with the premium for a property and casualty insurance policy in effect during the assessment period established by Treasury. See § 50.94(c).
          
          
            § 50.93
            Notification of recoupment.

            (a) Treasury will provide notifications of recoupment through publication of notices in the Federal Register or in another manner Treasury deems appropriate, based upon the circumstances of the certified act(s) of terrorism under consideration.
            (b) Treasury will provide reasonable advance notice to insurers of any initial Federal terrorism policy surcharge effective date. This effective date shall be January 1 of the calendar year following publication of the notice, unless such date would not provide for sufficient notice of implementation while meeting the collection timing requirements of section 103(e)(8)(E) of the Act.
            (c) Treasury will provide reasonable advance notice to insurers of any modification or cessation of the Federal terrorism policy surcharge.
            (d) Treasury will provide notification to insurers annually as to the continuation of the Federal terrorism policy surcharge.
          
          
            § 50.94
            Collecting the surcharge.

            (a) Insurers shall collect a Federal terrorism policy surcharge from policyholders as required by Treasury.
            
            (b) Policies subject to the Federal terrorism policy surcharge are those for which direct written premium is reported on commercial lines of business on the NAIC's Exhibit of Premiums and Losses of the NAIC Annual Statement (commonly known as Statutory Page 14) as provided in § 50.4(w)(1), or equivalently reported.
            (c) For policies subject to the Federal terrorism policy surcharge, the surcharge shall be imposed and collected on a written premium basis for policies that become effective or renew during the assessment period. All new, renewal, mid-term, and audit premiums for a policy term are subject to the surcharge in effect on the policy term effective date. Notwithstanding this paragraph, if the premium for a policy term that would otherwise be subject to the surcharge is revised after the end of the reporting period described in § 50.95(e), then any additional premium attributable to such revision is not subject to the Surcharge. For purposes of this subpart:
            (1) Written premium basis means the premium amount charged a policyholder by an insurer for property and casualty insurance, including all premiums, policy expense constants and fees defined as premium pursuant to the Statements of Statutory Accounting Principles established by the NAIC, as adopted by the state for which the premium will be reported.
            (2) In the case of a policy providing multiple insurance coverages, if an insurer cannot identify the premium amount charged a policyholder specifically for property and casualty insurance under the policy, then:

            (i) If the insurer estimates that the portion of the premium amount charged for coverage other than property and casualty insurance is de minimis to the total premium for the policy, the insurer may impose and collect from the policyholder a surcharge amount based on the total premium for the policy, but

            (ii) If the insurer estimates that the portion of the premium amount charged for coverage other than property and casualty insurance is not de minimis, the insurer shall impose and collect from the policyholder a Surcharge amount based on a reasonable estimate of the premium amount for the property and casualty insurance coverage under the policy.
            (3) The Federal terrorism policy surcharge is not considered premium.
            (d) A policyholder must pay the applicable Federal terrorism policy surcharge when due. The insurer shall have such rights and remedies to enforce the collection of the surcharge that are the equivalent to those that exist under applicable state or other law for nonpayment of premium.
            (e) When an insurer returns an unearned premium, or otherwise refunds premium to a policyholder, it shall also return any Federal terrorism policy surcharge collected that is attributable to the refunded unearned premium. Notwithstanding this paragraph, if the written premium for a policy is revised and refunded after the end of the reporting period described in § 50.95(e), then the insurer is not required to refund any Surcharge that is attributable to the refunded premium.
            (f) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, if the expense of collecting the Federal terrorism policy surcharge from all policyholders of an insurer during an assessment period exceeds the amount of the Surcharges anticipated to be collected, such insurer may satisfy its obligation to collect by omitting actual collection and instead remitting to Treasury the amount otherwise due.
            (g) The Federal terrorism policy surcharge is repayment of Federal financial assistance in an amount required by law. No fee or commission shall be charged on the Federal terrorism policy surcharge.
          
          
            § 50.95
            Remitting the surcharge.
            (a) Each insurer shall report direct written premium and Federal terrorism policy surcharges to Treasury on a monthly and annual basis during the assessment period. Reporting will be on a form prescribed by Treasury and will be due according to the following schedule:
            (1) Monthly: From the beginning of the assessment period through November, on the last business day of the calendar month following the month for which premium is reported, and
            
            (2) Annually: March 1 for the prior calendar year.
            (b) The monthly statements provided to Treasury will include the following:
            (1) Cumulative calendar year direct written premium adjusted for premium not subject to the Federal terrorism policy surcharge, summarized by policy year.
            (2) The aggregate Federal terrorism policy surcharge amount calculated by applying the established surcharge percentage to the insurer's adjusted direct written premium by policy year.
            (3) Insurer certification of the submission.
            (c) The annual statements to be provided to Treasury will include the following:
            (1) Direct written premium, adjusted for premium not subject to the Federal terrorism policy surcharge, summarized by policy year and by commercial line of insurance as specified in § 50.4(w).
            (2) The aggregate Federal terrorism policy surcharge amount calculated by applying the established surcharge percentage to the insurer's adjusted direct written premium by policy year.
            (3) In the case of an insurer that has chosen not to collect the Federal terrorism policy surcharge from its policyholders as provided in § 50.94(f), a certification that the expense of collecting the Surcharge during the assessment period would have exceeded the amount of the surcharges collected over the assessment period.
            (4) Insurer certification of the submission.
            (d) The calculated aggregate Federal terrorism policy surcharge amount, as described in paragraphs (b)(2) and (c)(2) of this section, shall be remitted to Treasury upon submission of each monthly and annual statement. Through its submitted statements, an insurer obtains credit for a refund of any Federal terrorism policy surcharge previously remitted to Treasury that was subsequently returned by the insurer to a policyholder as attributable to refunded premium under § 50.94(e). A negative calculated amount in a monthly or annual statement indicates payment from Treasury is due to the insurer.
            (e) Reporting shall continue for the one-year period following the end of the assessment period established by Treasury, unless otherwise permitted by Treasury.
          
          
            § 50.96
            Insurer responsibility.
            Notwithstanding § 50.4(o), for purposes of the collection, reporting and remittance of Federal terrorism policy surcharges to Treasury, the definition of insurer shall not include any affiliate of the insurer.
          
        
        
          Subpart K—Federal Cause of Action; Approval of Settlements
          
            § 50.100
            Federal cause of action and remedy.
            (a) General. If the Secretary certifies an act as an act of terrorism pursuant to subpart G of this part, there shall exist a Federal cause of action for property damage, personal injury, or death arising out of or resulting from such act of terrorism, pursuant to section 107 of the Act, which shall be the exclusive cause of action and remedy for claims for property damage, personal injury, or death arising out of or relating to such act of terrorism, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.
            (b) Jurisdiction. For each determination described in paragraph (a) of this section, not later than 90 days after the Secretary certifies an act as an act of terrorism, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation shall designate a single district court or, if necessary, multiple district courts of the United States that shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction over all actions for any claim (including any claim for loss of property, personal injury, or death) relating to or arising out of an act of terrorism subject to section 107 of the Act.
            (c) Effective period. The exclusive Federal cause of action and remedy described in paragraph (a) of this section shall exist only for causes of action for property damage, personal injury, or death that arise out of or result from acts of terrorism during the effective period of the Program.
            (d) Rights not affected. Nothing in section 107 of the Act or this subpart shall in any way:
            
            (1) Limit the liability of any government, organization, or person who knowingly participates in, conspires to commit, aids and abets, or commits any act of terrorism;
            (2) Affect any party's contractual right to arbitrate a dispute; or
            (3) Affect any provision of the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act (Pub. L. 107-42; 49 U.S.C. 40101 note).
          
          
            § 50.101
            State causes of action preempted.
            All State causes of action of any kind for property damage, personal injury, or death arising out of or resulting from an act of terrorism that are otherwise available under state law are preempted, except that, pursuant to section 107(b) of the Act, nothing in this section shall limit in any way the liability of any government, organization, or person who knowingly participates in, conspires to commit, aids and abets, or commits the act of terrorism certified by the Secretary.
          
          
            § 50.102
            Advance approval of settlements.
            (a) Mandatory submission of settlements for advance approval. Pursuant to section 107(a)(6) of the Act, an insurer shall submit to Treasury for advance approval any proposed agreement to settle or compromise any Federal cause of action for property damage, personal injury, or death, asserted by a third-party or parties against an insured, involving an insured loss, all or part of the payment of which the insurer intends to include in its aggregate insured losses for purposes of calculating the insurer deductible or the Federal share of compensation of its insured losses under the Program, when:
            (1) Any portion of the proposed settlement amount that is attributable to an insured loss or losses involving personal injury or death in the aggregate is $2 million or more per third-party claimant, regardless of the number of causes of action or insured losses being settled; or
            (2) Any portion of the proposed settlement amount that is attributable to an insured loss or losses involving property damage (including loss of use) in the aggregate is $10 million or more per third-party claimant, regardless of the number of causes of action or insured losses being settled.
            (b) Discretionary review of other settlements. Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, Treasury may require that an insurer submit for review and advance approval any proposed agreement to settle or compromise any Federal cause of action for property damage, personal injury, or death, asserted by a third-party or parties against an insured, involving an insured loss, all or part of the payment of which the insurer intends to include in its aggregate insured losses for purposes of calculating the insurer deductible or the Federal share of compensation of its insured losses where the settlement amounts are below the applicable monetary thresholds identified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.
            (c) Factors. In determining whether to approve a proposed settlement, Treasury will consider the nature of the loss, the facts and circumstances surrounding the loss, and other factors such as whether:
            (1) The proposed settlement compensates for a third-party's loss, the liability for which is an insured loss under the terms and conditions of the underlying commercial property and casualty insurance policy, as certified by the insurer pursuant to § 50.103(d)(2);
            (2) Any amount of the proposed settlement is attributable to punitive or exemplary damages intended to punish or deter (whether or not specifically so described as such damages);
            (3) The settlement amount offsets amounts received from the United States pursuant to any other Federal program;
            (4) The settlement amount does not include any items such as fees and expenses of attorneys, experts, and other professionals that have caused the insured losses under the underlying commercial property and casualty insurance policy to be overstated; and

            (5) Any other criteria that Treasury may consider appropriate, depending on the facts and circumstances surrounding the settlement, including the information contained in § 50.103.
            
            (d) Settlement without seeking advance approval or despite disapproval. If an insurer settles a cause of action or agrees to the settlement of a cause of action without submitting the proposed settlement for Treasury's advance approval in accordance with paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, and in accordance with § 50.103 or despite Treasury's disapproval of the proposed settlement, the insurer will not be entitled to include the paid settlement amount (or portion of the settlement amount, to the extent partially disapproved) in its aggregate insured losses for purposes of calculating the Federal share of compensation of its insured losses, unless the insurer can demonstrate, to the satisfaction of Treasury, extenuating circumstances.
          
          
            § 50.103
            Procedure for requesting approval of proposed settlements.
            (a) Submission of notice. Insurers must request advance approval of a proposed settlement by submitting a notice of the proposed settlement and other required information in writing to the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Office or its designated representative. The address where notices are to be submitted will be available at https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/fin-mkts/Pages/program.aspx following any certification of an act of terrorism pursuant to section 102(1) of the Act.
            (b) Complete notice. Treasury will review requests for advance approval and determine whether additional information is needed to complete the notice.
            (c) Treasury response or deemed approval. Within 30 days after Treasury's receipt of a complete notice, or as extended in writing by Treasury, Treasury may issue a written response and indicate its partial or full approval or rejection of the proposed settlement. If Treasury does not issue a response within 30 days after Treasury's receipt of a complete notice, unless extended in writing by Treasury, the request for advance approval is deemed approved by Treasury. Any settlement is still subject to review under the claim procedures pursuant to § 50.80.
            (d) Notice format. A notice of a proposed settlement should be entitled, “Notice of Proposed Settlement—Request for Approval,” and should provide the full name and address of the submitting insurer and the name, title, address, and telephone number of the designated contact person. An insurer must provide all relevant information, including the following, as applicable:
            (1) A brief description of the claim against the insured, the amount of the claim, the operative policy terms, and defenses to coverage;
            (2) A certification by the insurer that the settlement is for a third-party's loss, the liability for which is an insured loss under the terms and conditions of the underlying commercial property and casualty insurance policy;

            (3) A brief description of all damages allegedly sustained and an itemized statement of all damages by category (i.e., actual, economic and non-economic loss, punitive damages, etc.);
            (4) A statement from the insurer or its attorney in support of the settlement;
            (5) The total dollar amount of the proposed settlement and the amount of the proposed settlement which is an insured loss;
            (6) Indication as to whether the settlement was negotiated by counsel;
            (7) The amount to be paid that will compensate for any items such as fees and expenses of attorneys, experts, and other professionals for their services and expenses related to the insured loss and/or settlement and the net amount to be received by the third-party after such payment;
            (8) The amount(s) received from the United States pursuant to any other Federal program(s) for compensation of insured losses related to an act of terrorism;
            (9) The proposed terms of the written settlement agreement, including release language and subrogation terms;
            (10) Other relevant agreements, including:
            (i) Admissions of liability or insurance coverage;
            (ii) Determinations of the number of occurrences under a commercial property and casualty insurance policy;

            (iii) The allocation of paid amounts or amounts to be paid to certain policies, or to a specific policy, coverage and/or aggregate limits;
            
            (iv) Any other agreement that may affect the payment or amount of the Federal share of compensation to be paid to the insurer; and
            (v) Any other relevant agreement requested by Treasury.
            (11) A statement indicating whether the proposed settlement has been approved by the Federal court or is subject to such approval and whether such approval is expected or likely; and
            (12) Such other information that is related to the insured loss as may be requested by Treasury that it deems necessary to evaluate the proposed settlement.
          
          
            § 50.104
            Subrogation.
            An insurer shall not waive its rights of subrogation under its property and casualty insurance policy with respect to any losses the payment of which the insurer intends to include in its insurer deductible or the aggregate insured losses for purposes of calculating the Federal share of compensation of its insured losses and shall, unless upon request the United States agrees in writing to forbear from exercising such right, preserve the subrogation right of the United States as provided by section 107(c) of the Act by not taking any action that would prejudice the subrogation right of the United States.
          
        
        
          Subpart L—Cap on Annual Liability
          
            § 50.110
            Cap on annual liability.
            Pursuant to section 103 of the Act, if the aggregate insured losses exceed $100,000,000,000 during a calendar year:
            (a) The Secretary shall not make any payment for any portion of the amount of such losses that exceeds $100,000,000,000;
            (b) An insurer that has met its insurer deductible shall not be liable for the payment of any portion of the amount of such losses that exceeds $100,000,000,000; and
            (c) The Secretary shall determine the pro rata share of insured losses to be paid by each insurer that incurs insured losses under the Program.
          
          
            § 50.111
            Notice to Congress.
            Pursuant to section 103(e)(3) of the Act, the Secretary shall provide an initial notice to Congress within 15 days of the certification of an act of terrorism, stating whether the Secretary estimates that aggregate insured losses will exceed $100,000,000,000 for the calendar year in which the event occurs. Such initial estimate may be based on insured loss amounts as compiled by insurance industry statistical organizations, data previously collected by the Secretary, and any other information the Secretary in his or her discretion considers appropriate. The Secretary shall also notify Congress if estimated or actual aggregate insured losses exceed $100,000,000,000 during any calendar year.
          
          
            § 50.112
            Determination of pro rata share.
            (a) Pro rata loss percentage (PRLP) is the percentage determined by the Secretary to be applied by an insurer against the amount that would otherwise be paid by the insurer under the terms and conditions of an insurance policy providing property and casualty insurance under the Program if there were no cap on annual liability under section 103(e)(2)(A) of the Act.
            (b) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, if Treasury estimates that aggregate insured losses may exceed the cap on annual liability for a calendar year, then Treasury will determine a PRLP. The PRLP applies to insured loss payments by insurers for insured losses incurred in the subject calendar year, as specified in § 50.113, from the effective date of the PRLP, as established by Treasury, until such time as Treasury provides notice that the PRLP is revised. Treasury will determine the PRLP based on the following considerations:
            (1) Estimates of insured losses from insurance industry statistical organizations;
            (2) Any data calls issued by Treasury (see § 50.114);
            (3) Expected reliability and accuracy of insured loss estimates and likelihood that insured loss estimates could increase;
            (4) Estimates of insured losses and expenses not included in available statistical reporting;

            (5) Such other factors as the Secretary considers important.
            

            (c) Treasury shall provide notice of the determination of the PRLP through publication in the Federal Register, or in another manner Treasury deems appropriate, based upon the circumstances of the act of terrorism under consideration.
            (d) As appropriate, Treasury will determine any revision to a PRLP based on the same considerations listed in paragraph (b) of this section, and will provide notice for its application to insured loss payments.
            (e) If Treasury estimates based on an initial act of terrorism or subsequent act of terrorism within a calendar year that aggregate insured losses may exceed the cap on annual liability, but an appropriate PRLP cannot yet be determined, Treasury will provide notification advising insurers of this circumstance and, after consulting with the relevant state authorities, may initiate the action described in either paragraph (e)(1) or (2) of this section.
            (1) Hiatus in payments. Call a hiatus in insurer loss payments for insured losses of up to two weeks. In such a circumstance, Treasury will determine a PRLP as quickly as possible. The PRLP, as later determined, will be effective retroactively as of the start of the hiatus. Any insured losses submitted in support of an insurer's claim for the Federal share of compensation will be reviewed for the insurer's compliance with pro rata payments in accordance with the effective date of the PRLP.
            (2) Determine an interim PRLP. (i) An interim PRLP is an amount determined without the availability of information necessary for consideration of all factors listed in § 50.112(b). It is a conservatively low percentage amount determined in order to facilitate initial partial claim payments by insurers after an act of terrorism and prior to the time that information becomes available to determine a PRLP based on consideration of the factors listed in § 50.112(b).

            (ii) In such a circumstance, Treasury will determine a PRLP to replace the interim PRLP as quickly as possible. The PRLP, as later determined, will be effective retroactively as of the effective date of the interim PRLP. Any insured losses submitted in support of an insurer's claim for the Federal share of compensation will be reviewed for the insurer's compliance with pro rata payments in accordance with the effective date of the interim PRLP, or as later replaced by the PRLP as appropriate.
          
          
            § 50.113
            Application of pro rata share.
            An insurer shall apply the PRLP to determine the pro rata share of each insured loss to be paid by the insurer on all insured losses in the absence of an agreement on a complete and final settlement as evidenced by a signed settlement agreement or other means reviewable by a third party as of the effective date established by Treasury. Payments based on the application of the PRLP and determination of the pro rata share satisfy the insurer's liability for payment under the Program. Application of the PRLP and the determination of the pro rata share are the exclusive means for calculating the amount of insured losses for Program purposes. The pro rata share is subject to the following:
            (a) The pro rata share is determined based on the estimated or actual final claim settlement amount that would otherwise be paid.
            (b) All policies. If partial payments have already been made as of the effective date of the PRLP, then the pro rata share for that loss is the greater of the amount already paid as of the effective date of the PRLP or the amount computed by applying the PRLP to the estimated or actual final claim settlement amount that would otherwise be paid.
            (c) Certain workers' compensation insurance policies. If an insurer's payments under a workers' compensation policy cumulatively exceed the amount computed by applying the PRLP to the estimated or actual final claim settlement amount that would otherwise be paid because such estimated or actual final settlement amount is reduced from a previous estimate, then the insurer may request a review and adjustment by Treasury in the calculation of the Federal share of compensation. In requesting such a review, the insurer must submit information to supplement its Certification of Loss demonstrating a reasonable estimate invalidated by unexpected conditions differing from prior assumptions including, but not limited to, an explanation and the basis for the prior assumptions.
            (d) If an insurer has not yet made payments in excess of its insurer deductible, the rules in this paragraph apply.
            (1) If the insurer estimates that it will exceed its insurer deductible making payments based on the application of the PRLP to its insured losses, then the insurer shall apply the PRLP as of the effective date specified in § 50.112(b).

            (2)(i) If the insurer estimates that it will not exceed its insurer deductible making payments based on the application of the PRLP to its insured losses, then the insurer may make payments on the same basis as prior to the effective date of the PRLP. The insurer may also make payments on the basis of applying some other pro rata amount it determines that is greater than the PRLP, where the insurer estimates that application of such other pro rata amount will result in it not exceeding its insurer deductible. The insurer remains liable for losses in accordance with § 50.115(c).
            (ii) If an insurer estimates that it will not exceed its insurer deductible and has made payments on the basis provided in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, but thereafter reaches its insurer deductible, then the insurer shall apply the PRLP to any remaining insured losses. When such an insurer submits a claim for the Federal share of compensation, the amount of the insurer's losses will be deemed to be the amount it would have paid if it had applied the PRLP as of the effective date, and the Federal share of compensation will be calculated on that amount. However, an insurer may request an exception if it can demonstrate that its estimate was invalidated as a result of insured losses from a subsequent act of terrorism.
          
          
            § 50.114
            Data call authority.
            For the purpose of determining initial or recalculated PRLPs, Treasury may issue a data call to insurers for insured loss information, seeking information in addition to any information provided to Treasury under subparts F and H of this part.
          
          
            § 50.115
            Final amount.
            (a) Treasury shall determine if, as a final proration, remaining insured loss payments, as well as adjustments to previous insured loss payments, can be made by insurers based on an adjusted PLRP, and aggregate insured losses still remain within the cap on annual liability. In such a circumstance, Treasury will notify insurers as to the final PRLP and its application to insured losses.
            (b) If paragraph (a) of this section applies, Treasury may require, as part of the insurer submission for the Federal share of compensation for insured losses, a supplementary explanation regarding how additional payments will be provided on previously settled insured losses.
            (c) An insurer that has prorated its insured losses, but that has not met its insurer deductible, remains liable for loss payments that in the aggregate bring the insurer's total insured loss payments up to an amount equal to the lesser of its insured losses without proration or its insurer deductible.

                    Except as specifically authorized by the Secretary of the Treasury (or designee) or as otherwise provided in this part, no person shall export, melt, or treat:
                    (a) Any 5-cent coin of the United States; or
                    (b) Any one-cent coin of the United States.
                  
                  
                    § 82.2
                    Exceptions.
                    (a) The prohibition contained in § 82.1 against the exportation of 5-cent coins and one-cent coins of the United States shall not apply to:
                    (1) The exportation in any one shipment of 5-cent coins and one-cent coins having an aggregate face value of not more than $100 that are to be legitimately used as money or for numismatic purposes. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to authorize export for the purpose of sale or resale of coins for melting or treatment by any person.
                    (2) The exportation of 5-cent coins and one-cent coins carried on an individual, or in the personal effects of an individual, departing from a place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, when the aggregate face value is not more than $5, or when the aggregate face value is not more than $25 and it is clear that the purpose for exporting such coins is for legitimate personal numismatic, amusement, or recreational use.
                    (b) The prohibition contained in § 82.1 against the treatment of 5-cent coins and one-cent coins shall not apply to the treatment of these coins for educational, amusement, novelty, jewelry, and similar purposes as long as the volumes treated and the nature of the treatment makes it clear that such treatment is not intended as a means by which to profit solely from the value of the metal content of the coins.
                    (c) The prohibition contained in § 82.1 against the exportation, melting, or treatment of 5-cent and one-cent coins of the United States shall not apply to coins exported, melted, or treated incidental to the recycling of other materials so long as—
                    (1) Such 5-cent and one-cent coins were not added to the other materials for their metallurgical value;

                    (2) The volumes of the 5-cent coins and one-cent coins, relative to the volumes of the other materials recycled, makes it clear that the presence of such coins is merely incidental; and
                    
                    (3) The separation of the 5-cent and one-cent coins from the other materials would be impracticable or cost prohibitive.
                    (d) The prohibition contained in § 82.1 against the exportation, melting, or treatment of 5-cent coins shall not apply to 5-cent coins inscribed with the years 1942, 1943, 1944, or 1945 that are composed of an alloy comprising copper, silver and manganese.
                    (e) The prohibition contained in § 82.1 against the exportation of 5-cent coins and one-cent coins shall not apply to 5-cent coins and one-cent coins exported by a Federal Reserve Bank or a domestic depository institution, or to a foreign central bank, when the exportation of such 5-cent coins and one-cent coins is for use as circulating money.
                    (f)(1) The prohibition contained in § 82.1 against exportation, melting, or treatment of 5-cent coins and one-cent coins of the United States shall not apply to coins exported, melted, or treated under a written license issued by the Secretary of the Treasury (or designee).
                    (2) Applications for licenses should be transmitted to the Director, United States Mint, 801 9th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20220.

                      Assessment of civil penalties.
                      (a) General rule. The assessing official may impose a civil penalty on any person when the following two conditions are met:
                      
                      (1) That person uses in connection with, or as a part of, any advertisement, solicitation, business activity, or product, whether alone or with other words, letters, symbols, or emblems—
                      (i) The words “Department of the Treasury,” “United States Mint,” or “U.S. Mint”;
                      (ii) The titles “Secretary of the Treasury,” “Treasurer of the United States,” “Director of the United States Mint,” or “Director of the U.S. Mint”;
                      (iii) The abbreviations or initials of any entity or title referred to in paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (a)(1)(ii) of this section;
                      (iv) Any symbol, emblem, seal, or badge of an entity referred to in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section (including the design of any envelope, stationery, or identification card used by such an entity); or

                      (2) That person's use is in a manner that could reasonably be interpreted or construed as conveying the false impression that such advertisement, solicitation, business activity, or product is in any manner approved, endorsed, sponsored, authorized by, or associated with the United States Mint, or any officer, or employee thereof.
                      (b) Disclaimers. Any determination of whether a person has violated the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section shall be made without regard to any use of a disclaimer of affiliation with the United States Government or any particular agency or instrumentality thereof.
                      (c) Civil penalty. The assessing official may impose a civil penalty on any person who violates the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section. The amount of a civil penalty shall not exceed $5,000 for each and every use of any material in violation of paragraph (a) of this section, except that such penalty shall not exceed $25,000 for each and every use if such use is in a broadcast or telecast.
                      (d) Time limitations. (1) Civil penalties imposed under the procedures in this subpart must be assessed before the end of the three-year period beginning on the date of offense.
                      (2) The assessing official may commence a civil action to recover or enforce any civil penalty imposed in a Final Notice of Assessment issued pursuant to § 92.17 at any time before the end of the two-year period beginning on the date of the Final Notice of Assessment. If judicial review of the Final Notice of Assessment is sought, the two-year period begins to run from the date that a final and unappealable court order is issued.
                      (e) Criminal Proceeding. No civil penalty may be imposed under the procedures in this subpart with respect to any violation of paragraph (a) of this section after a criminal proceeding on the same violation has been commenced by indictment or information under 31 U.S.C. 333(d).
                    
                    
                      § 92.14

                      (b) The assessing official will consider relevant factors when determining whether to initiate an action to impose a civil penalty under the procedures in this subpart. Those factors may include, but are not limited to, the following:
                      (1) The scope of the misuse;
                      (2) The purpose and/or nature of the misuse;
                      (3) The extent of the harm caused by the misuse;

                      (5) The commercial benefit intended to be derived from the misuse; and
                      (6) The repeated nature of the misuse.
                      (c) If the assessing official decides to initiate an action to impose a civil penalty under the procedures in this subpart, he or she will, in writing:
                      (1) Appoint an examining official; and
                      (2) Delegate to the examining official the authority to prepare, sign, and serve an Initial Notice of Assessment on behalf of the assessing official.
                    
                    
                      § 92.15
                      Initial notice of assessment.

                      The examining official shall review all immediately available evidence on the matter; determine a proposed civil penalty based on the factors listed under § 92.16(d)(2)(iii); and prepare and serve an Initial Notice of Assessment by United States mail or other means upon the person believed to be in violation of § 92.13 and otherwise subject to a civil penalty. The notice shall provide the name and telephone number of the examining official, who can provide information concerning the notice and the procedures in this subpart. The notice shall include the following:
                      (a) A specific reference to the provisions of § 92.13 violated;
                      (b) A concise statement of the facts that support the conclusion that such a violation occurred;
                      (c) The amount of the civil penalty proposed and the maximum amount of the potential civil penalty that the assessing official could impose;
                      (d) A notice informing the person alleged to be in violation of § 92.13 that he or she:
                      (1) May, within 30 days of the date of the notice, pay the proposed civil penalty, thereby waiving the right to make a written response under § 92.16 and to seek judicial review under § 92.18:
                      (i) By electronic funds transfer (EFT) in accordance with instructions provided by the examining official in the Initial Notice of Assessment; or
                      (ii) By means other than EFT only with the written approval of the assessing official;
                      (2) May make a written response in accordance with § 92.16 within 30 days of the date of the notice addressing, as appropriate:
                      (i) Why a civil penalty should not be imposed; and
                      (ii) Why a civil penalty should be in a lesser amount than proposed.
                      (3) May be represented by an attorney or other representative, provided that a designation of representative signed by the person alleged to be in violation is received by the examining official; and
                      (4) May request, within 20 days of the date of the notice, a copy of or opportunity to review any documents and/or other evidence that the United States Mint compiled and relied on in determining to issue the notice (the assessing official reserves the right to assert privileges available under law and may decline to disclose certain documents and/or other evidence protected by such privileges; however, any documents or other evidence withheld from disclosure shall be expunged from the record and shall not be considered by the examining and assessing officials in arriving at their respective recommendations and decisions); and
                      (e) An advisement of the following:
                      (1) If no written response is received within the time allowed in § 92.16(b), a Final Notice of Assessment may be issued without a presentation by the person;
                      (2) If a written response has been made and the examining official deems it necessary, the examining official may request, orally or in writing, additional information from the respondent;
                      (3) A Final Notice of Assessment may be issued in accordance with § 92.17 requiring that the proposed civil penalty be paid;

                      (4) A Final Notice of Assessment is subject to judicial review in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 701 et seq.; and
                      (5) All submissions sent in response to the Initial Notice of Assessment must be transmitted to the address specified in the notice and include the name, address, and telephone number of the respondent.
                    
                    
                      § 92.16
                      Written response.
                      (a) Form and contents. (1) The written response submitted by a person pursuant to § 92.15(d)(2) must provide the following:
                      (i) A reference to and specific identification of the Initial Notice of Assessment involved;
                      (ii) The full name of the person against whom the Initial Notice of Assessment has been made;
                      (iii) If the respondent is not a natural person, the name and title of the officer authorized to act on behalf of the respondent; and
                      (iv) If a representative of the person named in the Initial Notice of Assessment is filing the written response, a copy of the duly executed designation as representative.

                      (2) The written response must admit or deny each violation of § 92.13 set forth in the Initial Notice of Assessment. Any violation not specifically denied will be presumed to be admitted. Where a violation is denied, the respondent shall specifically set forth the legal or factual basis upon which the allegation is denied. If the basis of the written response is that the respondent is not the person responsible for the alleged violation, the written response must set forth sufficient information to allow the examining and assessing officials to determine the truth of such an assertion. The written response should include any and all documents and other information that the respondent believes should be a part of the administrative record on the matter.
                      (b) Time. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, any written response made under this section must be submitted not later than 30 days after the date of the Initial Notice of Assessment.
                      (2) If a request for documents or other evidence is made pursuant to § 92.15(d)(4), the written response must be submitted not later than 20 days after the date of the United States Mint's response to the request.
                      (3)(i) In computing the number of days allowed for filing a written response under this paragraph, the first day counted is the day after the date of the Initial Notice of Assessment is issued. If the last date on which the response is required to be filed by this paragraph is a Saturday, Sunday or Federal holiday, the response will be due on the next business day after that date.
                      (ii) If a response is transmitted by United States mail, it will be deemed timely filed if postmarked on or before the due date.
                      (4) The examining official may extend the period for making a written response under paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section for up to ten days for good cause shown. Requests for extensions beyond ten days must be approved by the assessing official and must be based on good cause shown. Generally, failure to obtain representation in a timely manner will not be considered good cause.
                      (c) Filing. The response may be sent by personal delivery, United States mail or commercial delivery. A written response transmitted by means other than United States mail will be considered filed on the date received at the address specified in the Initial Notice of Assessment.
                      (d) Review and Recommendation. The examining official will fully consider the facts and arguments submitted by the respondent in the written response, any other documents filed by the respondent pursuant to this subpart, and the evidence in the United States Mint's record on the matter. If the respondent waives the right to submit a written response in accordance with § 92.15(d)(1), or declines to submit a written response by the end of the 30-day response period, the examining official will fully consider the evidence in the United States Mint's record on the matter.
                      (1) In fully considering the matter, the examining official will not consider any evidence introduced into the record by the United States Mint after the date of the Initial Notice of Assessment unless and until the respondent has been notified that such additional evidence will be considered, and has had an opportunity to request, review and comment on such evidence.
                      (2) The examining official will prepare a concise report, addressed to the assessing official, which will contain the following:
                      (i) The entire administrative record on the matter, including all information provided in or with a written response timely filed by the respondent and any additional information provided pursuant to § 92.15(e)(2), as well as all evidence upon which the Initial Notice of Assessment was based, and any additional evidence as provided for in § 92.16(d)(1).
                      (ii) A finding, based on the preponderance of the evidence, as to each alleged violation specified in the Initial Notice of Assessment;

                      (iii) For each violation that the examining official determines to have occurred, a recommendation as to the appropriate amount of a civil penalty to be imposed which, upon additional consideration of the evidence, may be the same as, more than, or less than the amount initially proposed by the examining official pursuant to § 92.15. In making this recommendation, the examining official will consider all relevant factors including, but not limited to, the following:
                      (A) The scope of the misuse;
                      (B) The purpose and/or nature of the misuse;
                      (C) The extent of the harm caused by the misuse;
                      (D) The circumstances of the misuse;
                      (E) The commercial benefit intended to be derived from the misuse; and
                      (F) The repeated nature of the misuse.
                      (iv) If the examining official determines that a violation has occurred, a proposed Final Notice of Assessment that incorporates his or her findings and recommendations.
                      (v) Any additional information or considerations that the assessing officer should consider in a decision whether to issue a Final Notice of Assessment under § 92.17.
                    
                    
                      § 92.17
                      Final action.
                      (a) In making a final determination whether to impose a penalty, the assessing official shall take into consideration the entire report prepared by the examining official. Although the assessing official should accord appropriate weight to the findings and recommendations of the examining official, the assessing official is not bound by them. The assessing official may approve, disapprove, modify, or substitute any or all of the examining official's findings and recommendations if, in his or her judgment, the evidence in the record supports such a decision. The assessing official will determine whether:
                      (1) The facts warrant a conclusion that no violation has occurred; or
                      (2)(i) The facts warrant a conclusion that one or more violations have occurred; and
                      (ii) The facts and violations found justify the conclusion that a civil penalty should be imposed.
                      (b) If the assessing official determines that no violation has occurred, the official shall promptly send a letter indicating that determination to the person served with an Initial Notice of Assessment and to any designated representative of such person.
                      (c) If the assessing official determines that a violation has occurred:
                      (1) The assessing official shall issue a Final Notice of Assessment to the person served with an Initial Notice of Assessment and to any designated representative of such person.
                      (2) The assessing official may, in his or her discretion:
                      (i) Impose a civil penalty;
                      (ii) Not impose a civil penalty; or
                      (iii) Impose a civil penalty and suspend the payment of all or some of the civil penalty, conditioned on the violator's future compliance with 31 U.S.C. 333.
                      (3) If a civil penalty is imposed under § 92.17(c)(2)(i) or (iii), the assessing official shall determine the appropriate amount of the penalty in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 333(c)(2). In determining the amount of a civil penalty, the assessing official will consider relevant factors including, but not limited to, the following:
                      (i) The scope of the misuse;
                      (ii) The purpose and/or nature of the misuse;
                      (iii) The extent of the harm caused by the misuse;
                      (iv) The circumstances of the misuse;
                      (v) The commercial benefit intended to be derived from the misuse; and
                      (vi) The repeated nature of the misuse.
                      (4) The Final Notice of Assessment shall:
                      (i) Include the following:
                      (A) A specific reference to each provision of § 92.13 found to have been violated;
                      (B) A concise statement of the facts supporting a conclusion that each violation has occurred;
                      (C) An analysis of how the facts and each violation justifies the conclusion that a civil penalty should be imposed; and
                      (D) The amount of each civil penalty imposed and a statement as to how the amount of each penalty was determined; and
                      (ii) Inform the person of the following:

                      (A) Payment of a civil penalty imposed by the Final Notice of Assessment must be made within 30 days of the date of the notice;
                      
                      (B) Payment of a civil penalty imposed by the Final Notice of Assessment shall be paid by EFT in accordance with instructions provided in the notice, unless the assessing official has given written approval to have payment made by other means;
                      (C) If payment of a civil penalty imposed by the Final Notice of Assessment has been suspended on the condition that the person comply in the future with 31 U.S.C. 333 and this subpart, the failure by the person to so comply will make the civil penalty payable on demand;
                      (D) If a civil penalty is not paid within 30 days of the date of the Final Notice of Assessment (or on demand under paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(D) of this section), a civil action to collect the penalty or enforce compliance may be commenced at any time within two years of the date of the Final Notice of Assessment; and

                      (E) Any civil penalty imposed by the Final Notice of Assessment may be subject to judicial review in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 701 et seq.
                      
                    
                    
                      § 92.18

                      A Final Notice of Assessment issued under the procedures in this subpart may be subject to judicial review pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 701 et seq.

                    § 100.2
                    Scope of regulations; transactions effected through Federal Reserve banks and branches; distribution of coin and currencies.

                    (a) The regulations in this part govern the exchange of the coin and paper currency of the United States (including national bank notes and Federal Reserve bank notes in process of retirement and Federal Reserve notes). Under authorization in the Act approved May 29, 1920, 41 Stat. 655 (31 U.S.C. 476), the Secretary of the Treasury transferred to the Federal Reserve banks and branches the duties and functions performed by the former Assistant Treasurers of the United States in connection with the exchange of paper currency and coin of the United States. Except for the duties in this respect to be performed by the Treasurer of the United States and the Director of the Mint, as may be indicated from time to time by the Secretary of the Treasury, exchanges of the paper currency and coin of the United States and the distribution and replacement thereof will, so far as practicable, be effected through the Federal Reserve banks and branches. The Federal Reserve banks and branches are authorized to distribute available supplies of coin and currency to depository institutions, as that term is defined in section 103 of the Monetary Control Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-221). As authorized by section 107 of the Act, transportation of coin and currency and coin wrapping services will be provided according to a schedule of fees established by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Inquiries by depository institutions regarding distribution and related services should be addressed to the Federal Reserve bank of the district where the institution is located.
                    (b) The Department of the Treasury has authorized amendments to this part by the following bureaus and offices:

                      § 100.3
                      Lawfully held coin and currencies in general.
                      The official agencies of the Department of the Treasury will continue to exchange lawfully held coins and currencies of the United States, dollar for dollar, for other coins and currencies which may be lawfully acquired and are legal tender for public and private debts. Paper currency of the United States which has been falsely altered and coins altered to render them for use as other denominations will not be redeemed since such currency and coins are subject to forfeiture under Title 18, United States Code, section 492. Persons receiving such currency and coins should notify immediately the nearest local office of the U.S. Secret Service of the Department of the Treasury, and hold the same pending advice from the Service.
                    
                    
                      § 100.4

                      Gold coins, and gold certificates of the type issued before January 30, 1934, are exchangeable, as provided in this part, into other currency or coin which may be lawfully issued.

                      § 100.5
                      Mutilated paper currency.
                      (a) General. Lawfully held mutilated paper currency of the United States may be submitted for examination in accord with the provisions in this subpart. Such currency may be redeemed at face amount if sufficient remnants of any relevant security feature and clearly more than one-half of the original note remains. Fragments of such mutilated currency which are not clearly more than one-half of the original whole note or are lacking sufficient remnants of any relevant security feature will be redeemed at face value only if the Director, Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Department of the Treasury, is satisfied that the missing portions have been totally destroyed. The Director's judgment shall be based on such evidence of total destruction as is necessary and shall be final. Any submission under this subpart shall be deemed an acceptance of all provisions contained herein.
                      (b) Definitions. The following definitions are used in this subpart:
                      
                        Mutilated currency is currency which has been damaged to the extent that:
                      (i) One-half or less of the original note remains; or
                      (ii) Its condition is such that its value is questionable and the currency must be forwarded to the Department of the Treasury for the examination by trained experts before any redemption is made.
                      
                        Unfit currency is currency which is unfit for further circulation because of its physical condition such as torn, dirty, limp, worn or defaced. Unfit currency should not be forwarded to the Department of the Treasury, but may be exchanged at commercial banks.
                    
                    
                      § 100.6
                      Destroyed paper currency.
                      No relief will be granted on account of lawfully held paper currency which has been totally destroyed.
                    
                    
                      
                      § 100.7
                      Treasury's redemption process.
                      (a) Lawful holders of mutilated currency may receive a redemption at full value when:
                      (1) Clearly more than 50% of a note identifiable as United States currency is present along with sufficient remnants of any relevant security feature; or
                      (2) Fifty percent or less of a note identifiable as United States currency is present and the method of mutilation and supporting evidence demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Treasury that the missing portions have been totally destroyed.
                      (b) No redemption will be made when:
                      (1) A submission, or any portion thereof, demonstrates a pattern of intentional mutilation or an attempt to defraud the United States. In such instances, the entire submission will be destroyed or retained as evidence.
                      (2) A submission appears to be part of, or intended to further, any criminal scheme. In such instances, the entire submission will be destroyed or retained as evidence.
                      (3) A submission contains a material misrepresentation of facts.
                      (4) Fragments and remnants presented are not identifiable as United States currency; or
                      (5) Fragments and remnants presented which represent 50% or less of a note are identifiable as United States currency but the method of destruction and supporting evidence do not satisfy the Treasury that the missing portion has been totally destroyed.
                      (c) Lawfully held mutilated currency in a submission that also contains counterfeit currency may be destroyed or retained as evidence, at the discretion of the Director of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.
                      (d) All cases will be handled under proper procedures to safeguard the funds and interests of the submitter of lawfully held mutilated currency. In some cases, the amount redeemed will be less than the amount estimated by the submitter. In other cases, the amount redeemed may be greater. The amount redeemed will be determined by an examination made by trained mutilated currency examiners and governed by the above criteria.
                      (e) The Director of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing shall have final authority with respect to redemptions of mutilated currency submissions.
                      (f) All submissions for review shall include an estimate of the value of the currency and an explanation of how it came to be mutilated. The submission should also contain the bank account number and routing number for an account of a United States bank since all redemptions of $500 or more shall be made through Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT).
                    
                    
                      § 100.8
                      Packaging and shipping of mutilated currency.
                      Mutilated currency examiners are best able to determine the value of the currency when it has been carefully packed and boxed as described below. As a result, failure to follow the directions in this section may result in a denial of redemption:
                      (a) Regardless of the condition of the currency, do not disturb the fragments more than is absolutely necessary.
                      (b) If the currency is brittle or inclined to fall apart, pack it carefully in cotton and box it as found, without disturbing the fragments, if possible.
                      (c) If the currency was in a purse, box, or other container when mutilated, it should be left therein, if possible, in order to prevent further deterioration of the fragments or from their being lost.
                      (d) If it is absolutely necessary to remove the fragments from the container, send the container with the currency and any other contents found, except as noted in paragraph (g) of this section.
                      (e) If the currency was flat when mutilated, do not roll, fold, laminate, tape, glue or in any other way alter the currency in an attempt to preserve it.
                      (f) If the currency was in a roll when mutilated, do not attempt to unroll or straighten.

                      (g) If coin or any other metal is mixed with the currency, remove carefully. Do not send coin or other metal in the same package with mutilated paper currency, as the metal will break up the currency. Coin should be exchanged in accordance with subpart C of this part.
                      
                      (h) Mutilated currency shipments must be addressed as follows:

                      (c) Whoever intentionally files a false claim seeking reimbursement for mutilated currency may be held criminally liable under a number of statutes including 18 U.S.C. 287 and 18 U.S.C. 1341 and may be held civilly liable under 31 U.S.C. 3729, et seq.

                      § 100.10
                      Request for examination of uncurrent coin for possible redemption.
                      (a) Definition. Uncurrent coins are whole U.S. coins which are merely worn or reduced in weight by natural abrasion yet are readily and clearly recognizable as to genuineness and denomination and which are machine countable.
                      (b) Redemption process. The United States Mint will not accept uncurrent coins for redemption. Members of the public wishing to redeem lawfully held uncurrent coins must deposit the uncurrent coins with a bank or other financial institution that will accept them, or with a depository institution that has established a direct customer relationship with a Federal Reserve Bank. A Federal Reserve Bank will redeem uncurrent coins, based on the policies described in the Federal Reserve's Operating Circular 2.
                      (c) Criteria for acceptance. Depository institutions that redeem uncurrent coins must sort the coins by denomination into packages in accordance with the Federal Reserve's Operating Circular 2. The Federal Reserve Banks have the right to reject any shipment containing objects that are not U.S. coins or any contaminant that could render the uncurrent coins unsuitable for coinage metal.
                      (d) Redemption sites. The Federal Reserve Banks and branches listed in § 100.17 are the only authorized redemption sites at which a depository institution that has established a direct customer relationship with a Federal Reserve Bank may redeem uncurrent coins.
                    
                    
                      § 100.11

                      (a) General. Lawfully held bent or partial coins of the United States may be submitted to the United States Mint for examination in accordance with the provisions in this subpart. Any submission under this subpart shall be deemed an acceptance of all provisions of this subpart.
                      (b) Definitions. (1) Bent coins are U.S. coins which are bent or deformed so as to preclude normal machine counting but which are readily and clearly identifiable as to genuineness and denomination.
                      (2) Partial coins are U.S. coins which are not whole; partial coins must be readily and clearly identifiable as to genuineness and denomination.
                      (3) Participants are individuals or businesses that submit coins through the redemption process.
                      (c) Redemption process. (1) Depending on submission amount and frequency, participants may be subject to a certification process by the United States Mint. The established annual weight threshold and details about the participant certification process will be published on the United States Mint's website. If certification is required, it must be done prior to submission.
                      
                      (2) All submissions for review shall include an estimate of the value of the coins and an explanation of how the submission came to be bent or partial. The submission should also contain the bank account number and routing number for a checking or savings account at a bank or other financial institution (such as a mutual fund, brokerage firm, or credit union) in the United States.
                      (3) Participants may be required to provide documentation for how the participant came into custody of the bent or partial coins.
                      (4) The United States Mint reserves the right to test samples from any submission to authenticate the material. The size of the sample will be limited to the amount necessary for authentication. Testing may result in partial or complete destruction of the sample.
                      (5) The United States Mint reserves the right to conduct site visits for participants over a certain volume threshold to verify information provided to the United States Mint.
                      (6) No redemption will be made when:
                      (i) A submission, or any portion of a submission, demonstrates a pattern of intentional mutilation or an attempt to defraud the United States;
                      (ii) A submission appears to be part of, or intended to further, any criminal activity;
                      (iii) A submission contains a material misrepresentation of facts;
                      (iv) Material presented is not identifiable as United States coins. In such instances, the participant will be notified to retrieve the entire submission, at the participant's sole expense, within 30 days. If the submission is not retrieved in a timely manner, the entire submission will be treated as voluntarily abandoned property, pursuant to 41 CFR 102-41.80, and will be retained or disposed of by the United States Mint;
                      (v) A submission contains any contaminant that could render the coins unsuitable for coinage metal. In such instances, the participant will be notified to retrieve the entire submission, at the participant's sole expense, within 30 days. If the submission is not retrieved in a timely manner, the entire submission will be treated as voluntarily abandoned property, pursuant to 41 CFR 102-41.80, and will be retained or disposed of by the United States Mint; or
                      (vi) A submission contains more than a nominal amount of uncurrent coins. In such instances, the participant may be notified to retrieve the entire submission, at the participant's sole expense, within 30 days. If the submission is not retrieved in a timely manner, the entire submission will be treated as voluntarily abandoned property, pursuant to 41 CFR 102-41.80, and will be retained or disposed of by the United States Mint.
                      (7) The Director of the United States Mint, or designee, shall have final authority with respect to all aspects of redemptions of bent or partial coin submissions.
                      (d) Redemption rates—(1) Generally. Participants shall separate bent or partial coins by the denomination categories listed below in lots of at least one pound for each denomination category. The United States Mint will redeem bent or partial coins on the basis of their weight and denomination at the following rates:

                    (3) The coins were determined to be counterfeit and were seized by the Treasury Department and forfeited to the United States.
                    (b) To whom addressed. Petitions for mitigation of the forfeiture of counterfeit gold coins should be addressed to the Assistant Secretary, Enforcement, Operations, Tariff Affairs, Department of Treasury, 15th and Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20220.

                    (2) The petitioner was an innocent purchaser or holder of the gold coins and is not under investigation in connection with the coins at the time of submission or thereafter;

                    (4) Mitigation of the forfeiture is in the best interest of the Government.
                  
                  
                    § 101.4
                    Extraction of gold bullion from the counterfeit coins.
                    If the petition is approved, the Assistant Secretary shall then forward the gold coins to the Bureau of the Mint where, if economically feasible, the gold bullion will be extracted from the counterfeit coins.

                    Exceptions.
                    The provisions of this part shall not apply where the cost of smelting the gold coins exceeds the value of the gold bullion to be returned.
                  
                  
                    § 101.8

                    The Secretary of the Treasury retains complete discretion to deny any claim of any petitioner when the Secretary believes it is not in the best interest of the Government to return the bullion to the petitioner or when the Secretary is not convinced that the petitoner was an innocent purchaser or holder without knowledge that the gold coins were counterfeit.

                    Authority, purpose, collection of information, and incorporation by reference.
                    (a) Authority. This part is issued jointly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) and the Secretary of the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) under section 802 of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 (Act) (enacted as Title VIII of the Security and Accountability For Every Port Act of 2006, Pub. L. No. 109-347, 120 Stat. 1884, and codified at 31 U.S.C. 5361-5367). The Act states that none of its provisions shall be construed as altering, limiting, or extending any Federal or State law or Tribal-State compact prohibiting, permitting, or regulating gambling within the United States. See 31 U.S.C. 5361(b). In addition, the Act states that its provisions are not intended to change which activities related to horseracing may or may not be allowed under Federal law, are not intended to change the existing relationship between the Interstate Horseracing Act of 1978 (IHA) (15 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.) and other Federal statutes in effect on October 13, 2006, the date of the Act's enactment, and are not intended to resolve any existing disagreements over how to interpret the relationship between the IHA and other Federal statutes. See 31 U.S.C. 5362(10)(D)(iii). This part is intended to be consistent with these provisions.
                    (b) Purpose. The purpose of this part is to issue implementing regulations as required by the Act. The part sets out necessary definitions, designates payment systems subject to the requirements of this part, exempts certain participants in designated payment systems from certain requirements of this part, provides nonexclusive examples of policies and procedures reasonably designed to identify and block, or otherwise prevent and prohibit, restricted transactions, and sets out the Federal entities that have exclusive regulatory enforcement authority with respect to the designated payments systems and non-exempt participants therein.
                    (c) Collection of information. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved the collection of information requirements in this part for the Department of the Treasury and assigned OMB control number 1505-0204. The Board has approved the collection of information requirements in this part under the authority delegated to the Board by OMB, and assigned OMB control number 7100-0317.

                    (2) Any amendment to definitions of the relevant ACH terms in the ACH Rules shall not apply to this part unless the Treasury and the Board jointly accept such amendment by publishing notice of acceptance of the amendment to this part in the Federal Register.

                    § 132.5
                    Policies and procedures required.
                    (a) All non-exempt participants in designated payment systems shall establish and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to identify and block or otherwise prevent or prohibit restricted transactions.
                    (b) A non-exempt financial transaction provider participant in a designated payment system shall be considered to be in compliance with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section if—
                    (1) It relies on and complies with the written policies and procedures of the designated payment system that are reasonably designed to—
                    (i) Identify and block restricted transactions; or
                    (ii) Otherwise prevent or prohibit the acceptance of the products or services of the designated payment system or participant in connection with restricted transactions; and
                    (2) Such policies and procedures of the designated payment system comply with the requirements of this part.
                    (c) For purposes of paragraph (b)(2) in this section, a participant in a designated payment system may rely on a written statement or notice by the operator of that designated payment system to its participants that states that the operator has designed or structured the system's policies and procedures for identifying and blocking or otherwise preventing or prohibiting restricted transactions to comply with the requirements of this part as conclusive evidence that the system's policies and procedures comply with the requirements of this part, unless the participant is notified otherwise by its Federal functional regulator or, in the case of participants that are not directly supervised by a Federal functional regulator, the Federal Trade Commission.
                    (d) As provided in the Act, a person that identifies and blocks a transaction, prevents or prohibits the acceptance of its products or services in connection with a transaction, or otherwise refuses to honor a transaction, shall not be liable to any party for such action if—
                    (1) The transaction is a restricted transaction;
                    (2) Such person reasonably believes the transaction to be a restricted transaction; or
                    (3) The person is a participant in a designated payment system and blocks or otherwise prevents the transaction in reliance on the policies and procedures of the designated payment system in an effort to comply with this regulation.

                    (e) Nothing in this part requires or is intended to suggest that designated payment systems or participants therein must or should block or otherwise prevent or prohibit any transaction in connection with any activity that is excluded from the definition of “unlawful Internet gambling” in the Act as an intrastate transaction, an intratribal transaction, or a transaction in connection with any activity that is allowed under the Interstate Horseracing Act of 1978 (15 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.; see § 132.1(a)).
                    (f) Nothing in this part modifies any requirement imposed on a participant by other applicable law or regulation to file a suspicious activity report to the appropriate authorities.
                    (g) The requirement of this part to establish and implement written policies and procedures applies only to the U.S. offices of participants in designated payment systems.
                  
                  
                    § 132.6
                    Non-exclusive examples of policies and procedures.
                    (a) In general. The examples of policies and procedures to identify and block or otherwise prevent or prohibit restricted transactions set out in this section are non-exclusive. In establishing and implementing written policies and procedures to identify and block or otherwise prevent or prohibit restricted transactions, a non-exempt participant in a designated payment system is permitted to design and implement policies and procedures tailored to its business that may be different than the examples provided in this section. In addition, non-exempt participants may use different policies and procedures with respect to different business lines or different parts of the organization.
                    
                    (b) Due diligence. If a non-exempt participant in a designated payment system establishes and implements procedures for due diligence of its commercial customer accounts or commercial customer relationships in order to comply, in whole or in part, with the requirements of this regulation, those due diligence procedures will be deemed to be reasonably designed to identify and block or otherwise prevent or prohibit restricted transactions if the procedures include the steps set out in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) of this section and subject to paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
                    (1) At the establishment of the account or relationship, the participant conducts due diligence of a commercial customer and its activities commensurate with the participant's judgment of the risk of restricted transactions presented by the customer's business.
                    (2) Based on its due diligence, the participant makes a determination regarding the risk the commercial customer presents of engaging in an Internet gambling business and follows either paragraph (b)(2)(i) or (b)(2)(ii) of this section.
                    (i) The participant determines that the commercial customer presents a minimal risk of engaging in an Internet gambling business.
                    (ii) The participant cannot determine that the commercial customer presents a minimal risk of engaging in an Internet gambling business, in which case it obtains the documentation in either paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) or (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section—
                    (A) Certification from the commercial customer that it does not engage in an Internet gambling business; or
                    (B) If the commercial customer does engage in an Internet gambling business, each of the following—
                    (1) Evidence of legal authority to engage in the Internet gambling business, such as—
                    (i) A copy of the commercial customer's license that expressly authorizes the customer to engage in the Internet gambling business issued by the appropriate State or Tribal authority or, if the commercial customer does not have such a license, a reasoned legal opinion that demonstrates that the commercial customer's Internet gambling business does not involve restricted transactions; and
                    (ii) A written commitment by the commercial customer to notify the participant of any changes in its legal authority to engage in its Internet gambling business.
                    (2) A third-party certification that the commercial customer's systems for engaging in the Internet gambling business are reasonably designed to ensure that the commercial customer's Internet gambling business will remain within the licensed or otherwise lawful limits, including with respect to age and location verification.
                    (3) The participant notifies all of its commercial customers, through provisions in the account or commercial customer relationship agreement or otherwise, that restricted transactions are prohibited from being processed through the account or relationship.
                    (4) With respect to the determination in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, participants may deem the following commercial customers to present a minimal risk of engaging in an Internet gambling business—
                    (i) An entity that is directly supervised by a Federal functional regulator as set out in § 132.7(a); or
                    (ii) An agency, department, or division of the Federal government or a State government.
                    (c) Automated clearing house system examples. (1) The policies and procedures of the originating depository financial institution and any third party processor in an ACH debit transaction, and the receiving depository financial institution and any third party processor in an ACH credit transaction, are deemed to be reasonably designed to identify and block or otherwise prevent or prohibit restricted transactions if they—
                    (i) Address methods to conduct due diligence in establishing a commercial customer account or relationship as set out in § 132.6(b);

                    (ii) Address methods to conduct due diligence as set out in § 132.6(b)(2)(ii)(B) in the event that the participant has actual knowledge that an existing commercial customer of the participant engages in an Internet gambling business; and
                    
                    (iii) Include procedures to be followed with respect to a commercial customer if the originating depository financial institution or third-party processor has actual knowledge that its commercial customer has originated restricted transactions as ACH debit transactions or if the receiving depository financial institution or third-party processor has actual knowledge that its commercial customer has received restricted transactions as ACH credit transactions, such as procedures that address—
                    (A) The circumstances under which the commercial customer should not be allowed to originate ACH debit transactions or receive ACH credit transactions; and
                    (B) The circumstances under which the account should be closed.
                    (2) The policies and procedures of a receiving gateway operator and third-party processor that receives instructions to originate an ACH debit transaction directly from a foreign sender are deemed to be reasonably designed to prevent or prohibit restricted transactions if they include procedures to be followed with respect to a foreign sender if the receiving gateway operator or third-party processor has actual knowledge, obtained through notification by a government entity, such as law enforcement or a regulatory agency, that such instructions included instructions for restricted transactions. Such procedures may address sending notification to the foreign sender, such as in the form of the notice contained in appendix A to this part.
                    (d) Card system examples. The policies and procedures of a card system operator, a merchant acquirer, third-party processor, or a card issuer, are deemed to be reasonably designed to identify and block or otherwise prevent or prohibit restricted transactions, if the policies and procedures—
                    (1) Provide for either—
                    (i) Methods to conduct due diligence—
                    (A) In establishing a commercial customer account or relationship as set out in § 132.6(b); and
                    (B) As set out in § 132.6(b)(2)(ii)(B) in the event that the participant has actual knowledge that an existing commercial customer of the participant engages in an Internet gambling business; or
                    (ii) Implementation of a code system, such as transaction codes and merchant/business category codes, that are required to accompany the authorization request for a transaction, including—
                    (A) The operational functionality to enable the card system operator or the card issuer to reasonably identify and deny authorization for a transaction that the coding procedure indicates may be a restricted transaction; and
                    (B) Procedures for ongoing monitoring or testing by the card system operator to detect potential restricted transactions, including—
                    (1) Conducting testing to ascertain whether transaction authorization requests are coded correctly; and
                    (2) Monitoring and analyzing payment patterns to detect suspicious payment volumes from a merchant customer; and
                    (2) For the card system operator, merchant acquirer, or third-party processor, include procedures to be followed when the participant has actual knowledge that a merchant has received restricted transactions through the card system, such as—
                    (i) The circumstances under which the access to the card system for the merchant, merchant acquirer, or third-party processor should be denied; and
                    (ii) The circumstances under which the merchant account should be closed.
                    (e) Check collection system examples. (1) The policies and procedures of a depositary bank are deemed to be reasonably designed to identify and block or otherwise prevent or prohibit restricted transactions, if they—

                    (ii) Address methods for the depositary bank to conduct due diligence as set out in § 132.6(b)(2)(ii)(B) in the event that the depositary bank has actual knowledge that an existing commercial customer engages in an Internet gambling business; and

                    (iii) Include procedures to be followed if the depositary bank has actual knowledge that a commercial customer of the depositary bank has deposited checks that are restricted transactions, such as procedures that address—
                    (A) The circumstances under which check collection services for the customer should be denied; and
                    (B) The circumstances under which the account should be closed.
                    (2) The policies and procedures of a depositary bank that receives checks for collection from a foreign banking office are deemed to be reasonably designed to identify and block or otherwise prevent or prohibit restricted transactions if they include procedures to be followed by the depositary bank when it has actual knowledge, obtained through notification by a government entity, such as law enforcement or a regulatory agency, that a foreign banking office has sent checks to the depositary bank that are restricted transactions. Such procedures may address sending notification to the foreign banking office, such as in the form of the notice contained in the appendix to this part.
                    (f) Money transmitting business examples. The policies and procedures of an operator of a money transmitting business are deemed to be reasonably designed to identify and block or otherwise prevent or prohibit restricted transactions if they—

                    On [date], U.S. government officials informed us that your institution processed payments through our facilities for Internet gambling transactions restricted by U.S. law on [dates, recipients, and other relevant information if available].
                    We provide this notice to comply with U.S. Government regulations implementing the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 (Act), a U.S. federal law. Our policies and procedures established in accordance with those regulations provide that we will notify a foreign counterparty if we learn that the counterparty has processed payments through our facilities for Internet gambling transactions restricted by the Act. This notice ensures that you are aware that we have received information that your institution has processed payments for Internet gambling restricted by the Act.

                    The Act is codified in subchapter IV, chapter 53, title 31 of the U.S. Code (31 U.S.C. 5361 et seq.). Implementing regulations that duplicate one another can be found at part 233 of title 12 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (12 CFR part 233) and part 132 of title 31 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (31 CFR part 132).

                    (b) Purpose. The purpose of this part is to issue implementing regulations as required by the Act. The part governs the calculation of the maximum obligation limitation which limits the aggregate amount of outstanding obligations the FDIC may issue or incur in connection with the orderly liquidation of a covered financial company.
                  
                  
                    § 149.2

The term “fair value” means the expected total aggregate value of each asset, or group of assets that are managed within a portfolio of a covered financial company on a consolidated basis if such asset, or group of assets, was sold or otherwise disposed of in an orderly transaction.
                    
                      Most recent financial statement available. (1) The term “most recent financial statement available” means a covered financial company's—
                    (i) Most recent financial statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission or any other regulatory body;
                    (ii) Most recent financial statement audited by an independent CPA firm; or

                    (2) The FDIC and the Treasury will jointly determine the most pertinent of the above financial statements, taking into consideration the timeliness and reliability of the statements being considered.
                    
                      Obligation. The term “obligation” means, with respect to any covered financial company—
                    (1) Any guarantee issued by the FDIC on behalf of the covered financial company;
                    (2) Any amount borrowed pursuant to section 210(n)(5)(A) of the Act; and
                    (3) Any other obligation with respect to the covered financial company for which the FDIC has a direct or contingent liability to pay any amount.
                    
                      Total consolidated assets of each covered financial company that are available for repayment. The term “total consolidated assets of each covered financial company that are available for repayment” means the difference between:
                    
                    (1) The total assets of the covered financial company on a consolidated basis that are available for liquidation during the operation of the receivership; and
                    (2) To the extent included in paragraph (1) of this definition, all assets that are separated from, or made unavailable to, the covered financial company by a statutory or regulatory barrier that prevents the covered financial company from possessing or selling assets and using the proceeds from the sale of such assets.
                  
                  
                    § 149.3
                    Maximum obligation limitation.
                    The FDIC shall not, in connection with the orderly liquidation of a covered financial company, issue or incur any obligation, if, after issuing or incurring the obligation, the aggregate amount of such obligations outstanding for each covered financial company would exceed—
                    (a) An amount that is equal to 10 percent of the total consolidated assets of the covered financial company, based on the most recent financial statement available, during the 30-day period immediately following the date of appointment of the FDIC as receiver (or a shorter time period if the FDIC has calculated the amount described under paragraph (b) of this section); and
                    (b) The amount that is equal to 90 percent of the fair value of the total consolidated assets of each covered financial company that are available for repayment, after the time period described in paragraph (a) of this section.

                    (b) The Department will apply the following principles in determining whether a company is an assessed company:
                    (1) For tiered bank holding companies for which a holding company owns or controls, or is owned or controlled by, other holding companies, the assessed company shall be the top-tier, regulated holding company.

                    (4) In situations where a company does not report total consolidated assets in its public reports or where a company uses a financial reporting methodology other than U.S. GAAP to report on its U.S. operations, the Department will use, at its discretion, any comparable financial information that the Department may require from the company for this determination.
                    (c) Any company that the Department determines is an assessed company on a given determination date will be an assessed company for the entire assessment period related to such determination date, and will be subject to the full assessment fee for that assessment period, regardless of any changes in the company's assets or other attributes that occur after the determination date.
                  
                  
                    § 150.4
                    Calculation of assessment basis.
                    (a) For the initial assessment period, the Department will calculate the assessment basis such that it is equivalent to the sum of:
                    (1) Budgeted operating expenses for the Office for the period beginning July 21, 2012 and ending March 31, 2013;
                    (2) Budgeted operating expenses for the Council for the period beginning July 21, 2012 and ending March 31, 2013;

                    (4) Capital expenses for the Council for the period beginning July 21, 2012 and ending April 30, 2013; and
                    (5) An amount necessary to reimburse reasonable implementation expenses of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as provided under section 210(n)(10) of the Dodd-Frank Act.
                    (b) For each subsequent assessment period, the Department will calculate an assessment basis that shall be sufficient to replenish the Financial Research Fund to a level equivalent to the sum of:
                    (1) Budgeted operating expenses for the Office for the applicable assessment period;
                    (2) Budgeted operating expenses for the Council for the applicable assessment period;
                    (3) Budgeted capital expenses for the Office for the 12-month period beginning on the first day of the applicable assessment period;
                    (4) Budgeted capital expenses for the Council for the 12-month period beginning on the first day of the applicable assessment period; and
                    (5) An amount necessary to reimburse reasonable implementation expenses of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as provided under section 210(n)(10) of the Dodd-Frank Act.
                  
                  
                    § 150.5

                    (a) For each assessed company, the Department will calculate the total assessable assets in accordance with the definition in § 150.2.
                    (b) The Department will allocate the assessment basis to the assessed companies in the following manner:
                    (1) Based on the sum of all assessed companies' total assessable assets, the Department will calculate the assessment fee rate necessary to collect the assessment basis for the applicable assessment period.
                    (2) The assessment payable by an assessed company for each assessment period shall be equal to the assessment fee rate for that assessment period multiplied by the total assessable assets of such assessed company.
                    (3) Foreign banking organizations with less than $50 billion in total assessable assets shall not be assessed.
                  
                  
                    § 150.6
                    Notice and payment of assessments.
                    (a) No later than fifteen calendar days after the determination date (or, in the case of the initial assessment period, no later than seven days after the publication date of this rule), the Department will send to each assessed company a statement that:

                    (1) Confirms that such company has been determined by the Department to be an assessed company; and
                    
                    (2) States the total assessable assets that the Department has determined will be used for calculating the company's assessment.
                    (b) If a company that is required to make an assessment payment for a given semiannual assessment period believes that the statement referred to in paragraph (a) of this section contains an error, the company may provide the Department with a written request for a revised statement. Such request must be received by the Department via email within one month and must include all facts that the company requests the Department to consider. The Department will respond to all such requests within 21 calendar days of receipt thereof.
                    (c) No later than the 14 calendar days prior to the payment date for a given assessment period, the Department will send an electronic billing notification to each assessed company, containing the final assessment that is required to be paid by such assessed company.

                    (d) For the purpose of making the payments described in § 150.5, each assessed company shall designate a deposit account for direct debit by the Department through www.pay.gov or successor Web site. No later than the later of 30 days prior to the payment date for an assessment period, or the effective date of this rule, each such company shall provide notice to the Department of the account designated, including all information and authorizations required by the Department for direct debit of the account. After the initial notice of the designated account, no further notice is required unless the company designates a different account for assessment debit by the Department, in which case the requirements of the preceding sentence apply.
                    (e) Each assessed company shall take all actions necessary to allow the Department to debit assessments from such company's designated deposit account. Each such company shall, prior to each assessment payment date, ensure that funds in an amount at least equal to the amount on the relevant electronic billing notification are available in the designated deposit account for debit by the Department. Failure to take any such action or to provide such funding of the account shall be deemed to constitute nonpayment of the assessment. The Department will cause the amount stated in the applicable electronic billing notification to be directly debited on the appropriate payment date from the deposit account so designated.
                    (f) In the event that, for a given assessment period, an assessed company materially misstates or misrepresents any information that is used by the Department in calculating that company's total assessable assets, the Department may at any time re-calculate the assessment payable by that company for that assessment period, and the assessed company shall take all actions necessary to allow the Department to immediately debit any additional payable amounts from such assessed company's designated deposit account.
                    (g) If a due date under this section falls on a date that is not a business day, the applicable date shall be the next business day.
