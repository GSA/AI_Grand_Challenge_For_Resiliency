      Explanation
      The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
      Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
      
        Title 1 through Title 16 
        as of January 1
        Title 17 through Title 27 
        as of April 1
        Title 28 through Title 41 
        as of July 1
        Title 42 through Title 50 
        as of October 1
      
      The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.
      
        LEGAL STATUS
        The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).
      
      
        HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
        The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
        To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, October 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.
      
      
        EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
        Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.
      
      
        OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

        The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.
      
      
        PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
        Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.
      
      
        “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
        The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.
      
      
        INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
        
          What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
        
          What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
        (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
        (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
        (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
        
          What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.
      
      
        CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

        A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.

        An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
        
        The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
        A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.
      
      
        REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
        There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

              (a) The thorax consists of the assembly shown as number SA 150 M030 in Figure 1, and conforms to each of the drawings subtended by number SA 150 M030.
              (b) The thorax contains enough unobstructed interior space behind the rib cage to permit the midpoint of the sternum to be depressed 2 inches without contact between the rib cage and other parts of the dummy or its instrumentation, except for instruments specified in paragraph (d)(7) of this section.
              (c) When impacted by a test probe conforming to § 572.11(a) at 14 fps and at 22 fps in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, the thorax shall resist with forces measured by the test probe of not more than 1450 pounds and 2250 pounds, respectively, and shall deflect by amounts not greater than 1.1 inches and 1.7 inches, respectively. The internal hysteresis in each impact shall not be less than 50 percent and not more than 70 percent.
              (d) Test procedure: (1) With the dummy seated without back support on a surface as specified in § 572.11(i) and in the orientation specified in § 572.11(i), adjust the dummy arms and legs until they are extended horizontally forward parallel to the midsagittal plane.
              (2) Place the longitudinal center line of the test probe so that it is 17.7 ±0.1 inches above the seating surface at impact.
              (3) Align the test probe specified in § 572.11(a) so that at impact its longitudinal centerline coincides within 2 degrees of a horizontal line in the dummy's midsagittal plane.
              (4) Adjust the dummy so that the surface area on the thorax immediately adjacent to the projected longitudinal center line of the test probe is vertical. Limb support, as needed to achieve and maintain this orientation, may be provided by placement of a steel rod of any diameter not less than one-quarter of an inch and not more than three-eighths of an inch, with hemispherical ends, vertically under the limb at its projected geometric center.
              (5) Impact the thorax with the test probe so that its longitudinal centerline falls within 2 degrees of a horizontal line in the dummy's midsagittal plane at the moment of impact.
              (6) Guide the probe during impact so that it moves with no significant lateral, vertical, or rotational movement.
              (7) Measure the horizontal deflection of the sternum relative to the thoracic spine along the line established by the longitudinal centerline of the probe at the moment of impact, using a potentiometer mounted inside the sternum.
              (8) Measure hysteresis by determining the ratio of the area between the loading and unloading portions of the force deflection curve to the area under the loading portion of the curve.

              (3) Flex the thorax forward 50° and then rearward as necessary to return it to its initial position in accordance with Figure 11 unsupported by external means.
              (4) Apply a forward force perpendicular to the thorax instrument cavity rear face in the midsagittal plane 15 inches above the top surface of the pelvic-lumbar adapter. Apply the force at any torso deflection rate between .5 and 1.5 degrees per second up to 40° of flexion but no further, continue to apply for 10 seconds that force necessary to maintain 40° of flexion, and record the force with an instrument mounted to the thorax as shown in Figure 5. Release all force as rapidly as possible and measure the return angle 3 minutes after the release.
              (d) When the abdomen is subjected to continuously applied force in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, the abdominal force-deflection curve shall be within the two curves plotted in Figure 10.
              (e) Test procedure: (1) Place the assembled thorax, lumbar spine and pelvic assemblies in a supine position on a flat, rigid, smooth, dry, clean horizontal surface, ensuring that all component surfaces are clean, dry, and untreated unless otherwise specified.
              (2) Place a rigid cylinder 6 inches in diameter and 18 inches long transversely across the abdomen, so that the cylinder is symmetrical about the midsagittal plane, with its longitudinal centerline horizontal and perpendicular to the midsagittal plane at a point 9.2 inches above the bottom line of the buttocks, measured with the dummy positioned in accordance with Figure 11.
              (3) Establish the zero deflection point as the point at which a force of 10 pounds has been reached.
              (4) Apply a vertical downward force through the cylinder at any rate between 0.25 and 0.35 inches per second.
              (5) Guide the cylinder so that it moves without significant lateral or rotational movement.

              § 572.11
              Test conditions and instrumentation.
              (a) The test probe used for thoracic and knee impact tests is a cylinder 6 inches in diameter that weighs 51.5 pounds including instrumentation. Its impacting end has a flat right face that is rigid and that has an edge radius of 0.5 inches.
              (b) Accelerometers are mounted in the head on the horizontal transverse bulkhead shown in the drawings subreferenced under assembly No. SA 150 M010 in Figure 1, so that their sensitive axes intersect at a point in the midsagittal plane 0.5 inches above the horizontal bulkhead and 1.9 inches ventral of the vertical mating surface of the skull with the skull cover. One accelerometer is aligned with its sensitive axis perpendicular to the horizontal bulkhead in the midsagittal plane and with its seismic mass center at any distance up to 0.3 inches superior to the axial intersection point. Another accelerometer is aligned with its sensitive axis parallel to the horizontal bulkhead and perpendicular to the midsagittal plane, and with its seismic mass center at any distance up to 1.3 inches to the left of the axial intersection point (left side of dummy is the same as that of man). A third accelerometer is aligned with its sensitive axis parallel to the horizontal bulkhead in the midsagittal plane, and with its seismic mass center at any distance up to 1.3 inches dorsal to the axial intersection point.
              (c) Accelerometers are mounted in the thorax by means of a bracket attached to the rear vertical surface (hereafter “attachment surface”) of the thoracic spine so that their sensitive axes intersect at a point in the midsagittal plane 0.8 inches below the upper surface of the plate to which the neck mounting bracket is attached and 3.2 inches perpendicularly forward of the surface to which the accelerometer bracket is attached. One accelerometer has its sensitive axis oriented parallel to the attachment surface in the midsagittal plane, with its seismic mass center at any distance up to 1.3 inches inferior to the intersection of the sensitive axes specified above. Another accelerometer has its sensitive axis oriented parallel to the attachment surface and perpendicular to the midsagittal plane, with its seismic mass center at any distance up to 0.2 inches to the right of the intersection of the sensitive axes specified above. A third accelerometer has its sensitive axis oriented perpendicular to the attachment surface in the midsagittal plane, with its seismic mass center at any distance up to 1.3 inches dorsal to the intersection of the sensitive axes specified above. Accelerometers are oriented with the dummy in the position specified in § 572.11(i).
              (d) A force-sensing device is mounted axially in each femur shaft so that the transverse centerline of the sensing element is 4.25 inches from the knee's center of rotation.
              (e) The outputs of acceleration and force-sensing devices installed in the dummy and in the test apparatus specified by this part are recorded in individual data channels that conform to the requirements of SAE Recommended Practice J211a, December 1971, with channel classes as follows:
              (1) Head acceleration—Class 1000.

              (5) Impact the thorax with the test probe so that at the moment of impact the probe's longitudinal centerline falls within 2 degrees of a horizontal line in the dummy midsagittal plane.
              (6) Guide the probe during impact so that it moves with no significant lateral, vertical or rotational movement.
              (7) Allow a time period of at least 20 minutes between successive tests of the chest.
            
            
              § 572.19
              Lumbar spine, abdomen and pelvis.
              (a) The lumbar spine, abdomen, and pelvis consist of the part of the torso assembly shown by number SA 103C 030 on drawing SA 103C 001 and conform to each of the applicable drawings listed under this number on drawing SA 103C 002, sheets 10 and 11.
              (b) When subjected to continuously applied force in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, the lumbar spine assembly shall flex by an amount that permits the rigid thoracic spine to rotate from its initial position in accordance with Figure 18 of this subpart by 40 degrees at a force level of not less than 34 pounds and not more than 47 pounds, and straighten upon removal of the force to within 5 degrees of its initial position.
              (c) Test procedure. (1) The dummy with lower legs removed is positioned in an upright seated position on a seat as indicated in Figure 18, ensuring that all dummy component surfaces are clean, dry and untreated unless otherwise specified.

              (2) Attach the pelvis to the seating surface by a bolt C/328, modified as shown in Figure 18, and the upper legs at the knee axial rotation joints by the attachments shown in Figure 18. Tighten the mountings so that the pelvis-lumbar joining surface is horizontal and adjust the femur ball-flange screws at each hip socket joint to 50 inch pounds torque. Remove the head and the neck and install a cylindrical aluminum adapter 2.0 inches in diameter and 2.80 inches long in place of the neck.
              (3) Flex the thorax forward 50 degrees and then rearward as necessary to return to its initial position in accordance with Figure 18 unsupported by external means.
              (4) Apply a forward pull force in the midsagittal plane at the top of the neck adapter, so that at 40 degrees of the lumbar spine flexion the applied force is perpendicular to the thoracic spine box. Apply the force at any torso deflection rate between 0.5 and 1.5 degrees per second up to 40 degrees of flexion but no further; continue to apply for 10 seconds the force necessary to maintain 40 degrees of flexion, and record the highest applied force at that time. Release all force as rapidly as possible and measure the return angle 3 minutes after the release.

              (a) The limbs consist of the following assemblies: leg assemblies 86-5001-001, revision A and -002, revision A, and arm assemblies 78051-123, revision D and -124, revision D, and shall conform to the drawings subtended therein.
              (b) Femur impact response. (1) When each knee of the leg assemblies is impacted in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section, at 6.9 ft/sec ±0.10 ft/sec by the pendulum defined in § 572.36(b), the peak knee impact force, which is a product of pendulum mass and acceleration, shall have a minimum value of not less than 1060 pounds and a maximum value of not more than 1300 pounds.
              (2) Test procedure. (i) The test material consists of leg assemblies (86-5001-001, revision A) left and (-002, revision A) right with upper leg assemblies (78051-46) left and (78051-47) right removed. The load cell simulator (78051-319, revision A) is used to secure the knee cap assemblies (79051-16, revision B) as shown in Figure 24.
              (ii) Soak the test material in a test environment at any temperature between 66 degrees F to 78 degrees F and at a relative humidity from 10% to 70% for a period of at least four hours prior to its application in a test.
              (iii) Mount the test material with the leg assembly secured through the load cell simulator to a rigid surface as shown in Figure 24. No contact is permitted between the foot and any other exterior surfaces.
              (iv) Place the longitudinal centerline of the test probe so that at contact with the knee it is collinear within 2 degrees with the longitudinal centerline of the femur load cell simulator.
              (v) Guide the pendulum so that there is no significant lateral, vertical or rotational movement at time zero.
              (vi) Impact the knee with the test probe so that the longitudinal centerline of the test probe at the instant of impact falls within .5 degrees of a horizontal line parallel to the femur load cell simulator at time zero.
              (vii) Time zero is defined as the time of contact between the test probe and the knee.
              (c) Hip joint-femur flexion. (1) When each femur is rotated in the flexion direction in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the femur torque at 30 deg. rotation from its initial horizontal orientation will not be more than 70 ft-lbf, and at 150 ft-lbf of torque will not be less than 40 deg. or more than 50 deg.
              (2) Test procedure. (i) The test material consists of the assembled dummy, part No. 78051-218 (revision S) except that (1) leg assemblies (86-5001-001 and 002) are separated from the dummy by removing the 3/8-16 Socket Head Cap Screw (SHCS) (78051-99) but retaining the structural assembly of the upper legs (78051-43 and -44), (2) the abdominal insert (78051-52) is removed and (3) the instrument cover plate (78051-13) in the pelvic bone is replaced by a rigid pelvic bone stabilizer insert (Figure 25a) and firmly secured.

              (ii) Seat the dummy on a rigid seat fixture (Figure 25) and firmly secure it to the seat back by bolting the stabilizer insert and the rigid support device (Figure 25b) to the seat back of the test fixture (Figures 26 and 27) while maintaining the pelvis (78051-58) “B” plane horizontal.
              (iii) Insert a lever arm into the femur shaft opening of the upper leg structure assembly (78051-43/44) and firmly secure it using the 3/8-16 socket head cap screws.
              (iv) Lift the lever arm parallel to the midsagittal plane at a rotation rate of 5 to 10 deg. per second while maintaining the 1/2 in. shoulder bolt longitudinal centerline horizontal throughout the range of motion until the 150 ft-lbf torque level is reached. Record the torque and angle of rotation of the femur.
              (v) Operating environment and temperature are the same as specified in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.

              § 572.44
              Instrumentation and test conditions.
              (a) The test probe used for lateral thoracic and pelvis impact tests is a 6 inch diameter cylinder that weighs 51.5 pounds including instrumentation. Its impacting end has a flat right angle face that is rigid and has an edge radius of 0.5 inches.

              (b) Three accelerometers are mounted in the thorax for measurement of lateral accelerations with each accelerometer's sensitive axis aligned to be closely perpendicular to the thorax's midsagittal plane. The accelerometers are mounted in the following locations:
              (1) One accelerometer is mounted on the thorax to lumbar adaptor (SID-005 revision F, dated May 18, 1994, incorporated by reference; see § 572.40) with seismic mass center located 0.5 inches toward the impact side, 0.1 inches upward and 1.86 inches rearward from the reference point shown in Figure 30 in appendix A to subpart F of part 572. Maximum permissible variation of the seismic location must not exceed 0.2 inches spherical radius.
              (2) Two accelerometers are mounted, one on the top and the other at the bottom part of the Rib Bar (SID-024) on the struck side. Their seismic mass centers are at any distance up to .4 inches from a point on the Rib Bar surface located on its longitudinal center line .75 inches from the top for the top accelerometer and .75 inches from the bottom, for the bottom accelerometer.
              (c) One accelerometer is mounted in the pelvis for measurement of the lateral acceleration with its sensitive axis perpendicular to the pelvic midsagittal plane. The accelerometer is mounted on the rear wall of the instrumentation cavity of the pelvis (SID-087 revision H, dated May 18, 1994, incorporated by reference; see § 572.40). The accelerometer's seismic mass with respect to the mounting bolt center line is 0.9 inches up, 0.7 inches to the left for left side impact and 0.03 inches to the left for right side impact, and 0.5 inches rearward from the rear wall mounting surface as shown in Figure 31 in appendix A to subpart F of part 572. Maximum permissible variation of the seismic location must not exceed 0.2 inches spherical radius.
              (d) Instrumentation and sensors used must conform to the SAE J-211 (1980) recommended practice requirements (incorporated by reference; see § 572.40). The outputs of the accelerometers installed in the dummy are then processed with the software for the Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter (FIR 100 software). The FORTRAN program for this FIR 100 software (FIR100 Filter Program, Version 1.0, July 16, 1990) is incorporated by reference in this part (see § 572.40). The data are processed in the following manner:
              (1) Analog data recorded in accordance with SAE J-211 (1980) recommended practice channel class 1000 specification.
              (2) Filter the data with a 300 Hz, SAE Class 180 filter;
              (3) Subsample the data to a 1600 Hz sampling rate;
              (4) Remove the bias from the subsampled data, and
              (5) Filter the data with the FIR100 Filter Program (Version 1.0, July 16, 1990), which has the following characteristics—
              (i) Passband frequency, 100 Hz.
              (ii) Stopband frequency, 189 Hz.
              (iii) Stopband gain, −50 db.
              (iv) Passband ripple, 0.0225 db.
              (e) The mountings for the spine, rib and pelvis accelerometers shall have no resonance frequency within a range of 3 times the frequency range of the applicable channel class.
              (f) Limb joints of the test dummy are set at the force between 1-2 g's, which just supports the limbs' weight when the limbs are extended horizontally forward. The force required to move a limb segment does not exceed 2 g's throughout the range of limb motion.
              (g) Performance tests are conducted at any temperature from 66 °F to 78 °F and at any relative humidity from 10 percent to 70 percent after exposure of the dummy to these conditions for a period of not less than 4 hours.
              (h) For the performance of tests specified in §§ 572.42 and 572.43, the dummy is positioned as follows:
              (1) The dummy is placed on a flat, rigid, clean, dry, horizontal smooth aluminum surface whose length and width dimensions are not less than 16 inches, so that the dummy's midsagittal plane is vertical and centered on the test surface. The dummy's torso is positioned to meet the requirements of § 572.42 and § 572.43. The seating surface is without the back support and the test dummy is positioned so that the dummy's midsagittal plane is vertical and centered on the seat surface.

              (2) The legs are positioned so that their centerlines are in planes parallel to the midsagittal plane.

              (b) Head assembly impact response requirements. When the head is impacted by a test probe conforming to § 572.77(a)(1) at 7 feet per second (fps) according to the test procedure in paragraph (c) of this section, then the resultant head acceleration measured at the location of the accelerometer installed in the headform according to § 577.77(b) is not less than 130g and not more than 160g.
              (1) The recorded acceleration-time curve for this test is unimodal at or above the 50g level, and lies at or above that level for an interval not less than 1.0 and not more than 2.0 milliseconds.
              (2) The lateral acceleration vector does not exceed 5g.
              (c) Head test procedure. The test procedure for the head is as follows:
              (1) Seat and orient the dummy on a seating surface having a back support as specified in § 572.78(c), and adjust the joints of the limbs at any setting (between 1g and 2g) which just supports the limbs' weight when the limbs are extended horizontally and forward.
              (2) Adjust the test probe so that its longitudinal center line is—
              (i) At the forehead at the point of orthogonal intersection of the head midsagittal plane and the transverse plane which is perpendicular to the Z axis of the head as shown in Figure 40;
              (ii) Located 2.7 ±0.1 inches below the top of the head measured along the Z axis, and;
              (iii) Coincides within 2 degrees with the line made by the intersection of the horizontal and midsagittal planes passing through this point.
              (3) Impact the head with the test probe so that at the moment of contact the probe's longitudinal center line falls within 2 degrees of a horizontal line in the dummy's midsagittal plane.
              (4) Guide the test probe during impact so that there is no significant lateral, vertical, or rotational movement.
              (5) Allow at least 60 minutes between successive head tests.

              (b) Neck assembly impact response requirements. When the head-neck assembly (SA 106C 010 and SA 106C 020) is tested according to the test procedure in § 572.73(c), the head:
              (1) Shall rotate, while translating in the direction of the pendulum preimpact flight, in reference to the pendulum's longitudinal center line a total of 78 degrees ±6 degrees about the head's center of gravity; and
              (2) Shall rotate to the extent specified in Table B at each indicated point in time, measured from time of impact, with the chordal displacement measured at the head's center of gravity.
              (i) Chordal displacement at time “T” is defined as the straight line distance between the position relative to the pendulum arm of the head's center of gravity at time “zero;” and the position relative to the pendulum arm of the head's center of gravity at time T as illustrated by Figure 3 in § 572.11.
              (ii) The peak resultant acceleration recorded at the location of the accelerometers mounted in the headform according to § 572.77(b) shall not exceed 30g.

              (c) Neck test procedure. The test procedure for the neck is as follows:

              (1) Mount the head and neck assembly on a rigid pendulum as specified in § 572.21, Figure 15, so that the head's midsagittal plane is vertical and coincides with the plane of motion of the pendulum's longitudinal center line. Attach the neck directly to the pendulum as shown in § 572.21, Figure 15.
              
              (2) Release the pendulum and allow it to fall freely from a height such that the velocity at impact is 17.00 ±1.0 fps, measured at the center of the accelerometer specified in § 572.21, Figure 15.
              (3) Decelerate the pendulum to a stop with an acceleration-time pulse described as follows:
              (i) Establish 5g and 20g levels on the a-t curve.
              (ii) Establish t1 at the point where the rising a-t curve first crosses the 5g level; t2 at the point where the rising a-t curve first crosses the 20g level; t3 at the point where the decaying a-t curve last crosses the 20g level; and t4 at the point where the decaying a-t curve first crosses the 5g level.
              (iii) t2−t1 shall not be more than 3 milliseconds.
              (iv) t3−t2 shall not be more than 22 milliseconds, and not less than 19 milliseconds.

              (b) Lumbar spine, abdomen, and pelvis assembly response requirements. When the lumbar spine is subjected to a force continuously applied according to the test procedure set out in paragraph (c) of this section, the lumbar spine assembly shall—
              (1) Flex by an amount that permits the rigid thoracic spine to rotate from the torso's initial position, as defined in (c)(3), by 40 degrees at a force level of not less that 46 pounds and not more than 52 pounds, and
              (2) Straighten upon removal of the force to within 5 degrees of its initial position when the force is removed.
              (c) Lumbar spine, abdomen, and pelvis test procedure. The test procedure for the lumbar spine, abdomen, and pelvis is as follows:
              (1) Remove the dummy's head-neck assembly, arms, and lower legs, clean and dry all component surfaces, and seat the dummy upright on a seat as specified in Figure 42.
              (2) Adjust the dummy by—
              (i) Tightening the femur ballflange screws at each hip socket joint to 50 inch-pounds torque;
              (ii) Attaching the pelvis to the seating surface by a bolt D/605 as shown in Figure 42.
              (iii) Attaching the upper legs at the knee joints by the attachments shown in drawing Figure 42.
              (iv) Tightening the mountings so that the pelvis-lumbar joining surface is horizontal; and
              (v) Removing the head and neck, and installing a cylindrical aluminum adapter (neck adapter) of 2.0 inches diameter and 2.60 inches length as shown in Figure 42.
              (3) The initial position of the dummy's torso is defined by the plane formed by the rear surfaces of the shoulders and buttocks which is three to seven degrees forward of the transverse vertical plane.
              (4) Flex the thorax forward 50 degrees and then rearward as necessary to return the dummy to its initial torso position, unsupported by external means.
              (5) Apply a forward pull force in the midsagittal plane at the top of the neck adapter so that when the lumbar spine flexion is 40 degrees, the applied force is perpendicular to the thoracic spine box.
              (i) Apply the force at any torso deflection rate between 0.5 and 1.5 degrees per second, up to 40 degrees of flexion.
              (ii) For 10 seconds, continue to apply a force sufficient to maintain 40 degrees of flexion, and record the highest applied force during the 10 second period.

              § 572.76
              Limbs assembly and test procedure.
              (a) Limbs assembly. The limbs consist of the assemblies designated as SA 106C 041, SA 106C 042, SA 106C 071, and SA 106C 072, on drawing No. SA 106C 001, sheet 2, and conform to each applicable drawing listed on SA 106C 001, sheets 14 through 17.
              (b) Limbs assembly impact response requirement. When each knee is impacted at 7.0 ±0.1 fps, according to paragraph (c) of this section, the maximum force on the femur shall not be more than 1060 pounds and not less than 780 pounds, with a duration above 400 pounds of not less than 0.8 milliseconds.
              (c) Limbs test procedure. The test procedure for the limbs is as follows:
              (1) Seat and orient the dummy without back support on a seating surface that is 11 ±0.2 inches above a horizontal (floor) surface as specified in § 572.78(c).
              (i) Orient the dummy as specified in Figure 43 with the hip joint adjustment at any setting between 1g and 2g.
              (ii) Place the dummy legs in a plane parallel to the dummy's midsagittal plane with the knee pivot center line perpendicular to the dummy's midsagittal plane, and with the feet flat on the horizontal (floor) surface.

              (iii) Adjust the feet and lower legs until the line between the midpoint of each knee pivot and each ankle pivot is within 2 degrees of the vertical.
              (2) If necessary, reposition the dummy so that at the level one inch below the seating surface, the rearmost point of the dummy's lower legs remains not less than 3 inches and not more than 6 inches forward of the forward edge of the seat.
              (3) Align the test probe specified in § 572.77(a) with the longitudinal center line of the femur force gauge, so that at impact, the probe's longitudinal center line coincides with the sensor's longitudinal center line within ±2 degrees.
              (4) Impact the knee with the test probe moving horizontally and parallel to the midsagittal plane at the specified velocity.
              (5) Guide the test probe during impact so that there is no significant lateral, vertical, or rotational movement.
            
            
              § 572.77
              Instrumentation.
              (a)(1) Test probe. For the head, thorax, and knee impact test, use a test probe that is rigid, of uniform density and weighs 10 pounds and 6 ounces, with a diameter of 3 inches; a length of 13.8 inches; and an impacting end that has a rigid flat right face and edge radius of 0.5 inches.
              (2) The head and thorax assembly may be instrumented either with a Type A or Type B accelerometer.
              (i) Type A accelerometer is defined in drawing SA 572 S1.
              (ii) Type B accelerometer is defined in drawing SA 572 S2.
              (b) Head accelerometers. (1) Install accelerometers in the head as shown in drawing SA 106C 001 sheet 1 using suitable spacers or adaptors as needed to affix them to the horizontal transverse bulkhead so that the sensitive axes of the three accelerometers intersect at the point in the midsagittal plane located 0.4 inches below the intersection of a line connecting the longitudinal center lines of the roll pins in either side of the dummy's head with the head's midsagittal plane.
              (2) The head has three orthogonally mounted accelerometers aligned as follows:
              (i) Align one accelerometer so that its sensitive axis is perpendicular to the horizontal bulkhead in the midsagittal plane.
              (ii) Align the second accelerometer so that its sensitive axis is parallel to the horizontal bulkhead, and perpendicular to the midsagittal plane.
              (iii) Align the third accelerometer so that its sensitive axis is parallel to the horizontal bulkhead in the midsagittal plane.
              (iv) The seismic mass center for any of these accelerometers may be at any distance up to 0.4 inches from the axial intersection point.
              (c) Thoracic accelerometers. (1) Install accelerometers in the thoracic assembly as shown in drawing SA 106C 001, sheet 1, using suitable spacers and adaptors to affix them to the frontal surface of the spine assembly so that the sensitive axes of the three accelerometers intersect at a point in the midsagittal plane located 0.95 inches posterior of the spine mounting surface, and 0.55 inches below the horizontal centerline of the two upper accelerometer mount attachment hole centers.
              (2) The sternum-thoracic assembly has three orthogonally mounted accelerometers aligned as follows:
              (i) Align one accelerometer so that its sensitive axis is parallel to the attachment surface in the midsagittal plane.
              (ii) Align the second accelerometer so that its sensitive axis is parallel to the attachment surface, and perpendicular to the midsagittal plane.
              (iii) Align the third accelerometer so that its sensitive axis is perpendicular to the attachment surface in the midsagittal plane.
              (iv) The seismic mass center for any of these accelerometers may be at any distance up to 0.4 inches of the axial intersection point.
              (d) Femur-sensing device. Install a force-sensing device SA 572-S10 axially in each femur shaft as shown in drawing SA 106C 072 and secure it to the femur assembly so that the distance measured between the center lines of two attachment bolts is 3.00 inches.
              (e) Limb joints. Set the limb joints at lg, barely restraining the limb's weight when the limb is extended horizontally, and ensure that the force required to move the limb segment does not exceed 2g throughout the limb's range of motion.
              
              (f) Recording outputs. Record the outputs of acceleration and force-sensing devices installed in the dummy and in the test apparatus specified in this part, in individual channels that conform to the requirements of SAE Recommended Practice J211, October 1988, with channel classes as set out in the following table C.

              General description.
              (a) The dummy consists of: (1) The assembly specified in drawing LP 1049/A, March 1979, which is described in its entirety by means of approximately 54 separate drawings and specifications, 1049/1 through 1049/54; and (2) a parts list LP 1049/0 (5 sheets); and (3) a report entitled, “The TNO P3/4 Child Dummy Users Manual,” January 1979, published by Instituut voor Wegtransportmiddelen TNO.
              (b) Adjacent dummy segments are joined in a manner such that throughout the range of motion and also under simulated crash-impact conditions there is no contact between metallic elements except for contacts that exist under static conditions.
              (c) The structural properties of the dummy are such that the dummy conforms to this part in every respect both before and after being used in dynamic tests such as that specified in Standard No. 213 of this chapter (§ 571.213).
            
            
              § 572.82
              Head.
              The head consists of the assembly shown in drawing LP 1049/A and conforms to each of the applicable drawings listed under LP 1049/0 through 54.
            
            
              § 572.83
              Head-neck.
              The head-neck assembly shown in drawing 1049/A consists of parts specified as items 1 through 16 and in item 56.
            
            
              § 572.84
              Thorax.
              The thorax consists of the part of the torso shown in assembly drawing LP 1049/A and conforms to each of the applicable drawings listed under LP 1049/0 through 54.
            
            
              § 572.85
              Lumbar spine flexure.
              (a) When subjected to continuously applied force in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, the lumbar spine assembly shall flex by an amount that permits the thoracic spine to rotate from its initial position in accordance with Figure No. 18 of § 572.21 (49 CFR part 572) by 40 degrees at a force level of not less than 18 pounds and not more than 22 pounds, and straighten upon removal of the force to within 5 degrees of its initial position.
              (b) Test procedure. (1) The lumbar spine flexure test is conducted on a dummy assembly as shown in drawing LP 1049/A, but with the arms (which consist of parts identified as items 17 through 30) and all head-neck parts (identified as items 1 through 13 and 59 through 63), removed.
              (2) With the torso assembled in an upright position, adjust the lumbar cable by tightening the adjustment nut for the lumbar vertebrae until the spring is compressed to 2/3 of its unloaded length.
              (3) Position the dummy in an upright seated position on a seat as indicated in Figure No. 18 of § 572.21 (lower legs do not need to be removed, but must be clamped firmly to the seating surface), ensuring that all dummy component surfaces are clean, dry and untreated unless otherwise specified.
              (4) Firmly affix the dummy to the seating surface through the pelvis at the hip joints by suitable clamps that also prevent any relative motion with respect to the upper legs during the test in § 572.65(c)(3) of this part. Install a pull attachment at the neck to torso juncture as shown in Figure 18 of § 572.21.
              (5) Flex the thorax forward 50 degrees and then rearward as necessary to return it to its initial position.

              (6) Apply a forward pull force in the midsagittal plane at the top of the neck adapter so that at 40 degrees of the lumbar spine flexion the applied force is perpendicular to the thoracic spine box. Apply the force at any torso deflection rate between 0.5 and 1.5 degrees per second up to 40 degrees of flexion but no further; maintain 40 degrees of flexion for 10 seconds, and record the highest applied force during that time. Release all force as rapidly as possible and measure the return angle three minutes after release.
            
            
              § 572.86
              Test conditions and dummy adjustment.
              (a) With the complete torso on its back lying on a horizontal surface and the neck assembly mounted and shoulders on the edge of the surface, adjust the neck such that the head bolt is lowered 0.40 ±0.05 inches (10 ±1 mm) after a vertically applied load of 11.25 pounds (50 N) applied to the head bolt is released.
              (b) With the complete torso on its back with the adjusted neck assembly as specified in § 572.66(a), and lying on a horizontal surface with the shoulders on the edge of the surface, mount the head and tighten the head bolt and nut firmly, with the head in horizontal position. Adjust the head joint at the force between 1-2g, which just supports the head's weight.
              (c) Using the procedures described below, limb joints are set at the force between 1-2g, which just supports the limbs' weight when the limbs are extended horizontally forward:
              (1) With the complete torso lying with its front down on a horizontal surface, with the hip joint just over the edge of the surface, mount the upper leg and tighten hip joint nut firmly. Adjust the hip joint by releasing the hip joint nut until the upper leg just starts moving.
              (2) With the complete torso and upper leg lying with its front up on a horizontal surface, with the knee joint just over the edge of the surface, mount the lower leg and tighten knee joint firmly. Adjust the knee joint by releasing the knee joint nut until the lower leg just starts moving.
              (3) With the torso in an upright position, mount the upper arm and tighten firmly the adjustment bolts for the shoulder joint with the upper arm placed in a horizontal position. Adjust the shoulder joint by releasing the shoulder joint nut until the upper arm just starts moving.
              (4) With the complete torso in an upright position and upper arm in a vertical position, mount the forearm in a horizontal position and tighten the elbow hinge bolt and nut firmly. Adjust the elbow joint nut until the forearm just starts moving.
              (d) With the torso assembled in an upright position, the adjustment nut for the lumbar vertebrae is tightened until the spring is compressed to 2/3 of its unloaded length.
              (e) Performance tests are conducted at any temperature from 66 to 78 degrees F and at any relative humidity from 10 percent to 70 percent after exposure of the dummy to these conditions for a period of not less than four hours.
              (f) Performance tests of the same component, segment, assembly or fully assembled dummy are separated in time by a period of not less than 20 minutes unless otherwise specified.
              (g) Surfaces of the dummy components are not painted except as specified in the part or in drawings incorporated by this part.

              § 572.113
              Neck assembly.

              The head/neck assembly consists of the parts 78051-61X, rev. C; -84; -90, rev. A; -94; -98; -104, revision F; -303, rev. E;—305; -306; -307, rev. X and has a six axis neck transducer (drawing C-1709, revision D) installed in conformance with § 572.36(d).
              
              (a) Test procedure. (1) Soak the head and neck assembly in a test environment at any temperature between 20.6 and 22.2 degrees C. (69 to 72 degrees F.) and at any relative humidity between 10 percent and 70 percent for a period of at least four (4) hours prior to its application in a test.
              (2) Torque the jamnut (78051-64) on the neck cable (78051-301, rev. E) to 1.35 ±0.27 Nm (1.0 ±0.2 ft-lb) before each test.
              (3) Using neck brackets 78051-303 and -307, mount the head/neck assembly to the part 572 pendulum test fixture (see § 572.33, Figure 22,) so that the midsagittal plane of the head is vertical and perpendicular to the plane of motion of the pendulum's longitudinal centerline (see § 572.33, Figure 20, except that the direction of the head/neck assembly is rotated around the superior-inferior axis by an angle of 90 degrees). Install suitable transducers or other devices necessary for measuring the “D” plane (horizontal surface at the base of the skull) rotation with respect to the pendulum's longitudinal centerline. The rotation can be measured by placing a transducer at the occipital condyles and another at the intersection of the centerline of the neck and the line extending from the base of the neck as shown in figure 52.
              (4) Release the pendulum and allow it to fall freely from a height to achieve an impact velocity of 6.89 to 7.13 m/s (22.6 to 23.4 ft/sec) measured at the center of the pendulum accelerometer.
              (5) Allow the neck to flex without the head or neck contacting any object during the test.
              (6) Time zero is defined as the time of initial contact between the striker plate and the pendulum deceleration medium.
              (7) Allow a period of at least thirty (30) minutes between successive tests on the same neck assembly.
              (b) Performance criteria. (1) The pendulum deceleration pulse is to be characterized in terms of decrease in velocity as obtained by integrating the pendulum acceleration output.

              (2) The maximum rotation of the midsagittal plane of the head shall be 66 to 82 degrees with respect to the pendulum's longitudinal centerline. The decaying head rotation vs. time curve shall cross the zero angle between 58 to 67 ms after reaching its peak value.

              (3) The moment about the x-axis which coincides with the midsagittal plane of the head at the level of the occipital condyles shall have a maximum value between 73 and 88 Nm. The decaying moment vs. time curve shall first cross zero moment between 49 and 64 ms after reaching its peak value. The following formula is to be used to calculate the moment about the occipital condyles when using the six-axis neck transducer:
              
              M = Mx + 0.01778 Fy
              
              
                Where Mx and Fy are the moment and force measured by the transducer and expressed in terms of Nm and N, respectively.
              
              
              (4) The maximum rotation of the head with respect to the pendulum's longitudinal centerline shall occur between 2 and 16 ms after peak moment.

              § 572.122
              Head assembly and test procedure.
              (a) The head assembly for this test consists of the complete head (drawing 127-1000), a six-axis neck transducer (drawing SA572-S11) or its structural replacement (drawing 78051-383X), a head to neck-to-pivot pin (drawing 78051-339), and 3 accelerometers (drawing SA572-S4).
              (b) When the head assembly in paragraph (a) of this section is dropped from a height of 376.0 ±1.0 mm (14.8 ±0.04 in) in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, the peak resultant acceleration at the location of the accelerometers at the head CG may not be less than 245 G or more than 300 G. The resultant acceleration vs. time history curve shall be unimodal; oscillations occurring after the main pulse must be less than 10 percent of the peak resultant acceleration. The lateral acceleration shall not exceed 15 g's (zero to peak).
              (c) Head test procedure. The test procedure for the head is as follows:
              (1) Soak the head assembly in a controlled environment at any temperature between 18.9 and 25.6 °C (66 and 78 °F) and a relative humidity from 10 to 70 percent for at least four hours prior to a test.
              (2) Prior to the test, clean the impact surface of the skin and the impact plate surface with isopropyl alcohol, trichloroethane, or an equivalent. The skin of the head must be clean and dry for testing.
              (3) Suspend the head assembly as shown in Figure N1. The lowest point on the forehead must be 376.0 ±1.0 mm (14.8 ±0.04 in) from the impact surface and the head must be oriented to an incline of 62 ±1 deg. between the “D” plane as shown in Figure N1 and the plane of the impact surface. The 1.57 mm (0.062 in) diameter holes located on either side of the dummy's head shall be used to ensure that the head is level with respect to the impact surface.

              (4) Drop the head assembly from the specified height by means that ensure a smooth, instant release onto a rigidly supported flat horizontal steel plate which is 50.8 mm (2 in) thick and 610 mm (24 in) square. The impact surface shall be clean, dry and have a micro finish of not less than 203.2. × 10−6 mm (8 micro inches) (RMS) and not more than 2032.0 × 10−6 mm (80 micro inches) (RMS).
              (5) Allow at least 2 hours between successive tests on the same head.
            
            
              § 572.123

              (a) The neck assembly for the purposes of this test consists of the assembly of components shown in drawing 127-1015.
              (b) When the head-neck assembly consisting of the head (drawing 127-1000), neck (drawing 127-1015), pivot pin (drawing 78051-339), bib simulator (drawing TE127-1025, neck bracket assembly (drawing 127-8221), six-axis neck transducer (drawing SA572-S11), neck mounting adaptor (drawing TE-2208-001), and three accelerometers (drawing SA572-S4) installed in the head assembly as specified in § 572.122, is tested according to the test procedure in paragraph (c) of this section, it shall have the following characteristics:
              (1) Flexion. (i) Plane D, referenced in Figure N2, shall rotate in the direction of preimpact flight with respect to the pendulum's longitudinal centerline between 74 degrees and 92 degrees. Within this specified rotation corridor, the peak moment about the occipital condyles shall be not less than 27 N-m (19.9 ft-lbf) and not more than 33 N-m (24.3 ft-lbf).
              (ii) The positive moment shall decay for the first time to 5 N-m (3.7 ft-lbf) between 103 ms and 123 ms.

              (iii) The moment shall be calculated by the following formula: Moment (N-m) = My−(0.01778m) × (FX).
              (iv) My is the moment about the y-axis and FX is the shear force measured by the neck transducer (drawing SA572-S11) and 0.01778m is the distance from force to occipital condyle.
              (2) Extension. (i) Plane D, referenced in Figure N3, shall rotate in the direction of preimpact flight with respect to the pendulum's longitudinal centerline between 85 degrees and 103 degrees. Within this specified rotation corridor, the peak moment about the occipital condyles shall be not more than −19 N-m (−14 ft-lbf) and not less than −24 N-m (−17.7ft-lbf).
              (ii) The negative moment shall decay for the first time to −5 N-m (−3.7 ft-lbf) between 123 ms and 147 ms.

              (iii) The moment shall be calculated by the following formula: Moment (N-m) = My−(0.01778m) × (FX).
              (iv) My is the moment about the y-axis and FX is the shear force measured by the neck transducer (drawing SA572-S11) and 0.017778m is the distance from force to occipital condyle.
              (3) Time-zero is defined as the time of initial contact between the pendulum striker plate and the honeycomb material.
              (c) Test procedure. The test procedure for the neck assembly is as follows:
              (1) Soak the neck assembly in a controlled environment at any temperature between 20.6 and 22.2 °C (69 and 72 °F) and a relative humidity between 10 and 70 percent for at least four hours prior to a test.
              (2) Torque the jam nut (drawing 9000341) on the neck cable (drawing 127-1016) to 0.23 ±0.02 N-m (2.0 ±0.2 in-lbs).
              (3) Mount the head-neck assembly, defined in paragraph (b) of this section, on the pendulum so the midsagittal plane of the head is vertical and coincides with the plane of motion of the pendulum as shown in Figure N2 for flexion tests and Figure N3 for extension tests.
              (4) Release the pendulum and allow it to fall freely from a height to achieve an impact velocity of 4.95 ±0.12 m/s (16.2 ±0.4 ft/s) for flexion tests and 4.3 ±0.12 m/s (14.10 ±0.40 ft/s) for extension tests, measured by an accelerometer mounted on the pendulum as shown in Figure 22 of 49 CFR 572 at the instant of contact with the honey comb.
              (i) Time-zero is defined as the time of initial contact between the pendulum striker plate and the honeycomb material. All data channels should be at the zero level at this time.

              (ii) Stop the pendulum from the initial velocity with an acceleration vs. time pulse which meets the velocity change as specified below. Integrate the pendulum acceleration data channel to obtain the velocity vs. time curve:

              Thorax assembly and test procedure.
              (a) Thorax (upper torso) assembly. The thorax consists of the part of the torso assembly shown in drawing 127-2000.
              (b) When the anterior surface of the thorax of a completely assembled dummy (drawing 127-0000) is impacted by a test probe conforming to section 572.127(a) at 6.71 ±0.12 m/s (22.0 ±0.4 ft/s) according to the test procedure in paragraph (c) of this section:
              (1) The maximum sternum displacement (compression) relative to the spine, measured with chest deflection transducer (drawing SA572-S50), must be not less than 38.0 mm (1.50 in) and not more than 46.0 mm (1.80 in). Within this specified compression corridor, the peak force, measured by the probe in accordance with section 572.127, shall not be less than 1150 N (259 lbf) and not more than 1380 N (310 lbf). The peak force after 12.5 mm (0.5 in) of sternum displacement but before reaching the minimum required 38.0 mm (1.5 in) sternum displacement limit shall not exceed 1500 N (337.2 lbf).
              (2) The internal hysteresis of the ribcage in each impact as determined by the plot of force vs. deflection in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be not less than 65 percent but not more than 85 percent.
              (c) Test procedure. The test procedure for the thorax assembly is as follows:
              (1) Soak the dummy in a controlled environment at any temperature between 20.6° and 22.2 °C (69° and 72 °F) and a relative humidity between 10 and 70 percent for at least four hours prior to a test.
              (2) Seat and orient the dummy, wearing tight-fitting underwear or equivalent consisting of a size 5 short-sleeved shirt having a weight less than 0.090 kg (0.2 lb) and an opening at the top just large enough to permit the passage of the head with a tight fit, and a size 4 pair of long pants having a weight of less than 0.090 kg (0.2 lb) with the legs cut off sufficiently above the knee to allow the knee target to be visible, on a seating surface without back support as shown in Figure N4, with the limbs extended horizontally and forward, parallel to the midsagittal plane, the midsagittal plane vertical within ±1 degree and the ribs level in the anterior-posterior and lateral directions within ±0.5 degrees.
              (3) Establish the impact point at the chest midsagittal plane so that the impact point of the longitudinal centerline of the probe coincides with the midsagittal plane of the dummy within ±2.5 mm (0.1 in) and is 12.7 ±1.1 mm (0.5 ±0.04 in) below the horizontal-peripheral centerline of the No. 3 rib and is within 0.5 degrees of a horizontal line in the dummy's midsagittal plane.
              (4) Impact the thorax with the test probe so that at the moment of contact the probe's longitudinal center line falls within 2 degrees of a horizontal line in the dummy's midsagittal plane.
              (5) Guide the test probe during impact so that there is no significant lateral, vertical or rotational movement.
              (6) No suspension hardware, suspension cables, or any other attachments to the probe, including the velocity vane, shall make contact with the dummy during the test.

              § 572.125
              Upper and lower torso assemblies and torso flexion test procedure.
              (a) Upper/lower torso assembly. The test objective is to determine the stiffness effects of the lumbar spine (drawing 127-3002), including cable (drawing 127-8095), mounting plate insert (drawing 910420-048), nylon shoulder bushing (drawing 9001373), nut (drawing 9001336), and abdominal insert (drawing 127-8210), on resistance to articulation between upper torso assembly (drawing 127-2000) and lower torso assembly (drawing 127-3000).
              (b)(1) When the upper torso assembly of a seated dummy is subjected to a force continuously applied at the head to neck pivot pin level through a rigidly attached adaptor bracket as shown in Figure N5 according to the test procedure set out in paragraph (c) of this section, the lumbar spine-abdomen assembly shall flex by an amount that permits the upper torso assembly to translate in angular motion until the machined rear surface of the instrument cavity at the back of the thoracic spine box is at 45 ±0.5 degrees relative to the vertical transverse plane, at which time the force applied as shown in Figure N5 must be not less than 147 N (33 lbf) and not more than 200 N (45 lbf), and
              (2) Upon removal of the force, the torso assembly must return to within 8 degrees of its initial position.
              (c) Test procedure. The test procedure for the torso assemblies is as follows:
              (1) Soak the dummy in a controlled environment at any temperature between 18.9 and 25.6 °C (66 and 78 °F) and a relative humidity between 10 and 70 percent for at least four hours prior to a test.
              (2) Attach the dummy (with or without the legs below the femurs) to the fixture in a seated posture as shown in Figure N5.
              (3) Secure the pelvis at the pelvis instrument cavity rear face by threading four 1/4 in cap screws into the available threaded attachment holes. Tighten the mountings so that the test material is rigidly affixed to the test fixture and the pelvic-lumbar joining surface is horizontal.
              (4) Flex the thorax forward three times between vertical and until the torso reference plane, as shown in figure N5, reaches 30 ±2 degrees from vertical. Bring the torso to vertical orientation, remove all externally applied flexion forces, and wait 30 minutes before conducting the test. During the 30-minute waiting period, the dummy's upper torso shall be externally supported at or near its vertical orientation to prevent sagging.
              (5) Remove the external support and wait two minutes. Measure the initial orientation of the torso reference plane of the seated, unsupported dummy as shown in Figure N5. This initial torso orientation angle may not exceed 22 degrees.

              Head assembly and test procedure.
              (a) The head assembly (refer to § 572.130(a)(1)(i)) for this test consists of the complete head (drawing 880105-100X), a six-axis neck transducer (drawing SA572-S11) or its structural replacement (drawing 78051-383X), and 3 accelerometers (drawing SA572-S4).
              (b) When the head assembly is dropped from a height of 376.0 ±1.0 mm (14.8 ±0.04 in) in accordance with subsection (c) of this section, the peak resultant acceleration at the location of the accelerometers at the head CG may not be less than 250 G or more than 300 G. The resultant acceleration vs. time history curve shall be unimodal; oscillations occurring after the main pulse must be less than 10 percent of the peak resultant acceleration. The lateral acceleration shall not exceed 15 G (zero to peak).
              (c) Head test procedure. The test procedure for the head is as follows:
              (1) Soak the head assembly in a controlled environment at any temperature between 18.9 and 25.6 °C (66 and 78 °F) and a relative humidity from 10 to 70 percent for at least four hours prior to a test.
              (2) Prior to the test, clean the impact surface of the skin and the impact plate surface with isopropyl alcohol, trichloroethane, or an equivalent. The skin of the head must be clean and dry for testing.
              (3) Suspend and orient the head assembly as shown in Figure 19 of 49 CFR 572. The lowest point on the forehead must be 376.0 ±1.0 mm (14.8 ±0.04 in) from the impact surface. The 1.57 mm (0.062 in) diameter holes located on either side of the dummy's head shall be used to ensure that the head is level with respect to the impact surface.

              (4) Drop the head assembly from the specified height by means that ensure a smooth, instant release onto a rigidly supported flat horizontal steel plate which is 50.8 mm (2.0 in) thick and 610 mm (24.0 in) square. The impact surface shall be clean, dry and have a micro finish of not less than 203.2. × 10−6 mm (8 micro inches) (RMS) and not more than 2032.0 × 10−6 mm (80 micro inches) (RMS).
              (5) Allow at least 2 hours between successive tests on the same head.

              Neck assembly and test procedure.
              (a) The neck assembly (refer to § 572.130(a)(1)(ii)) for the purposes of this test consists of the assembly of components shown in drawing 880105-250.

              (b) When the head-neck assembly consisting of the head (drawing 880105-100X), neck (drawing 880105-250), bib simulator (drawing 880105-371), upper neck adjusting bracket (drawing 880105-207), lower neck adjusting bracket (drawing 880105-208), six-axis neck transducer (drawing SA572-S11), and either three accelerometers (drawing SA572-S4) or their mass equivalent installed in the head assembly as specified in drawing 880105-100X, is tested according to the test procedure in subsection (c) of this section, it shall have the following characteristics:
              (1) Flexion. (i) Plane D, referenced in Figure O1, shall rotate in the direction of preimpact flight with respect to the pendulum's longitudinal centerline between 77 degrees and 91 degrees. During the time interval while the rotation is within the specified corridor, the peak moment, measured by the neck transducer (drawing SA5572-311), about the occipital condyles may not be less than 69 N-m (51 ft-lbf) and not more than 83 N-m (61 ft-lbf). The positive moment shall decay for the first time to 10 N-m (7.4 ft-lbf) between 80 ms and 100 ms after time zero.

              (ii) The moment shall be calculated by the following formula: Moment (N-m)= My−(0.01778m) × (Fx).
              (iii) My is the moment about the y-axis, Fx is the shear force measured by the neck transducer (drawing SA572-S11), and 0.01778m is the distance from force to occipital condyle.
              (2) Extension. (i) Plane D, referenced in Figure O2, shall rotate in the direction of preimpact flight with respect to the pendulum's longitudinal centerline between 99 degrees and 114 degrees. During the time interval while the rotation is within the specified corridor, the peak moment, measured by the neck transducer (drawing SA5572-S11), about the occipital condyles shall be not more than −53 N-m (−39 ft-lbf) and not less than −65 N-m (−48 ft-lbf). The negative moment shall decay for the first time to −10 N-m (−7.4 ft-lbf) between 94 ms and 114 ms after time zero.

              (ii) The moment shall be calculated by the following formula: Moment (N-m) = My − (0.01778m) × (Fx).
              (iii) My is the moment about the y-axis, Fx is the shear force measured by the neck transducer (drawing SA572-S11), and 0.01778 m is the distance from force to occipital condyle.
              (3) Time-zero is defined as the time of initial contact between the pendulum striker plate and the honeycomb material. All data channels shall be at the zero level at this time.
              (c) Test Procedure. The test procedure for the neck assembly is as follows:
              (1) Soak the neck assembly in a controlled environment at any temperature between 20.6 and 22.2 °C (69 and 72 °F) and a relative humidity between 10 and 70 percent for at least four hours prior to a test.
              (2) Torque the jam nut (drawing 9000018) on the neck cable (drawing 880105-206) to 1.4 ±0.2 N-m (12.0 ±2.0 in-lb).
              (3) Mount the head-neck assembly, defined in subsection (b) of this section, on the pendulum described in Figure 22 of 49 CFR 572 so that the midsagittal plane of the head is vertical and coincides with the plane of motion of the pendulum as shown in Figure O1 for flexion tests and Figure O2 for extension tests.
              (4)(i) Release the pendulum and allow it to fall freely from a height to achieve an impact velocity of 7.01 ±0.12 m/s (23.0 ±0.4 ft/s) for flexion tests and 6.07 ±0.12 m/s (19.9 ±0.40 ft/s) for extension tests, measured by an accelerometer mounted on the pendulum as shown in Figure 22 of 49 CFR 572 at the instant of contact with the honey comb.
              (ii) Stop the pendulum from the initial velocity with an acceleration vs. time pulse which meets the velocity change as specified below. Integrate the pendulum acceleration data channel to obtain the velocity vs. time curve:

              § 572.134
              Thorax assembly and test procedure.
              (a) Thorax (Upper Torso) Assembly (refer to § 572.130(a)(1)(iii)). The thorax consists of the part of the torso assembly shown in drawing 880105-300.
              (b) When the anterior surface of the thorax of a completely assembled dummy (drawing 880105-000) is impacted by a test probe conforming to section 572.137(a) at 6.71 ±0.12 m/s (22.0 ±0.4 ft/s) according to the test procedure in subsection (c) of this section:
              (1) Maximum sternum displacement (compression) relative to the spine, measured with chest deflection transducer (drawing SA572-S5), must be not less than 50.0 mm (1.97 in) and not more than 58.0 mm (2.30 in). Within this specified compression corridor, the peak force, measured by the impact probe as defined in section 572.137 and calculated in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section, shall not be less than 3900 N (876 lbf) and not more than 4400 N (989 lbf). The peak force after 18.0 mm (0.71 in) of sternum displacement but before reaching the minimum required 50.0 mm (1.97 in) sternum displacement limit shall not exceed 4600 N.
              (2) The internal hysteresis of the ribcage in each impact as determined by the plot of force vs. deflection in paragraph (1) of this section shall be not less than 69 percent but not more than 85 percent. The hysteresis shall be calculated by determining the ratio of the area between the loading and unloading portions of the force deflection curve to the area under the loading portion of the curve.
              (3) The force shall be calculated by the product of the impactor mass and its deceleration.
              (c) Test procedure. The test procedure for the thorax assembly is as follows:
              (1) The dummy is clothed in a form fitting cotton stretch above-the-elbow sleeved shirt and above-the-knee pants. The weight of the shirt and pants shall not exceed 0.14 kg (0.30 lb) each.
              (2) Soak the dummy in a controlled environment at any temperature between 20.6 and 22.2 °C (69 and 72 °F) and a relative humidity between 10 and 70 percent for at least four hours prior to a test.
              (3) Seat and orient the dummy on a seating surface without back support as shown in Figure O3, with the limbs extended horizontally and forward, parallel to the midsagittal plane, the midsagittal plane vertical within ±1 degree and the ribs level in the anterior-posterior and lateral directions within ±0.5 degrees.
              (4) Establish the impact point at the chest midsagittal plane so that the impact point of the longitudinal centerline of the probe coincides with the midsagittal plane of the dummy within ±2.5 mm (0.1 in) and is 12.7 ±1.1 mm (0.5 ±0.04 in) below the horizontal-peripheral centerline of the No. 3 rib and is within 0.5 degrees of a horizontal line in the dummy's midsagittal plane.
              (5) Impact the thorax with the test probe so that at the moment of contact the probe's longitudinal center line falls within 2 degrees of a horizontal line in the dummy's midsagittal plane.
              (6) Guide the test probe during impact so that there is no significant lateral, vertical or rotational movement.
              (7) No suspension hardware, suspension cables, or any other attachments to the probe, including the velocity vane, shall make contact with the dummy during the test.

              § 572.135
              Upper and lower torso assemblies and torso flexion test procedure.
              (a) Upper/lower torso assembly. The test objective is to determine the stiffness effects of the lumbar spine (drawing 880105-1096), and abdominal insert (drawing 880105-434), on resistance to articulation between the upper torso assembly (drawing 880105-300) and the lower torso assembly (drawing 880105-450) (refer to § 572.130(a)(1)(iv)).

              (b)(1) When the upper torso assembly of a seated dummy is subjected to a force continuously applied at the head to neck pivot pin level through a rigidly attached adaptor bracket as shown in Figure O4 according to the test procedure set out in subsection (c) of this section, the lumbar spine-abdomen assembly shall flex by an amount that permits the upper torso assembly to translate in angular motion relative to the vertical transverse plane 45 ±0.5 degrees at which time the force applied must be not less than 320 N (71.5 lbf) and not more than 390 N (87.4 lbf), and
              (2) Upon removal of the force, the torso assembly must return to within 8 degrees of its initial position.
              (c) Test procedure. The test procedure for the upper/lower torso assembly is as follows:
              (1) Soak the dummy in a controlled environment at any temperature between 18.9 and 25.6 °C (66 and 78 °F) and a relative humidity between 10 and 70 percent for at least four hours prior to a test.
              (2) Assemble the complete dummy (with or without the legs below the femurs) and attach to the fixture in a seated posture as shown in Figure O4.
              (3) Secure the pelvis to the fixture at the pelvis instrument cavity rear face by threading four 1/4 inch cap screws into the available threaded attachment holes. Tighten the mountings so that the test material is rigidly affixed to the test fixture and the pelvic-lumbar joining surface is horizontal.
              (4) Attach the loading adapter bracket to the spine of the dummy as shown in Figure O4.
              (5) Inspect and adjust, if necessary, the seating of the abdominal insert within the pelvis cavity and with respect to the torso flesh, assuring that the torso flesh provides uniform fit and overlap with respect to the outside surface of the pelvis flesh.
              (6) Flex the dummy's upper torso three times between the vertical and until the torso reference plane, as shown in Figure O4, reaches 30 degrees from the vertical transverse plane. Bring the torso to vertical orientation and wait for 30 minutes before conducting the test. During the 30 minute waiting period, the dummy's upper torso shall be externally supported at or near its vertical orientation to prevent it from drooping.
              (7) Remove all external support and wait two minutes. Measure the initial orientation angle of the torso reference plane of the seated, unsupported dummy as shown in Figure O4. The initial orientation angle may not exceed 20 degrees.
              (8) Attach the pull cable and the load cell as shown in Figure O4.
              (9) Apply a tension force in the midsagittal plane to the pull cable as shown in Figure O4 at any upper torso deflection rate between 0.5 and 1.5 degrees per second, until the angle reference plane is at 45 ±0.5 degrees of flexion relative to the vertical transverse plane.
              (9) Continue to apply a force sufficient to maintain 45 ±0.5 degrees of flexion for 10 seconds, and record the highest applied force during the 10-second period.
              (10) Release all force at the attachment bracket as rapidly as possible, and measure the return angle with respect to the initial angle reference plane as defined in paragraph (6) 3 minutes after the release.

              § 572.142
              Head assembly and test procedure.
              (a) The head assembly (refer to § 572.140(a)(1)(i)) for this test consists of the head (drawing 210-1000), adapter plate (drawing ATD 6259), accelerometer mounting block (drawing SA 572-S80), structural replacement of 1/2 mass of the neck load transducer (drawing TE-107-001), head mounting washer (drawing ATD 6262), one 1/2-20 × 1″ flat head cap screw (FHCS) (drawing 9000150), and 3 accelerometers (drawing SA-572-S4).
              (b) When the head assembly in paragraph (a) of this section is dropped from a height of 376.0±1.0 mm (14.8±0.04 in) in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, the peak resultant acceleration at the location of the accelerometers at the head CG shall not be less than 250 g or more than 280 g. The resultant acceleration versus time history curve shall be unimodal, and the oscillations occurring after the main pulse shall be less than 10 percent of the peak resultant acceleration. The lateral acceleration shall not exceed ±15 G (zero to peak).
              (c) Head test procedure. The test procedure for the head is as follows:
              (1) Soak the head assembly in a controlled environment at any temperature between 18.9 and 25.6 °C (66 and 78 °F) and at any relative humidity between 10 and 70 percent for at least four hours prior to a test.
              (2) Prior to the test, clean the impact surface of the head skin and the steel impact plate surface with isopropyl alcohol, trichlorethane, or an equivalent. Both impact surfaces must be clean and dry for testing.
              (3) Suspend the head assembly with its midsagittal plane in vertical orientation as shown in Figure P1 of this subpart. The lowest point on the forehead is 376.0 ±1.0 mm (14.76 ±0.04 in) from the steel impact surface. The 3.3 mm (0.13 in) diameter holes, located on either side of the dummy's head in transverse alignment with the CG, shall be used to ensure that the head transverse plane is level with respect to the impact surface.

              (4) Drop the head assembly from the specified height by a means that ensures a smooth, instant release onto a rigidly supported flat horizontal steel plate which is 50.8 mm (2 in) thick and 610 mm (24 in) square. The impact surface shall be clean, dry and have a finish of not less than 203.2 × 10−6 mm (8 micro inches) (RMS) and not more than 2032.0 × 10−6 mm (80 micro inches) (RMS).
              (5) Allow at least 2 hours between successive tests on the same head.
            
            
              § 572.143
              Neck-headform assembly and test procedure.
              (a) The neck and headform assembly (refer to §§ 572.140(a)(1)(ii) and 572.140(a)(1)(iii)) for the purposes of this test, as shown in Figures P2 and P3 of this subpart, consists of the neck molded assembly (drawing 210-2015), neck cable (drawing 210-2040), nylon shoulder bushing (drawing 9001373), upper mount plate insert (drawing 910420-048), bib simulator (drawing TE-208-050), urethane washer (drawing 210-2050), neck mounting plate (drawing TE-250-021), two jam nuts (drawing 9001336), load-moment transducer (drawing SA 572-S19), and headform (drawing TE-208-000).
              (b) When the neck and headform assembly, as defined in § 572.143(a), is tested according to the test procedure in paragraph (c) of this section, it shall have the following characteristics:
              (1) Flexion.
              
              (i) Plane D, referenced in Figure P2 of this subpart, shall rotate in the direction of preimpact flight with respect to the pendulum's longitudinal centerline between 70 degrees and 82 degrees. Within this specified rotation corridor, the peak moment about the occipital condyle may not be less than 42 N-m and not more than 53 N-m.
              (ii) The positive moment shall decay for the first time to 10 N-m between 60 ms and 80 ms after time zero.
              (iii) The moment and rotation data channels are defined to be zero when the longitudinal centerline of the neck and pendulum are parallel.
              (2) Extension.
              (i) Plane D referenced in Figure P3 of this subpart shall rotate in the direction of preimpact flight with respect to the pendulum's longitudinal centerline between 83 degrees and 93 degrees. Within this specified rotation corridor, the peak moment about the occipital condyle may be not more than −43.7 N-m and not less than −53.3 N-m.
              (ii) The negative moment shall decay for the first time to −10 N-m between 60 and 80 ms after time zero.

              § 572.144
              Thorax assembly and test procedure.
              (a) Thorax (upper torso) assembly (refer to § 572.140(a)(1)(iv)). The thorax consists of the upper part of the torso assembly shown in drawing 210-3000.
              (b) When the anterior surface of the thorax of a completely assembled dummy (drawing 210-0000) is impacted by a test probe conforming to § 572.146(a) at 6.0 ±0.1 m/s (19.7 ±0.3 ft/s) according to the test procedure in paragraph (c) of this section.

              (1) Maximum sternum displacement (compression) relative to the spine, measured with the chest deflection transducer (SA-572-S50), must not be less than 32mm (1.3 in) and not more than 38mm (1.5 in). Within this specified compression corridor, the peak force, measured by the probe-mounted accelerometer as defined in § 572.146(a) and calculated in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section, shall be not less than 680 N and not more than 810 N. The peak force after 12.5 mm of sternum compression but before reaching the minimum required 32.0 mm sternum compression shall not exceed 910 N.
              (2) The internal hysteresis of the ribcage in each impact, as determined from the force vs. deflection curve, shall be not less than 65 percent and not more than 85 percent. The hysteresis shall be calculated by determining the ratio of the area between the loading and unloading portions of the force deflection curve to the area under the loading portion of the curve.
              (3) The force shall be calculated by the product of the impactor mass and its deceleration.
              (c) Test procedure. The test procedure for the thorax assembly is as follows:
              (1) The test dummy is clothed in cotton-polyester-based tight-fitting shirt with long sleeves and ankle-length pants whose combined weight is not more than 0.25 kg (0.55 lbs).
              (2) Soak the dummy in a controlled environment at any temperature between 20.6 and 22.2 °C (69 and 72 °F) and at any relative humidity between 10 and 70 percent for at least four hours prior to a test.
              (3) Seat and orient the dummy on a seating surface without back support as shown in Figure P4, with the lower limbs extended horizontally and forward, the upper arms parallel to the torso and the lower arms extended horizontally and forward, parallel to the midsagittal plane, the midsagittal plane being vertical within ±1 degree and the ribs level in the anterior-posterior and lateral directions within ±0.5 degrees.
              (4) Establish the impact point at the chest midsagittal plane so that the impact point of the longitudinal centerline of the probe coincides with the dummy's mid-sagittal plane and is centered on the center of No. 2 rib within ±2.5 mm (0.1 in.) and 0.5 degrees of a horizontal plane.
              (5) Impact the thorax with the test probe so that at the moment of contact the probe's longitudinal center line is within 2 degrees of a horizontal line in the dummy's midsagittal plane.
              (6) Guide the test probe during impact so that there is no significant lateral, vertical or rotational movement.
              (7) No suspension hardware, suspension cables, or any other attachments to the probe, including the velocity vane, shall make contact with the dummy during the test.

              § 572.145
              Upper and lower torso assemblies and torso flexion test procedure.
              (a) The test objective is to determine the resistance of the lumbar spine and abdomen of a fully assembled dummy (drawing 210-0000) to flexion articulation between upper and lower halves of the torso assembly (refer to § 572.140(a)(1)(iv)).
              (b)(1) When the upper half of the torso assembly of a seated dummy is subjected to a force continuously applied at the occipital condyle level through the rigidly attached adaptor bracket in accordance with the test procedure set out in paragraph (c) of this section, the lumbar spine-abdomen assembly shall flex by an amount that permits the upper half of the torso, as measured at the posterior surface of the torso reference plane shown in Figure P5 of this subpart, to translate in angular motion in the midsagittal plane 45 ±0.5 degrees relative to the vertical transverse plane, at which time the pulling force applied must not be less than 130 N (28.8 lbf) and not more than 180 N (41.2 lbf), and
              (2) Upon removal of the force, the upper torso assembly returns to within 10 degrees of its initial position.
              (c) Test procedure. The test procedure is as follows:
              (1) Soak the dummy in a controlled environment at any temperature between 18.9° and 25.6 °C (66 and 78 °F) and at any relative humidity between 10 and 70 percent for at least 4 hours prior to a test.
              (2) Assemble the complete dummy (with or without the lower legs) and seat it on a rigid flat-surface table, as shown in Figure P5 of this subpart.

              (i) Unzip the torso jacket and remove the four 1/4-20 × 3/4″ bolts which attach the lumbar load transducer or its structural replacement to the pelvis weldment (drawing 210-4510) as shown in Figure P5 of this subpart.
              (ii) Position the matching end of the rigid pelvis attachment fixture around the lumbar spine and align it over the four bolt holes.
              (iii) Secure the fixture to the dummy with the four 1/4-20 × 3/4″ bolts and attach the fixture to the table. Tighten the mountings so that the pelvis-lumbar joining surface is horizontal within ±1 deg and the buttocks and upper legs of the seated dummy are in contact with the test surface.
              (iv) Attach the loading adapter bracket to the upper part of the torso as shown in Figure P5 of this subpart and zip up the torso jacket.
              (v) Point the upper arms vertically downward and the lower arms forward.
              (3)(i) Flex the thorax forward three times from vertical until the torso reference plane reaches 30 ±2 degrees from vertical.

              (ii) Remove all externally applied flexion forces and support the upper torso half in a vertical orientation for 30 minutes to prevent it from drooping.
              (4) Remove the external support and after two minutes measure the initial orientation angle of the upper torso reference plane of the seated, unsupported dummy as shown in Figure P5 of this subpart. The initial orientation of the torso reference plane may not exceed 15 degrees.
              (5) Attach the pull cable at the point of load application on the adaptor bracket while maintaining the initial torso orientation. Apply a pulling force in the midsagittal plane, as shown in Figure P5 of this subpart, at any upper torso flexion rate between 0.5 and 1.5 degrees per second, until the torso reference plane reaches 45 ±0.5 degrees of flexion relative to the vertical transverse plane.
              (6) Continue to apply a force sufficient to maintain 45 ±0.5 degrees of flexion for 10 seconds, and record the highest applied force during the 10-second period.
              (7) [Reserved]
              (8) Release all force at the loading adaptor bracket as rapidly as possible and measure the return angle with respect to the initial angle reference plane as defined in paragraph (c)(4) of this section 3 to 4 minutes after the release.

              § 572.152
              Head assembly and test procedure.
              (a) The head assembly (refer to § 572.150(a)(1)(i)) for this test consists of the assembly (drawing 921022-001), triaxial mount block (SA572-80), and 3 accelerometers (drawing SA572-S4).
              (b) Frontal and rear impact. (1) Frontal impact. When the head assembly in paragraph (a) of this section is dropped from a height of 376.0 ±1.0 mm (14.8 ±0.04 in) in accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, the peak resultant acceleration measured at the head CG shall not be less than 100 g or more than 120 g. The resultant acceleration vs. time history curve shall be unimodal, and the oscillations occurring after the main pulse shall be less than 17 percent of the peak resultant acceleration. The lateral acceleration shall not exceed ±15 g's.
              (2) Rear impact. When the head assembly in paragraph (a) of this section is dropped from a height of 376.0 ±1.0 mm (14.8 ±0.04 in) in accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, the peak resultant acceleration measured at the head CG shall be not less than 55 g and not more than 71 g. The resultant acceleration vs. time history curve shall be unimodal, and the oscillations occurring after the main pulse shall be less than 17 percent of the peak resultant acceleration. The lateral acceleration shall not exceed ±15 g's.
              (c) Head test procedure. The test procedure for the head is as follows:
              (1) Soak the head assembly in a controlled environment at any temperature between 18.9 and 25.6 °C (66 and 78 °F) and at any relative humidity between 10 and 70 percent for at least four hours prior to a test. These temperature and humidity levels shall be maintained throughout the entire testing period specified in this section.
              (2) Before the test, clean the impact surface of the head skin and the steel impact plate surface with isopropyl alcohol, trichlorethane, or an equivalent. Both impact surfaces shall be clean and dry for testing.
              (3)(i) For a frontal impact test, suspend the head assembly with its midsagittal plane in vertical orientation as shown in Figure R1 of this subpart. The lowest point on the forehead is 376.0 ±1.0 mm (14.8 ±0.04 in) from the impact surface. The 3.30 mm (0.13 in) diameter holes located on either side of the dummy's head are used to ensure that the head is level with respect to the impact surface. The angle between the lower surface plane of the neck transducer mass simulator (drawing 910420-003) and the plane of the impact surface is 45 ±1 degrees.
              (ii) For a rear impact test, suspend the head assembly with its midsagittal plane in vertical orientation as shown in Figure R2 of this subpart. The lowest point on the back of the head is 376.0 ±1.0 mm (14.8 ±0.04 in) from the impact surface. The 3.30 mm (0.13 in) diameter holes located on either side of the dummy's head are used to ensure that the head is level with respect to the impact surface. The angle between the lower surface plane of the neck transducer structural replacement (drawing 910420-003) and the impact surface is 90 ±1 degrees.

              (4) Drop the head assembly from the specified height by a means that ensures a smooth, instant release onto a rigidly supported flat horizontal steel plate which is 50.8 mm (2 in) thick and 610 mm (24 in) square. The impact surface shall be clean, dry and have a micro finish of not less than 203.2 × 10−6 mm (8 micro inches) (RMS) and not more than 2032.0 × 10−6 mm (80 micro inches) (RMS).
              (5) Allow at least 2 hours between successive tests of the head assembly at the same impact point. For head impacts on the opposite side of the head, the 30-minute waiting period specified in § 572.155(m) does not apply.

              Neck-headform assembly and test procedure.
              (a) The neck and headform assembly (refer to §§ 572.150(a)(1)(ii) and 572.150(a)(1)(iii)) for the purposes of this test consists of parts shown in CRABI neck test assembly (drawing TE-3200-100);

              (b) When the neck and headform assembly, as defined in § 572.153(a), is tested according to the test procedure in § 572.153(c), it shall have the following characteristics:
              
              (1) Flexion. (i) Plane D referenced in Figure R3 of this subpart shall rotate in the direction of pre-impact flight with respect to the pendulum's longitudinal centerline not less than 75 degrees and not more than 86 degrees. Within this specified rotation corridor, the peak positive moment about the occipital condyles shall be not less than 36 N-m (26.6 ft-lbf) and not more than 45 N-m (33.2 ft-lbf).
              (ii) The positive moment about the occipital condyles shall decay for the first time to 5 N-m (3.7 ft-lbf) between 60 ms and 80 ms after time zero.
              (iii) The moment about the occipital condyles shall be calculated by the following formula: Moment (N-m) = My − (0.005842m) × (Fx), where My is the moment about the y-axis, Fx is the shear force measured by the neck transducer (drawing SA572 -S23) and 0.005842m is the distance from the point at which the load cell measures the force to the occipital condyle.
              (2) Extension. (i) Plane D referenced in Figure R4 of this subpart shall rotate in the direction of preimpact flight with respect to the pendulum's longitudinal centerline not less than 80 degrees and not more than 92 degrees. Within the specified rotation corridor, the peak negative moment about the occipital condyles shall be not more than −12 Nm (−8.9 ft-lbf) and not less than −23 N-m (−17.0 ft-lbf) within the minimum and maximum rotation interval.
              (ii) The negative moment about the occipital condyles shall decay for the first time to −5 Nm (−3.7 lbf-ft) between 76 ms and 90 ms after time zero.
              (iii) The moment about the occipital condyles shall be calculated by the following formula: Moment (N-m) = My − (0.005842m) × (Fx), where My is the moment about the y-axis, Fx is the shear force measured by the neck transducer (drawing SA572 -S23) and 0.005842m is the distance from the point at which the load cell measures the force to the occipital condyle.
              (c) Test procedure. (1) Soak the neck assembly in a controlled environment at any temperature between 20.6 and 22.2 °C (69 and 72 °F) and at any relative humidity between 10 and 70 percent for at least four hours prior to a test. These temperature and humidity levels shall be maintained throughout the testing period specified in this section.
              (2) Torque the jam nut (drawing 9001336) on the neck cable (drawing ATD-6206) to 0.2 to 0.3 Nm (2-3 in-lbf).
              (3) Mount the neck-headform assembly, defined in paragraph (b) of this section, on the pendulum so the midsagittal plane of the headform is vertical and coincides with the plane of motion of the pendulum as shown in Figure R3 for flexion and Figure R4 for extension tests.

              (b) When the thorax of a completely assembled dummy (drawing 921022-000) is impacted by a test probe conforming to § 572.155(a) at 5.0 ±0.1m/s (16.5 ±0.3 ft/s) according to the test procedure in paragraph (c) of this section, the peak force, measured by the impact probe in accordance with paragraph § 572.155(a), shall be not less than 1514 N (340.7 lbf) and not more than 1796 N (404.1 lbf).
              (c) Test procedure. (1) Soak the dummy in a controlled environment at any temperature between 20.6 and 22.2 °C (69 and 72 °F) and at any relative humidity between 10 and 70 percent for at least four hours prior to a test. These temperature and humidity levels shall be maintained throughout the entire testing period specified in this section.
              (2) The test dummy is clothed in a cotton-polyester based tight fitting sweat shirt with long sleeves and ankle long pants whose combined weight is not more than 0.25 kg (.55 lbs).
              (3) Seat and orient the dummy on a level seating surface without back support as shown in Figure R5 of this subpart, with the lower limbs extended forward, parallel to the midsagittal plane and the arms 0 to 5 degrees forward of vertical. The dummy's midsagittal plane is vertical within ±/1 degree and the posterior surface of the upper spine box is aligned at 90 ±/1 degrees from the horizontal. (Shim material may be used under the upper legs to maintain the dummy's specified spine box surface alignment).
              (4) Establish the impact point at the chest midsagittal plane so that the impact point of the longitudinal centerline of the probe coincides with the dummy's midsagittal plane, is centered on the torso 196 ±/2.5 mm (7.7 ±/0.1 in) vertically from the plane of the seating surface, and is within 0.5 degrees of a horizontal plane.
              (5) Impact the thorax with the test probe so that at the moment of contact the probe's longitudinal center line falls within 2 degrees of a horizontal line in the dummy's midsagittal plane.
              (6) Guide the test probe during impact so that there is no significant lateral, vertical or rotational movement.
              (7) No suspension hardware, suspension cables, or any other attachments to the probe, including the velocity vane, shall make contact with the dummy during the test.

The test objective is to determine the stiffness effects of the lumbar spine (specified in 49 CFR 572.125(a)), including cable (specified in 49 CFR 572.125(a)), mounting plate insert (specified in 49 CFR 572.125(a)), nylon shoulder bushing (specified in 49 CFR 572.125(a)), nut (specified in 49 CFR 572.125(a)), spine box weighting plates (drawing 167-2020 Revision A), lumbar base weight (drawing 167-3010 Revision A), and abdominal insert (specified in 49 CFR 572.125(a)), on resistance to articulation between the upper torso assembly (drawing 167-2000) and the lower torso assembly (drawing 167-3000). Drawing Nos. 167-2000, 167-2020 Revision A, 167-3000, and 167-3010 Revision A, are incorporated by reference, see § 572.160.
              (b)(1) When the upper torso assembly of a seated dummy is subjected to a force continuously applied at the head to neck pivot pin level through a rigidly attached adaptor bracket as shown in Figure S2 according to the test procedure set out in 49 CFR 572.125(c), the lumbar spine-abdomen assembly must flex by an amount that permits the upper torso assembly to translate in angular motion until the machined surface of the instrument cavity at the back of the thoracic spine box is at 45 ±0.5 degrees relative to the transverse plane, at which time the force applied as shown in Figure S2 must be within 88.6 N ±25 N (20.0 lbf ±5.6 lbf), and
              (2) Upon removal of the force, the torso assembly must return to within 9 degrees of its initial position.
              (c) Test procedure. The upper and lower torso assemblies are tested as specified in 49 CFR 572.125(c), except that in paragraph (c)(5) of that section, the initial torso orientation angle may not exceed 32 degrees.

              § 572.172
              Head assembly and test procedure.
              (a) The head assembly for this test consists of the complete head (drawing 420-1000), a six-axis neck transducer (drawing SA572-S11, included in drawing 420-0000), or its structural replacement (drawing 420-383X), and 3 accelerometers (drawing SA572-S4, included in drawing 420-0000) (all incorporated by reference, see § 572.170).
              (b) When the head assembly is dropped from a height of 376.0 ±1.0 mm (14.8 ±0.04 in) in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, the peak resultant acceleration at the location of the accelerometers at the head CG may not be less than 250 G or more than 300 G. The resultant acceleration vs. time history curve shall be unimodal; oscillations occurring after the main pulse must be less than 10 percent of the peak resultant acceleration. The lateral acceleration shall not exceed 15 G (zero to peak).
              (c) Head test procedure. The test procedure for the head is as follows:
              (1) Soak the head assembly in a controlled environment at any temperature between 18.9 and 25.6 °C (66 and 78 °F) and a relative humidity from 10 to 70 percent for at least four hours prior to a test.
              (2) Prior to the test, clean the impact surface of the skin and the impact plate surface with isopropyl alcohol, trichloroethane, or an equivalent. The skin of the head must be clean and dry for testing.
              (3) Suspend and orient the head assembly as shown in Figure T1. The lowest point on the forehead must be 376.0 ±1.0 mm (14.8 ±0.04 in) from the impact surface. The 1.57 mm (0.062 in) diameter holes located on either side of the dummy's head shall be used to ensure that the head is level with respect to the impact surface.

              (4) Drop the head assembly from the specified height by means that ensure a smooth, instant release onto a rigidly supported flat horizontal steel plate which is 50.8 mm (2 in) thick and 610 mm (24 in) square. The impact surface shall be clean, dry and have a micro finish of not less than 203.2 × 10−6 mm (8 micro inches) (RMS) and not more than 2032.0 × 10−6 mm (80 micro inches) (RMS).
              (5) Allow at least 2 hours between successive tests on the same head.
            
            
              § 572.173
              Neck assembly and test procedure.
              (a) The neck assembly for the purposes of this test consists of the assembly of components shown in drawing 420-2000 (incorporated by reference, see § 572.170).

              (b) When the head-neck assembly consisting of the head (drawing 420-1000), neck (drawing 420-2000), six-channel neck transducer (SA572-S11, included in drawing 420-0000), lower neck bracket assembly (drawing 420-2070), and either three uniaxial accelerometers (drawing SA572-S4, included in drawing 420-0000) or their mass equivalent installed in the head assembly as specified in drawing 420-1000 (all incorporated by reference, see § 572.170), is tested according to the test procedure in paragraph (c) of this section, it shall have the following characteristics:
              (1) Flexion. (i) Plane D, referenced in Figure T2, shall rotate in the direction of preimpact flight with respect to the pendulum's longitudinal centerline between 76 degrees and 90 degrees. During the time interval while the rotation is within the specified corridor, the peak moment, measured by the neck transducer (drawing SA572-S11, included in drawing 420-0000) (incorporated by reference, see § 572.170), about the occipital condyles may not be less than 50 N-m (36.9 ft-lbf) and not more than 62 N-m (45.7 ft-lbf). The positive moment shall decay for the first time to 10 N-m (7.4 ft-lbf) between 86 ms and 105 ms after time zero.

              (ii) The moment shall be calculated by the following formula: Moment (N-m) = My − (0.01778) × (FX).
              (iii) My is the moment about the y-axis in Newton-meters, FX is the shear force measured by the neck transducer (drawing SA572-S11) in Newtons, and 0.01778 is the distance in meters from the load center of the neck transducer to the occipital condyle.
              (2) Extension. (i) Plane D, referenced in Figure T3, shall rotate in the direction of preimpact flight with respect to the pendulum's longitudinal centerline between 96 degrees and 115 degrees. During the time interval while the rotation is within the specified corridor, the peak moment, measured by the neck transducer (drawing SA572-S11, included in drawing 420-0000) (incorporated by reference, see § 572.170), about the occipital condyles may not be more than −37 N-m (−27.3 ft-lbf) and not less than −46 N-m (−33.9 ft-lbf). The positive moment shall decay for the first time to −10 N-m (−7.4 ft-lbf) between 100 ms and 116 ms after time zero.

              (ii) The moment shall be calculated by the following formula: Moment (N-m) = My − (0.01778) × (FX).
              (iii) My is the moment about the y-axis in Newton-meters, FX is the shear force measured by the neck transducer (drawing SA572-S11, included in drawing 420-0000) (incorporated by reference, see § 572.170) in Newtons, and 0.01778 is the distance in meters from the load center of the neck transducer to the occipital condyle.
              (3) Time zero is defined as the time of initial contact between the pendulum striker plate and the honeycomb material. All data channels shall be at the zero level at this time.
              (c) Test procedure. The test procedure for the neck assembly is as follows:
              (1) Soak the neck assembly in a controlled environment at any temperature between 20.6 and 22.2 °C (69 and 72 °F) and a relative humidity between 10 and 70 percent for at least four hours prior to a test.
              (2) Torque the hex nut (drawing 420-2000, part 9000130) on the neck cable (drawing 420-2060) (both incorporated by reference, see § 572.170) to 0.9 ±0.2 N-m (8 ±2 in-lbf) before each test on the same neck.
              (3) Mount the head-neck assembly, defined in paragraph (b) of this section, on the pendulum described in Figure 22 of 49 CFR part 572 so that the leading edge of the lower neck bracket coincides with the leading edge of the pendulum as shown in Figure T2 for flexion tests and Figure T3 for extension tests.
              (4)(i) Release the pendulum and allow it to fall freely from a height to achieve an impact velocity of 6.1 ±0.12 m/s (20.0 ±0.4 ft/s) for flexion tests and 5.03 ±0.12 m/s (16.50 ±0.40 ft/s) for extension tests, measured by an accelerometer mounted on the pendulum as shown in Figure T2 at the instant of contact with the honeycomb.
              (ii) Stop the pendulum from the initial velocity with an acceleration vs. time pulse that meets the velocity change as specified below. Integrate the pendulum acceleration data channel to obtain the velocity vs. time curve:

              Thorax assembly and test procedure.
              (a) The thorax consists of the part of the torso assembly designated as the upper torso (drawing 420-3000) (incorporated by reference, see § 572.170).
              (b) When the anterior surface of the thorax of a completely assembled dummy (drawing 420-0000) (incorporated by reference, see § 572.170) is impacted by a test probe conforming to section 572.177 at 6.00 ±0.12 m/s (22.0 ±0.4 ft/s) according to the test procedure in paragraph (c) of this section:
              (1) Maximum sternum displacement (compression) relative to the spine, measured with chest deflection transducer (drawing SA572-T4, included in drawing 420-0000) (incorporated by reference, see § 572.170), must be not less than 37 mm (1.46 in) and not more than 46 mm (1.81 in). Within this specified compression corridor, the peak force, measured by the impact probe as defined in section 572.177 and calculated in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section, shall not be less than 2.0 kN (450 lbf) and not more than 2.45 kN (551 lbf). The peak force after 20 mm (0.79 in.) of sternum displacement but before reaching the minimum required 37 mm (1.46 in.) sternum displacement limit shall not exceed 2.52 kN (567 lbf).
              (2) The internal hysteresis of the ribcage in each impact as determined by the plot of force vs. deflection in paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be not less than 69 percent but not more than 85 percent. The hysteresis shall be calculated by determining the ratio of the area between the loading (from time zero to maximum deflection) and unloading portions (from maximum deflection to zero force) of the force deflection curve to the area under the loading portion of the curve.
              (3) The force shall be calculated by the product of the impactor mass and its measured deceleration.
              (c) Test Procedure. The test procedure for the thorax assembly is as follows:
              (1) The dummy is clothed in a form fitting cotton stretch above-the-elbow sleeved shirt and above-the-knees pants. The weight of the shirt and pants shall not exceed 0.14 kg (0.30 lb) each.
              (2) Torque the lumbar cable (drawing 420-4130) (incorporated by reference, see § 572.170) to 0.9 ±0.2 N-m (8 ±2 in-lbf) and set the lumbar adjustment angle to 12 degrees. Set the neck angle to 16 degrees.
              (3) Soak the dummy in a controlled environment at any temperature between 20.6 and 22.2 °C (69 and 72 °F) and a relative humidity between 10 and 70 percent for at least four hours prior to a test.
              (4) Seat and orient the dummy on a seating surface without back support as shown in Figure T4, with the limbs extended horizontally and forward, parallel to the midsagittal plane, the midsagittal plane vertical within ±1 degree and the ribs level in the anterior-posterior and lateral directions within ±0.5 degrees.
              (5) Establish the impact point at the chest midsagittal plane so that the impact point of the longitudinal centerline of the probe coincides with the midsagittal plane of the dummy within ±2.5 mm (0.1 in) and is 12.7 ±1.1 mm (0.5 ±0.04 in) below the horizontal-peripheral centerline of the No. 3 rib and is within 0.5 degrees of a horizontal line in the dummy's midsagittal plane.
              (6) Impact the thorax with the test probe so that at the moment of contact the probe's longitudinal centerline falls within 2 degrees of a horizontal line in the dummy's midsagittal plane.
              (7) Guide the test probe during impact so that there is no significant lateral, vertical, or rotational movement.

              (8) No suspension hardware, suspension cables, or any other attachments to the probe, including the velocity vane, shall make contact with the dummy during the test.
            
            
              § 572.175
              Upper and lower torso assemblies and torso flexion test procedure.
              (a) The test objective is to determine the stiffness of the molded lumbar assembly (drawing 420-4100), abdominal insert (drawing 420-4300), and chest flesh assembly (drawing 420-3560) on resistance to articulation between the upper torso assembly (drawing 420-3000) and lower torso assembly (drawing 420-4000) (all incorporated by reference, see § 572.170).
              (b) When the upper torso assembly of a seated dummy is subjected to a force continuously applied at the head to neck pivot pin level through a rigidly attached adaptor bracket as shown in Figure T5 according to the test procedure set out in paragraph (c) of this section:
              (1) The lumbar spine-abdomen-chest flesh assembly shall flex by an amount that permits the upper torso assembly to translate in angular motion relative to the vertical transverse plane 35 ±0.5 degrees at which time the force applied must be not less than 180 N (40.5 lbf) and not more than 250 N (56.2 lbf).
              (2) Upon removal of the force, the torso assembly must return to within 8 degrees of its initial position.
              (c) Test Procedure. The test procedure for the upper/lower torso assembly is as follows:
              (1) Torque the lumbar cable (drawing 420-4130) (incorporated by reference, see § 572.170) to 0.9 ±0.2 N-m (8 ±2 in-lbf) and set the lumbar adjustment angle to 12 degrees. Set the neck angle to 16 degrees.
              (2) Soak the dummy in a controlled environment at any temperature between 20.6 and 22.2 °C (69 and 72 °F) and a relative humidity between 10 and 70 percent for at least four hours prior to a test.
              (3) Assemble the complete dummy (with or without the legs below the femurs) and attach to the fixture in a seated posture as shown in Figure T5.
              (4) Secure the pelvis to the fixture at the pelvis instrument cavity rear face by threading four 1/4-inch cap screws into the available threaded attachment holes. Tighten the mountings so that the test material is rigidly affixed to the test fixture and the pelvic-lumbar joining surface is 18 degrees from horizontal and the legs are parallel with the test fixture.
              (5) Attach the loading adaptor bracket to the spine of the dummy as shown in Figure T5.
              (6) Inspect and adjust, if necessary, the seating of the abdominal insert within the pelvis cavity and with respect to the chest flesh, assuring that the chest flesh provides uniform fit and overlap with respect to the outside surface of the pelvis flesh.
              (7) Flex the dummy's upper torso three times between the vertical and until the torso reference frame, as shown in Figure T5, reaches 30 degrees from the vertical transverse plane. Bring the torso to vertical orientation and wait for 30 minutes before conducting the test. During the 30-minute waiting period, the dummy's upper torso shall be externally supported at or near its vertical orientation to prevent it from drooping.
              (8) Remove all external support and wait two minutes. Measure the initial orientation angle of the torso reference plane of the seated, unsupported dummy as shown in Figure T5. The initial orientation angle may not exceed 20 degrees.
              (9) Attach the pull cable and the load cell as shown in Figure T5.
              (10) Apply a tension force in the midsagittal plane to the pull cable as shown in Figure T5 at any upper torso deflection rate between 0.5 and 1.5 degrees per second, until the angle reference plane is at 35 ±0.5 degrees of flexion relative to the vertical transverse plane.
              (11) Continue to apply a force sufficient to maintain 35 ±0.5 degrees of flexion for 10 seconds, and record the highest applied force during the 10-second period.
              (12) Release all force at the attachment bracket as rapidly as possible, and measure the return angle with respect to the initial angle reference plane as defined in paragraph (c)(7) of this section three minutes after the release.

            (a) Each manufacturer shall furnish a report to the NHTSA for each defect in his vehicles or in his items of original or replacement equipment that he or the Administrator determines to be related to motor vehicle safety, and for each noncompliance with a motor vehicle safety standard in such vehicles or items of equipment which either he or the Administrator determines to exist.
            (b) Each report shall be submitted not more than 5 working days after a defect in a vehicle or item of equipment has been determined to be safety related, or a noncompliance with a motor vehicle safety standard has been determined to exist. At a minimum, information required by paragraphs (c)(1), (2), and (5) of this section shall be submitted in the initial report. The remainder of the information required by paragraph (c) of this section that is not available within the five-day period shall be submitted within 5 working days after the manufacturer has confirmed the accuracy of the information. In addition, each manufacturer shall amend information required by paragraphs (c)(2), (3), and (8)(i) or (ii) within 5 working days after it has new information that updates or corrects information that was previously reported. Each manufacturer submitting new information relative to a previously submitted report shall refer to the recall campaign number when a number has been assigned by the NHTSA.
            (c) Each manufacturer shall include in each report the information specified below.

            (1) The manufacturer's name: The full corporate or individual name of the fabricating manufacturer and any brand name or trademark owner of the vehicle or item of equipment shall be spelled out, except that such abbreviations as “Co.” or “Inc.”, and their foreign equivalents, and the first and middle initials of individuals, may be used. In the case of a defect or noncompliance decided to exist in an imported vehicle or item of equipment, the agency designated by the fabricating manufacturer pursuant to 49 U.S.C. section 30164(a) shall be also stated. If the fabricating manufacturer is a corporation that is controlled by another corporation that assumes responsibility for compliance with all requirements of this part the name of the controlling corporation may be used.
            (2) Identification of the vehicles or items of motor vehicle equipment potentially containing the defect or noncompliance, including a description of the manufacturer's basis for its determination of the recall population and a description of how the vehicles or items of equipment to be recalled differ from similar vehicles or items of equipment that the manufacturer has not included in the recall.
            (i) In the case of passenger cars, the identification shall be by the make, line, model year, the inclusive dates (month and year) of manufacture, and any other information necessary to describe the vehicles.
            (ii) In the case of vehicles other than passenger cars, the identification shall be by body style or type, inclusive dates (month and year) of manufacture and any other information necessary to describe the vehicles, such as GVWR or class for trucks, displacement (cc) for motorcycles, and number of passengers for buses.

            (iii) In the case of items of motor vehicle equipment, the identification shall be by the generic name of the component (tires, child seating systems, axles, etc.), part number (for tires, a range of tire identification numbers, as required by 49 CFR 574.5), size and function if applicable, the inclusive dates (month and year) of manufacture if available, brand (or trade) name, model name, model number, as applicable, and any other information necessary to describe the items.

            (iv) In the case of motor vehicles or items of motor vehicle equipment in which the component that contains the defect or noncompliance was manufactured by a different manufacturer from the reporting manufacturer, the reporting manufacturer shall identify the component and, if known, the component's country of origin (i.e. final place of manufacture or assembly), the manufacturer and/or assembler of the component by name, business address, and business telephone number. If the reporting manufacturer does not know the identity of the manufacturer of the component, it shall identify the entity from which it was obtained. If at the time of submission of the initial report, the reporting manufacturer does not know the country of origin of the component, the manufacturer shall ascertain the country of origin and submit a supplemental report with that information once it becomes available.
            (v) In the case of items of motor vehicle equipment, the manufacturer of the equipment shall identify by name, business address, and business telephone number every manufacturer that purchases the defective or noncomplying component for use or installation in new motor vehicles or new items of motor vehicle equipment.
            (3) The total number of vehicles or items of equipment potentially containing the defect or noncompliance, and where available the number of vehicles or items of equipment in each group identified pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
            (4) The percentage of vehicles or items of equipment specified pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section estimated to actually contain the defect or noncompliance.
            (5) A description of the defect or noncompliance, including both a brief summary and a detailed description, with graphic aids as necessary, of the nature and physical location (if applicable) of the defect or noncompliance. In addition, the manufacturer shall identify and describe the risk to motor vehicle safety reasonably related to the defect or noncompliance consistent with its evaluation of risk required by 49 CFR 577.5(f).
            (6) In the case of a defect, a chronology of all principal events that were the basis for the determination that the defect related to motor vehicle safety, including a summary of all warranty claims, field or service reports, and other information, with their dates of receipt.

            (7) In the case of a noncompliance, the test results and other information that the manufacturer considered in determining the existence of the noncompliance. The manufacturer shall identify the date of each test and observation that indicated that a noncompliance might or did exist.
            (8)(i) A description of the manufacturer's program for remedying the defect or noncompliance. This program shall include a plan for reimbursing an owner or purchaser who incurred costs to obtain a remedy for the problem addressed by the recall within a reasonable time in advance of the manufacturer's notification of owners, purchasers and dealers, in accordance with § 573.13 of this part. A manufacturer's plan may incorporate by reference a general reimbursement plan it previously submitted to NHTSA, together with information specific to the individual recall. Information required by § 573.13 that is not in a general reimbursement plan shall be submitted in the manufacturer's report to NHTSA under this section. If a manufacturer submits one or more general reimbursement plans, the manufacturer shall update each plan every two years, in accordance with § 573.13. The manufacturer's remedy program and reimbursement plans will be available for inspection by the public at NHTSA headquarters.
            (ii) The estimated date(s) on which it will begin sending notifications to owners, and to dealers and distributors, that there is a safety-related defect or noncompliance and that a remedy without charge will be available to owners, and the estimated date(s) on which it will complete such notifications (if different from the beginning date). If a manufacturer subsequently becomes aware that either the beginning or the completion dates reported to the agency for any of the notifications will be delayed by more than two weeks, it shall promptly advise the agency of the delay and the reasons therefore, and furnish a revised estimate.

            (iii) If a manufacturer intends to file a petition for an exemption from the recall requirements of the Act on the basis that a defect or noncompliance is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety, it shall notify NHTSA of that intention in its report to NHTSA of the defect or noncompliance under this section. If such a petition is filed and subsequently denied, the manufacturer shall provide the information required by paragraph (c)(8)(ii) of this section within five Federal government business days from the date the petition denial is published in the Federal Register.
            
            (iv) If a manufacturer advises NHTSA that it intends to file such a petition for exemption from the notification and remedy requirements on the grounds that the defect or noncompliance is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety, and does not do so within the 30-day period established by 49 CFR 556.4(c), the manufacturer must submit the information required by paragraph (c)(8)(ii) of this section no later than the end of that 30-day period.
            (9) In the case of a remedy program involving the replacement of tires, the manufacturer's program for remedying the defect or noncompliance shall:
            (i) Address how the manufacturer will assure that the entities replacing the tires are aware of the legal requirements related to recalls of tires established by 49 U.S.C. Chapter 301 and regulations thereunder. At a minimum, the manufacturer shall notify its owned stores and/or distributors, as well as all independent outlets that are authorized to replace the tires that are the subject of the recall, annually or for each individual recall that the manufacturer conducts, about the ban on the sale of new defective or noncompliant tires (49 CFR 573.11); the prohibition on the sale of new and used defective and noncompliant tires (49 CFR 573.12); and the duty to notify NHTSA of any sale of a new or used recalled tire for use on a motor vehicle (49 CFR 573.10). For tire outlets that are manufacturer-owned or otherwise subject to the control of the manufacturer, the manufacturer shall also provide directions to comply with these statutory provisions and the regulations thereunder.

            (ii) Address how the manufacturer will prevent, to the extent reasonably within its control, the recalled tires from being resold for installation on a motor vehicle. At a minimum, the manufacturer shall include the following information, to be furnished to each tire outlet that it owns, or that is authorized to replace tires that are recalled, either annually or for each individual recall the manufacturer conducts:
            (A) Written directions to manufacturer-owned and other manufacturer-controlled outlets to alter the recalled tires permanently so that they cannot be used on vehicles. These shall include instructions on the means to render recalled tires unsuitable for resale for installation on motor vehicles and instructions to perform the incapacitation of each recalled tire, with the exception of any tires that are returned to the manufacturer pursuant to a testing program, within 24 hours of receipt of the recalled tire at the outlet. If the manufacturer has a testing program for recalled tires, these directions shall also include criteria for selecting recalled tires for testing and instructions for labeling those tires and returning them promptly to the manufacturer for testing.
            (B) Written guidance to all other outlets which are authorized to replace the recalled tires on how to alter the recalled tires promptly and permanently so that they cannot be used on vehicles.
            (C) A requirement that manufacturer-owned and other manufacturer-controlled outlets report to the manufacturer, either on a monthly basis or within 30 days of the deviation, the number of recalled tires removed from vehicles by the outlet that have not been rendered unsuitable for resale for installation on a motor vehicle within the specified time frame (other than those returned for testing) and describe any such failure to act in accordance with the manufacturer's plan;
            (iii) Address how the manufacturer will limit, to the extent reasonably within its control, the disposal of the recalled tires in landfills and, instead, channel them into a category of positive reuse (shredding, crumbling, recycling, and recovery) or another alternative beneficial non-vehicular use. At a minimum, the manufacturer shall include the following information, to be furnished to each tire outlet that it owns or that is authorized to replace tires that are recalled, either annually or for each individual recall that the manufacturer conducts:
            (A)(1) Written directions that require manufacturer-owned and other manufacturer-controlled outlets either:
            (i) To ship recalled tires to one or more locations designated by the manufacturer as part of the program or allow the manufacturer to collect and dispose of the recalled tires; or
            (ii) To ship recalled tires to a location of their own choosing, provided that they comply with applicable state and local laws and regulations regarding disposal of tires.
            (2) Under option (c)(9)(iii)(A)(1)(ii) of this section, the directions must also include further direction and guidance on how to limit the disposal of recalled tires in landfills and, instead, channel them into a category of positive reuse (shredding, crumbling, recycling, and recovery) or another alternative beneficial non-vehicular use.
            (B)(1) Written guidance that authorizes all other outlets that are authorized to replace the recalled tires either:
            (i) To ship recalled tires to one or more locations designated by the manufacturer or allow the manufacturer to collect and dispose of the recalled tires; or
            (ii) To ship recalled tires to a location of their own choosing, provided that they comply with applicable state and local laws and regulations regarding disposal of tires.
            (2) Under option (c)(9)(iii)(B)(1)(ii) of this section, the manufacturer must also include further guidance on how to limit the disposal of recalled tires in landfills and, instead, channel them into a category of positive reuse (shredding, crumbling, recycling, and recovery) or another alternative beneficial non-vehicular use.

            (C) A requirement that manufacturer-owned and other manufacturer-controlled outlets report to the manufacturer, on a monthly basis or within 30 days of the deviation, the number of recalled tires disposed of in violation of applicable state and local laws and regulations, and describe any such failure to act in accordance with the manufacturer's plan; and
            
            (D) A description of the manufacturer's program for disposing of the recalled tires that are returned to the manufacturer or collected by the manufacturer from the retail outlets, including, at a minimum, statements that the returned tires will be disposed of in compliance with applicable state and local laws and regulations regarding disposal of tires, and will be channeled, insofar as possible, into a category of positive reuse (shredding, crumbling, recycling and recovery) or another alternative beneficial non-vehicular use, instead of being disposed of in landfills.
            (iv) To the extent that the manufacturer wishes to limit the frequency of shipments of recalled tires, it must specify both a minimum time period and a minimum weight for the shipments and provide that shipments may be made at whichever minimum occurs first.
            (v) Written directions required under this paragraph to be furnished to a manufacturer-owned or controlled outlet shall be sent to the person in charge of each outlet by first-class mail or by electronic means, such as FAX transmissions or e-mail, with further instructions to notify all employees of the outlet who are involved with removal, rendering unsuitable for use, or disposition of recalled tires of the applicable requirements and procedures.
            (vi) Manufacturers must implement the plans for disposition of recalled tires that they file with NHTSA pursuant to this paragraph. The failure of a manufacturer to implement its plan in accordance with its terms constitutes a violation of the Safety Act.
            (10) A representative copy of all notices, bulletins, and other communications that relate directly to the defect or noncompliance and are sent to more than one manufacturer, distributor, dealer or purchaser. These copies shall be submitted to NHTSA's Recall Management Division (NVS-215) (RMD), not later than 5 days after they are initially sent to manufacturers, distributors, dealers, or purchasers. Submission shall be made pursuant to § 573.9 of this part.
            (11) The manufacturer's campaign number, if not identical to the identification number assigned by NHTSA.

            § 573.13
            Reimbursement for pre-notification remedies.
            (a) Pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 30120(d) and § 573.6(c)(8)(i) of this part, this section specifies requirements for a manufacturer's plan (including general reimbursement plans submitted pursuant to § 573.6(c)(8)(i)) to reimburse owners and purchasers for costs incurred for remedies in advance of the manufacturer's notification of safety-related defects and noncompliance with Federal motor vehicle safety standards under subsection (b) or (c) of 49 U.S.C. 30118.
            (b) Definitions. The following definitions apply to this section:
            (1) Booster seat means either a backless child restraint system or a belt-positioning seat.
            (2) Claimant means a person who seeks reimbursement for the costs of a pre-notification remedy for which he or she paid.
            (3) Pre-notification remedy means a remedy that is performed on a motor vehicle or item of replacement equipment for a problem subsequently addressed by a notification under subsection (b) or (c) of 49 U.S.C. 30118 and that is obtained during the period for reimbursement specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
            (4) Other child restraint system means all child restraint systems as defined in 49 CFR 571.213 S4 not included within the categories of rear-facing infant seat or booster seat.
            (5) Rear-facing infant seat means a child restraint system that is designed to position a child to face only in the direction opposite to the normal direction of travel of the motor vehicle.
            (6) Warranty means a warranty as defined in § 579.4(c) of this chapter.
            (c) The manufacturer's plan shall specify a period for reimbursement, as follows:
            (1) The beginning date shall be no later than a date based on the underlying basis for the recall determined as follows:
            (i) For a noncompliance with a Federal motor vehicle safety standard, the date shall be the date of the first test or observation by either NHTSA or the manufacturer indicating that a noncompliance may exist.
            (ii) For a safety-related defect that is determined to exist following the opening of an Engineering Analysis (EA) by NHTSA's Office of Defects Investigation (ODI), the date shall be the date the EA was opened, or one year before the date of the manufacturer's notification to NHTSA pursuant to § 573.6 of this part, whichever is earlier.
            (iii) For a safety-related defect that is determined to exist in the absence of the opening of an EA, the date shall be one year before the date of the manufacturer's notification to NHTSA pursuant to § 573.6 of this part.
            (2) The ending date shall be no earlier than:
            (i) For motor vehicles, 10 calendar days after the date on which the manufacturer mailed the last of its notifications to owners pursuant to part 577 of this chapter.
            (ii) For replacement equipment, 10 calendar days after the date on which the manufacturer mailed the last of its notifications to owners pursuant to part 577 of this chapter (where applicable) or 30 days after the conclusion of the manufacturer's initial efforts to provide public notice of the existence of the defect or noncompliance pursuant to § 577.7, whichever is later.
            (d) The manufacturer's plan shall provide for reimbursement of costs for pre-notification remedies, subject to the conditions established in the plan. The following conditions and no others may be established in the plan.
            (1) The plan may exclude reimbursement for costs incurred within the period during which the manufacturer's original or extended warranty would have provided for a free repair of the problem addressed by the recall, without any payment by the consumer unless a franchised dealer or authorized representative of the manufacturer denied warranty coverage or the repair made under warranty did not remedy the problem addressed by the recall. The exclusion based on an extended warranty may be applied only when the manufacturer provided written notice of the terms of the extended warranty to owners.
            (2)(i) For a motor vehicle, the plan may exclude reimbursement:
            (A) If the pre-notification remedy was not of the same type (repair, replacement, or refund of purchase price) as the recall remedy;
            (B) If the pre-notification remedy did not address the defect or noncompliance that led to the recall or a manifestation of the defect or noncompliance; or
            (C) If the pre-notification remedy was not reasonably necessary to correct the defect or noncompliance that led to the recall or a manifestation of the defect or noncompliance.
            (ii) However, the plan may not require that the pre-notification remedy be identical to the remedy elected by the manufacturer pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 30120(a)(1)(A).

            (3)(i) For replacement equipment, the plan may exclude reimbursement:
            
            (A) If the pre-notification remedy did not address the defect or noncompliance that led to the recall or a manifestation of the defect or noncompliance;
            (B) If the pre-notification remedy was not reasonably necessary to correct the defect or noncompliance that led to the recall or a manifestation of the defect and noncompliance; or

            (C) In the case of a child restraint system that was replaced, if the replacement child restraint is not the same type (i.e., rear-facing infant seat, booster seat, or other child restraint system) as the restraint that was the subject of the recall.
            (ii) However, the plan may not require that the pre-notification remedy be identical to the remedy elected by the manufacturer pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 30120(a)(1)(B).
            (4) The plan may exclude reimbursement if the claimant did not submit adequate documentation to the manufacturer at an address or location designated pursuant to § 573.13(f). The plan may require, at most, that the following documentation be submitted:
            (i) Name and mailing address of the claimant;
            (ii) Identification of the product that was recalled:
            (A) For motor vehicles, the vehicle make, model, model year, and vehicle identification number of the vehicle;
            (B) For replacement equipment other than child restraint systems and tires, a description of the equipment, including model and size as appropriate;
            (C) For child restraint systems, a description of the restraint, including the type (rear-facing infant seat, booster seat, or other child restraint system) and the model; or
            (D) For tires, the model and size;
            (iii) Identification of the recall (either the NHTSA recall number or the manufacturer's recall number);
            (iv) Identification of the owner or purchaser of the recalled motor vehicle or replacement equipment at the time that the pre-notification remedy was obtained;
            (v) A receipt for the pre-notification remedy, which may be an original or copy:
            (A) If the reimbursement sought is for a repair, the manufacturer may require that the receipt indicate that the repair addressed the defect or noncompliance that led to the recall or a manifestation of the defect or noncompliance, and state the total amount paid for the repair of that problem. Itemization of a receipt of the amount for parts, labor, other costs and taxes, may not be required unless it is unclear on the face of the receipt that the repair for which reimbursement is sought addressed only the pre-notification remedy relating to the pertinent defect or noncompliance or manifestation thereof.
            (B) If the reimbursement sought is for the replacement of a vehicle part or an item of replacement equipment, the manufacturer may require that the receipt identify the item and state the total amount paid for the item that replaced the defective or noncompliant item;
            (vi) In the case of items of replacement equipment that were replaced, documentation that the claimant or a relative thereof (with relationship stated) owned the recalled item. Such documentation could consist of:
            (A) An invoice or receipt showing purchase of the recalled item of replacement equipment;
            (B) If the claimant sent a registration card for a recalled child restraint system or tire to the manufacturer, a statement to that effect;
            (C) A copy of the registration card for the recalled child restraint system or tire; or
            (D) Documentation demonstrating that the claimant had replaced a recalled tire that was on a vehicle that he, she, or a relative owned; and
            (vii) If the pre-notification remedy was obtained at a time when the vehicle or equipment could have been repaired or replaced at no charge under a manufacturer's original or extended warranty program, documentation indicating that the manufacturer's dealer or authorized facility either refused to remedy the problem addressed by the recall under the warranty or that the warranty repair did not correct the problem addressed by the recall.
            (e) The manufacturer's plan shall specify the amount of costs to be reimbursed for a pre-notification remedy.
            (1) For motor vehicles:
            
            (i) The amount of reimbursement shall not be less than the lesser of:
            (A) The amount paid by the owner for the remedy, or
            (B) The cost of parts for the remedy, plus associated labor at local labor rates, miscellaneous fees such as disposal of waste, and taxes. Costs for parts may be limited to the manufacturer's list retail price for authorized parts.
            (ii) Any associated costs, including, but not limited to, taxes or disposal of wastes, may not be limited.
            (2) For replacement equipment:
            (i) The amount of reimbursement ordinarily would be the amount paid by the owner for the replacement item.
            (ii) In cases in which the owner purchased a brand or model different from the item of motor vehicle equipment that was the subject of the recall, the manufacturer may limit the amount of reimbursement to the retail list price of the defective or noncompliant item that was replaced, plus taxes.
            (iii) If the item of motor vehicle equipment was repaired, the provisions of paragraph (e)(1) of this section apply.
            (f) The manufacturer's plan shall identify an address to which claimants may mail reimbursement clams and may identify franchised dealer(s) and authorized facilities to which claims for reimbursement may be submitted directly.
            (g) The manufacturer (either directly or through its designated dealer or facility) shall act upon requests for reimbursement as follows:
            (1) The manufacturer shall act upon a claim for reimbursement within 60 days of its receipt. If the manufacturer denies the claim, the manufacturer must send a notice to the claimant within 60 days of receipt of the claim that includes a clear, concise statement of the reasons for the denial.
            (2) If a claim for reimbursement is incomplete when originally submitted, the manufacturer shall advise the claimant within 60 days of receipt of the claim of the documentation that is needed and offer an opportunity to resubmit the claim with complete documentation.
            (h) Reimbursement shall be in the form of a check or cash from the manufacturer or a designated dealer or facility.
            (i) The manufacturer shall make its reimbursement plan available to the public upon request.
            (j) Any disputes over the denial in whole or in part of a claim for reimbursement shall be resolved between the claimant and the manufacturer. NHTSA will not mediate or resolve any disputes regarding eligibility for, or the amount of, reimbursement.
            (k) Each manufacturer shall implement each plan for reimbursement in accordance with this section and the terms of the plan.
            (l) Nothing in this section requires that a manufacturer provide reimbursement in connection with a fraudulent claim for reimbursement.
            (m) A manufacturer's plan may provide that it will not apply to recalls based solely on noncompliant or defective labels.
            (n) The requirement that reimbursement for a pre-notification remedy be provided to an owner does not apply if, in the case of a motor vehicle or replacement equipment other than a tire, it was bought by the first purchaser more than 10 calendar years before notice is given under 49 U.S.C. 30118(c) or an order is issued under section 49 U.S.C. 30118(b). In the case of a tire, this period shall be 5 calendar years.

            § 573.14
            Accelerated remedy program.
            (a) An accelerated remedy program is one in which the manufacturer expands the sources of replacement parts needed to remedy the defect or noncompliance, or expands the number of authorized repair facilities beyond those facilities that usually and customarily provide remedy work for the manufacturer, or both.
            (b) The Administrator may require a manufacturer to accelerate its remedy program if:
            (1) The Administrator finds that there is a risk of serious injury or death if the remedy program is not accelerated;

            (2) The Administrator finds that acceleration of the remedy program can be reasonably achieved by expanding the sources of replacement parts, expanding the number of authorized repair facilities, or both; and
            (3) The Administrator determines that the manufacturer's remedy program is not likely to be capable of completion within a reasonable time.
            (c) The Administrator, in deciding whether to require the manufacturer to accelerate a remedy program and what to require the manufacturer to do, will consult with the manufacturer and may consider a wide range of information, including, but not limited to, the following: the manufacturer's initial or revised report submitted under § 573.6(c), information from the manufacturer, information from other manufacturers and suppliers, information from any source related to the availability and implementation of the remedy, and the seriousness of the risk of injury or death associated with the defect or noncompliance.
            (d) As required by the Administrator, an accelerated remedy program shall include the manner of acceleration (expansion of the sources of replacement parts, expansion of the number of authorized repair facilities, or both), may require submission of a plan, may identify the parts to be provided and/or the sources of those parts, may require the manufacturer to notify the agency and owners about any differences among different sources or brands of parts, may require the manufacturer to identify additional authorized repair facilities, and may specify additional owner notifications related to the program. The Administrator may also require the manufacturer to include a program to provide reimbursement to owners who incur costs to obtain the accelerated remedy.

            (e) Under an accelerated remedy program, the remedy that is provided shall be equivalent to the remedy that would have been provided if the manufacturer's remedy program had not been accelerated. The replacement parts used to remedy the defect or noncompliance shall be reasonably equivalent to those that would have been used if the remedy program were not accelerated. The service procedures shall be reasonably equivalent. In the case of tires, all replacement tires shall be the same size and type as the defective or noncompliant tire, shall be suitable for use on the owner's vehicle, shall have the same or higher load index and speed rating, and, for passenger car tires, shall have the same or better rating in each of the three categories enumerated in the Uniform Tire Quality Grading System. See 49 CFR 575.104. In the case of child restraints systems, all replacements shall be of the same type (e.g., rear-facing infant seats with a base, rear-facing infant seats without a base, convertible seats (designed for use in both rear- and forward-facing modes), forward-facing only seats, high back booster seats with a five-point harness, and belt positioning booster seats) and the same overall quality.
            (f) In those instances where the accelerated remedy program provides that an owner may obtain the remedy from a source other than the manufacturer or its dealers or authorized facilities by paying for the remedy and/or its installation, the manufacturer shall reimburse the owner for the cost of obtaining the remedy as specified on paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(3) of this section. Under these circumstances, the accelerated remedy program shall include, to the extent required by the Administrator:
            (1) A description of the remedy and costs that are eligible for reimbursement, including identification of the equipment and/or parts and labor for which reimbursement is available;
            (2) Identification, with specificity or as a class, of the alternative repair facilities at which reimbursable repairs may be performed, including an explanation of how to arrange for service at those facilities; and

            (3) Other provisions assuring appropriate reimbursement that are consistent with those set forth in § 573.13, including, but not limited to, provisions regarding the procedures and needed documentation for making a claim for reimbursement, the amount of costs to be reimbursed, the office to which claims for reimbursement shall be submitted, the requirements on manufacturers for acting on claims for reimbursement, and the methods by which owners can obtain information about the program.
            
            (g) In response to a manufacturer's request, the Administrator may authorize a manufacturer to terminate its accelerated remedy program if the Administrator concludes that the manufacturer can meet all future demands for the remedy through its own sources in a prompt manner. If required by the Administrator, the manufacturer shall provide notice of the termination of the program to all owners of unremedied vehicles and equipment at least 30 days in advance of the termination date, in a form approved by the Administrator.
            (h) Each manufacturer shall implement any accelerated remedy program required by the Administrator according to the terms of that program.

            Public availability of motor vehicle recall information.
            (a) General—Manufacturers that have manufactured for sale, sold, offered for sale, introduced or delivered for introduction in interstate commerce, or imported into the United States 25,000 or more light vehicles or 5,000 or more motorcycles in the current calendar year or the prior calendar year shall make motor vehicle safety recall information applicable to the vehicles they manufactured available to the public on the Internet. The information shall be in a format that is searchable by vehicle make and model and vehicle identification number (VIN), that preserves consumer privacy, and that includes information about each recall that has not been completed for each vehicle.
            (b) Specific requirements—The system that manufacturers use to provide the information as specified in paragraph (a) of this section must also meet the following requirements:
            (1) Be free of charge and not require users to register or submit information, other than a make, model, and a VIN, in order to obtain information on recalls;
            (2) Have a hyperlink (Internet link) to it conspicuously placed on the manufacturer's main United States' Web page;
            (3) Not include sales or marketing messages with the page for entering a make, model, and VIN, or with the page where the results are displayed;
            (4) Allow users to search a vehicle's recall remedy status, and report that a recall has not been completed on that vehicle, as soon as possible and no later than the date when the manufacturer includes that vehicle on its list compiled for purposes of 49 CFR 573.8(a);
            (5) Ensure safety recalls subject to paragraph (b)(4) of this section are conspicuously placed first, before any other information that is displayed;
            (6) For vehicles that have been identified as covered by a safety recall, but for which the recall remedy is not yet available, state that the vehicle is covered by the safety recall and that the remedy is not yet available;
            (7) Be updated at least once every seven (7) calendar days. The date of the last update must display on both the page for entering the make, model, and VIN to search for recall completion information and the results page;
            (8) Where the search results in identification of a recall that has not been completed, state the recall campaign number NHTSA assigned to the matter; state the date the defect or noncompliance was reported pursuant to Part 573; provide a brief description of the safety defect or noncompliance, including the risk to safety, identified in the manufacturer's information report or owner notification letter filed pursuant to this part; and describe the remedy program;
            (9) At a minimum, include recall completion information for each vehicle covered by any safety recall for which the owner notification campaign started at any time within the previous fifteen (15) calendar years;
            (10) State the earliest date for which recall completion information is available, either on the search page or on the results page, and provide information for all owner notification campaigns after that date;
            (11) Instruct the user to contact the manufacturer if the user has questions or wishes to question the accuracy of any information, and provide a hyperlink or other contact information for doing so;

            (12) Ensure, through adherence with technical specifications that NHTSA makes available through a secure area of its Web site http://www.safercar.gov/Vehicle + Manufacturers/RecallsPortal,
              the secure electronic transfer of the recall information and data required to be made publicly available by this section, to NHTSA for its use in displaying that information and data on its Web sites or other public portals.

            Editorial Note:

            An interpretation of manufacturer's designee issued by NHTSA and published at 36 FR 9780, May 28, 1971, provides as follows:
            
            “A request for an interpretation has been received from the Rubber Manufacturers Association asking that it be made clear that, under the Tire Identification and Recordkeeping Regulation (part 574), particularly §§ 574.7 and 574.8, only the tire manufacturer, brand name owner, or retreader may designate a third party to provide the necessary recording forms or to maintain the records required by the regulation.
            “Another person has requested an interpretation concerning the questions whether: (1) A tire manufacturer, brand name owner or retreader may designate one or more persons to be its designee for the purpose of maintaining the information, (2) an independent distributor or dealer may select a designee for the retention of the manufacturer's records, provided the manufacturer approves the designation, and (3) the independent distributor or dealer may seek administrative relief in the event he believes the information retained by the manufacturer is being used to his detriment.

            “Under section 113(f) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1402(f) and part 574, it is the tire manufacturer who has the ultimate responsibility for maintaining the records of first purchasers. Therefore, it is the tire manufacturer or his designee who must maintain these records. The term designee, as used in the regulation, was not intended to preclude multiple designees; if the tire manufacturer desires, he may designate more than one person to maintain the required information. Furthermore, neither the Act nor the regulation prohibits the distributor or dealer from being the manufacturer's designee nor do they prohibit a distributor or dealer from selecting someone to be the manufacturer's designee provided the manufacturer approves of the selection.

            “With respect to the possibility of manufacturers using the maintained information to the detriment of a distributor or dealer, the NHTSA will of course investigate claims by distributors or dealers of alleged misconduct and, if the maintained information is being misused, take appropriate action.
            “Issued under the authority of sections 103, 113, and 119 of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, 15 U.S.C. 1392, 1402, and 1407, and the delegation of authority at 49 CFR 1.51.”

            § 574.5
            Tire identification requirements.
            (a) Tire identification number (TIN) labeling requirement—(1) New tires. Each new tire manufacturer must conspicuously label on one sidewall of each tire it manufactures, except non-pneumatic tires or non-pneumatic tire assemblies, by permanently molding into or onto the sidewall, in the manner and location specified in Figure 1, a TIN consisting of 13 symbols and containing the information set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section. NOTE: The Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards may have more specific TIN marking requirements for some tires. See 49 CFR part 571.
            (2) Retreaded tires. Each tire retreader must conspicuously label at least one sidewall of each tire it retreads by permanently molding or branding into or onto the sidewall, in the manner and location specified by Figure 2, a TIN consisting of seven symbols and containing the information set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(3) of this section.
            (3) Non-pneumatic tires and non-pneumatic tire assemblies. Each manufacturer of a non-pneumatic tire or non-pneumatic tire assembly must permanently mold, stamp, or otherwise permanently mark into or onto at least one side of the non-pneumatic tire or non-pneumatic tire assembly a TIN consisting of 13 symbols and containing the information set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section.
            (4) Tires for mileage-contract purchasers. Manufacturers or retreaders of tires exclusively for mileage-contract purchasers may, instead of meeting any other requirements of this section, permanently mold into or onto the tire sidewall in lettering at least 6 mm (0.25 inch) high the phrase “for mileage contract use only”.
            (5) Optional phase-out of two-symbol plant code. NHTSA will assign to tire manufacturers who were previously assigned a plant code consisting of two symbols a new three-symbol plant code to replace each two-symbol plant code. A manufacturer may continue to use a previously assigned two-symbol plant code until April 13, 2025. Manufacturers who use a two-symbol plant code must comply with paragraph (g) of this section in lieu of the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section. Retreaders may also optionally comply with paragraph (g) of this section in lieu of paragraph (b) of this section until April 13, 2025.
            (b) TIN content requirements—(1) Plant code. The plant code, consisting of three symbols, must be the first group of the TIN. The plant code represents the identity of the new tire manufacturer or retreader. The plant code is assigned to the manufacturer or retreader by NHTSA upon request. See § 574.6.
            (2) Manufacturer's code. The manufacturer's code, consisting of six symbols, is the second group of the TIN for all new tires, but it cannot be used for retreaded tires. The manufacturer's code must be located between the plant code and the date code as shown in Figure 1. For new tires, the manufacturer's code may be used as a descriptive code for the purpose of identifying significant characteristics of the tire or to identify the brand name owner. For a new non-pneumatic tire or a non-pneumatic tire assembly, the manufacturer's code must identify the non-pneumatic tire identification code. Each manufacturer must maintain a detailed record of each manufacturer's code it uses with the corresponding tire size, tire characteristic, brand name owner, and non-pneumatic tire identification code as applicable and their respective meanings, which it must provide to NHTSA upon request.
            (3) Date code. The date code, consisting of four numerical symbols, is the final group. The date code must identify the week and year of manufacture. The first and second symbols of the date code must identify the week of the year by using “01” for the first full calendar week in each year, “02” for the second full calendar week, and so on. The calendar week runs from Sunday through the following Saturday. The final week of each year may include no more than six days of the following year. The third and fourth symbols of the date code must identify the last two digits of the year of manufacture. For example, 0109 means the tire was manufactured in the first full calendar week of 2009, or the week beginning on Sunday, January 4, 2009, and ending on Saturday, January 10, 2009. The date code must be positioned as shown in Figures 1 or 2 for new tires and retreaded tires, respectively.
            (c) Retreaded tire mark. The symbol “R” must be used to identify retreaded tires, and must be marked at the time of TIN marking in a location specified in Figure 2. The “R” is not part of the TIN.
            (d) Method of marking. (1) At the option of the manufacturer or retreader, the information contained in paragraph (b)(3) of this section may, instead of being permanently molded, be laser etched into or onto the sidewall in the location specified in Figures 1 or 2, respectively, during the manufacturing process of the tire and not later than 24 hours after the tire is removed from the mold.
            (2) The labeling for a non-pneumatic tire or a non-pneumatic tire assembly must be in the manner specified in Figure 1 and positioned on the non-pneumatic tire or non-pneumatic tire assembly such that it is not placed on the tread or the outermost edge of the tire and is not obstructed by any portion of the non-pneumatic rim or wheel center member designated for use with that non-pneumatic tire in S4.4 of Standard No. 129 (49 CFR 571.129).
            (e) The DOT symbol. (1) The DOT symbol constitutes a certification that the marked tire conforms to an applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard.
            (2) If required, a manufacturer or retreader must place the DOT symbol as shown and positioned relative to the TIN in Figure 1 for new tires and as shown in Figure 2 for retreaded tires.
            (3) The DOT symbol must not appear on tires to which no Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard is applicable, except that retreaders of tires for use on motor vehicles other than passenger cars may, prior to retreading, remove the DOT symbol from the sidewall or allow it to remain on the sidewall, at the retreader's option.
            (f) Authorized symbols. The only symbols that manufacturers and retreaders are allowed to use in the tire identification number are: A, B, C, D, E, F, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, R, T, U, V, W, X, Y, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 0.
            (g) Old TIN content requirement. The following requirements are applicable to tire manufacturers who were previously assigned two-symbol plant codes by NHTSA and to retreaders. A new tire manufacturer who continues to use a previously assigned two-symbol plant code in place of a new three-symbol plant code and a retreader may optionally comply with this paragraph instead of paragraph (b) of this section until April 13, 2025.
            (1) First grouping. The plant code, consisting of two symbols, must be the first group of the TIN. The plant code represents the identity of the new tire manufacturer and was previously assigned to the manufacturer by NHTSA.
            (2) Second grouping. For new tires, the second group, consisting of no more than two symbols, must be used to identify the tire size. For a non-pneumatic tire or non-pneumatic tire assembly, the second group, consisting of no more than two symbols, must be used to identify the non-pneumatic tire identification code. For retreaded tires, the second group, consisting of no more than two symbols, must identify the retread matrix in which the tire was processed or a tire size code if a matrix was not used to process the retreaded tire. Each new tire manufacturer and retreader must maintain a record of each symbol used, with the corresponding matrix or tire size, which it must provide to NHTSA upon request.
            (3) Third grouping. The third group, consisting of no more than four symbols, may be used at the option of the manufacturer or retreader as a descriptive code for the purpose of identifying significant characteristics of the tire. However, if the tire is manufactured for a brand name owner, one of the functions of the third grouping must be to identify the brand name owner. Each manufacturer or retreader who uses the third grouping must maintain a detailed record of any descriptive brand name owner code used, which it must provide to NHTSA upon request.
            (4) Fourth grouping. The date code, consisting of four numerical symbols, is the final group. The date code must identify the week and year of manufacture. The first and second symbols of the date code must identify the week of the year by using “01” for the first full calendar week in each year, “02” for the second full calendar week, and so on. The calendar week runs from Sunday through the following Saturday. The final week of each year may include no more than six days of the following year. The third and fourth symbols of the date code must identify the last two digits of the year of manufacture. For example, 0109 means the tire was manufactured in the first full calendar week of 2009, or the week beginning on Sunday, January 4, 2009, and ending on Saturday, January 10, 2009. The date code must be positioned as shown in Figures 1 or 2 for new tires and retreaded tires, respectively.

              § 575.6
              Requirements.
              (a)(1) At the time a motor vehicle is delivered to the first purchaser for purposes other than resale, the manufacturer of that vehicle shall provide the Uniform Tire Quality Grading information required by § 575.104(d)(1)(iii) in the owner's manual of each vehicle it produces. The vehicle manufacturer shall also provide to the purchaser, in writing and in the English language, the information specified in § 575.103 of this part that is applicable to that vehicle. The information provided with a vehicle may contain more than one table, but the document must either:
              (i) Clearly and unconditionally indicate which of the tables apply to the vehicle with which it is provided, or

              (ii) Contain a statement on its cover referring the reader to the vehicle certification label for specific information concerning which of the tables apply to that vehicle. If the manufacturer chooses option in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, the vehicle certification label shall include such specific information.
              
              
                Example 1.
                Manufacturer X furnishes a document containing several tables that apply to various groups of vehicles that it produces. The document contains the following notation on its front page: “The information that applies to this vehicle is contained in Table 5.” That notation satisfies the requirement.
              
              
                Example 2.

                Manufacturer Y furnishes a document containing several tables as in Example 1, with the following notation on its front page:
                
                “Information applies as follows:
                Model P. Regular cab, 135 in. (3,430 mm) wheel base—Table 1.
                Model P. Club cab, 142 in. (3,607 mm) wheel base—Table 2.
                Model Q—Table 3.”
                
                This notation does not satisfy the requirement, since it is conditioned on the model or the equipment of the vehicle with which the document is furnished, and therefore additional information is required to select the proper table.
              
              

              (2)(i) At the time a motor vehicle manufactured on or after September 1, 1990 is delivered to the first purchaser for purposes other than resale, the manufacturer shall provide to the purchaser, in writing in the English language and not less than 10 point type, the following statement in the owner's manual, or, if there is no owner's manual, on a one-page document:
              
              
                
                If you believe that your vehicle has a defect which could cause a crash or could cause injury or death, you should immediately inform the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in addition to notifying [INSERT NAME OF MANUFACTURER].
                If NHTSA receives similar complaints, it may open an investigation, and if it finds that a safety defect exists in a group of vehicles, it may order a recall and remedy campaign. However, NHTSA cannot become involved in individual problems between you, your dealer, or [INSERT NAME OF MANUFACTURER].

                To contact NHTSA, you may call the Vehicle Safety Hotline toll-free at 1-888-327-4236 (TTY: 1-800-424-9153); go to http://www.safercar.gov; or write to: Administrator, NHTSA, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. You can also obtain other information about motor vehicle safety from http://www.safercar.gov.
                
              
              
              (ii) The manufacturer shall specify in the table of contents of the owner's manual the location of the statement in 575.6(a)(2)(i). The heading in the table of contents shall state “Reporting Safety Defects.”

              (3) For vehicles manufactured prior to September 1, 2000, at the time a motor vehicle is delivered to the first purchaser for purposes other than resale, the manufacturer of that vehicle shall provide the purchaser, in writing and in the English language, the information specified in §§ 575.103 and 575.104 of this part that is applicable to that vehicle and its tires. The document provided with a vehicle may contain more than one table, but the document must either clearly and unconditionally indicate which of the tables apply to the vehicle with which it is provided, or contain a statement on its cover referring the reader to the vehicle certification label for specific information concerning which of the tables apply to that vehicle. If the manufacturer chooses option (a)(2) of this section, the vehicle certification label shall include such specific information.
              
              
                Example 1.
                Manufacturer X furnishes a document containing several tables, which apply to various groups of vehicles that it produces. The document contains the following notation on its front page: “The information that applies to this vehicle is contained in Table 5.” The notation satisfies the requirement.
              
              
                Example 2.
                Manufacturer Y furnishes a document containing several tables as in Example 1, with the following notation on its front page: Information applies as follows:
                Model P, 6-cylinder engine—Table 1.
                Model P, 8-cylinder engine—Table 2.
                Model Q—Table 3.
                This notation does not satisfy the requirement, since it is conditioned on the model or the equipment of the vehicle with which the document is furnished, and therefore additional information is required to select the proper table.
              
              
              (4) When a motor vehicle that has a GVWR of 10,000 pounds or less, except a motorcycle or low speed vehicle, and that is manufactured on or after September 1, 2005, is delivered to the first purchaser for purposes other than resale, the manufacturer shall provide to the purchaser, in writing in the English language and not less than 10 point type, a discussion of the items specified in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (v) of this section in the owner's manual, or, if there is no owner's manual, in a document:
              (i) Tire labeling, including a description and explanation of each marking on the tires provided with the vehicle, and information about the location of the Tire Identification Number (TIN);
              (ii) Recommended tire inflation pressure, including a description and explanation of:
              (A) Recommended cold tire inflation pressure,
              (B) The vehicle placard and tire inflation pressure label specified in Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 110 and their location in the vehicle,
              (C) Adverse safety consequences of underinflation (including tire failure), and
              (D) Measuring and adjusting air pressure to achieve proper inflation;
              (iii) Glossary of tire terminology, including “cold tire pressure,” “maximum inflation pressure,” and “recommended inflation pressure,” and all non-technical terms defined in S3 of FMVSS Nos. 110 & 139;
              (iv) Tire care, including maintenance and safety practices;
              (v) Vehicle load limits, including a description and explanation of:

              (A) Locating and understanding load limit information, total load capacity, seating capacity, towing capacity, and cargo capacity,
              
              (B) Calculating total and cargo load capacities with varying seating configurations including quantitative examples showing/illustrating how the vehicle's cargo and luggage capacity decreases as the combined number and size of occupants increases,
              (C) Determining compatibility of tire and vehicle load capabilities,
              (D) Adverse safety consequences of overloading on handling and stopping and on tires.
              (5) When a motor vehicle that has a GVWR of 10,000 pounds or less, except a motorcycle or low speed vehicle, and that is manufactured on or after September 1, 2005, is delivered to the first purchaser for purposes other than resale, the manufacturer shall provide to the purchaser, in writing in the English language and not less than 10 point type, the following verbatim statement, as applicable, in the owner's manual, or, if there is no owner's manual, in a document:
              (i) For vehicles except trailers: “Steps for Determining Correct Load Limit—
              (1) Locate the statement “The combined weight of occupants and cargo should never exceed XXX kg or XXX lbs.” on your vehicle's placard.
              (2) Determine the combined weight of the driver and passengers that will be riding in your vehicle.
              (3) Subtract the combined weight of the driver and passengers from XXX kg or XXX lbs.
              (4) The resulting figure equals the available amount of cargo and luggage load capacity. For example, if the “XXX” amount equals 1400 lbs. and there will be five 150 lb passengers in your vehicle, the amount of available cargo and luggage load capacity is 650 lbs. (1400-750 (5 × 150) = 650 lbs.)
              (5) Determine the combined weight of luggage and cargo being loaded on the vehicle. That weight may not safely exceed the available cargo and luggage load capacity calculated in Step 4.
              (6) If your vehicle will be towing a trailer, load from your trailer will be transferred to your vehicle. Consult this manual to determine how this reduces the available cargo and luggage load capacity of your vehicle.”
              (ii) For trailers: “Steps for Determining Correct Load Limit—
              (1) Locate the statement “The weight of cargo should never exceed XXX kg or XXX lbs.” on your vehicle's placard.
              (2) This figure equals the available amount of cargo and luggage load capacity.”
              (3) Determine the combined weight of luggage and cargo being loaded on the vehicle. That weight may not safely exceed the available cargo and luggage load capacity.
              (b) At the time a motor vehicle tire is delivered to the first purchaser for a purpose other than resale, the manufacturer of that tire, or in the case of a tire marketed under a brand name, the brand name owner, shall provide to that purchaser the information specified in subpart B of this part that is applicable to that tire.

              § 575.103
              Truck-camper loading.
              (a) Scope. This section requires manufacturers of slide-in campers to affix to each camper a label that contains information relating to identification and proper loading of the camper and to provide more detailed loading information in the owner's manual. This section also requires manufacturers of trucks that would accommodate slide-in campers to specify the cargo weight ratings and the longitudinal limits within which the center of gravity for the cargo weight rating should be located.
              (b) Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide information that can be used to reduce overloading and improper load placement in truck-camper combinations and unsafe truck- camper matching in order to prevent accidents resulting from the adverse effects of these conditions on vehicle steering and braking.
              (c) Application. This section applies to slide-in campers and to trucks that are capable of accommodating slide- in campers.
              (d) Definitions.
              
              
                Camper means a structure designed to be mounted in the cargo area of a truck, or attached to an incomplete vehicle with motive power, for the purpose of providing shelter for persons.
              
                Cargo Weight Rating means the value specified by the manufacturer as the cargo-carrying capacity, in pounds or kilograms, of a vehicle, exclusive of the weight of occupants in designated seating positions, computed as 68 kilograms or 150 pounds times the number of designated seating positions.
              
                Slide-in Camper means a camper having a roof, floor, and sides, designed to be mounted on and removable from the cargo area of a truck by the user.
              (e) Requirements—(1) Slide-in Camper—(i) Labels. Each slide-in camper shall have permanently affixed to it, in such a manner that it cannot be removed without defacing or destroying it, and in a plainly visible location on an exterior rear surface other than the roof, steps, or bumper extension, a label containing the following information in the English language lettered in block capitals and numerals not less than 2.4 millimeters (three thirty-seconds of an inch) high, of a color contrasting with the background, in the order shown below and in the form illustrated in Figure 1.
              (A) Name of camper manufacturer. The full corporate or individual name of the actual assembler of the camper shall be spelled out, except that such abbreviations as “Co.” or “Inc.” and their foreign equivalents, and the first and middle initials of individuals may be used. The name of the manufacturer shall be preceded by the words “Manufactured by” or “Mfd by.”
              (B) Month and year of manufacture. It may be spelled out, such as “June 1995” or expressed in numerals, such as “695.”
              (C) The following statement completed as appropriate:
              

              “Camper weight is ______ kg. (______ lbs.) maximum when it contains standard equipment, ______ liters (______ gal.) of water, ______ kg. (______ lbs.) of bottled gas, and ______ cubic meters (______ cubic ft.) refrigerator (or icebox with ______ kg. (______ lbs.) of ice, as applicable). Consult owner's manual (or data sheet, as applicable) for weights of additional or optional equipment.”
              
              (D) “Liters (or gal.) of water” refers to the volume of water necessary to fill the camper's fresh water tanks to capacity. “Kg. (or lbs.) of bottled gas” refers to the amount of gas necessary to fill the camper's bottled gas tanks to capacity. The statement regarding a “refrigerator” or “icebox” refers to the capacity of the refrigerator with which the vehicle is equipped or the weight of the ice with which the icebox may be filled. Any of these items may be omitted from the statement if the corresponding accessories are not included with the camper, provided that the omission is noted in the camper owner's manual as required in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section.
              (ii) Owner's manual. Each slide-in camper manufacturer shall provide with each camper a manual or other document containing the information specified in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) (A) through (F) of this section.
              (A) The statement and information provided on the label as specified in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section. Instead of the information required by paragraphs (e)(1)(i)(B) of this section, a manufacturer may use the statements “See camper identification label located (as applicable) for month and year of manufacture.” If water, bottled gas, or refrigerator (icebox) has been omitted from this statement, the manufacturer's information shall note such omission and advise that the weight of any such item when added to the camper should be added to the maximum camper weight figure used in selecting an appropriate truck.
              (B) A list of other additional or optional equipment that the camper is designed to carry, and the maximum weight of each if its weight is more than 9 kg. (20 lbs) when installed.
              (C) The statement: “To estimate the total cargo load that will be placed on a truck, add the weight of all passengers in the camper, the weight of supplies, tools, and all other cargo, the weight of installed additional or optional camper equipment, and the manufacturer's camper weight figure. Select a truck that has a cargo weight rating that is equal to or greater than the total cargo load of the camper and whose manufacturer recommends a cargo center of gravity zone that will contain the camper's center of gravity when it is installed.”

              (D) The statements: “When loading this camper, store heavy gear first, keeping it on or close to the camper floor. Place heavy things far enough forward to keep the loaded camper's center of gravity within the zone recommended by the truck manufacturer. Store only light objects on high shelves. Distribute weight to obtain even side-to-side balance of the loaded vehicle. Secure loose items to prevent weight shifts that could affect the balance of your vehicle. When the truck-camper is loaded, drive to a scale and weigh on the front and on the rear wheels separately to determine axle loads. The load on an axle should not exceed its gross axle weight rating (GAWR). The total of the axle loads should not exceed the gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR). These weight ratings are given on the vehicle certification label that is located on the left side of the vehicle, normally on the dash panel, hinge pillar, door latch post, or door edge next to the driver on trucks manufactured on or after January 1, 1972. If weight ratings are exceeded, move or remove items to bring all weights below the ratings.”
              (E) A picture showing the location of the longitudinal center of gravity of the camper within an accuracy of 5 centimeters (2 inches) under the loaded condition specified in paragraph (e)(1)(i)(D) of this section in the manner illustrated in Figure 2.
              (F) A picture showing the proper match of a truck and slide-in camper in the form illustrated in Figure 3.
              (2) Trucks. (i) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, each manufacturer of a truck that is capable of accommodating a slide-in camper shall provide to the purchaser in the owner's manual or other document delivered with the truck, in writing and in the English language, the information specified in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) (A) through (E) of this section.
              (A) A picture showing the manufacturer's recommended longitudinal center of gravity zone for the cargo weight rating in the form illustrated in Figure 4. The boundaries of the zone shall be such that when a slide-in camper equal in weight to the truck's cargo weight rating is installed, no GAWR of the truck is exceeded.
              (B) The truck's cargo weight rating.
              (C) The statements: “When the truck is used to carry a slide-in camper, the total cargo load of the truck consists of the manufacturer's camper weight figure, the weight of installed additional camper equipment not included in the manufacturer's camper weight figure, the weight of camper cargo, and the weight of passengers in the camper. The total cargo load should not exceed the truck's cargo weight rating and the camper's center of gravity should fall within the truck's recommended center of gravity zone when installed.”
              (D) A picture showing the proper match of a truck and slide-in camper in the form illustrated in Figure 3.
              (E) The statements: “Secure loose items to prevent weight shifts that could affect the balance of your vehicle. When the truck camper is loaded, drive to a scale and weigh on the front and on the rear wheels separately to determine axle loads. Individual axle loads should not exceed either of the gross axle weight ratings (GAWR). The total of the axle loads should not exceed the gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR). These ratings are given on the vehicle certification label that is located on the left side of the vehicle, normally the dash, hinge pillar, door latch post, or door edge next to the driver. If weight ratings are exceeded, move or remove items to bring all weights below the ratings.”
              (ii) If a truck would accommodate a slide-in camper but the manufacturer of the truck recommends that the truck not be used for that purpose, the information specified in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section shall not be provided but instead the manufacturer shall provide a statement that the truck should not be used to carry a slide-in camper.

              § 575.104
              Uniform tire quality grading standards.
              (a) Scope. This section requires motor vehicle and tire manufacturers and tire brand name owners to provide information indicating the relative performance of passenger car tires in the areas of treadwear, traction, and temperature resistance.
              (b) Purpose. The purpose of this section is to aid the consumer in making an informed choice in the purchase of passenger car tires.
              (c) Application. (1) This section applies to new pneumatic tires for use on passenger cars. However, this section does not apply to deep tread, winter-type snow tires, space-saver or temporary use spare tires, tires with nominal rim diameters of 12 inches or less, or to limited production tires as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
              (2) “Limited production tire” means a tire meeting all of the following criteria, as applicable:
              (i) The annual domestic production or importation into the United States by the tire's manufacturer of tires of the same design and size as the tire does not exceed 15,000 tires;
              (ii) In the case of a tire marketed under a brand name, the annual domestic purchase or importation into the United States by a brand name owner of tires of the same design and size as the tire does not exceed 15,000 tires;
              (iii) The tire's size was not listed as a vehicle manufacturer's recommended tire size designation for a new motor vehicle produced in or imported into the United States in quantities greater than 10,000 during the calendar year preceding the year of the tire's manufacture; and
              (iv) The total annual domestic production or importation into the United States by the tire's manufacturer, and in the case of a tire marketed under a brand name, the total annual domestic purchase or purchase for importation into the United States by the tire's brand name owner, of tires meeting the criteria of paragraphs (c)(2) (i), (ii), and (iii) of this section, does not exceed 35,000 tires.
              Tire design is the combination of general structural characteristics, materials, and tread pattern, but does include cosmetic, identifying or other minor variations among tires.
              (d) Requirements—(1) Information. (i) Each manufacturer of tires, or in the case of tires marketed under a brand name, each brand name owner, shall provide grading information for each tire of which he is the manufacturer or brand name owner in the manner set forth in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) (A) and (B) of this section. The grades for each tire shall be only those specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Each tire shall be able to achieve the level of performance represented by each grade with which it is labeled. An individual tire need not, however, meet further requirements after having been subjected to the test for any one grade.
              (A) Except for a tire of a new tire line, manufactured within the first six months of production of the tire line, each tire shall be graded with the words, letters, symbols, and figures specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, permanently molded into or onto the tire sidewall between the tire's maximum section width and shoulder in accordance with one of the methods described in Figure 1. For purposes of this paragraph, new tire line shall mean a group of tires differing substantially in construction, materials, or design from those previously sold by the manufacturer or brand name owner of the tires. As used in this paragraph, the term “construction” refers to the internal structure of the tire (e.g., cord angles, number and placement of breakers), “materials” refers to the substances used in manufacture of the tire (e.g., belt fiber, rubber compound), and “design” refers to properties or conditions imposed by the tire mold (e.g., aspect ratio, tread pattern).

              (B) Each tire manufactured on and after the effective date of these amendments, other than a tire sold as original equipment on a new vehicle, shall have affixed to its tread surface so as not to be easily removable a label or labels containing its grades and other information in the form illustrated in Figure 2, Parts I and II. The treadwear grade attributed to the tire shall be either imprinted or indelibly stamped on the label containing the material in Part I of Figure 2, directly to the right of or below the word “TREADWEAR.” The traction grade attributed to the tire shall be indelibly circled in an array of the potential grade letters AA, A, B, or C, directly to the right of or below the word “TRACTION” in Part I of Figure 2. The temperature resistance grade attributed to the tire shall be indelibly circled in an array of the potential grade letters A, B, or C, directly to the right of or below the word “TEMPERATURE” in Part I of Figure 2. The words “TREADWEAR,” “TRACTION,” AND “TEMPERATURE,” in that order, may be laid out vertically or horizontally. The text of Part II of Figure 2 may be printed in capital letters. The text of Part I and the text of Part II of Figure 2 need not appear on the same label, but the edges of the two texts must be positioned on the tire tread so as to be separated by a distance of no more than one inch. If the text of Part I and the text of Part II of Figure 2 are placed on separate labels, the notation “See EXPLANATION OF DOT QUALITY GRADES” shall be added to the bottom of the Part I text, and the words “EXPLANATION OF DOT QUALITY GRADES” shall appear at the top of the Part II text. The text of Figure 2 shall be oriented on the tire tread surface with lines of type running perpendicular to the tread circumference. If a label bearing a tire size designation is attached to the tire tread surface and the tire size designation is oriented with lines type running perpendicular to the tread circumference, the text of Figure 2 shall read in the same direction as the tire size designation.
              (ii) In the case of the information required by § 575.6(c) to be furnished to prospective purchasers of tires, each tire manufacturer or brand name owner shall, as part of that information, list all possible grades for traction and temperature resistance, and restate verbatim the explanation for each performance area specified in Figure 2. The information need not be in the same format as in Figure 2. The information must indicate clearly and unambiguously the grade in each performance area for each tire of that manufacturer or brand name owner offered for sale at the particular location.
              (iii) Each manufacturer of motor vehicles equipped with passenger car tires shall include in the owner's manual of each such vehicle a list of all possible grades for traction and temperature resistance and restate verbatim the explanation for each performance area specified in Figure 2, Part II. The information need not be in the exact format of Figure 2, Part II, but it must contain a statement referring the reader to the tire sidewall for the specific tire grades for the tires with which the vehicle is equipped, as follows:
              Uniform Tire Quality Grading
              Quality grades can be found where applicable on the tire sidewall between tread shoulder and maximum section width. For example:
              Treadwear 200 Traction AA Temperature A
              (iv) In the case of information required in accordance with § 575.6(a) to be furnished to the first purchaser of a new motor vehicle, each manufacturer of motor vehicles shall, as part of the required information, list all possible grades for traction and temperature resistance and restate verbatim the explanation for each performance area specified in Figure 2 to this section. The information need not be in the format of Figure 2 to this section, but it must contain a statement referring the reader to the tire sidewall for the specific tire grades for the tires with which the vehicle is equipped.
              (2) Performance—(i) Treadwear. Each tire shall be graded for treadwear performance with the word “TREADWEAR” followed by a number of two or three digits representing the tire's grade for treadwear, expressed as a percentage of the NHTSA nominal treadwear value, when tested in accordance with the conditions and procedures specified in paragraph (e) of this section. Treadwear grades shall be expressed in multiples of 20 (for example, 80, 120, 160).
              (ii) Traction. Each tire shall be graded for traction performance with the word “TRACTION,” followed by the symbols AA, A, B, or C, when the tire is tested in accordance with the conditions and procedures specified in paragraph (f) of this section.
              (A) The tire shall be graded C when the adjusted traction coefficient is either:
              (1) 0.38 or less when tested in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) of this section on the asphalt surface specified in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section, or
              (2) 0.26 or less when tested in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) of this section on the concrete surface specified in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section.
              (B) The tire may be graded B only when its adjusted traction coefficient is both:
              (1) More than 0.38 when tested in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) of this section on the asphalt surface specified in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section, and
              (2) More than 0.26 when tested in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) of this section on the concrete surface specified in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section.
              (C) The tire may be graded A only when its adjusted traction coefficient is both:
              (1) More than 0.47 when tested in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) of this section on the asphalt surface specified in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section, and
              (2) More than 0.35 when tested in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) of this section on the concrete surface specified in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section.
              (D) The tire may be graded AA only when its adjusted traction coefficient is both:
              (1) More than 0.54μ when tested in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) of this section on the asphalt surface specified in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section; and
              (2) More than 0.38μ when tested in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) of this section on the concrete surface specified in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section.
              (iii) Temperature resistance. Each tire shall be graded for temperature resistance performance with the word “TEMPERATURE” followed by the letter A, B, or C, based on its performance when the tire is tested in accordance with the procedures specified in paragraph (g) of this section. A tire shall be considered to have successfully completed a test stage in accordance with this paragraph if, at the end of the test stage, it exhibits no visual evidence of tread, sidewall, ply, cord, innerliner, or bead separation, chunking, broken cords, cracking or open splices as defined in § 571.109 of this chapter, and the tire pressure is not less than the pressure specified in paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
              (A) The tire shall be graded C if it fails to complete the 500 rpm test stage specified in paragraph (g)(9) of this section.
              (B) The tire may be graded B only if it successfully completes the 500 rpm test stage specified in paragraph (g)(9) of this section.
              (C) The tire may be graded A only if it successfully completes the 575 rpm test stage specified in paragraph (g)(9) of this section.
              (e) Treadwear grading conditions and procedures—(1) Conditions. (i) Tire treadwear performance is evaluated on a specific roadway course approximately 400 miles in length, which is established by the NHTSA both for its own compliance testing and for that of regulated persons. The course is designed to produce treadwear rates that are generally representative of those encountered by tires in public use. The course and driving procedures are described in appendix A of this section.
              (ii) Treadwear grades are evaluated by first measuring the performance of a candidate tire on the government test course, and then correcting the projected mileages obtained to account for environmental variations on the basis of the performance of the course monitoring tires run in the same convoy.
              (iii) In convoy tests, each vehicle in the same convoy, except for the lead vehicle, is throughout the test within human eye range of the vehicle immediately ahead of it.
              (iv) A test convoy consists of two or four passenger cars, light trucks, or MPVs, each with a GVWR of 10,000 pounds or less.

              (v) On each convoy vehicle, all tires are mounted on identical rims of design or measuring rim width specified for tires of that size in accordance with 49 CFR 571.109, S4.4.1 (a) or (b), or a rim having a width within −0 to + 0.50 inches of the width listed.
              (2) Treadwear grading procedure. (i) Equip a convoy as follows: Place four course monitoring tires on one vehicle. Place four candidate tires with identical size designations on each other vehicle in the convoy. On each axle, place tires that are identical with respect to manufacturer and line.
              (ii) Inflate each candidate and each course monitoring tire to the applicable pressure specified in Table 1 of this section.
              (iii) Load each vehicle so that the load on each course monitoring and candidate tire is 85 percent of the test load specified in § 575.104(h).
              (iv) Adjust wheel alignment to the midpoint of the vehicle manufacturer's specifications, unless adjustment to the midpoint is not recommended by the manufacturer; in that case, adjust the alignment to the manufacturer's recommended setting. In all cases, the setting is within the tolerance specified by the manufacturer of the alignment machine.
              (v) Subject candidate and course monitoring tires to “break-in” by running the tires in the convoy for two circuits of the test roadway (800 miles). At the end of the first circuit, rotate each vehicle's tires by moving each front tire to the same side of the rear axle and each rear tire to the opposite side of the front axle. Visually inspect each tire for any indication of abnormal wear, tread separation, bulging of the sidewall, or any sign of tire failure. Void the grading results from any tire with any of these anomalies, and replace the tire.
              (vi) After break-in, allow the air pressure in the tires to fall to the applicable pressure specified in Table 1 of this section or for 2 hours, whichever occurs first. Measure, to the nearest 0.001 inch, the tread depth of each candidate and each course monitoring tire, avoiding treadwear indicators, at six equally spaced points in each groove. For each tire compute the average of the measurements. Do not measure those shoulder grooves which are not provided with treadwear indicators.
              (vii) Adjust wheel alignment to the midpoint of the manufacturer's specifications, unless adjustment to the midpoint is not recommended by the manufacturer; in that case, adjust the alignment according to the manufacturer's recommended setting. In all cases, the setting is within the tolerance specified by the manufacturer of the alignment machine.
              (viii) Drive the convoy on the test roadway for 6,400 miles.
              (A) After each 400 miles, rotate each vehicle's tires by moving each front tire to the same side of the rear axle and each rear tire to the opposite side of the front axle. Visually inspect each tire for treadwear anomalies.
              (B) After each 800 miles, rotate the vehicles in the convoy by moving the last vehicle to the lead position. Do not rotate driver positions within the convoy. In four-car convoys, vehicle one shall become vehicle two, vehicle two shall become vehicle three, vehicle three shall become vehicle four, and vehicle four shall become vehicle one.
              (C) After each 800 miles, if necessary, adjust wheel alignment to the midpoint of the vehicle manufacturer's specification, unless adjustment to the midpoint is not recommended by the manufacturer; in that case, adjust the alignment to the manufacturer's recommended setting. In all cases, the setting is within the tolerance specified by the manufacturer of the alignment machine.
              (D) After each 800 miles, if determining the projected mileage by the 9-point method set forth in (e)(2)(ix)(A)(1), measure the average tread depth of each tire following the procedure set forth in paragraph (e)(2)(vi) of this section.
              (E) After each 1,600 miles, move the complete set of four tires to the following vehicle. Move the tires on the last vehicle to the lead vehicle. In moving the tires, rotate them as set forth in (e)(2)(viii)(A) of this section.
              (F) At the end of the test, measure the tread depth of each tire pursuant to the procedure set forth in paragraph (e)(2)(vi) of this section.

              (ix)(A) Determine the projected mileage for each candidate tire either by the nine-point method of least squares set forth in paragraph (e)(2)(ix)(A)(1) of this section and appendix C to this section, or by the two-point arithmetical method set forth in paragraph (e)(2)(ix)(A)(2) of this section. Notify NHTSA about which of the alternative grading methods is being used.
              (1) Nine-Point Method of Least Squares. For each course monitoring and candidate tire in the convoy, using the average tread depth measurements obtained in accordance with paragraphs (e)(2)(vi) and (e)(2)(viii)(D) of this section and the corresponding mileages as data points, apply the method of least squares as described in appendix C to this section to determine the estimated regression line of y on x given by the following formula:
              
                EC01AU91.184
              
              
                Where:
                
                y = average tread depth in mils
                x = miles after break-in,
                a = y intercept of regression line (reference tread depth) in mils, calculated using the method of least squares; and
                b = the slope of the regression line in mils of tread depth per 1,000 miles, calculated using the method of least squares. This slope will be negative in value. The tire's wear rate is defined as the absolute value of the slope of the regression line.
              
              
              (2) Two-Point Arithmetical Method. For each course monitoring and candidate tire in the convoy, using the average tread depth measurements obtained in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(vi) and (e)(2)(viii)(F) of this section and the corresponding mileages as data points, determine the slope (m) of the tire's wear in mils of tread depth per 1,000 miles by the following formula:
              
                EC01AU91.185
              
              
                Where:
                
                Yo = average tread depth after break-in, mils
                Y1 = average tread depth at 6,400 miles, mils
                Xo = 0 miles (after break-in).
                X1 = 6,400 miles of travel
              
              This slope (m) will be negative in value. The tire's wear rate is defined as the slope (m) expressed in mils per 1,000 miles.
              
              (B) Average the wear rates of the four course monitoring tires as determined in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(ix)(A) of this section.

              (C) Determine the course severity adjustment factor by dividing the base course wear rate for the course monitoring tires (see Note to this paragraph) by the average wear rate for the four course monitoring tires.
              
              
                Note to paragraph (e)(2)(ix)(C):

                The base wear rate for the course monitoring tires will be obtained by the government by running the tire specified in ASTM E 1136 (incorporated by reference, see § 575.3) course monitoring tires for 6,400 miles over the San Angelo, Texas, UTQGS test route 4 times per year, then using the average wear rate from the last 4 quarterly CMT tests for the base course wear rate calculation. Each new base course wear rate will be published in the Federal Register. The course monitoring tires used in a test convoy must be no more than one year old at the commencement of the test and must be used within two months after removal from storage.
              
              
              (D) Determine the adjusted wear rate for each candidate tire by multiplying its wear rate determined in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(ix)(A) of this section by the course severity adjustment factor determined in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(ix)(C) of this section.
              (E) Determine the projected mileage for each candidate tire by applying the appropriate formula set forth below:
              (1) If the projected mileage is calculated pursuant to paragraph (e)(2)(ix)(A)(1) of this section, then:
              
                EC01AU91.186
              
              
                Where:
                

                a = y intercept of regression line (reference tread depth) for the candidate tire as determined in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(ix)(A)(1) of this section.
                b1 = the adjusted wear rate for the candidate tire as determined in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(ix)(D) of this section.
              
              
              (2) If the projected mileage is calculated pursuant to (e)(2)(ix)(a)(2) of this section, then:
              
                ER07SE99.000
              
              
                Where:
                
                Yo = average tread depth after break-in, mils
                mc = the adjusted wear rate for the candidate tires as determined in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(ix)(D) of this section.
              
              

              (F) Compute the grade (P) of the NHTSA nominal treadwear value for each candidate tire by using the following formula:
              
              P = Projected mileage × base course wear raten/402
              
              Where base course wear raten = new base course wear rate, i.e., average treadwear of the last 4 quarterly course monitoring tire tests conducted by NHTSA.
              
              Round off the percentage to the nearest lower 20-point increment.
              (f) Traction grading conditions and procedures—(1) Conditions. (i) Tire traction performance is evaluated on skid pads that are established, and whose severity is monitored, by the NHTSA both for its compliance testing and for that of regulated persons. The test pavements are asphalt and concrete surfaces constructed in accordance with the specifications for pads “C” and “A” in the “Manual for the Construction and Maintenance of Skid Surfaces,” National Technical Information Service No. DOT-HS-800-814. The surfaces have locked wheel traction coefficients when evaluated in accordance with paragraphs (f)(2)(i) through (f)(2)(vii) of this section of 0.50 ±0.10 for the asphalt and 0.35 ±0.10 for the concrete. The location of the skid pads is described in appendix B to this section.

              (ii) The standard tire is the tire specified in ASTM E 501 (incorporated by reference, see § 575.3).

              (iii) The pavement surface is wetted in accordance with paragraph 4.7, “Pavement Wetting System,” of ASTM E 274 (incorporated by reference, see § 575.3).

              (iv) The test apparatus is a test trailer built in conformity with the specifications in paragraph 4, “Apparatus,” of ASTM E 274 (incorporated by reference, see § 575.3). The test apparatus is instrumented in accordance with paragraph 4.5 of that method, except that the “wheel load” in paragraph 4.3 and tire and rim specifications in paragraph 4.4 of that method are as specified in the procedures in paragraph (f)(2) of this section for standard and candidate tires.

              (v) The test apparatus is calibrated in accordance with ASTM F 377 (incorporated by reference, see § 575.3), with the trailer's tires inflated to 24 psi and loaded to 1,085 pounds.
              (vi) Consecutive tests on the same surface are conducted not less than 30 seconds apart.

              (vii) A standard tire is discarded in accordance with ASTM E 501 (incorporated by reference, see § 575.3).
              (2) Procedure. (i) Prepare two standard tires as follows:
              (A) Condition the tires by running them for 200 miles on a pavement surface.
              (B) Mount each tire on a rim of design or measuring rim width specified for tires of its size in accordance with 49 CFR 571.109, S4.4.1 (a) or (b), or a rim having a width within −0 to + 0.50 inches of the width listed. Then inflate the tire to 24 psi, or, in the case of a tire with inflation pressure measured in kilopascals, to 180 kPa.
              (C) Statically balance each tire-rim combination.
              (D) Allow each tire to cool to ambient temperature and readjust its inflation pressure to 24 psi, or, in the case of a tire with inflation pressure measured in kilopascals, to 180 kPa.
              (ii) Mount the tires on the test apparatus described in paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of this section and load each tire to 1,085 pounds.
              (iii) Tow the trailer on the asphalt test surface specified in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section at a speed of 40 mph, lock one trailer wheel, and record the locked-wheel traction coefficient on the tire associated with that wheel between 0.5 and 1.5 seconds after lockup.
              (iv) Repeat the test on the concrete surface, locking the same wheel.
              (v) Repeat the tests specified in paragraphs (f)(2) (iii) and (iv) of this section for a total of 10 measurements on each test surface.
              (vi) Repeat the procedures specified in paragraphs (f)(2) (iii) through (v) of this section, locking the wheel associated with the other tire.

              (vii) Average the 20 measurements taken on the asphalt surface to find the standard tire traction coefficient for the asphalt surface. Average the 20 measurements taken on the concrete surface to find the standard tire traction coefficient for the concrete surface. The standard tire traction coefficient so determined may be used in the computation of adjusted traction coefficients for more than one candidate tire.
              (viii) Prepare two candidate tires of the same construction type, manufacturer, line, and size designation in accordance with paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, mount them on the test apparatus, and test one of them according to the procedures of paragraph (f)(2)(ii) through (v) of this section, except load each tire to 85% of the test load specified in § 575.104(h). For CT tires, the test inflation of candidate tires shall be 230 kPa. Candidate tire measurements may be taken either before or after the standard tire measurements used to compute the standard tire traction coefficient. Take all standard tire and candidate tire measurements used in computation of a candidate tire's adjusted traction coefficient within a single three hour period. Average the 10 measurements taken on the asphalt surface to find the candidate tire traction coefficient for the asphalt surface. Average the 10 measurements taken on the concrete surface to find the candidate tire traction coefficient for the concrete surface.

              (ix) Compute a candidate tire's adjusted traction coefficient for asphalt (μa) by the following formula:
              
              (μa) = Measured candidate tire coefficient for asphalt + 0.50 − Measured standard tire coefficient for asphalt
              

              (x) Compute a candidate tire's adjusted traction coefficient for concrete (μc) by the following formula:
              
              μc = Measured candidate tire coefficient for concrete + 0.35μ Measured standard tire coefficient for concrete
              
              (g) Temperature resistance grading. (1) Mount the tire on a rim of design or measuring rim width specified for tires of its size in accordance with § 571.109, paragraph S4.4.1 (a) or (b) and inflate it to the applicable pressure specified in Table 1 of this section.
              (2) Condition the tire-rim assembly to a temperature of 95 °F for at least 3 hours.
              (3) Adjust the pressure again to the applicable pressure specified in Table 1 of this section.
              (4) Mount the tire-rim assembly on an axle, and press the tire tread against the surface of a flat-faced steel test wheel that is 67.23 inches in diameter and at least as wide as the section width of the tire.
              (5) During the test, including the pressure measurements specified in paragraphs (g) (1) and (3) of this section, maintain the temperature of the ambient air, as measured 12 inches from the edge of the rim flange at any point on the circumference on either side of the tire at 95 °F. Locate the temperature sensor so that its readings are not affected by heat radiation, drafts, variations in the temperature of the surrounding air, or guards or other devices.
              (6) Press the tire against the test wheel with a load of 88 percent of the tire's maximum load rating as marked on the tire sidewall.
              (7) Rotate the test wheel at 250 rpm for 2 hours.
              (8) Remove the load, allow the tire to cool to 95 °F or for 2 hours, whichever occurs last, and readjust the inflation pressure to the applicable pressure specified in Table 1 of this section.
              (9) Reapply the load and without interruption or readjustment of inflation pressure, rotate the test wheel at 375 rpm for 30 minutes, and then at successively higher rates in 25 rpm increments, each for 30 minutes, until the tire has run at 575 rpm for 30 minutes, or to failure, whichever occurs first.

              (2) Determine the tire's maximum inflation pressure and maximum load rating both as specified on the tire's sidewall.
              (3) Determine the appropriate multiplier corresponding to the tire's maximum inflation pressure, as set forth in Table 2.
              (4) Multiply the tire's maximum load rating by the multiplier determined in paragraph (h)(3). This is the tire's calculated load.
              (5) Round the product determined in paragraph (h)(4) (the calculated load) to the nearest multiple of ten pounds or, if metric units are used, 5 kilograms. For example, 903 pounds would be rounded to 900 and 533 kilograms would be rounded to 535. This figure is the test load.

                Treadwear
                The treadwear grade is a comparative rating based on the wear rate of the tire when tested under controlled conditions on a specified government test course. For example, a tire graded 150 would wear one and one-half (11/2) times as well on the government course as a tire graded 100. The relative performance of tires depends upon the actual conditions of their use, however, and may depart significantly from the norm due to variations in driving habits, service practices and differences in road characteristics and climate.
                Traction
                The traction grades, from highest to lowest, are AA, A, B, and C. Those grades represent the tire's ability to stop on wet pavement as measured under controlled conditions on specified government test surfaces of asphalt and concrete. A tire marked C may have poor traction performance. Warning: The traction grade assigned to this tire is based on straight-ahead braking traction tests, and does not include acceleration, cornering, hydroplaning, or peak traction characteristics.
                Temperature
                The temperature grades are A (the highest), B, and C, representing the tire's resistance to the generation of heat and its ability to dissipate heat when tested under controlled conditions on a specified indoor laboratory test wheel. Sustained high temperature can cause the material of the tire to degenerate and reduce tire life, and excessive temperature can lead to sudden tire failure. The grade C corresponds to a level of performance which all passenger car tires must meet under the Federal Motor Safety Standard No. 109. Grades B and A represent higher levels of performance on the laboratory test wheel than the minimum required by law. Warning: The temperature grade for this tire is established for a tire that is properly inflated and not overloaded. Excessive speed, underinflation, or excessive loading, either separately or in combination, can cause heat buildup and possible tire failure.
                Appendix A—Treadwear Test Course and Driving Procedures
                
                  Introduction. The test course consists of three loops of a total of 400 miles in the geographical vicinity of Goodfellow AFB, San Angelo, Tex.
                The first loop runs south 143 miles through the cities of Eldorado, Sonora, and Juno, Tex. to the Camp Hudson Historical Marker, and returns by the same route.
                The second loop runs east over Farm and Ranch Roads (FM) and returns to its starting point.
                The third loop runs northwest to Water Valley, northeast toward Robert Lee and returns via Texas 208 to the vicinity of Goodfellow AFB.
                
                  Route. The route is shown in Figure 3. The table identifies key points by number. These numbers are encircled in Figure 3 and in parentheses in the descriptive material that follows.

                  Eastern Loop. From junction of Loop Road 306 and FM388 (2), make right turn onto FM388 and drive east to junction with FM2334 (13). Turn right onto FM2334 and proceed south across FM765 (14) to junction of FM2334 and US87 (15). For convoys that originate at Goodfellow AFB, make U-turn and return to junction of FM388 and Loop Road 306 (2) by the same route. For convoys that do not originate at Goodfellow AFB, upon reaching junction of FM2334 and US87 (15), make U-Turn and continue north on FM2334 past the intersection with FM388 to Veribest Cotton Gin, a distance of 1.8 miles beyond the intersection. Make U-turn and return to junction of FM2334 and FM388. Turn right onto FM388, proceed west to junction FM388 and Loop Road 306.
                
                  Northwestern Loop. From junction of Loop Road 306 and FM388 (2), make right turn onto Loop Road 306. Proceed onto US277, to junction with FM2105 (8). Turn left onto FM2105 and proceed west to junction with US87 (10). Turn right on US87 and proceed northwest to the junction with FM2034 near the town of Water Valley (11). Turn right onto FM2034 and proceed north to Texas 208 (12). Turn right onto Texas 208 and proceed south to junction with FM2105 (9). Turn left onto FM2105 and proceed east to junction with US277 (8).

                The asphalt skid pad is 600 ft. × 60 ft. and is shown in black on the runway in Figure 4. The pad is approached from either end by a 75 ft. ramp followed by 100 ft. of level pavement. This arrangement permits the skid trailers to stabilize before reaching the test area. The approaches are shown on the figure by the hash-marked area.
                The concrete pad is 600 ft. × 48 ft. and is on the taxi strip. The approaches to the concrete pad are of the same design as those for the asphalt pads.
                A two lane asphalt road has been built to connect the runway and taxi strip. The road is parallel to the northeast-southwest runway at a distance of 100 ft. The curves have super-elevation to permit safe exit from the runway at operating speeds.

                Appendix C—Method of Least Squares
                The method of least squares is a method of calculation by which it is possible to obtain a reliable estimate of a true physical relationship from a set of data which involve random error. The method may be used to establish a regression line that minimizes the sum of the squares of the deviations of the measured data points from the line. The regression line is consequently described as the line of “best fit” to the data points. It is described in terms of its slope and its “y” intercept.
                The graph in Figure 5 depicts a regression line calculated using the least squares method from data collected from a hypothetical treadwear test of 6,400 miles, with tread depth measurements made at every 500 miles.

                In this graph, xj,yj (j = 0, 1, . . ;. 8) are the individual data points representing the tread depth measurements (the overall average for the tire with 6 measurements in each tire groove) at the beginning of the test (after break-in) and at the end of each 800-mile segment of the test.
                The absolute value of the slope of the regression line is an expression of the mils of tread worn per 1,000 miles, and is calculated by the following formula:
                
                  EC01AU91.194
                
                The “y” intercept of the regression line (a) in mils is calculated by the following formula:

              (ii) Vehicles manufactured on or after September 1, 1999 and before September 1, 2000. When the rollover warning label required by paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section and the air bag warning label required by paragraph S4.5.1(b) of 49 CFR 571.208 are affixed to the same side of the driver side sun visor, either:
              (A) The rollover warning label must be affixed to the right (as viewed from the driver's seat) of the air bag warning label and the labels may not be contiguous; or
              (B) The pictogram of the air bag warning label must be separated from the pictograms of the rollover warning label by text, and
              (1) The labels must be located such that the shortest distance from any of the lettering or graphics on the rollover warning label to any of the lettering or graphics on the air bag warning label is not less than 3 cm, or
              (2) If the rollover warning and air bag warning labels are each completely surrounded by a continuous solid-lined border, the shortest distance from the border of the rollover warning label to the border of the air bag warning label is not less than 1 cm.
              (iii) The manufacturer must select the option to which a vehicle is certified by the time the manufacturer certifies the vehicle and may not thereafter select a different option for that vehicle. If a manufacturer chooses to certify compliance with more than one compliance option, the vehicle must satisfy the requirements applicable to each of the options selected.
              (iv) Vehicles manufactured on or after September 1, 2000. When the rollover warning label required by paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section and the air bag warning label required by paragraph S4.5.1(b) of 49 CFR 571.208 are affixed to the same side of the driver side sun visor the pictogram of the air bag warning label must be separated from the pictograms of the rollover warning label by text and:
              (A) The labels must be located such that the shortest distance from any of the lettering or graphics on the rollover warning label to any of the lettering or graphics on the air bag warning label is not less than 3 cm, or
              (B) If the rollover warning and air bag warning labels are each completely surrounded by a continuous solid-lined border, the shortest distance from the border of the rollover warning label to the border of the air bag warning label must be not less than 1 cm.
              (2) Alternate location for warning label. As an alternative to affixing the warning label required by paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section to the driver's sun visor, a manufacturer may permanently affix the label to the lower rear corner of the forwardmost driver's side window. The label must be legible, visible and prominent to a person next to the exterior of the driver's door.
              (3) Rollover Alert Label. If the label required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section and affixed to the driver side sun visor is not visible when the sun visor is in the stowed position, an alert label must be permanently affixed to that visor so that the label is visible when the visor is in that position. The alert label must comply with the following requirements:
              (i) The label must read:
              ROLLOVER WARNING
              Flip Visor Over
              (ii) The label must be black with yellow text.
              (iii) The label must be no less than 20 square cm.
              (4) Owner's Manual. The owner's manual must include the following statements and discussions:
              (i) The statement “Utility vehicles have a significantly higher rollover rate than other types of vehicles.”

              § 575.401
              Vehicle labeling of fuel economy, greenhouse gas, and other pollutant emissions information.
              (a) Purpose and scope. The purpose of this section is to aid potential purchasers in the selection of new passenger cars and light trucks by providing them with information about vehicles' performance in terms of fuel economy, greenhouse gas (GHG), and other air pollutant emissions. Manufacturers of passenger cars and light trucks are required to include this information on the label described in this section. Although this information will also be available through means such as postings at http://www.fueleconomy.gov, the additional label information is intended to provide consumers with this information at the point of sale, and to help them compare between vehicles.
              (b) Application. This section applies to passenger cars and light trucks manufactured in model year 2013 and later. Manufacturers may optionally comply with this section during model year 2012.
              (c) Definitions.
              
              (1) Data element means a piece of information required or permitted to be included on the fuel economy and environment label.
              (2) Fuel economy and environment label means the label with information about automobile performance in terms of fuel economy, greenhouse gases, and other emissions and with rating systems for fuel economy, greenhouse gases, and other emissions that also indicate the automobile(s) with the highest fuel economy and lowest greenhouse gas emissions, as specified at 49 U.S.C. 32908(g).
              (3) Miles per gasoline gallon equivalent (MPGe) is a measure of distance traveled per unit of energy consumed, and functions as a recognizable equivalent to, e.g., kilowatt-hours per mile (kW-hr/mile).
              (4) Monroney label means the label placed on new automobiles with the manufacturer's suggested retail price and other consumer information, as specified at 15 U.S.C. 1231-1233 (also known as the “Automobile Information Disclosure Act label”).
              (5) Other air pollutants or other emissions means those tailpipe emissions, other than carbon dioxide (CO2), for which manufacturers must provide EPA with emissions rates for all new light duty vehicles each model year under EPA's Tier 2 light duty vehicle emissions standards requirements (40 CFR Part 86, Subpart S) or the parallel requirements for those vehicles certified instead to the California emissions standards. These air pollutants include non-methane organic gases (NMOG), nitrogen oxides (NOX), particulate matter (PM), carbon monoxide (CO), and formaldehyde (HCHO).
              (6) Slider bar means a horizontal rating scale with a minimum value at one end and a maximum value at the other end that can accommodate a designation of a specific value between those values with a box or arrow. The actual rating value would be printed (displayed) at the proper position on the scale representing the vehicle's actual rating value relative to the two end values.
              (d) Required label. Prior to being offered for sale, each manufacturer must affix or cause to be affixed and each dealer must maintain or cause to be maintained on each passenger car or light truck a label that meets the requirements specified in this section, and conforms in content, format, and sequence to the sample labels depicted in the appendix to this section. The manufacturer must have the fuel economy label affixed in such a manner that appearance and legibility are maintained until after the vehicle is delivered to the ultimate consumer.
              (e) Required label information and format—general provisions—(1) Location. It is preferable that the fuel economy and environment label information be incorporated into the Monroney label, provided that the prominence and legibility of the fuel economy and environment label is maintained. If the fuel economy and environment label is incorporated into the Monroney label, it must be placed on a separate section in the Monroney label and must not be intermixed with that label information, except for vehicle descriptions as noted in 40 CFR 600.302-08(d)(1). If the fuel economy and environment label is not incorporated into the Monroney label, it must be located on a side window, and as close as possible to the Monroney label. If the window is not large enough to accommodate both the Monroney label and the fuel economy and environment label, the latter must be located on another window as close as physically possible to the Monroney label.
              (2) Size and legibility. The fuel economy and environment label must be readily visible from the exterior of the vehicle and presented in a legible and prominent fashion. The label must be rectangular in shape with a minimum height of 4.5 inches (114 mm) and a minimum length of 7.0 inches (177 mm) as specified in the appendix to this section.
              (3) Basic appearance. Fuel economy and environment labels must be printed on white or very light paper with the color specified in this section; any label markings for which a color is not specified here must be in black and white. The label can be divided into three separate fields outlined by a continuous border, as described in the appendix to this section. Manufacturers must make a good faith effort to conform to the formats illustrated in the appendix to this section. Label templates are available for download at http://www.nhtsa.gov/fuel-economy/.
              
              (4) Border. Create a continuous black border to outline the label and separate the three information fields. Include the following information in the upper and lower portions of the border:
              (i) Upper border, label name. (A) In the left portion of the upper border, the words “EPA” and “DOT” must be in boldface, capital letters that are light in color and left-justified, with a horizontal line in between them as shown in the appendix to this section.

            Notification pursuant to a manufacturer's decision.
            (a) When a manufacturer of motor vehicles or replacement equipment determines that any motor vehicle or item of replacement equipment produced by the manufacturer contains a defect that relates to motor vehicle safety, or fails to conform to an applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standard, or the manufacturer files a defect or noncompliance information report under 49 CFR part 573, the manufacturer shall provide notification in accordance with § 577.7(a), unless the manufacturer is exempted by the Administrator (pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 30118(d) or 30120(h)) from giving such notification. The notification shall contain the information specified in this section. The information required by paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section shall be presented in the form and order specified. The information required by paragraphs (d) through (h) of this section may be presented in any order. Except as authorized by the Administrator, the manufacturer shall submit a copy of its proposed owner notification letter, including any provisions or attachments related to reimbursement, to NHTSA's Recall Management Division (NVS-215) no fewer than five (5) Federal Government business days before it intends to begin mailing it to owners. The manufacturer shall mark the outside of each envelope in which it sends an owner notification letter with a notation that includes the phrase “SAFETY RECALL NOTICE,” all in capital letters and in a type that is larger than that used in the address section, and is also distinguishable from the other type in a manner other than size. It shall also imprint on the outside of this envelope a label in accordance with § 577.14. Except where the format of the envelope has been previously approved by NHTSA's Recall Management Division (NVS-215), each manufacturer must submit the envelope format it intends to use to that division at least five (5) Federal Government business days before mailing the notification to owners. Submission of envelopes and proposed owner notification letters shall be made by the means identified in 49 CFR 573.9.

            (1) When vehicle crash is a potential occurrence, the evaluation shall include whichever of the following is appropriate:
            (i) A statement that the defect or noncompliance can cause vehicle crash without prior warning; or
            (ii) A description of whatever prior warning may occur, and a statement that if this warning is not heeded, vehicle crash can occur.
            (2) When vehicle crash is not the potential occurrence, the evaluation must include a statement indicating the general type of injury to occupants of the vehicle, or to persons outside the vehicle, that can result from the defect or noncompliance, and a description of whatever prior warning may occur.
            (g) A statement of measures to be taken to remedy the defect or noncompliance, in accordance with paragraph (g)(1) or (g)(2) of this section, whichever is appropriate.

            § 577.7
            Time and manner of notification.
            (a) The notification required by § 577.5 shall—
            (1) Be furnished no later than 60 days from the date the manufacturer files its defect or noncompliance information report under part 573. In the event that the remedy for the defect or noncompliance is not available at the time of notification, the manufacturer shall issue a second notification within a reasonable time and in accordance with the requirements of this part once that remedy is available. The Administrator may order a manufacturer to send the notification to owners on a specific date where the Administrator finds, after consideration of available information and the views of the manufacturer, that such notification is in the public interest. The factors that the Administrator may consider include, but are not limited to, the severity of the safety risk; the likelihood of occurrence of the defect or noncompliance; whether there is something that an owner can do to reduce either the likelihood of occurrence of the defect or noncompliance or the severity of the consequences; whether there will be a delay in the availability of the remedy from the manufacturer; and the anticipated length of any such delay.
            (2) Be accomplished—

            (i) In the case of a notification required to be sent by a motor vehicle manufacturer, by first class mail to each person who is registered under State law as the owner of the vehicle and whose name and address are reasonably ascertainable by the manufacturer through State records or other sources available to him. If the owner cannot be reasonably ascertained, the manufacturer shall notify the most recent purchaser known to the manufacturer. The manufacturer shall also provide notification to each lessee of a leased motor vehicle that is covered by an agreement between the manufacturer and a lessor under which the manufacturer is to notify lessees directly of safety-related defects and noncompliances.
            (ii) In the case of a notification required to be sent by a replacement equipment manufacturer—
            (A) By first class mail to the most recent purchaser known to the manufacturer, and
            (B) (Except in the case of a tire) if decided by the Administrator to be required for motor vehicle safety, by public notice in such manner as the Administrator may require after consultation with the manufacturer.
            (iii) In the case of a manufacturer required to provide notification concerning any defective or noncomplying tire, by first class or certified mail.
            (iv) In the case of a notification to be sent by a lessor to a lessee of a leased motor vehicle, by first-class mail to the most recent lessee known to the lessor. Such notification shall be mailed within ten days of the lessor's receipt of the notification from the vehicle manufacturer.
            (b) The notification required by any paragraph of § 577.6 shall be provided:
            (1) Within 60 days after the manufacturer's receipt of the Administrator's order to provide the notification, except that the notification shall be furnished within a shorter or longer period if the Administrator incorporates in his order a finding that such period is in the public interest; and
            (2) In the manner and to the recipient specified in paragraph (a) of this section.
            (c) The notification required by § 577.13 shall—
            (1) Be furnished within a reasonable time after the manufacturer decides that a defect that relates to motor vehicle safety or a noncompliance exists. In the case of defects or noncompliances that present an immediate and substantial threat to motor vehicle safety, the manufacturer shall transmit this notice to dealers and distributors within three business days of its transmittal of the Defect and Noncompliance Information Report under 49 CFR 573.6 to NHTSA, except that when the manufacturer transmits the notice by other than electronic means, the manufacturer shall transmit this notice to dealers and distributors within five business days of its transmittal of the Defect and Noncompliance Information Report to NHTSA. In all other cases, the notification shall be provided in accordance with the schedule submitted to the agency pursuant to § 573.6(c)(8)(ii), unless that schedule is modified by the Administrator. The Administrator may direct a manufacturer to send the notification to dealers on a specific date if the Administrator finds, after consideration of available information and the views of the manufacturer, that such notification is in the public interest. The factors that the Administrator may consider include, but are not limited to, the severity of the safety risk; the likelihood of occurrence of the defect or noncompliance; the time frame in which the defect or noncompliance may manifest itself; availability of an interim remedial action by the owner; whether a dealer inspection would identify vehicles or items of equipment that contain the defect or noncompliance; and the time frame in which the manufacturer plans to provide the notification and the remedy to its dealers.
            (2) Be accomplished—
            (i) In the case of a notification required to be sent by a motor vehicle manufacturer, by certified mail, verifiable electronic means such as receipts or logs from electronic mail or satellite distribution system, or other more expeditious and verifiable means to all dealers and distributors of the vehicles that contain the defect or noncompliance.

            (ii) In the case of a notification required to be sent by a manufacturer of replacement equipment or tires, by certified mail, verifiable electronic means such as receipts or logs from electronic mail or satellite distribution system, or other more expeditious and verifiable means to all dealers and distributors of the product that are known to the manufacturer.
            (iii) In those cases where a manufacturer of motor vehicles or items of motor vehicle equipment provided the recalled product(s) to a group of dealers or distributors through a central office, notification to that central office will be deemed to be notice to all dealers and distributors within that group.
            (iv) In those cases in which a manufacturer of motor vehicles or items of motor vehicle equipment has provided the recalled product to independent dealers through independent distributors, the manufacturer may satisfy its notification responsibilities by providing the information required under this section to its distributors. In such cases, the manufacturer must also instruct those distributors to transmit a copy of the manufacturer's notification to known distributors and retail outlets along the distribution chain within five working days from its receipt.
            (d) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, where the recall is being conducted pursuant to an order issued by the Administrator under 49 U.S.C. 30118(b), notification required by § 577.13 shall be given on or before the date prescribed in the Administrator's order.

            § 577.10
            Follow-up notification.
            (a) If, based on quarterly reports submitted pursuant to § 573.7 of this part or other available information, the Administrator decides that a notification of a safety-related defect of a noncompliance with a Federal motor vehicle safety standard sent by a manufacturer has not resulted in an adequate number of vehicles or items of equipment being returned for remedy, the Administrator may direct the manufacturer to send a follow-up notification in accordance with this section. The scope, timing, form, and content of such follow-up notification will be established by the Administrator, in consultation with the manufacturer, to maximize the number of owners, purchasers, and lessees who will present their vehicles or items of equipment for remedy.
            (b) The Administrator may consider the following factors in deciding whether or not to require a manufacturer to undertake a follow-up notification campaign:
            (1) The percentage of covered vehicles or items of equipment that have been presented for the remedy;
            (2) The amount of time that has elapsed since the prior notification(s);
            (3) The likelihood that a follow-up notification will increase the number of vehicles or items of equipment receiving the remedy;

            (4) The seriousness of the safety risk from the defect or noncompliance;
            
            (5) Whether the prior notification(s) undertaken by the manufacturer complied with the requirements of the statute and regulations; and
            (6) Such other factors as are consistent with the purpose of the statute.
            (c) A manufacturer shall be required to provide a follow-up notification under this section only with respect to vehicles or items of equipment that have not been returned for remedy pursuant to the prior notification(s).
            (d) Except where the Administrator determines otherwise, the follow-up notification shall be sent to the same categories of recipients that received the prior notification(s).
            (e) A follow-up notification must include:
            (1) A statement that identifies it as a follow-up to an earlier communication;
            (2) A statement urging the recipient to present the vehicle or item of equipment for remedy; and
            (3) Except as determined by the Administrator, the information required to be included in the initial notification.
            (f) The manufacturer shall mark the outside of each envelope in which it sends a follow-up notification in a manner which meets the requirements of § 577.5(a) of this part.
            (g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the Administrator may authorize the use of other media besides first-class mail for a follow-up notification.

            (3) For notifications of defects or noncompliances in item of motor vehicle equipment that are in a form other than a letter to a specific owner or purchaser, if the manufacturer does not otherwise maintain a toll-free telephone number for the use of consumers, the manufacturer may refer claimants to a non-toll-free telephone number (with TTY capability) if it also specifies a mailing address at which owners can obtain the relevant information regarding the manufacturer's reimbursement plan.
            (d) The information to be provided under paragraph (c) of this section must:

            (4) Identify any restrictions on eligibility for reimbursement that the manufacturer is imposing (as limited by § 573.13 (d) of this chapter);

            (5) Specify all necessary documentation that must be submitted to obtain reimbursement;

            § 578.7
            Criminal safe harbor provision.
            (a) Scope. This section sets forth the requirements regarding the reasonable time and the manner of correction for a person seeking safe harbor protection from criminal liability under 49 U.S.C. 30170(a)(2), which provides that a person described in 49 U.S.C. 30170(a)(1) is not subject to criminal penalties thereunder if:
            (1) At the time of the violation, such person does not know that the violation would result in an accident causing death or serious bodily injury; and
            (2) The person corrects any improper reports or failure to report, with respect to reporting requirements of 49 U.S.C. 30166, within a reasonable time.
            (b) Reasonable time. A correction is considered to have been performed within a reasonable time if the person seeking protection from criminal liability makes the correction to any improper (i.e., incorrect, incomplete, or misleading) report not more than thirty (30) calendar days after the date of the report to the agency and corrects any failure to report not more than thirty (30) calendar days after the report was due to be sent to or received by the agency, as the case may be, pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 30166, including a regulation, requirement, request or order issued thereunder. In order to meet these reasonable time requirements, all submissions required by this section must be received by NHTSA within the time period specified in this paragraph, and not merely mailed or otherwise sent within that time period.
            (c) Sufficient manner of correction. Each person seeking safe harbor protection from criminal penalties under 49 U.S.C. 30170(a)(2) must comply with the following with respect to each improper report and failure to report for which safe harbor protection is sought:
            (1) Sign and submit to NHTSA a dated document identifying:
            (i) Each previous improper report (e.g., informational statement and document submission), and each failure to report as required under 49 U.S.C. 30166, including a regulation, requirement, request or order issued thereunder, for which protection is sought, and
            (ii) The specific predicate under which the improper or omitted report should have been provided (e.g., the report was required by a specified regulation, NHTSA Information Request, or NHTSA Special Order).
            (2) Submit the complete and correct information that was required to be submitted but was improperly submitted or was not previously submitted, including relevant documents that were not previously submitted, or, if the person cannot do so, provide a detailed description of that information and/or the content of those documents and the reason why the individual cannot provide them to NHTSA (e.g., the information or documents are not in the individual's possession or control).

            (3) For a corporation, the submission must be signed by an authorized person (ordinarily, the individual officer or employee who submitted the improper report or who should have provided the report that the corporation failed to submit on behalf of the company, or someone in the company with authority to make such a submission).
            (4) Submissions must be made by a means which permits the sender to verify promptly that the report was in fact received by NHTSA and the day it was received by NHTSA.
            (5) Submit the report to Chief Counsel (NCC-10), National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Room 5219, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590.

            § 578.8
            Civil penalty factors under 49 U.S.C. Chapter 301.
            
              (a) General civil penalty factors. This subsection interprets the terms nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation consistent with the factors in 49 U.S.C. 30165(c).
            (1) Nature of the violation means the essential, fundamental character or constitution of the violation. It includes but is not limited to the nature of a safety-related defect or noncompliance. It also includes what the violation involves.
            (2) Circumstances of the violation means the context, facts, and conditions having bearing on the violation.
            (3) Extent of the violation means the range of inclusiveness over which the violation extends including the scope, time frame and/or the degree of the violation. This includes the number of violations and whether the violations are related or unrelated.
            (4) Gravity of the violation means the importance, significance, and/or seriousness of the violation.
            
              (b) Discretionary civil penalty factors. Paragraph (b) of this section interprets the nine discretionary factors in 49 U.S.C. 30165(c)(1) through (9) that NHTSA may apply in making civil penalty amount determinations.
            (1) The nature of the defect or noncompliance means the essential, fundamental characteristic or constitution of the defect or noncompliance. “Defect” is as defined in 49 U.S.C. 30102(a)(2). “Noncompliance” under this factor includes a noncompliance with a Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (“FMVSS”), as well as other violations subject to penalties under 49 U.S.C. 30165. When considering the nature of a safety-related defect or noncompliance with an FMVSS, NHTSA may examine the conditions or circumstances under which the defect or noncompliance arises, the performance problem, and actual and probable consequences of the defect or noncompliance. When considering the nature of the noncompliance with the Safety Act or a regulation promulgated thereunder, NHTSA may also examine the circumstances surrounding the violation.
            (2) Knowledge by the respondent of its obligations under this chapter means all knowledge, legal and factual, actual, presumed and constructive, of the respondent of its obligations under 49 U.S.C. Chapter 301. If a respondent is other than a natural person, including but not limited to a corporation or a partnership, then the knowledge of an employee or employees of that non-natural person may be imputed to that non-natural person. The knowledge of an agent may be imputed to a principal. A person, such as a corporation, with multiple employees may be charged with the knowledge of each employee, regardless of whether the employees have communicated that knowledge among each other, or to a decision maker for the non-natural person.
            (3) The severity of the risk of injury means the gravity of exposure to potential injury and includes the potential for injury or death of drivers, passengers, other motorists, pedestrians, and others. The severity of the risk includes the likelihood of an injury occurring and the population group exposed.
            (4) The occurrence or absence of injury means whether injuries or deaths have occurred as a result of a defect, noncompliance, or other violation of 49 U.S.C. Chapter 301 or Chapter 5 of Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations. NHTSA may also take into consideration allegations of death or injury. The absence of deaths or injuries shall not be dispositive of manufacturer's liability for civil penalties.
            (5) The number of motor vehicles or items of motor vehicle equipment distributed with the defect or noncompliance
              means the total number of vehicles or items of motor vehicle equipment distributed with the defect or noncompliance with an FMVSS or the percentage of vehicles or items of motor vehicle equipment of the subject population with the defect or noncompliance with an FMVSS. If multiple make, model and model years of motor vehicles are affected by the defect or noncompliance with an FMVSS, NHTSA may also consider the percentage of motor vehicles that contain the defect or noncompliance with an FMVSS as a percentage of the manufacturer's total annual production of vehicles. NHTSA may choose to make distinction between those defective or noncompliant products distributed in commerce that consumers received, and those defective or noncompliant products distributed in commerce that consumers have not received.
            (6) Actions taken by the respondent to identify, investigate, or mitigate the condition means actions actually taken, the time frame when those actions were taken, what those actions involved and how they ameliorated or otherwise related to the condition, what remained after those actions were taken, and the speed with which the actions were taken. A failure to act may also be considered. NHTSA may also consider whether the respondent has set up processes to facilitate timely and accurate reporting and timely investigation of potential safety issues, whether it has audited such processes, whether it has provided training to employees on the processes, and whether such processes were followed.
            (7) The appropriateness of such penalty in relation to the size of the business of the respondent, including the potential for undue adverse economic impacts. NHTSA takes the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 into account. Upon a showing that a violator is a small entity, NHTSA may include, but is not limited to, requiring the small entity to correct the violation within a reasonable correction period, considering whether the violation was discovered through the participation by the small entity in a compliance assistance program sponsored by the agency, considering whether the small entity has been subject to multiple enforcement actions by the agency, considering whether the violations involve willful or criminal conduct, considering whether the violations pose serious health, safety or environmental threats, and requiring a good faith effort to comply with the law. NHTSA may also consider the effect of the penalty on ability of the person to continue to operate. NHTSA may consider a person's ability to pay, including in installments over time, any effect of a penalty on the respondent's ability to continue to do business, and relevant financial factors such as liquidity, solvency, and profitability. NHTSA may also consider whether the business has been deliberately undercapitalized.
            (8) Whether the respondent has been assessed civil penalties under this section during the most recent 5 years means whether the respondent has been assessed civil penalties, including a settlement agreement containing a penalty, a consent order or a lawsuit involving a penalty or payment of a civil penalty in the most recent 5 years from the date of the alleged violation, regardless of whether there was any admission of a violation or of liability, under 49 U.S.C. 30165.
            (9) Other appropriate factors means other factors not identified above, including but not limited to aggravating and mitigating factors relating to the violation, such as whether there is a history of violations, whether a person benefitted economically from a violation, the effect of the respondent's conduct on the integrity of programs administered by NHTSA, and whether there was a failure to respond in a complete and timely manner to requests for information or remedial action.

              (2) Each report filed under paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall include production data, as specified in paragraph (a) of 579.21 through 579.26 of this part and shall identify the alleged system or component covered by warranty claim, warranty adjustment, or field report as specified in paragraph (c) of 579.21 through 579.26 of this part.
              (d) Minimal specificity. A claim or notice involving death, a claim or notice involving injury, a claim involving property damage, a consumer complaint, a warranty claim or warranty adjustment, or a field report need not be reported if it does not identify the vehicle or equipment with minimal specificity. If a manufacturer initially receives a claim, notice, complaint, warranty claim, warranty adjustment, or field report in which the vehicle or equipment is not identified with minimal specificity and subsequently obtains information that provides the requisite information needed to identify the product with minimal specificity, the claim, etc. shall be deemed to have been received when the additional information is received. If a manufacturer receives a claim or notice involving death or injury in which the vehicle or equipment is not identified with minimal specificity and the matter is being handled by legal counsel retained by the manufacturer, the manufacturer shall attempt to obtain the missing minimal specificity information from such counsel.
              (e) Claims received by registered agents. A claim received by any registered agent of a manufacturer under the laws of any State, or the agent that any manufacturer offering motor vehicles or motor vehicle equipment for import has designated pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 30164(a), shall be deemed received by the manufacturer.
              (f) Updating of information required in reports. (1) Except as specified in this subsection, a manufacturer need not update its reports under this subpart.
              (2) With respect to each report of an incident submitted under paragraph (b) of §§ 579.21 through 579.26 of this part:
              (i) If a vehicle manufacturer is not aware of the VIN, or a tire manufacturer is not aware of the TIN, at the time the incident is initially reported, the manufacturer shall submit an updated report of such incident in its report covering the reporting period in which the VIN or TIN is identified. A manufacturer need not submit an updated report if the VIN or TIN is identified by the manufacturer in a reporting period that is more than one year later than the initial report to NHTSA.
              (ii) If a manufacturer indicated code 99 in its report because a system or component had not been identified in the claim or notice that led to the report, and the manufacturer becomes aware during a subsequent calendar quarter that one or more of the specified systems or components allegedly contributed to the incident, the manufacturer shall submit an updated report of such incident in its report covering the reporting period in which the involved specified system(s) or component(s) is (are) identified. A manufacturer need not submit an updated report if the system(s) or component(s) is(are) identified by the manufacturer in a reporting period that is more than one year later than the initial report to NHTSA.
              (iii) If one or more systems or components is identified in a manufacturer's report of an incident, the manufacturer need not submit an updated report to reflect additional systems or components allegedly involved in the incident that it becomes aware of in a subsequent reporting period.
              (iv) If the report is of an incident involving an injury and an injured person dies after a manufacturer has reported the injury to NHTSA, the manufacturer need not submit an updated report to NHTSA reflecting that death.
              (g) When a report involving a death is not required. A report on incident(s) involving one or more deaths occurring in a foreign country that is identified in claim(s) against a manufacturer of motor vehicles or motor vehicle equipment involving a vehicle or equipment that is identical or substantially similar to equipment that the manufacturer has offered for sale in the United States need not be furnished if the claim specifically alleges that the death was caused by a possible defect in a component other than one that is common to the vehicle or equipment that the manufacturer has offered for sale in the United States.
              (h) When a report involving a claim or notice is not required. If a manufacturer has reported a claim or notice relating to an incident involving death or injury, the manufacturer need not:
              (1) Report a claim or notice arising out of the incident by a person who was not injured physically, and
              (2) Include in its number of property damage claims a property damage claim arising out of the incident.
              (i) Reporting on behalf of other manufacturers. Whenever a fabricating manufacturer or importer submits a report on behalf of one or more other manufacturers (including a brand name owner), as authorized under § 579.3(b) of this part, the submitting manufacturer must identify each such other manufacturer. Whenever a brand name owner submits a report on its own behalf, it must identify the fabricating manufacturer of each separate product on which it is reporting.
              (j) Abbreviations. Whenever a manufacturer is required to identify a State in which an incident occurred, the manufacturer shall use the two-letter abbreviations established by the United States Postal Service (e.g., AZ for Arizona). Whenever a manufacturer is required to identify a foreign country in which an incident occurred, the manufacturer shall use the English-language name of the country in non-abbreviated form.
              (k) Claims of confidentiality. If a manufacturer claims that any of the information, data, or documents that it submits is entitled to confidential treatment, it must make such claim in accordance with part 512 of this chapter.
              (l) Additional related information that NHTSA may request. In addition to information required periodically under this subpart, NHTSA may request other information that may help identify a defect related to motor vehicle safety.
              (m) Use of the plural. As used in this part, the plural includes the singular and the singular includes the plural to bring within the scope of reporting that which might otherwise be construed to be without the scope.
              (n) Submission of copies of field reports. Copies of field reports required under this subpart shall be submitted not later than 15 days after reports are due pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.

            § 580.1
            Scope.
            This part prescribes rules requiring transferors and lessees of motor vehicles to make written disclosure to transferees and lessors respectively, concerning the odometer mileage and its accuracy as directed by sections 408 (a) and (e) of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act as amended, 15 U.S.C. 1988 (a) and (e). In addition, this part prescribes the rules requiring the retention of odometer disclosure statements by motor vehicle dealers, distributors and lessors and the retention of certain other information by auction companies as directed by sections 408(g) and 414 of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act as amended, 15 U.S.C. 1990(d) and 1988(g).
          
          
            § 580.2
            Purpose.
            The purpose of this part is to provide purchasers of motor vehicles with odometer information to assist them in determining a vehicle's condition and value by making the disclosure of a vehicle's mileage a condition of title and by requiring lessees to disclose to their lessors the vehicle's mileage at the time the lessors transfer the vehicle. In addition, the purpose of this part is to preserve records that are needed for the proper investigation of possible violations of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act and any subsequent prosecutorial, adjudicative or other action.
          
          
            § 580.3
            Definitions.
            All terms defined in sections 2 and 402 of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act are used in their statutory meaning. Other terms used in this part are defined as follows:
            
              Lessee means any person, or the agent for any person, to whom a motor vehicle has been leased for a term of at least 4 months.
            
              Lessor means any person, or the agent for any person, who has leased 5 or more motor vehicles in the past 12 months.
            
              Mileage means actual distance that a vehicle has traveled.
            
              Original power of attorney means, for single copy forms, the document set forth by secure process which is issued by the State, and, for multicopy forms, any and all copies set forth by secure process which are issued by the State.
            
              Secure printing process or other secure process means any process which deters and detects counterfeiting and/or unauthorized reproduction and allows alterations to be visible to the naked eye.
            
              Transferee means any person to whom ownership of a motor vehicle is transferred, by purchase, gift, or any means other than by the creation of a security interest, and any person who, as agent, signs an odometer disclosure statement for the transferee.
            
              Transferor means any person who transfers his ownership of a motor vehicle by sale, gift, or any means other than by the creation of a security interest, and any person who, as agent, signs an odometer disclosure statement for the transferor.

            § 580.4
            Security of title documents and power of attorney forms.
            Each title shall be set forth by means of a secure printing process or other secure process. In addition, power of attorney forms issued pursuant to §§ 580.13 and 580.14 and documents which are used to reassign the title shall be issued by the State and shall be set forth by a secure process.

            § 580.5
            Disclosure of odometer information.
            (a) Each title, at the time it is issued to the transferee, must contain the mileage disclosed by the transferor when ownership of the vehicle was transferred and contain a space for the information required to be disclosed under paragraphs (c), (d), (e) and (f) of this section at the time of future transfer.
            (b) Any documents which are used to reassign a title shall contain a space for the information required to be disclosed under paragraphs (c), (d), (e) and (f) of this section at the time of transfer of ownership.
            (c) In connection with the transfer of ownership of a motor vehicle, each transferor shall disclose the mileage to the transferee in writing on the title or, except as noted below, on the document being used to reassign the title. In the case of a transferor in whose name the vehicle is titled, the transferor shall disclose the mileage on the title, and not on a reassignment document. This written disclosure must be signed by the transferor, including the printed name. In connection with the transfer of ownership of a motor vehicle in which more than one person is a transferor, only one transferor need sign the written disclosure. In addition to the signature and printed name of the transferor, the written disclosure must contain the following information:
            (1) The odometer reading at the time of transfer (not to include tenths of miles);
            (2) The date of transfer;
            (3) The transferor's name and current address;
            (4) The transferee's name and current address; and
            (5) The identity of the vehicle, including its make, model, year, and body type, and its vehicle identification number.
            (d) In addition to the information provided under paragraph (c) of this section, the statement shall refer to the Federal law and shall state that failure to complete or providing false information may result in fines and/or imprisonment. Reference may also be made to applicable State law.
            (e) In addition to the information provided under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section,
            (1) The transferor shall certify that to the best of his knowledge the odometer reading reflects the actual mileage, or;
            (2) If the transferor knows that the odometer reading reflects the amount of mileage in excess of the designed mechanical odometer limit, he shall include a statement to that effect; or

            (3) If the transferor knows that the odometer reading differs from the mileage and that the difference is greater than that caused by odometer calibration error, he shall include a statement that the odometer reading does not reflect the actual mileage, and should not be relied upon. This statement shall also include a warning notice to alert the transferee that a discrepancy exists between the odometer reading and the actual mileage.
            (f) The transferee shall sign the disclosure statement, print his name, and return a copy to his transferor.
            (g) If the vehicle has not been titled or if the title does not contain a space for the information required, the written disclosure shall be executed as a separate document.
            (h) No person shall sign an odometer disclosure statement as both the transferor and transferee in the same transaction, unless permitted by §§ 580.13 or 580.14.

            § 580.7
            Disclosure of odometer information for leased motor vehicles.
            (a) Before executing any transfer of ownership document, each lessor of a leased motor vehicle shall notify the lessee in writing that the lessee is required to provide a written disclosure to the lessor regarding the mileage. This notice shall contain a reference to the federal law and shall state that failure to complete or providing false information may result in fines and/or imprisonment. Reference may also be made to applicable State law.
            (b) In connection with the transfer of ownership of the leased motor vehicle, the lessee shall furnish to the lessor a written statement regarding the mileage of the vehicle.

            (c) In addition to the information provided under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section,
            (1) The lessee shall certify that to the best of his knowledge the odometer reading reflects the actual mileage; or
            (2) If the lessee knows that the odometer reading reflects the amount of mileage in excess of the designed mechanical odometer limit, he shall include a statement to that effect; or
            (3) If the lessee knows that the odometer reading differs from the mileage and that the difference is greater than that caused by odometer calibration error, he shall include a statement that the odometer reading is not the actual mileage and should not be relied upon.
            (d) If the lessor transfers the leased vehicle without obtaining possession of it, the lessor may indicate on the title the mileage disclosed by the lessee under paragraph (b) and (c) of this section, unless the lessor has reason to believe that the disclosure by the lessee does not reflect the actual mileage of the vehicle.

            (c) The agency will respond to the applicant, in writing, and provide a list of the Federal statutory and/or regulatory requirements that the State may have failed to include in its proposal and indicate if any sections of the proposal appear to conflict with Federal requirements.
          
          
            § 580.11
            Petition for approval of alternate disclosure requirements.
            (a) A State may petition NHTSA for approval of disclosure requirements which differ from the disclosure requirements of § 580.5, § 580.7, or § 580.13(f) of this part.
            (b) Each petition filed under this section shall—
            (1) Be written in the English language;
            (2) Be submitted to the Office of Chief Counsel, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590;
            (3) Set forth the motor vehicle disclosure requirements in effect in the State, including a copy of the applicable State law or regulation; and
            (4) Explain how the State motor vehicle disclosure requirements are consistent with the purposes of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act.

            (c) Notice of the petition and an initial determination pending a 30-day comment period will be published in the Federal Register. Notice of final grant or denial of a petition for approval of alternate motor vehicle disclosure requirements will be published in the Federal Register. The effect of the grant of a petition is to relieve a State from responsibility to conform the State disclosure requirements with § 580.5, § 580.7, or § 580.13(f), as applicable, for as long as the approved alternate disclosure requirements remain in effect in that State. The effect of a denial is to require a State to conform to the requirements of § 580.5, § 580.7 or § 580.13(f), as applicable, of this part until such time as the NHTSA approves any alternate motor vehicle disclosure requirements.

            § 580.12
            Petition for extension of time.

            (a) If a State cannot conform its laws to achieve compliance with this part by April 29, 1989, the State may petition for an extension of time.
            
            (b) Each petition filed under this section shall—
            (1) Be written in the English language;
            (2) Be submitted, by February 28, 1989, to the Office of Chief Counsel, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC, 20590;
            (3) Set forth a chronological analysis of the efforts the State has taken to meet the deadline, the reasons why it did not do so, the length of time desired for extension and a description of the steps to be taken while the extension is in effect.

            (c) Notice of either the grant or denial of the petition is issued to the petitioner and will be published in the Federal Register.
            
            (d) A petition for a renewal of an extension of time must be filed no later than 30 days prior to the termination of the extension of time granted by the Agency. A petition for a renewal of an extension of time must meet the same requirements as the original petition for an extension of time.
            (e) If a petition for a renewal of the extension of time which meets the requirements of § 580.12(b) is filed, the extension of time will continue until a decision is made on the renewal petition.
          
          
            § 580.13
            Disclosure of odometer information by power of attorney.
            (a) If the transferor's title is physically held by a lienholder, or if the transferor to whom the title was issued by the State has lost his title and the transferee obtains a duplicate title on behalf of the transferor, and if otherwise permitted by State law, the transferor may give a power of attorney to his transferee for the purpose of mileage disclosure. The power of attorney shall be on a form issued by the State to the transferee that is set forth by means of a secure printing process or other secure process, and shall contain, in part A, a space for the information required to be disclosed under paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section. If a State permits the use of a power of attorney in the situation described in § 580.14(a), the form must also contain, in part B, a space for the information required to be disclosed under § 580.14, and, in part C, a space for the certification required to be made under § 580.15.
            (b) In connection with the transfer of ownership of a motor vehicle, each transferor to whom a title was issued by the State whose title is physically held by a lienholder or whose title has been lost, and who elects to give his transferee a power of attorney for the purpose of mileage disclosure, must appoint the transferee his attorney-in-fact for the purpose of mileage disclosure and disclose the mileage on the power of attorney form issued by the State. This written disclosure must be signed by the transferor, including the printed name, and contain the following information:
            (1) The odometer reading at the time of transfer (not to include tenths of miles);
            (2) The date of transfer;
            (3) The transferor's name and current address;
            (4) The transferee's name and current address; and
            (5) The identity of the vehicle, including its make, model year, body type and vehicle identification number.
            (c) In addition to the information provided under paragraph (b) of this section, the power of attorney form shall refer to the Federal odometer law and state that providing false information or the failure of the person granted the power of attorney to submit the form to the State may result in fines and/or imprisonment. Reference may also be made to applicable State law.
            (d) In addition to the information provided under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section:
            (1) The transferor shall certify that to the best of his knowledge the odometer reading reflects the actual mileage; or
            (2) If the transferor knows that the odometer reading reflects mileage in excess of the designed mechanical odometer limit, he shall include a statement to that effect; or

            (3) If the transferor knows that the odometer reading differs from the mileage and the difference is greater than that caused by a calibration error, he shall include a statement that the odometer reading does not reflect the actual mileage and should not be relied upon. This statement shall also include a warning notice to alert the transferee that a discrepancy exists between the odometer reading and the actual mileage.
            (e) The transferee shall sign the power of attorney form, print his name, and return a copy of the power of attorney form to the transferor.
            (f) Upon receipt of the transferor's title, the transferee shall complete the space for mileage disclosure on the title exactly as the mileage was disclosed by the transferor on the power of attorney form. The transferee shall submit the original power of attorney form to the State that issued it, with a copy of the transferor's title or with the actual title when the transferee submits a new title application at the same time. The State shall retain the power of attorney form and title for three years or a period equal to the State titling record retention period, whichever is shorter. If the mileage disclosed on the power of attorney form is lower than the mileage appearing on the title, the power of attorney is void and the dealer shall not complete the mileage disclosure on the title.

            (a) In circumstances where part A of a secure power of attorney form has been used pursuant to § 580.13 of this part, and if otherwise permitted by State law, a transferee may give a power of attorney to his transferor to review the title and any reassignment documents for mileage discrepancies, and if no discrepancies are found, to acknowledge disclosure on the title. The power of attorney shall be on part B of the form referred to in § 580.13(a), which shall contain a space for the information required to be disclosed under paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section and, in part C, a space for the certification required to be made under § 580.15.
            (b) The power of attorney must include a mileage disclosure from the transferor to the transferee and must be signed by the transferor, including the printed name, and contain the following information:

This certification shall be under part C of the same form as the powers of attorney executed under §§ 580.13 and 580.14 and shall include:
            (1) The signature and printed name of the person exercising the power of attorney;
            (2) The address of the person exercising the power of attorney; and
            (3) The date of the certification.

            1. Methods to deter or detect counterfeiting and/or unauthorized reproduction.
            (a) Intaglio printing—a printing process utilized in the production of bank-notes and other security documents whereby an engraved plate meets the paper under extremely high pressure forcing the paper into the incisions below the surface of the plate.
            (b) Intaglio Printing With Latent Images—a printing process utilized in the production of bank-notes and other security documents whereby an engraved plate meets the paper under extremely high pressure forcing the paper into the incisions below the surface of the plate. The three dimensional nature of intaglio printing creates latent images that aid in verification of authenticity and deter counterfeiting.

            (c) High Resolution Printing—a printing process which achieves excellent art clarity and detail quality approaching that of the intaglio process.
            (d) Micro-line Printing—a reduced line of type that appears to be a solid line to the naked eye but contains readable intelligence under strong magnification.
            (e) Pantograph Void Feature—wording incorporated into a pantograph by varying screen density in the pantograph. The wording will appear when attempts are made to photocopy on color copiers.
            (f) Hologram—a defraction foil substrate, produced from a negative which was made by splitting a laser beam into two separate beams to produce a three dimensional effect.
            (g) Security Paper—paper containing a security watermark and/or a security thread.
            2. Methods to allow alterations to be visible to the naked eye.
            (a) Erasure Sensitive Background Inks—a process whereby the text is printed in a dark color ink over a fine line erasure-sensitive prismatic ink tint.
            (b) Security Lamination—retro-reflective security laminate is placed over vital information after it has been entered to allow for detection of attempts to alter this information.
            (c) Security Paper—paper which has been chemically treated to detect chemical alterations.

              MARCH [YEAR TO BE INSERTED]
              COMPARISON OF DIFFERENCES IN INSURANCE COSTS FOR PASSENGER CARS, STATION WAGONS/PASSENGER VANS, PICKUPS AND UTILITY VEHICLES ON THE BASIS OF DAMAGE SUSCEPTIBILITY
              The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has provided the information in this booklet in compliance with Federal law as an aid to consumers considering the purchase of a new vehicle. The booklet compares differences in insurance costs for different makes and models of passenger cars, station wagons/passenger vans, pickups, and utility vehicles on the basis of damage susceptibility. However, it does not indicate a vehicle's relative safety.

              The following table contains the best available information regarding the effect of damage susceptibility on insurance premiums. It was taken from data compiled by the Highway Loss Data Institute (HLDI) in its December [YEAR TO BE INSERTED] Insurance Collision Report, and reflects the collision loss experience of passenger cars, utility vehicles, light trucks, and vans sold in the United States in terms of the average loss payment per insured vehicle year for [THREE APPROPRIATE YEARS TO BE INSERTED]. NHTSA has not verified the data in this table.
              The table represents vehicles' collision loss experience in relative terms, with 100 representing the average for all passenger vehicles. Thus, a rating of 122 reflects a collision loss experience that is 22 percent higher (worse) than average, while a rating of 96 reflects a collision loss experience that is 4 percent lower (better) than average. The table is not relevant for models that have been substantially redesigned for [YEAR TO BE INSERTED], and it does not include information about models without enough claim experience.
              Although many insurance companies use the HLDI information to adjust the “base rate” for the collision portion of their insurance premiums, the amount of any such adjustment is usually small. It is unlikely that your total premium will vary more than ten percent depending upon the collision loss experience of a particular vehicle.
              If you do not purchase collision coverage or your insurance company does not use the HLDI information, your premium will not vary at all in relation to these rankings.

              In addition, different insurance companies often charge different premiums for the same driver and vehicle. Therefore, you should contact insurance companies or their agents directly to determine the actual premium that you will be charged for insuring a particular vehicle.
              
              
                Please Note: In setting insurance premiums, insurance companies mainly rely on factors that are not directly related to the vehicle itself (except for its value). Rather, they mainly consider driver characteristics (such as age, gender, marital status, and driving record), the geographic area in which the vehicle is driven, how many miles are traveled, and how the vehicle is used. Therefore, to obtain complete information about insurance premiums, you should contact insurance companies or their agents directly.
              
              Insurance companies do not generally adjust their premiums on the basis of data reflecting the crashworthiness of different vehicles. However, some companies adjust their premiums for personal injury protection and medical payments coverage if the insured vehicle has features that are likely to improve its crashworthiness, such as air bags and automatic seat belts.

              Test data relating to vehicle crashworthiness and rollover ratings are available from NHTSA's New Car Assessment Program (NCAP). NCAP test results demonstrate relative frontal and side crash protection in new vehicles, and relative rollover resistance. Information on vehicles that NHTSA has tested in the NCAP program can be obtained from http://www.safercar.gov or by calling NHTSA's toll-free Vehicle Safety Hotline at 1-888-327-4236 (TTY: 1-800-424-9153).

            § 583.1
            Scope.
            This part establishes requirements for the disclosure of information relating to the countries of origin of the equipment of new passenger motor vehicles.
          
          
            § 583.2
            Purpose.
            The purpose of this part is to aid potential purchasers in the selection of new passenger motor vehicles by providing them with information about the value of the U.S./Canadian and foreign parts content of each vehicle, the countries of origin of the engine and transmission, and the site of the vehicle's final assembly.
          
          
            § 583.3
            Applicability.
            This part applies to manufacturers of new passenger motor vehicles manufactured or imported for sale in the United States, suppliers of passenger motor vehicle equipment, and dealers of new passenger motor vehicles.
          
          
            § 583.4
            Definitions.
            (a) Statutory terms. The terms allied supplier, carline, country of origin, dealer, foreign content, manufacturer, new passenger motor vehicle, of U.S./Canadian origin, outside supplier, passenger motor vehicle, passenger motor vehicle equipment, percentage (by value), State, and value added in the United States and Canada, defined in 49 U.S.C. 32304(a), are used in accordance with their statutory meanings except as further defined in paragraph (b) of this section.
            (b) Other terms and further definitions.
            
            (1) Administrator means the Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
            (2) Allied supplier means a supplier of passenger motor vehicle equipment that is wholly owned by the manufacturer, or in the case of a joint venture vehicle assembly arrangement, any supplier that is wholly owned by one member of the joint venture arrangement. A supplier is considered to be wholly owned by the manufacturer if a common parent company owns both the manufacturer and the supplier, or if a group of related companies own both the manufacturer and the supplier and no outside interests (interests other than the manufacturer itself or companies which own the manufacturer) own the supplier.
            (3) Carline means a name denoting a group of vehicles which has a degree of commonality in construction (e.g., body, chassis). Carline does not consider any level of decor or opulence and is not generally distinguished by such characteristics as roof line, number of doors, seats, or windows, except for light duty trucks. Carline is not distinguished by country of manufacture, final assembly point, engine type, or driveline. Light duty trucks are considered to be different carlines than passenger cars. A carline includes all motor vehicles of a given nameplate. Special purpose vehicles, vans, and pickup trucks are classified as separate carlines.
            (4) Final assembly means all operations involved in the assembly of a vehicle, performed at the final assembly point including but not limited to assembly of body panels, painting, final chassis assembly, trim installation, except engine and transmission fabrication and assembly and the fabrication of motor vehicle equipment components produced at the same final assembly point using forming processes such as stamping, machining or molding processes.
            (5) Final assembly point means the plant, factory, or other place, which is a building or series of buildings in close proximity, where a new passenger motor vehicle is produced or assembled from passenger motor vehicle equipment and from which such vehicle is delivered to a dealer or importer in such a condition that all component parts necessary to the mechanical operation of such automobile are included with such vehicle whether or not such component parts are permanently installed in or on such vehicle. For multi-stage vehicles, the final assembly point is the location where the first stage vehicle is assembled.
            (6) Outside supplier means:
            (i) A non-allied supplier of passenger motor vehicle equipment to a manufacturer's allied supplier and
            (ii) Anyone other than an allied supplier who ships directly to the manufacturer's final assembly point.
            (7) Passenger motor vehicle equipment means any system, subassembly, or component received at the final assembly point for installation on, or attachment to, such vehicle at the time of its initial shipment by the manufacturer to a dealer for sale to an ultimate purchaser. Passenger motor vehicle equipment also includes any system, subassembly, or component received by an allied supplier from an outside supplier for incorporation into equipment supplied by the allied supplier to the manufacturer with which it is allied.
            (8) Person means an individual, partnership, corporation, business trust, or any organized group of persons.
            (9) Ultimate purchaser means with respect to any new passenger motor vehicle, the first person, other than a dealer purchasing in its capacity as a dealer, who in good faith purchases such new passenger motor vehicle for purposes other than resale.

            [59 FR 37330, July 21, 1994, as amended at 60 FR 14229, Mar. 16, 1995; 60 FR 47893, Sept. 15, 1995; 64 FR 40780, July 28, 1999]
          
          
            § 583.6
            Procedure for determining U.S./Canadian parts content.

            (a) Each manufacturer, except as specified in § 583.5 (f) and (g), shall determine the percentage U.S./Canadian Parts Content for each carline on a model year basis. This determination shall be made before the beginning of each model year. Items of equipment produced at the final assembly point (but not as part of final assembly) are treated in the same manner as if they were supplied by an allied supplier. All value otherwise added at the final assembly point and beyond, including all final assembly costs, is excluded from the calculation of U.S./Canadian parts content. The country of origin of nuts, bolts, clips, screws, pins, braces, gasoline, oil, blackout, phosphate rinse, windshield washer fluid, fasteners, tire assembly fluid, rivets, adhesives, grommets, and wheel weights, used in final assembly of the vehicle, is considered to be the country where final assembly of the vehicle takes place.
            (b) Determining the value of items of equipment. (1) For items of equipment received at the final assembly point, the value is the price paid by the manufacturer for the equipment as delivered to the final assembly point.
            (2) For items of equipment produced at the final assembly point (but not as part of final assembly), the value is the fair market price that a manufacturer of similar size and location would pay a supplier for such equipment.
            (3) For items of equipment received at the factory or plant of an allied supplier, the value is the price paid by the allied supplier for the equipment as delivered to its factory or plant.
            (c) Determining the U.S./Canadian percentage of the value of items of equipment. (1) Equipment supplied by an outside supplier to a manufacturer or allied supplier is considered:
            (i) 100 percent U.S./Canadian, if 70 percent or more of its value is added in the United States and/or Canada; and
            (ii) To otherwise have the actual percent of its value added in the United States and/or Canada, rounded to the nearest five percent.
            (2) The extent to which an item of equipment supplied by an allied supplier is considered U.S./Canadian is determined by dividing the value added in the United States and/or Canada by the total value of the equipment. The resulting number is multiplied by 100 to determine the percentage U.S./Canadian content of the equipment.
            (3) In determining the value added in the United States and/or Canada of equipment supplied by an allied supplier, any equipment that is delivered to the allied supplier by an outside supplier and is incorporated into the allied supplier's equipment, is considered:
            (i) 100 percent U.S./Canadian, if at least 70 percent of its value is added in the United States and/or Canada; and
            (ii) To otherwise have the actual percent of its value added in the United States and/or Canada, rounded to the nearest five percent.
            (4)(i) Value added in the United States and/or Canada by an allied supplier or outside supplier includes—
            (A) The value added in the U.S. and/or Canada for materials used by the supplier, determined according to (4)(ii) for outside suppliers and (4)(iii) for allied suppliers, plus,
            (B) For passenger motor vehicle equipment assembled or produced in the U.S. or Canada, the value of the difference between the price paid by the manufacturer or allied supplier for the equipment, as delivered to its factory or plant, and the total value of the materials in the equipment.
            (ii) Outside suppliers of passenger motor vehicle equipment will determine the value added in the U.S. and/or Canada for materials in the equipment as specified in paragraphs (A) and (B).
            (A)(1) For any material used by the supplier which was produced or assembled in the U.S. or Canada, the supplier will subtract from the total value of the material any value that was not added in the U.S. and/or Canada. The determination of the value that was not added in the U.S. and/or Canada shall be a good faith estimate based on information that is available to the supplier, e.g., information in its records, information it can obtain from its suppliers, the supplier's knowledge of manufacturing processes, etc.
            (2) The supplier shall consider the amount of value added and the location in which that value was added—
            (i) At each earlier stage, counting from the time of receipt of a material by the supplier, back to and including the two closest stages each of which represented a substantial transformation into a new and different product with a different name, character and use.
            (ii) The value of materials used to produce a product in the earliest of these two substantial transformation stages shall be treated as value added in the country in which that stage occurred.

            (B) For any material used by the supplier which was imported into the United States or Canada from a third country, the value added in the United States and/or Canada is presumed to be zero. However, if documentation is available to the supplier which identifies value added in the United States and/or Canada for that material (determined according to the principles set forth in (A), such value added in the United States and/or Canada is counted.
            (iii) Allied suppliers of passenger motor vehicle equipment shall determine the value that is added in the U.S. and/or Canada for materials in the equipment in accordance with (c)(3).
            (iv) For the minor items listed in the § 583.4 definition of “passenger motor vehicle equipment” as being excluded from that term, outside and allied suppliers may, to the extent that they incorporate such items into their equipment, treat the cost of the minor items as value added in the country of assembly.
            (v) For passenger motor vehicle equipment which is imported into the territorial boundaries of the United States or Canada from a third country, the value added in the United States and/or Canada is presumed to be zero. However, if documentation is available to the supplier which identifies value added in the United States and/or Canada for that equipment (determined according to the principles set forth in the rest of (c)(4)), such value added in the United States and/or Canada is counted.
            (vi) The payment of duty does not result in value added in the United States and/or Canada.
            (5) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(6) of this section, if a manufacturer or allied supplier does not receive information from one or more of its suppliers concerning the U.S./Canadian content of particular equipment, the U.S./Canadian content of that equipment is considered zero. This provision does not affect the obligation of manufacturers and allied suppliers to request this information from their suppliers or the obligation of the suppliers to provide the information.
            (6) If a manufacturer or allied supplier requests information in a timely manner from one or more of its outside suppliers concerning the U.S./Canadian content of particular equipment, but does not receive that information despite a good faith effort to obtain it, the manufacturer or allied supplier may make its own good faith value added determinations, subject to the following provisions:
            (i) The manufacturer or allied supplier shall make the same value added determinations as would be made by the outside supplier;
            (ii) The manufacturer or allied supplier shall consider the amount of value added and the location in which the value was added for all of the stages that the outside supplier would be required to consider;
            (iii) The manufacturer or allied supplier may determine that particular value is added in the United States and/or Canada only if it has a good faith basis to make that determination;
            (iv) A manufacturer and its allied suppliers may, on a combined basis, make value added determinations for no more than 10 percent, by value, of a carline's total parts content from outside suppliers;
            (v) Value added determinations made by a manufacturer or allied supplier under this paragraph shall have the same effect as if they were made by the outside supplier;
            (vi) This provision does not affect the obligation of outside suppliers to provide the requested information.
            (d) Determination of the U.S./Canadian percentage of the total value of a carline's passenger motor vehicle equipment. The percentage of the value of a carline's passenger motor vehicle equipment that is U.S./Canadian is determined by—
            (1) Adding the total value of all of the equipment (regardless of country of origin) expected to be installed in that carline during the next model year;
            (2) Dividing the value of the U.S./Canadian content of such equipment by the amount calculated in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, and
            (3) Multiplying the resulting number by 100.
            (e) Alternative calculation procedures. (1) A manufacturer may submit a petition to use calculation procedures based on representative or statistical sampling, as an alternative to the calculation procedures specified in this section to determine U.S./Canadian parts content and major sources of foreign parts content.
            (2) Each petition must—
            (i) Be submitted at least 120 days before the manufacturer would use the alternative procedure;
            (ii) Be written in the English language;
            (iii) Be submitted in three copies to: Administrator, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590;
            (iv) State the full name and address of the manufacturer;
            (v) Set forth in full the data, views and arguments of the manufacturer that would support granting the petition, including—
            (A) the alternative procedure, and
            (B) analysis demonstrating that the alternative procedure will produce substantially equivalent results to the procedure set forth in this section;
            (vi) Specify and segregate any part of the information and data submitted in the petition that is requested to be withheld from public disclosure in accordance with part 512 of this chapter (the basic alternative procedure and basic supporting analysis must be provided as public information, but confidential business information may also be used in support of the petition).

            § 583.7
            Procedure for determining major foreign sources of passenger motor vehicle equipment.
            (a) Each manufacturer, except as specified in § 583.5(f) and (g), shall determine the countries, if any, which are major foreign sources of passenger motor vehicle equipment and the percentages attributable to each such country for each carline on a model year basis, before the beginning of each model year. The manufacturer need only determine this information for the two such countries with the highest percentages. Items of equipment produced at the final assembly point (but not as part of final assembly) are treated in the same manner as if they were supplied by an allied supplier. In making determinations under this section, the U.S. and Canada are treated together as if they were one (non-foreign) country. The country of origin of nuts, bolts, clips, screws, pins, braces, gasoline, oil, blackout, phosphate rinse, windshield washer fluid, fasteners, tire assembly fluid, rivets, adhesives, grommets, and wheel weights, used in final assembly of the vehicle, is considered to be the country where final assembly of the vehicle takes place.
            (b) Determining the value of items of equipment. The value of each item of equipment is determined in the manner specified in § 583.6(b).
            (c) Determining the country of origin of items of equipment. (1) Except as provided in (c)(2), the country of origin of each item is the country which contributes the greatest amount of value added to that item (treating the U.S. and Canada together).

            (2) Instead of making country of origin determinations in the manner specified in (c)(1), a manufacturer may, at its option, use any other methodology that is used for customs purposes (U.S. or foreign), so long as a consistent methodology is employed for all items of equipment, and the U.S. and Canada are treated together.
            (d) Determination of the percentage of the total value of a carline's passenger motor vehicle equipment which is attributable to individual countries other than the U.S. and Canada. The percentage of the value of a carline's passenger motor vehicle equipment that is attributable to each country other than the U.S. and Canada is determined on a model year basis by—
            (1) Adding up the total value of all of the passenger motor vehicle equipment (regardless of country of origin) expected to be installed in that carline during the next model year;
            (2) Adding up the value of such equipment which originated in each country other than the U.S. or Canada;
            (3) Dividing the amount calculated in paragraph (d)(2) of this section for each country by the amount calculated in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, and multiplying each result by 100.
            (e) A country is a major foreign source of passenger motor vehicle equipment for a carline only if the country is one other than the U.S. or Canada and if 15 or more percent of the total value of the carline's passenger motor vehicle equipment is attributable to the country.
            (f) In determining the percentage of the total value of a carline's passenger motor vehicle equipment which is attributable to individual countries other than the U.S. and Canada, no value which is counted as U.S./Canadian parts content is also counted as being value which originated in a country other than the U.S. or Canada.

            § 583.8
            Procedure for determining country of origin for engines and transmissions (for purposes of determining the information specified by §§ 583.5(a)(4) and 583.5(a)(5) only).
            (a) Each supplier of an engine or transmission shall determine the country of origin once a year for each engine and transmission. The origin of engines shall be calculated for engines of the same displacement produced at the same plant. The origin for transmissions shall be calculated for transmissions of the same type produced at the same plant. Transmissions are of the same type if they have the same attributes including: Drive line application, number of forward gears, controls, and layout. The U.S. and Canada are treated separately in making such determination.
            (b) The value of an engine or transmission is determined by first adding the prices paid by the manufacturer of the engine/transmission for each component comprising the engine/transmission, as delivered to the assembly plant of the engine/transmission, and the fair market value of each individual part produced at the plant. The assembly and labor costs incurred for the final assembly of the engine/transmission are then added to determine the value of the engine or transmission.
            (c) Determining the country of origin of components. (1) Except as provided in (c)(2), the country of origin of each item of equipment is the country which contributes the greatest amount of value added to that item (the U.S. and Canada are treated separately).
            (2) Instead of making country of origin determinations in the manner specified in (c)(1), a manufacturer may, at its option, use any other methodology that is used for customs purposes (U.S. or foreign), so long as a consistent methodology is employed for all components.
            (d) Determination of the total value of an engine/transmission which is attributable to individual countries. The value of an engine/transmission that is attributable to each country is determined by adding the total value of all of the components installed in that engine/transmission which originated in that country. For the country where final assembly of the engine/transmission takes place, the assembly and labor costs incurred for such final assembly are also added.

            (e) The country of origin of each engine and the country of origin of each transmission is the country which contributes the greatest amount of value added to that item of equipment (the U.S. and Canada are treated separately).

            § 583.9
            Attachment and maintenance of label.
            (a) Attachment of the label. (1) Except as provided in (a)(2), each manufacturer shall cause the label required by § 583.5 to be affixed to each new passenger motor vehicle before the vehicle is delivered to a dealer.
            (2) For vehicles which are delivered to a dealer prior to the introduction date for the model in question, each manufacturer shall cause the label required by § 583.5 to be affixed to the vehicle prior to such introduction date.
            (b) Maintenance of the label. (1) Each dealer shall cause to be maintained each label on the new passenger motor vehicles it receives until after such time as a vehicle has been sold to a consumer for purposes other than resale.
            (2) If the manufacturer of a passenger motor vehicle provides a substitute label containing corrected information, the dealer shall replace the original label with the substitute label.
            (3) If a label becomes damaged so that the information it contains is not legible, the dealer shall replace it with an identical, undamaged label.

              § 587.13
              General description.
              The offset deformable barrier is comprised of two elements: a fixed rigid barrier and a deformable face (Figure 1). The fixed rigid barrier is adequate to not deflect or displace more than 10 mm during the vehicle impact. The deformable face consists of aluminum honeycomb and aluminum covering.

              § 587.15
              Verification of aluminum honeycomb crush strength.
              The following procedure is used to ascertain the crush strength of the main honeycomb block and the bumper element honeycomb, as specified in §§ 587.14(a)(2) and 587.14(b)(2).
              (a) Sample locations. To ensure uniformity of crush strength across the whole of the deformable face, 8 samples are taken from 4 locations evenly spaced across the honeycomb material. Seven of these 8 samples must meet the crush strength requirements when tested in accordance with the following sections. The location of the samples depends on the size of the honeycomb material being tested. Four samples, each measuring 300 mm (11.8 in) × 300 mm (11.8 in) × 25 mm (1 in) thick are cut from the honeycomb material. (See Figure 2 for how to locate these samples on two different sizes of honeycomb material.) Each of these larger samples is cut into samples of the size specified in § 587.15(b). Verification is based on the testing of two samples from each of the four locations. The other two samples are retained for future verification, if necessary.
              (b) Sample size. Samples of the following size are used for testing. The length is 150 mm (5.9 in) ±6 mm (0.24 in), the width is 150 mm (5.9 in) ±6 mm (0.24 in), and the thickness is 25 mm (1 in) ±2 mm (0.08 in). The walls of incomplete cells around the edge of the sample are trimmed as follows (See Figure 3). In the width (“W”) direction, the fringes (“f”) are no greater than 1.8 mm (0.07 in); in the length (“L”) direction, the fringes (“e”) are at least half the length of one bonded cell wall (“d”) (in the ribbon direction).
              (c) Area measurement. The length of the sample is measured in three locations, 12.7 mm (0.5 in) from each end and in the middle, and recorded as L1, L2, and L3 (Figure 3). In the same manner, the width is measured and recorded as W1, W2, and W3 (Figure 3). These measurements are taken on the centerline of the thickness. The crush area is then calculated as:
              
                ER31MR00.013
              
              (d) Crush rate and distance. The sample is crushed at a rate of not less than 5.1 mm/min (0.2 in/ min) and not more than 7.6 mm/min (0.29 in/min). The minimum crush distance is 16.5 mm (0.65 in). Force versus deflection data are collected in either analog or digital form for each sample tested. If analog data are collected, a means of converting the data to digital data must be made available. All digital data are collected at a rate consistent with SAE Recommended Practice J211/1 Rev. MAR 95 (see § 587.12).
              (e) Crush strength determination. Ignore all data prior to 6.4 mm (0.25 in) of crush and after 16.5 mm (0.65 in) of crush. Divide the remaining data into three sections or displacement intervals (n = 1, 2, 3) (see Figure 4) as follows. Interval one is from 6.4-9.7 mm (0.25-0.38 in) deflection, inclusive. Interval two is from 9.7-13.2 mm (0.38-0.52 in) deflection, exclusive. Interval three is from 13.2-16.5 mm (0.52-0.65 in) deflection, inclusive. Find the average for each section as follows:
              
                ER31MR00.014
              
              
                where m represents the number of data points measured in each of the three intervals. Calculate the crush strength of each section as follows:
              
              
                ER31MR00.015
              
              (f) Sample crush strength specification. For a honeycomb sample to meet crush strength requirements, the following condition must be met. For the 0.342 MPa (49.6 psi) material, the strength must be equal to or greater than 0.308 MPa (45 psi) but less than or equal to 0.342 MPa (49.6 psi) for all three compression intervals. For the 1.711 MPa (248 psi) material the strength must be equal to or greater than 1.540 MPa (223 psi) but less than or equal to 1.711 MPa (248 psi) for all three compression intervals.
              (g) Testing hardware. (1) The hardware used to verify crush strength is capable of applying a load of 13.3 kN (3,000 lb), over at least a 16.5 mm (0.65 in) stroke. The crush rate is constant and known. To ensure that the load is applied to the entire sample, the top and bottom crush plates are no smaller than 165 mm by 165 mm (6.5 in × 6.5 in). The engaging surfaces of the crush plates have a roughness approximately equivalent to 60 grit sandpaper. The bottom crush plate is marked to ensure that the applied load is centered on the sample.
              (2) The crush plate assemblies have an average angular rigidity (about axes normal to the direction of crush) of at least 1017 Nm/deg (750 ft-lb/deg), over the range of 0 to 203 Nm (0 to 150 ft-lb) applied torque.
            
            
              § 587.16
              Adhesive bonding procedure.

              Immediately before bonding, aluminum sheet surfaces to be bonded are thoroughly cleaned using a suitable solvent, such as 1-1-1 Trichloroethane. This is carried out at least twice and more often if required to eliminate grease or dirt deposits. The cleaned surfaces are abraded using 120 grit abrasive paper. Metallic/silicon carbide abrasive paper is not to be used. The surfaces are thoroughly abraded and the abrasive paper changed regularly during the process to avoid clogging, which could lead to a polishing effect. Following abrading, the surfaces are thoroughly cleaned again, as above. In total, the surfaces are solvent-cleaned at least four times. All dust and deposits left as a result of the abrading process are removed, as these can adversely affect bonding. The adhesive is applied to one surface only, using a ribbed rubber roller. In cases where honeycomb is to be bonded to aluminum sheet, the adhesive is applied to the aluminum sheet only. A maximum pressure of 0.5 kg/m2 (11.9 lb/ft2) is applied evenly over the surface, giving a maximum film thickness of 0.5 mm (0.02 in).
            
            
              § 587.17
              Construction.
              (a) The main honeycomb block is bonded to the backing sheet with adhesive such that the cell axes are perpendicular to the sheet. The cladding sheet is adhesively bonded to the front surface of the main honeycomb block. The top and bottom surfaces of the cladding sheet are not bonded to the main honeycomb block but are positioned close to it. The cladding sheet is adhesively bonded to the backing sheet at the mounting flanges. The bumper element honeycomb is adhesively bonded to the front of the cladding sheet such that the cell axes are perpendicular to the sheet. The bottom of the bumper element honeycomb is flush with the bottom surface of the cladding sheet. The bumper facing sheet is adhesively bonded to the front of the bumper element honeycomb.
              (b) The bumper element honeycomb is divided into three equal sections by means of two horizontal slots. These slots are cut through the entire depth of the bumper element and extend the whole width of the bumper. The slots are cut using a saw; their width is the width of the blade used which do not exceed 4.0 mm (0.16 in).
              (c) Clearance holes for mounting the deformable face are drilled in the cladding sheet mounting flanges (shown in Figure 5). The holes are 20 mm (0.79 in) in diameter. Five holes are drilled in the top flange at a distance of 40 mm (1.57 in) from the top edge of the flange and five holes in the bottom flange at a distance of 40 mm (1.6 in) from the bottom edge of the flange. The holes are spaced at 100 mm (3.9 in), 300 mm (11.8 in), 500 mm (19.7 in), 700 mm (27.5 in), 900 mm (35.4 in) horizontally, from either edge of the barrier. All holes are drilled within ±1 mm (0.04 in) of the nominal distances.
            
            
              § 587.18
              Dimensions of fixed rigid barrier.
              (a) The fixed rigid barrier has a mass of not less than 7 × 104 kg (154,324 lb).
              (b) The height of the fixed rigid barrier is at least as high as the highest point on the vehicle at the intersection of the vertical transverse plane tangent to the forwardmost point of both front tires, when the tires are parallel to the longitudinal centerline of the vehicle, and the vertical plane through the longitudinal centerline of the vehicle.
            
            
              § 587.19
              Mounting.
              (a) The deformable face is rigidly attached to the edge of the fixed rigid barrier or to some rigid structure attached thereto. The front of the fixed rigid barrier to which the deformable face is attached is flat (continuous over the height and width of the face and vertical ±1 degree and perpendicular ±1 degree to the axis of the run-up track). The edge of the deformable face is aligned with the edge of the fixed rigid barrier appropriate for the side of the vehicle to be tested.

              (b) The deformable face is attached to the fixed rigid barrier by means of ten bolts, five in the top mounting flange and five in the bottom, such that the bottom of the bumper element honeycomb is 200 mm (7.8 in) ±15 mm (0.6 in) from the ground. These bolts are at least 8 mm (0.3 in) in diameter. Steel clamping strips are used for both the top and bottom mounting flanges (Figure 1). These strips are 60 mm (2.4 in) high and 1000 mm (39.4 in) wide and have thickness of at least 3 mm (0.12 in). Five clearance holes of 20 mm (0.8 in) diameter are drilled in both strips to correspond with those in the mounting flange on the deformable face cladding sheet (see § 586.17(c)).

            § 591.7
            Restrictions on importations.
            (a) A vehicle or equipment item which has entered the United States under a declaration made pursuant to § 591.5(j), and for which a Temporary Importation Bond has been provided to the Secretary of the Treasury, shall not remain in the United States for a period that exceeds 3 years from its date of entry.
            (b) If the importer of a vehicle or equipment item under § 591.5(j) does not intend to export or destroy the vehicle or equipment item not later than 3 years after the date of entry, and intends to pay duty to the U.S. Customs Service on such vehicle or equipment item, the importer shall request permission in writing from the Administrator for the vehicle or equipment item to remain in the United States for an additional period of time not to exceed 5 years from the date of entry. Such a request must be received not later than 60 days before the date that is 3 years after the date of entry. Such vehicle or equipment item shall not remain in the United States for a period that exceeds 5 years from the date of entry, unless further written permission has been obtained from the Administrator.

            (c) An importer of a vehicle which has entered the United States under a declaration made pursuant to § 591.5(j)(2)(i) shall not sell, or transfer possession of, or title to, the vehicle, and shall not license it for use, or operate it on the public roads, except under such terms and conditions as the Administrator may authorize in writing. An importer of a vehicle which has entered the United States under a declaration made pursuant to § 591.5(j)(2)(ii) shall at all times retain title to it.
            (d) Any violation of a term or condition imposed by the Administrator in a letter authorizing importation for on-road use under § 591.5(j), or a change of status under paragraph (e) of this section, including a failure to allow inspection upon request to verify that the accumulated mileage of the vehicle is not more than 2,500 miles in any 12-month period, shall be considered a violation of 49 U.S.C. 30112(a) for which a civil penalty may be imposed. Such a violation will also act to void the authorization and require the exportation of the vehicle. With respect to importations under § 591.6(f)(2) or a change of status to an importation for show or display as provided under paragraph (e) of this section, if the Administrator has reason to believe that a violation has occurred, the Administrator may tentatively conclude that a term of entry has been violated, but shall make no final conclusion until the importer or owner has been afforded an opportunity to present data, views, and arguments as to why there is no violation or why a penalty should not be imposed.
            (e) If the importer of a vehicle under § 591.5(f)(2)(ii) has been notified in writing by the Registered Importer with which it has executed a contract or other agreement that the registration of the Registered Importer has been suspended (for other than the first time) or revoked, pursuant to § 592.7 of this chapter, and that it has not affixed a certification label on the vehicle and/or filed a certification of conformance with the Administrator as required by § 592.6 of this chapter, and that it therefore may not release the vehicle for the importer, the importer shall execute a contract or other agreement with another Registered Importer for the certification of the vehicle and submission of the certification of conformance to the Administrator. The Administrator shall toll the 120-day period for submission of a certification to the Administrator pursuant to § 592.6(d) of this chapter during the period from the date of the Registered Importer's notification to the importer until the date of the contract with the substitute Registered Importer.
            (f) If a vehicle has entered the United States under a declaration made pursuant to § 591.5(l) and:
            (1) If the Administrator of NHTSA dismisses the petition or decides that the vehicle is not eligible for importation, or if the importer withdraws the petition or fails to submit a petition covering the vehicle within 180 days from the date of entry, the importer must deliver the vehicle, unless it is destroyed (with destruction documented by proof), to the Secretary of Homeland Security for export, or abandon the vehicle to the United States, within 30 days from the date of the dismissal, denial, or withdrawal of the importer's petition, as appropriate, or within 210 days from the date of entry if the importer fails to submit a petition covering the vehicle, and furnish NHTSA with documentary proof of the vehicle's exportation, abandonment, or destruction within 15 days from the date of such action; or
            (2) If the Administrator grants the petition, the importer must:
            (i) Furnish a bond, in an amount equal to 150 percent of the entered value of the vehicle as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, within 15 days from the date the importer is notified that the petition has been granted, unless the vehicle has been destroyed, and bring the vehicle into conformity with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety and bumper standards within 120 days from the date the petition is granted; or,
            (ii) Deliver the vehicle to the Secretary of Homeland Security for export within 30 days from the date the importer is notified that the petition has been granted; or

            (1) To have such vehicle brought into conformity with all applicable standards issued under part 571 and part 581 of this chapter within the number of days after the date of entry that the Administrator has established for such vehicle (to wit, 120 days);
            (2) In the case of a vehicle imported pursuant to section 591.5(f), to file (or if not a Registered Importer, to cause the Registered Importer of the vehicle to file) with the Administrator, a certificate that the vehicle complies with each Federal motor vehicle safety and bumper standard in the year that the vehicle was manufactured and which applies in such year to the vehicle; or
            (3) In the case of a Registered Importer, not to release custody of the vehicle to any person for license or registration for use on public roads, streets, or highways, or license or register the vehicle from the date of entry until 30 calendar days after it has certified compliance of the vehicle to the Administrator, unless the Administrator has notified the principal before 30 calendar days that (s)he has accepted the certification, and that the vehicle and bond may be released, except that no such release shall be permitted, before or after the 30th calendar day, if the principal has received written notice from the Administrator that an inspection of the vehicle will be required or that there is reason to believe that such certification is false or contains a misrepresentation;
            (4) In the case of a Registered Importer, to cause the vehicle to be available for inspection, if the principal has received written notice from the Administrator that an inspection is required.
            (5) In the case of a Registered Importer, not to release the vehicle until the Administrator is satisfied with the certification and any modification thereof, if the principal has received written notice from the Administrator that there is reason to believe that the certification is false or contains a misrepresentation.

            (6) If the principal has received written notice from the Administrator that the vehicle has been found not to comply with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety and bumper standards, and written demand that the vehicle be abandoned to the United States, or delivered to the Secretary of Homeland Security for export (at no cost to the United States), or to abandon the vehicle to the United States, or to deliver the vehicle, or cause the vehicle to be delivered to, the custody of the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection at the port of entry listed above, or to any other port of entry, and to secure all documents necessary for exportation of the vehicle from the United States at no cost to the United States, or in default of abandonment or redelivery after prior notice by the Administrator to the principal, to pay to the Administrator the amount of the bond.
            (e) If the principal defaults on the obligation of paragraph (d)(6) of this section, to abandon the vehicle to the United States or to redeliver the vehicle to the custody of a District Director of Customs and to execute all documents necessary for its exportation, the obligors shall pay to the Administrator the amount of the bond given under the provisions of this section.

            (a) After a bond has been forfeited, a principal and/or a surety may petition for remission of forfeiture.

            (4) Be filed within 30 days from the date of the mailing of the notice of forfeiture incurred.

            (d) If the Administrator finds that all conditions of the bond have, in fact, been fulfilled, the forfeiture is remitted.
            (e) A decision to mitigate a forfeiture upon condition that a stated amount is paid shall be effective for not more than 60 days from the date of notice to the petitioner of such decision. If payment of the stated amount is not made, or arrangements made for delayed or installment payment, the full claim of forfeiture shall be deemed applicable. The Administrator shall collect the claim, or, if unable to collect the claim within 120 days, shall refer the matter to the Department of Justice.

            (d) When the application is complete (and, if applicable, when the applicant has paid a sum representing the inspection component of the initial annual fee), the Administrator reviews the application and decides whether the applicant has complied with the requirements prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section. The Administrator shall base this decision on the application and upon any inspection NHTSA may have conducted of the applicant's conformance, storage, and recordkeeping facilities and any assessment of the applicant's personnel. If the Administrator decides that the applicant complies with the requirements, (s)he informs the applicant in writing and issues it a Registered Importer Number.
            (e)(1) The Administrator:
            (i) Shall deny registration to an applicant who (s)he decides does not comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section;

            (iv) May deny registration to an applicant that is or was owned or controlled by, or under common ownership or control with, or in affinity with, a Registered Importer whose registration has been revoked.

            (2) If the Administrator denies an application, (s)he informs the applicant in writing of the reasons for denial and that the applicant is entitled to a refund of that component of the initial annual fee representing the remaining costs of administration of the registration program, but not those components of the initial annual fee representing the costs of processing the application, and, if applicable, the costs of conducting an inspection of the applicant's facilities.
            (3) Within 30 days from the date of the denial, the applicant may submit a petition for reconsideration. The applicant may submit information and/or documentation supporting its request.

If the Administrator denies registration, (s)he notifies the applicant in writing and refunds that component of the initial annual fee representing the remaining costs of administration of the registration program, but does not refund those components of the initial annual fee representing the costs of processing the application, and, if applicable, the costs of conducting an inspection.
            (f) In order to maintain its registration, a Registered Importer must:
            (1) Not be convicted of, or have any person associated with direct or indirect ownership or control of the registered importer's business or any person employed by or associated with the registered importer who is convicted of, a crime related to the importation, purchase, or sale of motor vehicles or motor vehicle equipment.

            (iii) “I certify that I understand that, in the event that its registration is suspended or revoked, or lapses, [name of Registered Importer] will remain obligated to notify owners and to remedy noncompliance issues or safety related defects, as required by 49 CFR 592.6(j), for each vehicle for which [name of Registered Importer] has furnished a certificate of conformity to the Administrator.”

            § 592.6
            Duties of a registered importer.
            Each Registered Importer must:
            (a) With respect to each motor vehicle that it imports into the United States, assure that the Administrator has decided that the vehicle is eligible for importation pursuant to Part 593 of this chapter prior to such importation. The Registered Importer must also bring such vehicle into conformity with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards prescribed under Part 571 of this chapter and the bumper standard prescribed under Part 581 of this chapter, if applicable, and furnish certification to the Administrator pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, within 120 calendar days after such entry. For each motor vehicle, the Registered Importer must furnish to the Secretary of Homeland Security at the time of importation a bond in an amount equal to 150 percent of the dutiable value of the vehicle, as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security, to ensure that such vehicle either will be brought into conformity with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety and bumper standards or will be exported (at no cost to the United States) by the importer or the Secretary of Homeland Security or abandoned to the United States. However, if the Registered Importer has procured a continuous entry bond, it must furnish the Administrator with such bond, and must furnish the Secretary of Homeland Security (acting on behalf of the Administrator) with a paper or electronic copy, in a format accepted by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, of such bond at the time of importation of each motor vehicle.
            (b) Establish, maintain, and retain, for 10 years from the date of entry, at the facility in the United States it has identified in its application pursuant to § 592.5 (a)(5)(i), for each motor vehicle for which it furnishes a certificate of conformity, the following records, including correspondence and other documents, in hard copy format:
            (1) The declaration required by § 591.5 of this chapter.
            (2) All vehicle or equipment purchase or sales orders or agreements, conformance agreements between the Registered Importer and persons who import motor vehicles for personal use, and correspondence between the Registered Importer and the owner or purchaser of the vehicle.
            (3) The make, model, model year, odometer reading, and VIN of each vehicle that it imports and the last known name and address of the owner or purchaser of the vehicle.
            (4) Records, including photographs and other documents, sufficient to identify the vehicle and to substantiate that it has been brought into conformity with all Federal motor vehicle safety and bumper standards that apply to the vehicle, that the certification label has been affixed, and that either the vehicle is not subject to any safety recalls or that all noncompliances and safety defects covered by such recalls were remedied before the submission to the Administrator under paragraph (d) of this section. All photographs submitted shall be unaltered.
            (5) A copy of the certification submitted to the Administrator pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.
            (6) The number that the issuer has assigned to the service insurance policy that will accompany the vehicle and the full corporate or other business name of the issuer of the policy, and substantiation that the Registered Importer has notified the issuer of the policy that the policy has been provided with the vehicle.

            (c) Take possession of the vehicle and perform all modifications necessary to conform the vehicle to all Federal motor vehicle safety and bumper standards that apply to the vehicle at a facility that it has identified to the Administrator pursuant to § 592.5(a)(5)(i), and permanently affix to the vehicle at that facility, upon completion of conformance modifications and remedy of all noncompliances and defects that are the subject of any pending safety recalls, a label that identifies the Registered Importer and states that the Registered Importer certifies that the vehicle complies with all Federal motor vehicle safety and bumper standards that apply to the vehicle, and contains all additional information required by § 567.4 of this chapter.
            (d) For each motor vehicle imported pursuant to part 591.5(f) of this chapter, certify to the Administrator:
            (1) Within 120 days of the importation that it has brought the motor vehicle into conformity with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety and bumper standards in effect at the time the vehicle was manufactured by the fabricating manufacturer. Such certification shall state verbatim either that “I know that the vehicle that I am certifying conforms with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety and bumper standards because I personally witnessed each modification performed on the vehicle to effect compliance,” or that “I know that the vehicle I am certifying conforms with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety and bumper standards because the person who performed the necessary modifications to the vehicle is an employee of [RI name] and has provided full documentation of the work that I have reviewed, and I am satisfied that the vehicle as modified complies.” The Registered Importer shall also certify that it has destroyed or exported any noncompliant motor vehicle equipment items that were removed from an imported vehicle in the course of performing conformance modifications. The Registered Importer shall also certify, as appropriate, that either:
            (i) The vehicle is not required to comply with the parts marking requirements of the theft prevention standard (part 541 of this chapter); or
            (ii) The vehicle complies with those parts marking requirements as manufactured, or as modified prior to importation.
            (2) If the Registered Importer certifies that the vehicle was originally manufactured to comply with a standard that does not apply to the vehicle or that it has modified the vehicle to conform to such standard, or if the certification is incomplete, the Administrator may refuse to accept the certification. The Administrator shall refuse to accept a certification for a vehicle that has not been determined to be eligible for importation under part 593 of this chapter. If the Administrator does not accept a submission, (s)he shall return it to the Registered Importer. The costs associated with such a return will be charged to the Registered Importer. If the Administrator returns the submission as described above and the vehicle is eligible for importation, the 120-day period specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section continues to run, but the 30-day period specified in paragraph (f) of this section does not begin to run until the Administrator has accepted the submission. If the vehicle is not eligible for importation, the importer must export it from, or abandon it to, the United States. If the Registered Importer certifies that it has modified the vehicle to bring it into compliance with a standard and has, in fact, not performed all required modifications, the Administrator will regard such certification as “knowingly false” within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. 30115 and 49 U.S.C. 30141(c)(4)(B).
            (3) The certification must be signed and submitted by a principal of the Registered Importer designated in its registration application pursuant to § 592.5(a)(5)(iv), with an original hand-written signature and not with a signature that is stamped or mechanically applied.
            (4) The certification to the Administrator must specify the location of the facility where the vehicle was conformed, and the location where the Administrator may inspect the motor vehicle.
            (5) The certification to the Administrator must state and contain substantiation either that the vehicle is not subject to any safety recalls as of the time of such certification, or, alternatively, that all noncompliances and defects that are the subject of those safety recalls have been remedied.
            (6) When a Registered Importer certifies a make, model, and model year of a motor vehicle for the first time, its certification must include:
            (i) The make, model, model year and date of manufacture, odometer reading, VIN that complies with § 565.4(b), (c), and (g) of this chapter, and Customs Entry Number,

            (ii) A statement that it has brought the vehicle into conformity with all Federal motor vehicle safety and bumper standards that apply to the vehicle, and a description, with respect to each standard for which modifications were needed, of the modifications performed,
            (iii) A copy of the bond given at the time of entry to ensure conformance with the safety and bumper standards,
            (iv) The vehicle's vehicle eligibility number, as stated in appendix A to part 593 of this chapter,
            (v) A copy of the HS-7 Declaration form executed at the time of its importation if a Customs broker did not make an electronic entry for the vehicle with the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection,
            (vi) Unaltered front, side, and rear photographs of the vehicle,
            (vii) Unaltered photographs of the original manufacturer's certification label and the certification label of the Registered Importer affixed to the vehicle (and, if the vehicle is a motorcycle, a photograph or photocopy of the Registered Importer certification label before it has been affixed),
            (viii) Unaltered photographs and documentation sufficient to demonstrate conformity with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety and bumper standards to which the vehicle was not originally manufactured to conform,
            (ix) The policy number of the service insurance policy furnished with the vehicle pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section, and the full corporate or other business name of the insurer that issued the policy, and
            (x) A statement that the submission is the Registered Importer's initial certification submission for the make, model, and model year of the vehicle covered by the certification.
            (7) Except as specified in this paragraph, a Registered Importer's second and subsequent certification submissions for a given make, model, and model year vehicle must contain the information required by paragraph (d)(6) of this section. If the Registered Importer conformed such a vehicle in the same manner as it stated in its initial certification submission, it may say so in a subsequent submission and it need not provide the description required by paragraph (d)(6)(ii) of this section.
            (e) With respect to each motor vehicle that it imports, not take any of the following actions until the bond referred to in paragraph (a) of this section has been released, unless 30 days have elapsed from the date the Administrator receives the Registered Importer's certification of compliance of the motor vehicle in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section (the 30-day period will be extended if the Administrator has made written demand to inspect the motor vehicle):
            (1) Operate the motor vehicle on the public streets, roads, and highways for any purpose other than:
            (i) Transportation to and from a franchised dealership of the vehicle's original manufacturer for remedying a noncompliance or safety-related defect; or
            (ii) Mileage accumulation to stabilize the vehicle's catalyst and emissions control systems in preparation for pre-certification testing to obtain an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) certificate of conformity, but only insofar as the vehicle has been imported by an Independent Commercial Importer (ICI) who holds a current certificate of conformity with the EPA, the ICI has imported the vehicle under an EPA Declaration form 3520-1 on which Code J is checked, and the EPA has granted the ICI written permission to operate the vehicle on public roads for that purpose.
            (2) Sell the motor vehicle or offer it for sale;
            (3) Store the motor vehicle on the premises of a motor vehicle dealer;
            (4) Title the motor vehicle in a name other than its own, or license or register it for use on public streets, roads, or highways; or
            (5) Release custody of the motor vehicle to a person for sale, or for license or registration for use on public streets, roads, and highways, or for titling in a name other than that of the Registered Importer who imported the vehicle.

            (f) Furnish with each motor vehicle for which it furnishes certification or information to the Administrator in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, not later than the time it sells the vehicle, or releases custody of a vehicle to an owner who has imported it for personal use, a service insurance policy written or underwritten by an independent insurance company, in the amount of $2,000. The Registered Importer shall provide the insurance company with a monthly list of the VINs of vehicles covered by the policies of the insurance company, and shall retain a copy of each such list in its files.

            (g) Comply with the requirements of part 580 of this chapter, Odometer Disclosure Requirements, when the Registered Importer is a transferor of a vehicle as defined by § 580.3 of this chapter.
            (h) With respect to any motor vehicle it has imported and for which it has furnished a performance bond, deliver such vehicle to the Secretary of Homeland Security for export, or abandon it to the United States, upon demand by the Administrator, if such vehicle has not been brought into conformity with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety and bumper standards within 120 days from entry.
            (i)(1) With respect to any motor vehicle that it has imported or for which it has furnished a certificate of conformity or information to the Administrator as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, provide notification in accordance with part 577 of this chapter and a remedy without charge to the vehicle owner, after any notification under part 573 of this chapter that a vehicle to which such motor vehicle is substantially similar contains a defect related to motor vehicle safety or fails to conform with an applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standard. However, this obligation does not exist if the manufacturer of the vehicle or the Registered Importer of such vehicle demonstrates to the Administrator that the defect or noncompliance is not present in such vehicle, or that the defect or noncompliance was remedied before the submission of the certificate or the information to the Administrator, or that the original manufacturer of the vehicle will provide such notification and remedy.
            (2) If a Registered Importer becomes aware (from whatever source) that the manufacturer of a vehicle it has imported will not provide a remedy without charge for a defect or noncompliance that has been determined to exist in that vehicle, within 30 days thereafter, the Registered Importer must inform NHTSA and submit a copy of the notification letter that it intends to send to owners of the vehicle(s) in question.
            (3) Any notification to vehicle owners sent by a Registered Importer must contain the information specified in § 577.5 of this chapter, and must include the statement that if the Registered Importer's repair facility is more than 50 miles from the owner's mailing address, remedial repairs may be performed at no charge at a specific facility designated by the Registered Importer that is within 50 miles of the owner's mailing address, or, if no such facility is designated, that repairs may be performed anywhere, with the cost of parts and labor to be reimbursed by the Registered Importer.
            (4) Defect and noncompliance notifications by a Registered Importer must conform to the requirements of §§ 577.7 and 577.8 of this chapter, and are subject to §§ 577.9 and 577.10 of this chapter.
            (5) Except as provided in this paragraph, instead of the six quarterly reports required by § 573.7(a) of this chapter, the Registered Importer must submit to the Administrator two reports containing the information specified in § 573.7(b)(1) through (4) of this chapter. The reports shall cover the periods ending nine and 18 months after the commencement of the owner notification campaign, and must be submitted within 30 days of the end of each period. However, the reporting requirements established by this paragraph shall not apply to any safety recall that a vehicle manufacturer conducts that includes vehicles for which the Registered Importer has submitted the information required by paragraph (d) of this section.

            (6) The requirement that the remedy be provided without charge does not apply if the motor vehicle was bought by its first purchaser from the Registered Importer (or, if imported for personal use, conformed pursuant to a contract with the Registered Importer) more than 10 calendar years before the date the Registered Importer or the original manufacturer notifies the Administrator of the noncompliance or safety-related defect pursuant to part 573 of this chapter.
            
            (j) In order that the Administrator may determine whether the Registered Importer is meeting its statutory responsibilities, allow representatives of NHTSA during operating hours, upon demand, and upon presentation of credentials, to copy documents, or to inspect, monitor, or photograph any of the following:
            (1) Any facility identified by the Registered Importer where any vehicle for which a Registered Importer has the responsibility of providing a certificate of conformity to the Administrator is being modified, repaired, tested, or stored, and any facility where any record or other document relating to the modification, repair, testing, or storage of these vehicles is kept;
            (2) Any part or aspect of activities relating to the modification, repair, testing, or storage of vehicles by the Registered Importer; and
            (3) Any motor vehicle for which the Registered Importer has provided a certification of conformity to the Administrator before the Administrator releases the conformance bond.
            (k) Provide an annual statement, certifying that the information therein is true and correct, and pay an annual fee as required by § 592.5(f).

            (l) Except as noted in this paragraph, notify the Administrator in writing of any change that occurs in the information which was submitted in its registration application, not later than the 30th calendar day after such change. If a Registered Importer intends to use a facility that was not identified in its registration application, not later than 30 days before it begins to use such facility, it must notify the Administrator of its intent to use such facility and provide a description of the intended use, a copy of the lease or deed evidencing the Registered Importer's ownership or tenancy of the facility, and a copy of the license or similar document issued by an appropriate state or municipal authority stating that the Registered Importer is licensed to do business at that facility as an importer and/or modifier and/or seller of motor vehicles (or a statement that it has made a bona fide inquiry and is not required by state or local law to have such a license or permission), and a sufficient number of unaltered photographs of that facility to fully depict the Registered Importer's intended use. If a Registered Importer intends to change its street address or telephone number or discontinue use of a facility that was identified in its registration application, it shall notify the Administrator not less than 10 days before such change or discontinuance of such use, and identify the facility, if any, that will be used instead.
            (m) Assure that at least one full-time employee of the Registered Importer is present at at least one of the Registered Importer's facilities in the United States during normal business hours.
            (n) Not co-utilize the same employee, or any repair or conformance facility, with any other Registered Importer. If a Registered Importer co-utilizes the same storage facility with another Registered Importer or another entity, the storage area of each Registered Importer must be clearly delineated, and the vehicles being stored by each Registered Importer may not be mingled with vehicles for which that Registered Importer is not responsible.
            (o) Make timely, complete, and accurate responses to any requests by the Administrator for information, whether by general or special order or otherwise, to enable the Administrator to decide whether the Registered Importer has complied or is complying with 49 U.S.C. Chapters 301 and 325, and the regulations issued thereunder.
            (p) Pay all fees either by certified check, cashier's check, money order, credit card, or Electronic Funds Transfer System made payable to the Treasurer of the United States, in accordance with the invoice of fees incurred by the Registered Importer in the previous month that is provided by the Administrator. All such fees are due and payable not later than 15 days from the date of the invoice.

            (q) Not later than November 1, 2004, file with the Administrator all information required by § 592.5(a), as amended. If a Registered Importer has previously provided any item of information to the Administrator in its registration application, annual statement, or notification of change, it may incorporate that item by reference in the filing required under this subsection, provided that it clearly indicates the date, page, and entry of the previously-provided document.
            [69 FR 52095, Aug. 24, 2004, as amended at 70 FR 57801, Oct. 4, 2005; 76 FR 53079, Aug. 25, 2011; 79 FR 45376, Aug. 5, 2014; 80 FR 53014, Sept. 2, 2015]
          
          
            § 592.7
            Suspension, revocation, and reinstatement of suspended registrations.
            This section specifies the acts and omissions that may result in suspensions and revocations of registrations issued to Registered Importers by NHTSA, the process for such suspensions and revocations, and the provisions applicable to the reinstatement of suspended registrations.
            (a) Automatic suspension of a registration. 49 U.S.C. 30141(c)(4)(B) explicitly authorizes NHTSA to automatically suspend a registration when a Registered Importer does not, in a timely manner, pay a fee required by part 594 of this chapter or knowingly files a false or misleading certification under 49 U.S.C. 30146. NHTSA also may automatically suspend a registration under other circumstances, as specified in paragraphs (3), (4) and (5) of this section.
            (1) If the Administrator has not received the annual fee from a Registered Importer by the close of business on October 10 of a year, or, if October 10 falls on a weekend or holiday, by the next business day thereafter, or has not received any other fee owed by a Registered Importer within 15 calendar days from the date of the Administrator's invoice, the Registered Importer's registration will be automatically suspended at the beginning of the next business day. The Administrator will promptly notify the Registered Importer in writing of the suspension. Such suspension shall remain in effect until reinstated pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
            (2) If the Administrator decides that a Registered Importer has knowingly filed a false or misleading certification, (s)he shall promptly notify the Registered Importer in writing that its registration is automatically suspended. The notification shall inform the Registered Importer of the facts and conduct upon which the decision is based, and the period of suspension (which begins as of the date indicated in the Administrator's written notification). The notification shall afford the Registered Importer an opportunity to seek reconsideration of the decision by presenting data, views, and arguments in writing and/or in person, within 30 days. Not later than 30 days after the submission of data, views, and arguments, the Administrator, after considering all the information available, shall notify the Registered Importer in writing of his or her decision on reconsideration. Any suspension issued under this paragraph shall remain in effect until reinstated pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
            (3) If mail is undeliverable to the Registered Importer at the official street address it has provided to the Administrator, or if the telephone has been disconnected at the telephone number specified by the Registered Importer, the Administrator may automatically suspend the Registered Importer's registration. Such suspension shall remain in effect until the registration is reinstated pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
            (4) If a Registered Importer, not later than November 1, 2004, does not file with the Administrator all information required by § 592.5(a), as required by § 592.6(q), the Administrator may automatically suspend the registration. The Administrator shall promptly notify the Registered Importer in writing of the suspension. Such a suspension shall remain in effect until the registration is reinstated pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
            (5) If a Registered Importer releases one or more motor vehicles on the basis of a forged or falsified bond release letter, and the Administrator has not in fact issued such a letter, the Administrator may automatically suspend the registration. The Administrator shall promptly notify the Registered Importer in writing of the suspension.

            (6) The Administrator, in his or her sole discretion, may provide notice of a proposed automatic suspension or revocation for reasons specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(5) of this section.
            
            (7) The notification shall afford the Registered Importer an opportunity to seek reconsideration of the decision by presenting data, views, and arguments in writing and/or in person, within 30 days of such notification, before a decision, as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Not later than 30 days after the submission of data, views, and arguments, the Administrator, after considering all the information available, shall notify the Registered Importer in writing of his or her decision on reconsideration. Any automatic suspension issued under this paragraph shall remain in effect until reinstated pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
            (b) Non-automatic suspension or revocation of a registration. (1) 49 U.S.C. 30141(c)(4)(A) authorizes NHTSA to revoke or suspend a registration if a Registered Importer does not comply with a requirement of 49 U.S.C. 30141-30147, or any of 49 U.S.C. 30112, 30115, 30117-30122, 30125(c), 30127, or 30166, or any regulations issued under these sections. These regulations include, but are not limited to, parts 567, 568, 573, 577, 591, 592, 593, and 594 of this chapter.
            (2) When the Administrator has reason to believe that a Registered Importer has violated one or more of the statutes or regulations cited in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and that suspension or revocation would be an appropriate sanction under the circumstances, (s)he shall notify the Registered Importer in writing of the facts giving rise to the allegation of a violation and the proposed length of a suspension, if applicable, or revocation. The notice shall afford the Registered Importer an opportunity to present data, views, and arguments, in writing and/or in person, within 30 days of the date of the notice, as to whether the violation occurred, why the registration ought not to be suspended or revoked, or whether the suspension should be shorter than proposed. If the Administrator decides, on the basis of the available information, that the Registered Importer has violated a statute or regulation, the Administrator may suspend or revoke the registration. The Administrator shall notify the Registered Importer in writing of the decision, including the reasons for it. A suspension or revocation is effective as of the date of the Administrator's written notification unless another date is specified therein. The Administrator shall state the period of any suspension in the notice to the Registered Importer. There shall be no opportunity to seek reconsideration of a decision issued under this paragraph.
            (c) Reinstatement of suspended registrations. (1) When a registration has been suspended under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the Administrator will reinstate the registration when all fees owing are paid by wire transfer or certified check from a bank in the United States, together with a sum representing 10 percent of the amount of the fees that were not timely paid.
            (2) When a registration has been suspended under paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(5) of this section, the registration will be reinstated after the expiration of the period of suspension specified by the Administrator, or such earlier date as the Administrator may subsequently decide is appropriate.
            (3) When a registration has been suspended under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the registration will be reinstated when the Administrator decides that the Registered Importer has provided a street address to which mail to it is deliverable and a telephone number in its name that is in service.
            (4) When a registration has been suspended under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the registration will be reinstated when the Administrator decides that the Registered Importer has provided all relevant documentation and information required by § 592.6(q).
            (5) When a registration has been suspended under paragraph (b) of this section, the registration will be reinstated after the expiration of the period of suspension specified by the Administrator, or such earlier date as the Administrator may subsequently decide is appropriate.
            (6) When a suspended registration has been reinstated, NHTSA shall notify the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection promptly.

            (7) If a Registered Importer imports a motor vehicle on or after the date that its registration is suspended and before the date that the suspension ends, the Administrator may extend the suspension period by one day for each day that the Registered Importer has imported a motor vehicle during the time that its registration has been suspended.
            (d) Effect of suspension or revocation. (1) If a Registered Importer's registration is suspended or revoked, as of the date of suspension or revocation the entity will not be considered a Registered Importer, will not have the rights and authorities appertaining thereto, and must cease importing, and will not be allowed to import, vehicles for resale. The Registered Importer will not be refunded any annual or other fees it has paid for the fiscal year in which its registration is revoked. The Administrator shall notify the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection of any suspension or revocation of a registration not later than the first business day after such action is taken.
            (2) With respect to any vehicle for which it has not affixed a certification label and submitted a certificate of conformity to the Administrator under § 592.6(d) at the time it is notified that its registration has been suspended or revoked, the Registered Importer must affix a certification label and submit a certificate of conformity within 120 days from the date of entry.
            (3) When a registration has been revoked or suspended, the Registered Importer must export within 30 days of the effective date of the suspension or revocation all vehicles that it imported to which it has not affixed a certification label and furnished a certificate of conformity to the Administrator pursuant to § 592.6(d).
            (4) With respect to any vehicle imported pursuant to § 591.5(f)(2)(ii) of this chapter that the Registered Importer has agreed to bring into compliance with all applicable standards and for which it has not certified and furnished a certificate of conformity to the Administrator, the Registered Importer must immediately notify the owner of the vehicle in writing that its registration has been suspended or revoked.
            (e) Continuing obligations. A Registered Importer whose registration is suspended or revoked remains obligated under § 592.6(i) to notify owners and to remedy noncompliances or safety related defects for each vehicle for which it has furnished a certificate of conformity to the Administrator.
            [69 FR 52098, Aug. 24, 2004, as amended at 76 FR 53079, Aug. 25, 2011]
          
          
            § 592.8
            Inspection; release of vehicle and bond.
            (a) With respect to any motor vehicle for which it must provide a certificate of conformity to the Administrator as required by § 592.6(d), a Registered Importer shall not obtain title, licensing, or registration of the motor vehicle for use on the public roads, or release custody of it for such titling, licensing, or registration, except in accordance with the provisions of this section.
            (b) When conformance modifications to a motor vehicle have been completed, a Registered Importer shall submit the certification required by § 592.6(d) to the Administrator. In certifying a vehicle that the Administrator has determined to be substantially similar to one that has been certified by its original manufacturer for sale in the United States, the Registered Importer may rely on any certification by the original manufacturer with respect to identical safety features if it also certifies that any modification that it undertook did not affect the compliance of such safety features. Each submission shall be mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by private express delivery service to: Director, Office of Vehicle Safety Compliance, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Fourth Floor, Room W43-481, Mail Code NVS-220, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., Washington, DC 20590 or delivered in person. Each submission shall identify the location where the vehicle will be stored and is available for inspection, pending NHTSA action upon the submission.

            (c) Before the end of the 30th calendar day after receiving a complete certification under § 592.6(d), the Administrator may notify the Registered Importer in writing that an inspection of the vehicle is required to verify the certification. Written notice includes a proposed inspection date, which is as soon as practicable. If inspection of the vehicle indicates that the vehicle has been properly certified, at the conclusion of the inspection the Registered Importer is provided an instrument of release. If inspection of the vehicle shows that the vehicle has not been properly certified, the Registered Importer shall either make the modifications necessary to substantiate its certification, and provide a new certification for the standard(s) in the manner provided for in paragraph (b) of this section, or deliver the vehicle to the Secretary of the Treasury for export, or abandon it to the United States. Before the end of the 30th calendar day after receipt of new certification, the Administrator may require a further inspection in accordance with the provisions of this subsection.
            (d) The Administrator may by written notice request the Registered Importer to verify its certification of a motor vehicle before the end of the 30th calendar day after the date the Administrator receives a complete certification under § 592.6(d). If the basis for such request is that the certification is false or contains a misrepresentation, the Registered Importer shall be afforded an opportunity to present written data, views, and arguments as to why the certification is not false or misleading or does not contain a misrepresentation. The Administrator may require an inspection pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section. The motor vehicle and performance bond involved shall not be released unless the Administrator is satisfied with the certification.
            (e) If the Registered Importer has received no written notice from the Administrator by the end of the 30th calendar day after it has furnished a complete certification under section 592.6(d) of this chapter, the Registered Importer may release the vehicle from custody, sell or offer it for sale, or have it titled, licensed, or registered for use on the public roads.
            (f) If the Administrator accepts a certification without requiring an inspection, (s)he notifies the Registered Importer in writing, and provides a copy to the importer of record. Such notification shall be provided not later than the 25th calendar day after the Administrator has received such certification.
            (g) Release of the performance bond shall constitute acceptance of certification or completion of inspection of the vehicle concerned, but shall not preclude a subsequent decision by the Administrator pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 30118 that the vehicle fails to conform to any applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standard.
            [54 FR 40090, Sept. 29, 1989, as amended at 55 FR 37330, Sept. 11, 1990; 59 FR 52098, Oct. 14, 1994; 69 FR 52100, Aug. 24, 2004; 76 FR 53080, Aug. 25, 2011]
          
          
            § 592.9
            Forfeiture of bond.
            A Registered Importer is required by § 591.6 of this chapter to furnish a bond with respect to each motor vehicle that it imports. The conditions of the bond are set forth in § 591.8 of this chapter. Failure to fulfill any one of these conditions may result in forfeiture of the bond. A bond may be forfeited if the Registered Importer:
            (a) Fails to bring the motor vehicle covered by the bond into compliance with all applicable standards issued under part 571 and part 581 of this chapter within 120 days from the date of entry;
            (b) Fails to file with the Administrator a certificate that the motor vehicle complies with each Federal motor vehicle safety, bumper, and theft prevention standard in effect at the time the vehicle was manufactured and which applies to the vehicle;
            (c) Fails to cause a motor vehicle to be available for inspection if it has received written notice from the Administrator that an inspection is required;
            (d) Releases the motor vehicle before the Administrator accepts the certification and any modification thereof, if it has received written notice from the Administrator that there is reason to believe that the certification is false or contains a misrepresentation;

            (e) Before the bond is released, releases custody of the motor vehicle to any person for license or registration for use on public roads, streets, and highways, or licenses or registers the vehicle, including titling the vehicle in the name of another person, unless 30 calendar days have elapsed after the Registered Importer has filed a complete certification under § 592.6(d), and the Registered Importer has not received written notice pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) or (a)(4) of this section. For purposes of this part, a vehicle is deemed to be released from custody if it is not located at a duly identified facility of the Registered Importer and the Registered Importer has not notified the Administrator in writing of the vehicle's location or, if written notice has been provided, if the Administrator is unable to inspect the vehicle, or if the Registered Importer has transferred title to any other person regardless of the vehicle's location; or
            (f) Fails to deliver the vehicle, or cause it to be delivered, to the custody of the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection at any port of entry, for export or abandonment to the United States, and to execute all documents necessary to accomplish such purposes, if the Administrator has furnished it written notice that the vehicle has been found not to comply with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards along with a demand that the vehicle be delivered for export or abandoned to the United States.

            This part establishes procedures under section 108(c) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, as amended (15 U.S.C. 1397(c)), for making determinations whether a vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards, and is not otherwise eligible for importation under part 591 of this chapter, may be imported into the United States because it can be modified to meet the Federal standards.
          
          
            § 593.2
            Purpose.

            Processing of petitions.
            (a) NHTSA will review each petition for sufficiency under §§ 593.5 and 593.6. If the petition does not contain all the information required by this part, NHTSA notifies the petitioner, pointing out the areas of insufficiency, and stating that the petition will not receive further consideration until the required information is provided. If the additional information is not provided within the time specified by NHTSA in its notification, NHTSA may dismiss the petition as incomplete, and so notify the petitioner. When the petition is complete, its processing continues.
            (b) NHTSA publishes in the Federal Register, affording opportunity for comment, a notice of each petition containing the information required by this part.
            (c) No public hearing, argument, or other formal proceeding is held on a petition filed under this part.
            (d) If the Administrator is unable to determine that the vehicle in a petition submitted under § 593.6(a) is one that is substantially similar, or (if it is substantially similar) is capable of being readily modified to meet the standards, (s)he notifies the petitioner, and offers the petitioner the opportunity to supplement the petition by providing the information required for a petition submitted under paragraph 593.6(b).

            (e) If the Administrator determines that the petition does not clearly demonstrate that the vehicle model is eligible for importation, (s)he denies it and notifies the petitioner in writing. (S)he also publishes in the Federal Register a notice of denial and the reasons for it. A notice of denial also states that the Administrator will not consider a new petition covering the model that is the subject of the denial until at least 3 months from the date of the notice of denial. There is no administrative reconsideration available for petition denials.

            (f) If the Administrator determines that the petition clearly demonstrates that the vehicle model is eligible for importation, (s)he grants it and notifies the petitioner. (S)he also publishes in the Federal Register a notice of grant and the reasons for it.

            Determinations on the agency's initiative.

            (a) The Administrator may make a determination of eligibility on his or her own initiative. The agency publishes in the Federal Register, affording opportunity for comment, a notice containing the information available to the agency (other than confidential information) relevant to the basis upon which eligibility may be determined.
            (b) No public hearing, argument, or other formal proceeding is held upon a notice published under this section.
            (c) The Administrator publishes a second notice in the Federal Register in which (s)he announces his or her determination whether the vehicle is eligible or ineligible for importation, and states the reasons for the determination. A notice of ineligibility also announces that no further determination for the same model of motor vehicle will be made for at least 3 months following the date of publication of the notice. There is no administrative reconsideration available for a decision of ineligibility.
          
          
            § 593.9
            Effect of affirmative determinations; lists.
            (a) A notice of grant is sufficient authority for the importation by persons other than the petitioner of any vehicle of the same model specified in the grant.
            (b) The Administrator publishes annually in the Federal Register a list of determinations made under Sec. 593.7, and Sec. 593.8.

            (a) Except as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, information relevant to a determination under this part, including a petition and supporting data, and the grant or denial of the petition or the making of a determination on the Administrator's initiative, is available for public inspection in the Docket Section, Room 5109, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh St., SW., Washington, DC 20590. Copies of available information may be obtained, as provided in part 7 of this chapter.
            (b) Except for release of confidential information authorized under part 512 of this chapter, information made available for inspection under paragraph (a) of this section does not include information for which confidentiality has been requested and granted in accordance with part 512 of this chapter, and 5 U.S.C. 552(b). To the extent that a petition contains material relating to the methodology by which the petitioner intends to achieve conformance with a specific standard, the petitioner may request confidential treatment of such material on the grounds that it contains a trade secret or confidential information in accordance with part 512 of this chapter.
          
          
            Pt. 593, App. A
            Appendix A to Part 593—List of Vehicles Determined to be Eligible for Importation
            (a) Each vehicle on the following list is followed by a vehicle eligibility number. The importer of a vehicle admissible under any eligibility decision must enter that number on the HS-7 Declaration Form accompanying entry to indicate that the vehicle is eligible for importation.
            (1) “VSA” eligibility numbers are assigned to all vehicles that are decided to be eligible for importation on the initiative of the Administrator under § 593.8.
            (2) “VSP” eligibility numbers are assigned to vehicles that are decided to be eligible under § 593.7(f), based on a petition from a manufacturer or registered importer submitted under § 593.5(a)(1), which establishes that a substantially similar U.S.-certified vehicle exists.
            (3) “VCP” eligibility numbers are assigned to vehicles that are decided to be eligible under § 593.7(f), based on a petition from a manufacturer or registered importer submitted under § 593.5(a)(2), which establishes that the vehicle has safety features that comply with, or are capable of being altered to comply with, all applicable FMVSS.
            (b) Vehicles for which eligibility decisions have been made are listed alphabetically, first by make, then by model, then by model year.
            (c) All hyphens used in the Model Year column mean “through” (for example, “1995-1999” means “1995 through 1999”).
            (d) The initials “MC” used in the Make column mean “Motorcycle.”

            (e) The initials “SWB” used in the Model Type column mean “Short Wheel Base.”
            
            (f) The initials “LWB” used in the Model Type column mean “Long Wheel Base.”
            (g) For vehicles with a European country of origin, the term “Model Year” ordinarily means calendar year in which the vehicle was produced.
            (h) All vehicles are left-hand-drive (LHD) vehicles unless noted as RHD. The initials “RHD” used in the Model Type column mean “right-hand-drive.”
            (i) For vehicle models that have been determined to be eligible for importation based on a petition submitted under § 593.5(a)(1), which establishes that a substantially similar U.S.-certified vehicle exists, and no specific body style(s) are listed, only the body style(s) of that vehicle model that were U.S.-certified by the original manufacturer are eligible for importation. For example, if the original manufacturer manufactured both sedan and wagon body styles for the described model, but only certified the sedan for the U.S. market, the wagon body style would not be eligible for importation under that determination.

            (1) Processing and acting upon such application;
            (2) Any inspection deemed required for a determination upon such application;
            (3) The estimated remaining activities of administering the registration program in the fiscal year in which such application is intended to become effective.
            (b) That portion of the initial annual fee attributable to the processing of the application for applications filed on and after October 1, 2014, is $333. The sum of $333, representing this portion, shall not be refundable if the application is denied or withdrawn.
            (c) If, in order to make a determination upon an application, NHTSA must make an inspection of the applicant's facilities, NHTSA notifies the applicant in writing after the conclusion of any such inspection, that a supplement to the initial annual fee in a stated amount is due upon receipt of such notice to recover the direct and indirect costs associated with such inspection and notification, and that no determination will be made upon the application until such sum is received. Such sum is not refundable if the application is denied or withdrawn.

            (d) That portion of the initial annual fee attributable to the remaining activities of administering the registration program on and after October 1, 2014, is set forth in paragraph (i) of this section. This portion shall be refundable if the application is denied, or withdrawn before final action upon it.
            
            (e) Each Registered Importer who wishes to maintain the status of Registered Importer shall pay a regular annual fee based upon the direct and indirect costs of administering the registration program, including the suspension and reinstatement, and revocation of such registration.
            (f) The elements of administering the registration program that are included in the regular annual fee are:

            (2) Processing and reviewing the annual statement attesting to the fact that no material change has occurred in the Registered Importer's status since filing its original application.
            (3) Processing the annual fee.
            (4) Processing and reviewing any amendments to an annual statement received in the course of a fiscal year.

This cost is $25.73 per man-hour for the period beginning October 1, 2014.
            (i) Based upon the elements and indirect costs of paragraphs (f), (g), and (h) of this section, the component of the initial annual fee attributable to administration of the registration program, covering the period beginning October 1, 2014, is $511. When added to the costs of registration of $333, as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, the costs per applicant to be recovered through the annual fee are $844. The annual renewal registration fee for the period beginning October 1, 2014, is $726.

            (c) The indirect costs attributable to processing and acting upon a petition filed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section include a pro rata allocation of the average salary and benefits of persons employed in processing the petitions and recommending decisions on them, and a pro rata allocation of the costs attributable to maintaining the office space, and the computer or word processor.

            (d) The direct costs attributable to acting upon a petition filed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, also include the cost of publishing a notice in the Federal Register seeking public comment, the cost of publishing a second notice with the agency's determination, and a pro rata share of the cost of publishing an annual list of nonconforming vehicles determined to be eligible for importation.
            (e) For petitions filed on and after October 1, 2014, the fee payable for seeking a determination under paragraph (a)(1) of this section is $175. The fee payable for a petition seeking a determination under paragraph (a)(2) of this section is $800.

            Subpart B—Retrofit On-Off Switches for Air Bags
            
              § 595.5
              Requirements.
              (a) Beginning January 19, 1998, a dealer or motor vehicle repair business may modify a motor vehicle manufactured before September 1, 2015, by installing an on-off switch that allows an occupant of the vehicle to turn off an air bag in that vehicle, subject to the conditions in paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section.
              (b)(1) The dealer or motor vehicle repair business receives from the owner or lessee of the motor vehicle a letter from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that authorizes the installation of an on-off switch in that vehicle for that air bag and includes a form to be filled in by the dealer or motor vehicle repair business with information identifying itself and describing the installation it makes.
              (2) The dealer or motor vehicle repair business installs the on-off switch in accordance with the instructions of the manufacturer of the switch.
              (3) The on-off switch meets all of the conditions specified in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section.
              (i) The on-off switch is operable solely by a key or a key-like object. The on-off switch shall be separate from the ignition switch for the vehicle, so that the driver must take some action other than inserting the ignition key or turning the ignition key in the ignition switch to turn off the air bag. Once turned off, the air bag shall remain off until it is turned back on by means of the device. If a single on-off switch is installed for both air bags, the on-off switch shall allow each air bag to be turned off without turning off the other air bag. The readiness indicator required by S4.5.2 of § 571.208 of this chapter shall continue to monitor the readiness of the air bags even when one or both air bags has been turned off. The readiness indicator light shall not be illuminated solely because an air bag has been deactivated by means of an on-off switch.
              (ii) A telltale light in the interior of the vehicle shall be illuminated whenever the driver or passenger air bag is turned off by means of the on-off switch. The telltale for a driver air bag shall be clearly visible to an occupant of the driver's seating position. The telltale for a passenger air bag shall be clearly visible to occupants of all front seating positions. The telltale for an air bag:
              (A) Shall be yellow;
              (B) Shall have the identifying words “DRIVER AIR BAG OFF”, “PASSENGER AIR BAG OFF”, or “PASS AIR BAG OFF”, as appropriate, on the telltale or within 25 millimeters of the telltale;
              (C) Shall remain illuminated for the entire time that the air bag is “off;”
              (D) Shall not be illuminated at any time when the air bag is “on;” and,
              (E) Shall not be combined with the readiness indicator required by S4.5.2 of § 571.208 of this chapter.
              (4) The dealer or motor vehicle repair business provides the owner or lessee with an insert for the vehicle owner's manual that—

              (i) Describes the operation of the on-off switch,
              
              (ii) Lists the risk groups on the request form set forth in appendix B of this Part,
              (iii) States that an on-off switch should only be used to turn off an air bag for a member of one of those risk groups, and
              (iv) States the safety consequences for using the on-off switch to turn off an air bag for persons who are not members of any of those risk groups. The description of those consequences includes information, specific to the make, model and model year of the owner's or lessee's vehicle, about any seat belt energy managing features, e.g., load limiters, that will affect seat belt performance when the air bag is turned off.
              (5) In the form included in the agency authorization letter specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the dealer or motor vehicle repair business fills in information describing itself and the on-off switch installation(s) it makes in the motor vehicle. The dealer or motor vehicle repair business then sends the form to the address below within 7 working days after the completion of the described installations: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Attention: Air Bag Switch Request Forms, 400 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20590-1000.

              § 599.504
              Suspension, revocation, and reinstatement of registration and participation eligibility.
              (a) Suspension or revocation of dealer registration, or salvage auction or disposal facility participation eligibility. (1) When the NHTSA Chief Counsel determines that a violation has likely occurred, the Administrator may notify the dealer, salvage auction or disposal facility in writing of the facts giving rise to the allegation of a violation and the proposed length of a suspension, if applicable, or revocation of registration, in the case of a dealer, or participation eligibility in the case of a salvage auction or disposal facility.
              (2) The notice shall afford the dealer, salvage auction or disposal facility an opportunity to present data, views, and arguments, in writing and/or in person, within 30 days of the date of the notice, as to whether the violation occurred, why its registration or participation eligibility ought not to be suspended or revoked, or whether the suspension should be shorter than proposed. The Administrator may, for good cause, reduce the time allowed for response.
              (3) If the Administrator decides, on the basis of the available information, that the dealer, salvage auction or disposal facility has committed a violation, the Administrator may suspend or revoke the dealer registration or the participation eligibility of the salvage auction or disposal facility.
              (4) The Administrator shall notify the dealer, salvage auction or disposal facility in writing of the decision, including the reasons for it. The decision shall reflect the gravity of the offense.

              (5) A suspension or revocation is effective as of the date of the Administrator's written notification, unless another date is specified therein.
              
              (6) The Administrator shall state the period of any suspension in the notice to the dealer, salvage auction or disposal facility.
              (7) There shall be no opportunity to seek reconsideration of the Administrator's decision issued under this paragraph (a).
              (b) Reinstatement of suspended registration or participation eligibility. (1) When a registration or participation eligibility has been suspended under this subpart, the registration or participation eligibility will be reinstated after the expiration of the period of suspension specified by the Administrator, or such earlier date as the Administrator may subsequently decide is appropriate.
              (2) Reinstatement is automatically effective as of the date previously set forth in the Administrator's written notification of suspension, unless another date is specified by the Administrator in writing.
              (c) Effect of suspension or revocation of registration or participation eligibility. (1) If a dealer's registration or a salvage auction or disposal facility's participation eligibility is suspended or revoked, as of the date of suspension or revocation, the dealer, salvage auction or disposal facility will not be considered registered or eligible to participate in the CARS Program, and must cease participating in the program.
              (2) A dealer whose registration has been suspended will not be entitled to any rights or reimbursement of funds for new transactions submitted as of the effective date of the suspension or revocation.
              (3) NHTSA may take such action as appropriate, including publication, to provide notice that a dealer's registration, or salvage auction's or disposal facility's participation eligibility has been suspended or revoked.

              (c) When a report of an apparent violation has been received by NHTSA, or when an apparent violation has been detected by any person working for NHTSA, the matter may be investigated or evaluated by NHTSA Enforcement. If NHTSA Enforcement believes that a violation may have occurred, NHTSA Enforcement may prepare a report and send the report to the NHTSA Chief Counsel.
              (d) The NHTSA Chief Counsel will review the reports prepared by NHTSA Enforcement to determine if there is sufficient information to establish a likely violation.
              (1) The matter may be returned to NHTSA Enforcement for further investigation, if warranted.
              (2) The Chief Counsel may close a matter. A matter may be closed if, for example, the investigation has established that a violation did not occur, the alleged violator is unknown, there is insufficient information to support the existence of a violation and little likelihood of discovering additional relevant facts, or the magnitude of the matter is, under the circumstances, including availability of resources, insufficient to be pursued further.
              (3) If the Chief Counsel determines that a violation has likely occurred, the Chief Counsel may:
              (i) Issue a Notice of Violation to the party, and/or
              (ii) In the case of a dealer recommend that the Administrator suspend or revoke registration in the program or in the case of a salvage auction or disposal facility, recommend that the Administrator suspend or revoke participation eligibility in the program.
              (4) In the case of either paragraphs (d)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section, the NHTSA Chief Counsel will prepare a case file with recommended actions. A record of any prior violations by the same person or entity, shall be forwarded with the case file.

              (b) The Chief Counsel may issue a Notice of Violation to a party. Notice of Violation will contain the following information:
              
              (1) The name and address of the party;

              (8) A statement that failure to either pay the proposed penalty on the Notice of Violation or to decline the Notice of Violation and request a hearing within 30 days of the date shown on the Notice of Violation will result in a finding of violation by default and that NHTSA will proceed with the civil penalty in the amount proposed on the Notice of Violation without processing the violation under the hearing procedures set forth in this subpart.
              (c) The Notice of Violation may be delivered to the party by:
              (1) Hand-delivery to the party or an employee of the party;
              (2) Mailing to the party (certified mail is not required);

              (e) If a party pays the proposed penalty on the Notice of Violation or an amount agreed on in compromise within 30 days of the date shown on the Notice of Violation, a finding of “resolved with payment” will be entered into the case file. Such payment shall not be an admission of liability.
              (f) If the party agrees to pay the proposed penalty, but has not made payment within 30 days of the date shown on the Notice of Violation, NHTSA will enter a finding of violation by default in the matter and NHTSA will proceed with the civil penalty in the amount proposed on the Notice of Violation without processing the violation under the hearing procedures set forth in this subpart.
              (g) If within 30 days of the date shown on the Notice of Violation a party fails to pay the proposed penalty on the Notice of Violation; and fails to request a hearing, then NHTSA will enter a finding of violation by default in the case file, and will assess the civil penalty in the amount set forth on the Notice of Violation without processing the violation under the hearing procedures set forth in this subpart.
              (h) NHTSA's order assessing the civil penalty following a party's default is final agency action.

Prior to taking notice of a matter, the Hearing Officer shall give the party an opportunity to show why notice should not be taken. In any case in which notice is taken, the Hearing Officer places a written statement of the matters as to which notice was taken in the record, with the basis for such notice, including a statement that the party consented to notice being taken or a summary of the party's objections.
              (i) After the evidence in the case has been presented, the Chief Counsel and the party may present argument on the issues in the case.

              (j) A verbatim transcript of the hearing will not normally be prepared. A party may, solely at its own expense, cause a verbatim transcript to be made. If a verbatim transcript is made, the party shall submit two copies to the Hearing Officer not later than 15 days of the hearing. The Hearing Officer shall include such transcript in the record.
            
            
              § 599.514
              Assessment of civil penalties.
              (a) Not later than 30 days following the close of the hearing, the Hearing Officer shall issue a written decision on the Notice of Violation, based on the hearing record. The decision shall set forth the basis for the Hearing Officer's assessment of a civil penalty, or decision not to assess a civil penalty. In determining the amount of the civil penalty, the severity of the violation and the intent and history of the party committing the violation shall be taken into account. The assessment of a civil penalty by the Hearing Officer shall be set forth in an accompanying final order.
              (b) If the Hearing Officer assesses civil penalties in excess of $100,000.00, the Hearing Officer's decision contains a statement advising the party of the right to an administrative appeal to the Administrator. The party is advised that failure to submit an appeal within the prescribed time will bar its consideration and that failure to appeal on the basis of a particular issue will constitute a waiver of that issue in its appeal before the Administrator.
              (c) The filing of a timely and complete appeal to the Administrator of a Hearing Officer's order assessing a civil penalty shall suspend the operation of the Hearing Officer's penalty.
              (d) There shall be no administrative appeals of civil penalties of $100,000.00 or less.
            
            
              § 599.515
              Appeals of civil penalties in excess of $100,000.00.
              (a) A party may appeal the Hearing Officer's order assessing civil penalties over $100,000.00 to the Administrator within 21 days of the date of the issuance of the Hearing Officer's order.
              (b) The Administrator will affirm the decision of the Hearing Officer unless the Administrator finds that the Hearing Officer's decision was unsupported by the record as a whole.
              (c) If the Administrator finds that the decision of the Hearing Officer was unsupported, in whole or in part, then the Administrator may:
              (1) Assess or modify a civil penalty;
              (2) Rescind the Notice of Violation; or
              (3) Remand the case back to the Hearing Officer for new or additional proceedings.
              (d) In the absence of a remand, the decision of the Administrator in an appeal is a final agency action.
            
            
              § 599.516
              Collection of assessed or compromised civil penalties.

              (a) Payment of a civil penalty, whether assessed or compromised, shall be made by check, postal money order, or electronic transfer of funds, as provided in instructions by the agency. A payment of civil penalties shall not be considered a request for a hearing.
              (b) The party must remit payment of any assessed civil penalty to NHTSA within 30 days after receipt of the Hearing Officer's order assessing civil penalties or, in the case of an appeal to the Administrator, within 30 days after receipt of the Administrator's decision on the appeal. Failure to make timely payment may result in the institution of appropriate action under the Federal Claims Collection Act, as amended, the regulations issued thereunder, and other applicable law.
              (c) The party must remit payment of any compromised civil penalty to NHTSA on the date and under such terms and conditions as agreed to by the party and NHTSA. Failure to pay a compromised civil penalty to NHTSA on the date and under such terms and conditions as agreed to by the party and NHTSA may either result in the institution of appropriate action under the Federal Claims Collection Act, as amended, the regulations issued thereunder, and other applicable law, or NHTSA entering a finding of violation by default and assessing a civil penalty in the amount proposed in the Notice of Violation without processing the violation under the hearing procedures set forth in this part.
            
            
              § 599.517
              Other sanctions.
              The procedures and penalties described in this subpart are not the only procedures and penalties that may apply to someone who violates the CARS Act or submits a false certification required by this rule. Anyone who submits false information on these forms or otherwise violates the CARS Act or this part may not only be subject to the procedures and penalties described in this subpart, but also civil and criminal penalties. Such civil and criminal penalties may include penalties three times any amount falsely claimed to be due from the United States pursuant to the False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. 3729), or imprisonment of up to 5 years and fines of up to $250,000 (18 U.S.C. 1001). In addition, NHTSA may request that the Attorney General seek appropriate injunctive relief to address violations of the CARS Act or this part.
            
          
          
            Subpart F—Requirements and Procedures for Exceptions
            
              Source:
              74 FR 49340, Sept. 28, 2009, unless otherwise noted.
            
            
              § 599.600
              Exceptions—Applicability and requirements.
              (a) Applicability. (1) Eligible Requesters. To qualify for an exception under this subpart, a requester must be a dealer registered in accordance with the requirements of § 599.200.
              (2) Filing deadline. A request for an exception must be postmarked no later than October 13, 2009.
              (3) Availability of funds. An exception shall be approved under this subpart only if Federal funds are available for payment.
              (4) Exclusion. No exception may be approved for an application for reimbursement that was successfully submitted to the CARS system.
              (b) Threshold requirements. Subject to the requirements of § 599.600(a), a registered dealer may submit a request for exception and seek reimbursement of a CARS credit under this subpart if the dealer:
              (1) Prior to August 24, 2009, 8 pm EDT, completed a qualifying deal meeting the requirements of § 599.300 and § 599.301;
              (2) Took ownership and possession of a trade-in vehicle and transferred ownership and possession of a new vehicle to the purchaser; and
              (3) Prior to August 25, 2009, 8 pm EDT, attempted to submit an application for reimbursement meeting the requirements of § 599.302, but was prevented from submitting the application for any of the reasons identified in § 599.600(c).
              (c) Exception cases. A dealer is eligible for an exception if:
              (1) Password rejection. The dealer's account password was locked out and not reset by NHTSA;
              (2) Transaction rejection. The application was rejected at submission because the dealer entered a State identification number, a trade-in vehicle VIN, or a new vehicle VIN that was already entered into the CARS program system, but that State identification number, trade-in vehicle VIN, or new vehicle VIN was never used for a CARS deal; or
              (3) Other hardship. The dealer experienced any other hardship attributable to NHTSA action or inaction that the Administrator determines in his or her discretion should be redressed, consistent with the purposes of the CARS Act.
            
            
              § 599.601
              Procedures for requesting exception.
              (a) Submission. A request for exception must be made in writing and mailed by United States mail to the NHTSA Administrator, 1200 New Jersey Ave SE., Washington, DC 20590.
              (b) Contents. The request must include paper copies of the following materials:
              (1) Explanation of hardship. A written explanation of a hardship identified in § 599.600(c) that prevented the dealer from submitting its transaction, and the steps the dealer took to contact the agency and timely resolve the issue;
              (2) Proof of hardship. Documents evidencing that the dealer was unable to complete and submit an application for reimbursement prior to the deadline because of hardship caused by NHTSA. Documents may include copies of correspondence with the agency;
              (3) Documentation of qualifying transaction. Paper copies of all supporting attachments required by § 599.302(c)(2) which reveal that a qualifying CARS transaction, including the transfer of ownership and possession of the trade-in vehicle to the dealer and the delivery of ownership and possession of the new vehicle to the purchaser, was made prior to August 24, 2009, 8 p.m. EDT; and
              (4) Certifications. Paper copies of all certifications provided in Appendix A to this part, signed by both the dealer and the purchaser.
              (5) Evidence of prior notice to NHTSA. Evidence, if any, that the dealer attempted to contact NHTSA prior to August 25, 2009, 8 p.m. EDT, to request assistance with a problem described in § 599.600(c).
            
            
              § 599.603
              Disposition of requests for exception.
              (a) In general. Upon receipt of the request for exception, the agency will review the request to determine whether the exception should be granted and approved for payment.
              (b) Deciding official. The NHTSA Administrator or his or her designee shall serve as the Deciding Official for all determinations under this subpart.
              (c) Incomplete requests. A request for exception that fails to include all of the documents required under this subpart may be rejected without further review.
              (d) Denied requests. If the Deciding Official denies the request, the requester will be informed in writing of the reasons for the denial of the request.
              (e) Granted requests. If the Deciding Official grants the request, the requester will be notified by electronic mail, at the e-mail address identified in § 599.200(c)(2)(iii), and the requester's application for reimbursement will be processed for payment by the agency as a qualifying transaction in accordance with § 599.304.
              (f) No appeals. There are no appeals from the Deciding Official's decision.

              General.
              (a) Unless the Administrator, for good cause, finds a notice is impractical, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest, and incorporates such a finding and a brief statement of the reasons for it in the rule, a notice of proposed rulemaking must be issued, and interested persons are invited to participate in the rulemaking proceedings involving rules under an Act.

              § 601.23
              Initiation of rulemaking.

              A petition for extension of the time to submit comments must be received not later than three (3) days before expiration of the time stated in the notice. The filing of the petition does not automatically extend the time for petitioner's comments. Such a petition is granted only if the petitioner shows good cause for the extension, and if the extension is consistent with the public interest. If an extension is granted, it is granted to all persons, and it is published in the Federal Register.
              
            
            
              § 601.27
              Contents of written comments.

Any interested person must submit as part of his/her written comments all material that he/she considers relevant to any statement of fact made by him/her. Incorporation of material by reference is to be avoided. However, if such incorporation is necessary, the incorporated material shall be identified with respect to document and page.
            
            
              § 601.28

              § 601.29
              Additional rulemaking proceedings.
              The Administrator may initiate any further rulemaking proceedings that he/she finds necessary or desirable. For example, interested persons may be invited to make oral arguments, to participate in conferences between the Administrator or his/her representative at which minutes of the conference are kept, to appear at informal hearings presided over by officials designated by the Administrator at which a transcript or minutes are kept, or participate in any other proceeding to assure informed administrative action and to protect the public interest.
            
            
              § 601.30
              Hearings.
              (a) Sections 556 and 557 of Title 5, United States Code, do not apply to hearings held under this part. Unless otherwise specified, hearings held under this part are informal, non-adversary, fact-finding procedures at which there are no formal pleadings or adverse parties. Any rule issued in a case in which an informal hearing is held is not necessarily based exclusively on the record of the hearing.

              (b) The Administrator designates a representative to conduct any hearing held under this part. The Chief Counsel of the Federal Transit Administration designates a member of his/her staff to serve as legal officer at the hearing.
            
            
              § 601.31
              Adoption of final rules.

              Final rules are prepared by representatives of the office concerned and the Office of Chief Counsel. The rule is then submitted to the Administrator for his/her consideration. If the Administrator adopts the rule, it is published in the Federal Register, unless all persons subject to it are named and are personally served a copy of it.
            
            
              § 601.32
              Petitions for rulemaking or exemptions.
              (a) Any interested person may petition the Administrator to establish, amend, or repeal a rule, or for a permanent or temporary exemption from FTA rules as allowed by law.
              (b) Each petition filed under this section must:
              (1) Be submitted in duplicate to the Administrator, Federal Transit Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590;
              (2) State the name, street and mailing addresses, and telephone number of the petitioner; if the petitioner is not an individual, state the name, street and mailing addresses and telephone number of an individual designated as an agent of the petitioner for all purposes related to the petition;
              (3) Set forth the text or substance of the rule or amendment proposed, or of the rule from which the exemption is sought, or specify the rule that the petitioner seeks to have repealed, as the case may be;
              (4) Explain the interest of the petitioner in the action requested, including, in the case of a petition for an exemption, the nature and extent of the relief sought and a description of the persons to be covered by the exemption;
              (5) Contain any information and arguments available to the petitioner to support the action sought; and
              (6) In the case of a petition for exemption, except in cases in which good cause is shown, the petition must be submitted at least 120 days before the requested effective date of the exemption.
            
            
              § 601.33
              Processing of petitions.
              (a) Each petition received under § 601.32 of this part is referred to the head of the office responsible for the subject matter of that petition. Unless the Administrator otherwise specifies, no public hearing, argument or other proceeding is held directly on a petition before its disposition under this section.
              (b) Grants. If the Administrator determines the petition contains adequate justification, he/she initiates rulemaking action under this Subpart C or grants the exemption, as the case may be.
              (c) Denials. If the Administrator determines the petition does not justify rulemaking or granting the exemption, he/she denies the petition.
              (d) Notification. Whenever the Administrator determines that a petition should be granted or denied, the office concerned and the Office of Chief Counsel prepare a notice of that grant or denial for issuance to the petitioner, and the Administrator issues it to the petitioner.
            
            
              § 601.34
              Petitions for reconsideration.

              (a) Any interested person may petition the Administrator for reconsideration of a final rule issued under this part. The petition must be in English and submitted in duplicate to the Administrator, Federal Transit Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC, 20590, and received not later than thirty (30) days after publication of the final rule in the Federal Register. Petitions filed after that time will be considered as petitions filed under § 601.32. The petition must contain a brief statement of the complaint and an explanation as to why compliance with the final rule is not practicable, is unreasonable, or is not in the public interest.
              (b) If the petitioner requests the consideration of additional facts, he/she must state the reason the facts were not presented to the Administrator within the prescribed comment period of the rulemaking.
              (c) The Administrator does not consider repetitious petitions.

              (d) Unless the Administrator otherwise provides, the filing of a petition under this section does not stay the effectiveness of the final rule.
            
            
              § 601.35
              Proceedings on petitions for reconsideration.
              The Administrator may grant or deny, in whole or in part, any petition for reconsideration without further proceedings. In the event he/she determines to reconsider any rule, he/she may issue a final decision on reconsideration without further proceedings, or he/she may provide such opportunity to submit comment or information and data as he/she deems appropriate. Whenever the Administrator determines that a petition should be granted or denied, he/she prepares a notice of the grant or denial of a petition for reconsideration and issues it to the petitioner. The Administrator may consolidate petitions relating to the same rule.
            
            
              § 601.36
              Procedures for direct final rulemaking.
              (a) Rules the Administrator judges to be non-controversial and unlikely to result in adverse public comment may be published as direct final rules. These include non-controversial rules that:
              (1) Affect internal procedures of FTA, such as filing requirements and rules governing inspection and copying of documents;
              (2) Are non-substantive clarifications or corrections to existing rules;
              (3) Update existing forms;
              (4) Make minor changes in the substantive rule regarding statistics and reporting requirements;
              (5) Make changes to the rule implementing the Privacy Act; and
              (6) Adopt technical standards set by outside organizations.
              (b) The Federal Register document will state that any adverse comment or notice of intent to submit adverse comment must be received in writing by FTA within the specified time after the date of publication and that, if no written adverse comment or written notice of intent to submit adverse comment is received, the rule will become effective a specified number of days after the date of publication.

              (c) If no written adverse comment or written notice of intent to submit adverse comment is received by FTA within the specified time of publication in the Federal Register, FTA will publish a notice in the Federal Register indicating that no adverse comment was received and confirming that the rule will become effective on the date that was indicated in the direct final rule.

              (d) If FTA receives any written adverse comment or written notice of intent to submit adverse comment within the specified time of publication in the Federal Register, a notice withdrawing the direct final rule will be published in the final rule section of the Federal Register and, if FTA decides a rulemaking is warranted, a notice of proposed rulemaking will be published in the proposed rule section of the Federal Register.
              
              (e) An “adverse” comment for the purpose of this subpart means any comment that FTA determines is critical of the rule, suggests that the rule should not be adopted, or suggests a change that should be made in the rule. A comment suggesting that the policy or requirements of the rule should or should not also be extended to other Departmental programs outside the scope of the rule is not adverse.

            § 602.1
            Purpose.
            This part establishes the procedures and eligibility requirements for the administration of emergency relief funds for emergency public transportation services, and the protection, replacement, repair or reconstruction of public transportation equipment and facilities which are found to have suffered or are in danger of suffering serious damage resulting from a natural disaster affecting a wide area or a catastrophic failure from an external cause.
          
          
            § 602.3
            Applicability.
            This part applies to entities that provide public transportation services and that are impacted by emergencies and major disasters.
          
          
            § 602.5
            Definitions.

              Affected recipient. A recipient or subrecipient that operates public transportation service in an area impacted by an emergency or major disaster.
            
              Applicant. An entity that operates or allocates funds to an entity to operate public transportation service and that applies for a grant under 49 U.S.C. 5324.
            
              Building. For insurance purposes, a structure with two or more outside rigid walls and a fully secured roof, that is affixed to a permanent site. This includes manufactured or modular office trailers that are built on a permanent chassis, transported to a site in one or more sections, and affixed to a permanent foundation.
            
              Catastrophic failure. The sudden failure of a major element or segment of the public transportation system due to an external cause. The failure must not be primarily attributable to gradual and progressive deterioration, lack of proper maintenance or a design flaw.
            
              Contents coverage. For insurance purposes, contents are personal property within a building, including fixtures, machinery, equipment and supplies. In addition to the costs to repair or replace, contents insurance coverage shall include the cost of debris removal and the reasonable cost of removal of contents to minimize damage.
            
              Emergency. A natural disaster affecting a wide area (such as a flood, hurricane, tidal wave, earthquake, severe storm or landslide) or a catastrophic failure from any external cause, as a result of which:
            (1) The Governor of a State has declared an emergency and the Secretary of Transportation has concurred; or
            (2) The President has declared a major disaster under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5170).
            
              Emergency operations. The net project cost of temporary service that is outside the scope of an affected recipient's normal operations, including but not limited to: evacuations; rescue operations; bus, ferry, or rail service to replace inoperable service or to detour around damaged areas; additional service to accommodate an influx of passengers or evacuees; returning evacuees to their homes after the disaster or emergency; and the net project costs related to reestablishing, expanding, or relocating public transportation service before, during, or after an emergency or major disaster.
            
              Emergency protective measures. (1) Projects undertaken immediately before, during or following the emergency or major disaster for the purpose of protecting public health and safety or for protecting property. Such projects:
            (i) Eliminate or lessen immediate threats to public health or safety; or
            (ii) Eliminate or lessen immediate threats of significant damage or additional damage to an affected recipient's property through measures that are cost effective.
            (2) Examples of such projects include, but are not limited to:
            (i) Moving rolling stock in order to protect it from damage, e.g., to higher ground in order to protect it from storm surges;
            (ii) Emergency communications;

              Emergency repairs. Capital projects undertaken following the emergency or major disaster, until such time as permanent repairs can be undertaken, for the purpose of:
            (1) Minimizing the extent of the damage,
            (2) Restoring service, or
            (3) Ensuring service can continue to be provided until permanent repairs are made.
            
              External cause. An outside force or phenomenon that is separate from the damaged element and not primarily the result of existing conditions.
            
              Heavy maintenance. Work usually done by a recipient or subrecipient in repairing damage normally expected from seasonal and occasionally unusual natural conditions or occurrences, such as routine snow removal, debris removal from seasonal thunderstorms, or heavy repairs necessitated by excessive deferred maintenance. This may include work required as a direct result of a disaster, but which can reasonably be accommodated by a recipient or subrecipient's routine maintenance, emergency or contingency program.
            
              Incident period. The time interval during which the emergency-causing incident occurs. FTA will not approve pre-award authority for projects unless the damage to be alleviated resulted from the emergency-causing incident during the incident period or was incurred in anticipation of that incident. For each Stafford Act incident, FTA will adopt the incident period established by FEMA.
            
              Major disaster. Any natural catastrophe (including any hurricane, tornado, storm, high water, wind-driven water, tidal wave, tsunami, earthquake, volcanic eruption, landslide, mudslide, snowstorm, or drought), or, regardless of cause, any fire, flood, or explosion, in any part of the United States, which in the determination of the President causes damage of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant major disaster assistance under the Stafford Act to supplement the efforts and available resources of States, local governments, and disaster relief organizations in alleviating the damage, loss, hardship, or suffering caused thereby. 42 U.S.C. 5122.
            
              Net project cost. The part of a project that reasonably cannot be financed from revenues. 49 U.S.C. 5302.
            
              Permanent repairs. Capital projects undertaken following the emergency or major disaster for the purpose of repairing, replacing or reconstructing seriously damaged public transportation system elements, including rolling stock, equipment, facilities and infrastructure, as necessary to restore the elements to a state of good repair.
            
              Recipient. An entity that operates public transportation service and receives Federal transit funds directly from FTA.
            
              Resilience. The ability to anticipate, prepare for, and adapt to changing conditions and withstand, respond to, and recover rapidly from disruptions such as significant multi-hazard threats with minimum damage to social well-being, the economy, and the environment.
            
              Resilience project. A project designed and built to address existing and future vulnerabilities to a public transportation facility or system due to a probable occurrence or recurrence of an emergency or major disaster in the geographic area in which the public transportation system is located, and which may include the consideration of projected changes in development patterns, demographics, or climate change and extreme weather patterns. A resilience project may be a stand-alone project or may be completed at the same time as permanent repairs.
            
              Serious damage. Heavy, major or unusual damage to a public transportation facility which severely impairs the safety or usefulness of the facility. Serious damage must be beyond the scope of heavy maintenance.
            
              State. A State of the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Virgin Islands.

            § 602.7
            Policy.
            (a) The Emergency Relief Program is intended to aid recipients and subrecipients in restoring public transportation service and in repairing and reconstructing public transportation assets to a state of good repair as expeditiously as possible following an emergency or major disaster.
            (b) Emergency relief funds are not intended to supplant other Federal funds for the correction of preexisting, non-disaster related deficiencies.
            (c) Following an emergency, affected recipients may include projects that increase the resilience of affected public transportation systems to protect the systems from the effects of future emergencies and major disasters.
            (d) The expenditure of emergency relief funds for emergency repair shall be in such a manner so as to reduce, to the greatest extent feasible, the cost of permanent restoration work completed after the emergency or major disaster.
            (e) Emergency relief funds, or funds made available under 49 U.S.C. 5307 (Urbanized Area Formula Program) or 49 U.S.C. 5311 (Rural Area Formula Program) awarded for emergency relief purposes shall not duplicate assistance under another Federal program or compensation from insurance or any other source. Partial compensation for a loss by other sources will not preclude FTA emergency relief fund assistance for the part of such loss not compensated otherwise. Any compensation for damages or insurance proceeds for repair or replacement of the public transit equipment or facility must be used upon receipt to reduce FTA's emergency relief fund participation in the project.
            (1) If a recipient receives insurance proceeds that are directly attributable to specific assets, the recipient must:
            (i) Apply those proceeds to the cost of replacing or repairing the damaged or destroyed project property; or
            (ii) Return to FTA an amount equal to the remaining Federal interest in the lost, damaged, or destroyed project property.
            (2) If under the terms of its policy a recipient receives insurance proceeds that are not attributable to specific assets, such as blanket, lump-sum, or unallocated proceeds, FTA, in consultation with the recipient, will determine the portion of such proceeds that the recipient must attribute to transit assets.

            (3) Any insurance proceeds not attributable to transit assets may be used for other purposes without obligation to FTA, including as local share for FTA grants.
            
            (f) The Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 (42 U.S.C. 4001 et seq.) provides that Federal agencies may not provide any financial assistance for the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, repair, or improvement of a building in a special flood hazard area (100-year flood zone) unless the recipient has first acquired flood insurance to cover the buildings and contents constructed or repaired with Federal funds, in an amount at least equal to the Federal investment (less land cost) or to the maximum limit of coverage made available under the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, whichever is less.
            (1) Transit facilities to which this paragraph (f) applies are buildings located in special flood hazard areas and include but are not limited to maintenance facilities, storage facilities, above-ground stations and terminals, and manufactured or modular office trailers.
            (2) Flood insurance is not required for underground subway stations, track, tunnels, ferry docks, or to any transit facilities located outside of a special flood hazard area.
            (g) Recipients must obtain and maintain flood insurance on those buildings and contents for which FTA has provided funds.
          
          
            § 602.9
            Federal share.
            (a) A grant, contract, or other agreement for emergency operations, emergency protective measures, emergency repairs, permanent repairs and resilience projects under 49 U.S.C. 5324 shall be for up to 80 percent of the net project cost.
            (b) A grant made available under 49 U.S.C. 5307 or 49 U.S.C. 5311 to address an emergency shall be for up to 80 percent of the net project cost for capital projects, and up to 50 percent of the net project cost for operations projects.
            (c) The FTA Administrator may waive, in whole or part, the non-Federal share required under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
          
          
            § 602.11
            Pre-award authority.
            (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, pre-award authority for the Emergency Relief Program shall be effective beginning on the first day of the incident period, subject to the appropriation of Emergency Relief Program funds.
            (b) Recipients may use section 5307 or section 5311 formula funds to address an emergency, and, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, pre-award authority shall be effective beginning on the first day of the incident period of the emergency or major disaster.
            (c) For expected weather events, pre-award authority for evacuations and activities to protect public transportation vehicles, equipment and facilities, shall be effective in advance of the event under the following conditions:
            (1) The Governor of a State declares a state of emergency and requests concurrence by the Secretary of Transportation or makes a request to the President for an emergency declaration, in advance or anticipation of the impact of an incident that threatens such damage as could result in a major disaster;
            (2) The Governor takes appropriate action under State law and directs execution of the State emergency plan;
            (3) The activities are required in anticipation of the event; and
            (4) Assistance for a pre-disaster emergency declaration is limited to Emergency Protective Measures and Emergency Operations.
            (d) Pre-award authority shall be subject to a maximum amount determined by FTA based on estimates of immediate financial need, preliminary damage assessments, available Emergency Relief funds and other criteria to be determined in response to a particular event.
            (e) Pre-award authority is not a legal or implied commitment that the subject project will be approved for FTA assistance or that FTA will obligate Federal funds. Furthermore, it is not a legal or implied commitment that all activities undertaken by the applicant will be eligible for inclusion in the project(s).
            (f) Except as provided in § 602.15, all FTA statutory, procedural, and contractual requirements must be met.

            (g) The recipient must take no action that prejudices the legal and administrative findings that the FTA Regional Administrator must make in order to approve a project.
            
            (h) The Federal amount of any future FTA assistance awarded to the recipient for the project will be determined on the basis of the overall scope of activities and the prevailing statutory provisions with respect to the Federal/non-Federal match ratio at the time the funds are obligated.
            (i) When FTA subsequently awards a grant for the project, the Financial Status Report in FTA's electronic grants management system must indicate the use of pre-award authority.
          
          
            § 602.13
            Eligible activities.

            (4) Permanent repairs;
            (5) Actual engineering and construction costs on approved projects;
            (6) Repair or replacement of spare parts that are the property of an affected recipient or subrecipient and held in the normal course of business that are damaged or destroyed; and
            (7) Resilience projects.
            (c) Ineligible uses of Emergency Relief funds include:
            (1) Heavy maintenance;
            (2) Project costs for which the recipient has received funding from another Federal agency;
            (3) Project costs for which the recipient has received funding through payments from insurance policies;
            (4) Except for resilience projects that have been approved in advance, projects that change the function of the original infrastructure;
            (5) Projects for which funds were obligated in an FTA grant prior to the declared emergency or major disaster;
            (6) Reimbursements for lost revenue due to service disruptions caused by an emergency or major disaster;
            (7) Project costs associated with the replacement or replenishment of damaged or lost material that are not the property of the affected recipient and not incorporated into a public transportation system such as stockpiled materials or items awaiting installation; and
            (8) Other project costs FTA determines are not appropriate for the Emergency Relief Program.
          
          
            § 602.15
            Grant requirements.
            (a) Funding available under the Emergency Relief program is subject to the terms and conditions FTA determines are necessary.
            (b) The FTA Administrator shall determine the terms and conditions based on the circumstances of a specific emergency or major disaster for which funding is available under the Emergency Relief Program.
            (1) In general, projects funded under the Emergency Relief Program shall be subject to the requirements of chapter 53 of title 49, United States Code, as well as cross-cutting requirements, including but not limited to those outlined in FTA's Master Agreement.
            (2) The FTA Administrator may determine that certain requirements associated with public transportation programs are inapplicable as necessary and appropriate for emergency repairs, permanent repairs, emergency protective measures and emergency operating expenses that are incurred within 45 days of the emergency or major disaster, or longer as determined by FTA. If the FTA Administrator determines any requirement is inapplicable, the determination shall apply to all eligible activities undertaken with funds authorized under 49 U.S.C. 5324 within the 45-day period, as well as funds authorized under 49 U.S.C. 5307 and 5311 and used for eligible emergency relief activities.
            (3) FTA shall publish a notice on its Web site and in the emergency relief docket established under 49 CFR part 601 regarding the grant requirements for a particular emergency or major disaster.

            (c) In the event an affected recipient or subrecipient believes an FTA requirement limits its ability to respond to the emergency or major disaster, the recipient or subrecipient may request that the requirement be waived in accordance with the emergency relief docket process as outlined in 49 CFR part 601, subpart D. Applicants should not proceed on projects assuming that requests for such waivers will be granted.
            
            (d) In accordance with Executive Order 11988, Floodplain Management, recipients shall not use grant funds for any activity in an area delineated as a special flood hazard area or equivalent, as labeled in the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs). If there are no alternatives but to locate the action in a floodplain, prior to seeking FTA funding for such action, the recipient shall design or modify its actions in order to minimize potential harm to or within the floodplain.
            (1) Except as otherwise provided in this subparagraph, recipients shall use the “best available information” as identified by FEMA, which includes advisory data (such as Advisory Base Flood Elevations (ABFEs)), preliminary and final Flood Insurance Rate Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies (FISs).
            (2) If FEMA data is mutually determined by FTA and the recipient to be unavailable or insufficiently detailed, other Federal, State, or local data may be used as “best available information” in accordance with Executive Order 11988.
            (3) The final determination on “best available information” shall be used to establish such reconstruction requirements as a project's minimum elevation.
            (4) Where higher minimum elevations are required by either State or locally adopted building codes or standards, the higher of the State or local minimums would apply.
            (5) A base flood elevation from an interim or preliminary or non-FEMA source may not be used if it is lower than the current FIRM.
            (6) Recipients shall also consider the best available data on sea-level rise, storm surge, scouring and erosion before rebuilding.
          
          
            § 602.17
            Application procedures.
            (a) As soon as practical after an emergency, major disaster or catastrophic failure, affected recipients shall make a preliminary field survey, working cooperatively with the appropriate FTA Regional Administrator and other governmental agencies with jurisdiction over affected public transportation systems. The preliminary field survey should be coordinated with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, if applicable, to eliminate duplication of effort. The purpose of this survey is to determine the general nature and extent of damage to eligible public transportation systems.
            (1) The affected recipient shall prepare a damage assessment report. The purpose of the damage assessment report is to provide a factual basis for the FTA Regional Administrator's finding that serious damage to one or more public transportation systems has been caused by a natural disaster affecting a wide area, or a catastrophic failure. As appropriate, the damage assessment report should include by political subdivision or other generally recognized administrative or geographic boundaries—
            (i) The specific location, type of facility or equipment, nature and extent of damage;
            (ii) The most feasible and practical method of repair or replacement;
            (iii) A preliminary estimate of cost of restoration, replacement, or reconstruction for damaged systems in each jurisdiction.
            (iv) Potential environmental and historic impacts;
            (v) Photographs showing the kinds and extent of damage and sketch maps detailing the damaged areas;
            (vi) Recommended resilience projects to protect equipment and facilities from future emergencies or major disasters; and
            (vii) An evaluation of reasonable alternatives, including change of location, addition of resilience/mitigation elements, and any other alternative the recipient considered, for any damaged transit facility that has been previously repaired or reconstructed as a result of an emergency or major disaster.
            (2) Unless unusual circumstances prevail, the initial damage assessment report should be prepared within 60 days following the emergency, major disaster, or catastrophic failure. Affected recipients should update damage assessment reports as appropriate.

            (3) For large disasters where extensive damage to public transportation systems is readily evident, the FTA Regional Administrator may approve an application for assistance prior to submission of the damage assessment report. In these cases, the applicant shall prepare and submit to the FTA Regional Administrator an abbreviated or preliminary damage assessment report, summarizing eligible repair costs by jurisdiction, after the damage inspections have been completed.
            (b) Before funds can be made available, a grant application for emergency relief funds must be made to, and approved by, the appropriate FTA Regional Administrator. The application shall include:
            (1) A copy of the damage assessment report, as appropriate;
            (2) A list of projects, as documented in the damage assessment report, identifying emergency operations, emergency protective measures, and emergency repairs completed as well as permanent repairs needed to repair, reconstruct or replace the seriously damaged or destroyed rolling stock, equipment, facilities, and infrastructure to a state of good repair; and
            (3) Supporting documentation showing other sources of funding available, including insurance policies, agreements with other Federal agencies, and any other source of funds available to address the damage resulting from the emergency or major disaster.
            (c) Applications for emergency operations must include the dates, hours, number of vehicles, and total fare revenues received for the emergency service. Only net project costs may be reimbursed.
            (d) Applicants that receive funding from another Federal agency for operating expenses and also seek funding from FTA for operating expenses must include:
            (1) A copy of the agreement with the other Federal agency, including the scope of the agreement, the amount funded, and the dates the other agency funded operating costs; and
            (2) The scope of service and dates for which the applicant is seeking FTA funding.
            (e) Applicants that receive funding from another Federal agency for emergency or permanent repairs or emergency protective measures and also seek funding from FTA for emergency or permanent repairs or emergency protective measures must include:
            (1) A copy of the agreement with the other Federal agency, including the scope of the agreement and the amount funded; and
            (2) A list of projects included in the other agency's application or equivalent document.
            (f) Applicants are responsible for preparing and submitting a grant application. The FTA regional office may provide technical assistance to the applicant in preparation of a program of projects. This work may involve joint site inspections to view damage and reach tentative agreement on the type of permanent repairs the applicant will undertake. Project information should be kept to a minimum, but should be sufficient to identify the approved disaster or catastrophe and to permit a determination of the eligibility of proposed work. If the appropriate FTA Regional Administrator determines the damage assessment report is of sufficient detail to meet these criteria, additional project information need not be submitted.
            (g) The appropriate FTA Regional Administrator's approval of the grant application constitutes a finding of eligibility under 49 U.S.C. 5324.

              (c) The Chief Counsel may request additional information, as necessary, from the party submitting the request for an advisory opinion.
              (d) A request for an advisory opinion may be denied if:
              (1) The request contains incomplete information on which to base an informed advisory opinion;
              (2) The Chief Counsel concludes that an advisory opinion cannot reasonably be given on the matter involved;
              (3) The matter is adequately covered by a prior advisory opinion or a regulation;
              (4) The Chief Counsel otherwise concludes that an advisory opinion would not be in the public interest.
            
            
              § 604.19
              Processing of advisory opinions.

              (a) A request for an advisory opinion shall be sent to the Chief Counsel at ombudsman.charterservice@dot.gov, and filed electronically in the Charter Service Advisory Opinion/Cease and Desist Order docket number FTA-2007-0023 at http://www.regulations.gov or sent to the dockets office located at 1200 New Jersey Ave., SE., West Building Ground Floor, Room W12-140, Washington, DC 20590, for submission to that docket.
              (b) The Chief Counsel shall make every effort to respond to a request for an advisory opinion within ten days of receipt of a request that complies with § 604.18(b). The Chief Counsel shall send his or her decision to the interested party, the docket, and the recipient, if appropriate.
            
            
              § 604.20
              Effect of an advisory opinion.
              (a) An advisory opinion represents the formal position of FTA on a matter, and except as provided in § 604.25 of this subpart, obligates the agency to follow it until it is amended or revoked.
              (b) An advisory opinion may be used in administrative or court proceedings to illustrate acceptable and unacceptable procedures or standards, but not as a legal requirement and is limited to the factual circumstances described in the request for an advisory opinion. The Chief Counsel's advisory opinion shall not be binding upon a Presiding Official conducting a proceeding under subpart I of this part.
              (c) A statement made or advice provided by an FTA employee constitutes an advisory opinion only if it is issued in writing under this section. A statement or advice given by an FTA employee orally, or given in writing, but not under this section, is an informal communication that represents the best judgment of that employee at the time but does not constitute an advisory opinion, does not necessarily represent the formal position of FTA, and does not bind or otherwise obligate or commit the agency to the views expressed.
            
            
              § 604.21
              Special considerations for advisory opinions.
              Based on new facts involving significant financial considerations, the Chief Counsel may take appropriate enforcement action contrary to an advisory opinion before amending or revoking the opinion. This action shall be taken only with the approval of the Administrator.

              Request for a cease and desist order.

              (a) An interested party may also request a cease and desist order as part of its request for an advisory opinion. A request for a cease and desist order shall contain the following information in addition to the information required for an advisory opinion:
              (1) A description of the need for the cease and desist order, a detailed description of the lost business opportunity the interested party is likely to suffer if the recipient performs the charter service in question, and how the public interest will be served by avoiding or ameliorating the lost business opportunity. A registered charter provider must distinguish its loss from that of other registered charter providers in the geographic service area.
              (2) A detailed description of the efforts made to notify the recipient of the potential violation of the charter service regulations. Include names, titles, phone numbers or e-mail addresses of persons contacted, date and times contact was made, and the response received, if any.
              (b) A request for a cease and desist order may be denied if:
              (1) The request contains incomplete information on which to base an informed a cease and desist order;
              (2) The Chief Counsel concludes that a cease and desist order cannot reasonably be given on the matter involved;
              (3) The matter is adequately covered by a prior a cease and desist order; or
              (4) The Chief Counsel otherwise concludes that a cease and desist order would not be in the public interest.

              § 604.23
              Effect of a cease and desist order.
              (a) Issuance of a cease and desist order against a recipient shall be considered as an aggravating factor in determining the remedy to impose against the recipient in future findings of noncompliance with this part, if the recipient provides the service described in the cease and desist order issued by the Chief Counsel.
              (b) In determining whether to grant the request for a cease and desist order, the Chief Counsel shall consider the specific facts shown in the signed, sworn request for a cease and desist order, applicable statutes and regulations, and any other information that is relevant to the request.

              (a) The Chief Counsel may grant a request for a cease and desist order if the interested party demonstrates, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the planned provision of charter service by a recipient would violate this part.
              (b) In determining whether to grant the request for a cease and desist order, the Chief Counsel shall consider the specific facts shown in the signed, sworn request for a cease and desist order, applicable statutes, regulations, agreements, and any other information that is relevant to the request.

              § 604.37
              Appearances, parties, and rights of parties.
              (a) Any party to the hearing may appear and be heard in person and any party to the hearing may be accompanied, represented, or advised by an attorney licensed by a State, the District of Columbia, or a territory of the United States to practice law or appear before the courts of that State or territory, or by another duly authorized representative. An attorney, or other duly authorized representative, who represents a party shall file according to the filing and service procedures contained in § 604.30 and § 604.31.
              (b) The parties to the hearing are the respondent(s) named in the hearing order, the complainant(s), and FTA, as represented by the PO.
              (c) The parties to the hearing may agree to extend for a reasonable period of time the time for filing a document under this part. If the parties agree, the PO shall grant one extension of time to each party. The party seeking the extension of time shall submit a draft order to the PO to be signed by the PO and filed with the hearing docket. The PO may grant additional oral requests for an extension of time where the parties agree to the extension.
              (d) An extension of time granted by the PO for any reason extends the due date for the PO's recommended decision and for the final agency decision by the length of time in the PO's extension.
            
            
              § 604.38
              Discovery.
              (a) Permissible forms of discovery shall be within the discretion of the PO.
              (b) The PO shall limit the frequency and extent of discovery permitted by this section if a party shows that:
              (1) The information requested is cumulative or repetitious;
              (2) The information requested may be obtained from another less burdensome and more convenient source;
              (3) The party requesting the information has had ample opportunity to obtain the information through other discovery methods permitted under this section; or
              (4) The method or scope of discovery requested by the party is unduly burdensome or expensive.
            
            
              § 604.39
              Depositions.
              (a) For good cause shown, the PO may order that the testimony of a witness may be taken by deposition and that the witness produce documentary evidence in connection with such testimony. Generally, an order to take the deposition of a witness is entered only if:
              (1) The person whose deposition is to be taken would be unavailable at the hearing;
              (2) The deposition is deemed necessary to perpetuate the testimony of the witness; or
              (3) The taking of the deposition is necessary to prevent undue and excessive expense to a party and will not result in undue burden to other parties or in undue delay.
              (b) Any party to the hearing desiring to take the deposition of a witness according to the terms set out in this subpart, shall file a motion with the PO, with a copy of the motion served on each party. The motion shall include:
              (1) The name and residence of the witness;
              (2) The time and place for the taking of the proposed deposition;
              (3) The reasons why such deposition should be taken; and
              (4) A general description of the matters concerning which the witness will be asked to testify.
              (c) If good cause is shown in the motion, the PO in his or her discretion, issues an order authorizing the deposition and specifying the name of the witness to be deposed, the location and time of the deposition and the general scope and subject matter of the testimony to be taken.

              (d) Witnesses whose testimony is taken by deposition shall be sworn or shall affirm before any questions are put to them. Each question propounded shall be recorded and the answers of the witness transcribed verbatim. The written transcript shall be subscribed by the witness, unless the parties by stipulation waive the signing, or the witness is ill, cannot be found, or refuses to sign. The reporter shall note the reason for failure to sign.
            
            
              § 604.40
              Public disclosure of evidence.
              (a) Except as provided in this section, the hearing shall be open to the public.
              (b) The PO may order that any information contained in the record be withheld from public disclosure. Any person may object to disclosure of information in the record by filing a written motion to withhold specific information with the PO. The person shall state specific grounds for nondisclosure in the motion.
              (c) The PO shall grant the motion to withhold information from public disclosure if the PO determines that disclosure would be in violation of the Privacy Act, would reveal trade secrets or privileged or confidential commercial or financial information, or is otherwise prohibited by law.
            
            
              § 604.41
              Standard of proof.
              The PO shall issue a recommended decision or shall rule in a party's favor only if the decision or ruling is supported by a preponderance of the evidence.
            
            
              § 604.42
              Burden of proof.
              (a) The burden of proof of noncompliance with this part, determination, or agreement issued under the authority of the Federal Transit Laws is on the registered charter provider.
              (b) Except as otherwise provided by statute or rule, the proponent of a motion, request, or order has the burden of proof.
            
            
              § 604.43
              Offer of proof.
              A party whose evidence has been excluded by a ruling of the PO, during a hearing in which the respondent had an opportunity to respond to the offer of proof, may offer the evidence on the record when filing an appeal.
            
            
              § 604.44
              Record.
              (a) The transcript of all testimony in the hearing, all exhibits received into evidence, all motions, applications requests and rulings, and all documents included in the hearing record shall constitute the exclusive record for decision in the proceedings and the basis for the issuance of any orders.

              (b) Any interested person may examine the record by entering the docket number at http://www.regulations.gov or after payment of reasonable costs for search and reproduction of the record.
            
            
              § 604.45
              Waiver of procedures.
              (a) The PO shall waive such procedural steps as all parties to the hearing agree to waive before issuance of an initial decision.
              (b) Consent to a waiver of any procedural step bars the raising of this issue on appeal.
              (c) The parties may not by consent waive the obligation of the PO to enter a recommended decision on the record.
            
            
              § 604.46
              Recommended decision by a PO.
              (a) The PO shall issue a recommended decision based on the record developed during the proceeding and shall send the recommended decision to the Chief Counsel for ratification or modification not later than 110 days after the referral from the Chief Counsel.
              (b) The Chief Counsel shall ratify or modify the PO's recommended decision within 30 days of receiving the recommended decision. The Chief Counsel shall serve his or her decision, which is capable of being appealed to the Administrator, on all parties to the proceeding.
            
            
              § 604.47
              Remedies.
              (a) If the Chief Counsel determines that a violation of this part occurred, he or she may take one or more of the following actions:
              (1) Bar the recipient from receiving future Federal financial assistance from FTA;

              (2) Order the withholding of a reasonable percentage of available Federal financial assistance; or
              
              (3) Pursue suspension and debarment of the recipient, its employees, or its contractors.
              (b) In determining the type and amount of remedy, the Chief Counsel shall consider the following factors:
              (1) The nature and circumstances of the violation;
              (2) The extent and gravity of the violation (“extent of deviation from regulatory requirements”);
              (3) The revenue earned (“economic benefit”) by providing the charter service;
              (4) The operating budget of the recipient;
              (5) Such other matters as justice may require; and
              (6) Whether a recipient provided service described in a cease and desist order after issuance of such order by the Chief Counsel.
              (c) The Chief Counsel office may mitigate the remedy when the recipient can document corrective action of alleged violation. The Chief Counsel's decision to mitigate a remedy shall be determined on the basis of how much corrective action was taken by the recipient and when it was taken. Systemic action to prevent future violations will be given greater consideration than action simply to remedy violations identified during FTA's inspection or identified in a complaint.
              (d) In the event the Chief Counsel finds a pattern of violations, the remedy ordered shall bar a recipient from receiving Federal transit assistance in an amount that the Chief Counsel considers appropriate.
              (e) The Chief Counsel may make a decision to withhold Federal financial assistance in a lump sum or over a period of time not to exceed five years.
            
          
          
            Subpart J—Appeal to Administrator and Final Agency Orders
            
              § 604.48
              Appeal from Chief Counsel decision.
              (a) Each party adversely affected by the Chief Counsel's office decision may file an appeal with the Administrator within 21 days of the date of the Chief Counsel's issued his or her decision. Each party may file a reply to an appeal within 21 days after it is served on the party. Filing and service of appeals and replies shall be by personal delivery consistent with §§ 604.30 and 604.31.
              (b) If an appeal is filed, the Administrator reviews the entire record and issues a final agency decision based on the record that either accepts, rejects, or modifies the Chief Counsel's decision within 30 days of the due date of the reply. If no appeal is filed, the Administrator may take review of the case on his or her own motion. If the Administrator finds that the respondent is not in compliance with this part, the final agency order shall include a statement of corrective action, if appropriate, and identify remedies.
              (c) If no appeal is filed, and the Administrator does not take review of the decision by the office on the Administrator's own motion, the Chief Counsel's decision shall take effect as the final agency decision and order on the twenty-first day after the actual date the Chief Counsel's decision was issued.
              (d) The failure to file an appeal is deemed a waiver of any rights to seek judicial review of the Chief Counsel's decision that becomes a final agency decision by operation of paragraph (c) of this section.
            
            
              § 604.49
              Administrator's discretionary review of the Chief Counsel's decision.
              (a) If the Administrator takes review on the Administrator's own motion, the Administrator shall issue a notice of review by the twenty-first day after the actual date of the Chief Counsel's decision that contains the following information:
              (1) The notice sets forth the specific findings of fact and conclusions of law in the decision subject to review by the Administrator.
              (2) Parties may file one brief on review to the Administrator or rely on their post-hearing briefs to the Chief Counsel's office. Briefs on review shall be filed not later than 10 days after service of the notice of review. Filing and service of briefs on review shall be by personal delivery consistent with § 604.30 and § 604.31.

              (3) The Administrator issues a final agency decision and order within 30 days of the due date of the briefs on review. If the Administrator finds that the respondent is not in compliance with this part, the final agency order shall include a statement of corrective action, if appropriate, and identify remedies.
              (b) If the Administrator takes review on the Administrator's own motion, the decision of the Chief Counsel is stayed pending a final decision by the Administrator.
            
          
          
            Subpart K—Judicial Review
            
              § 604.50
              Judicial review of a final decision and order.
              (a) A person may seek judicial review in an appropriate United States District Court of a final decision and order of the Administrator as provided in 5 U.S.C. 701-706. A party seeking judicial review of a final decision and order shall file a petition for review with the Court not later than 60 days after a final decision and order is effective.
              (b) The following do not constitute final decisions and orders subject to judicial review:
              (1) FTA's decision to dismiss a complaint as set forth in § 604.29;
              (2) A recommended decision issued by a PO at the conclusion of a hearing; or
              (3) A Chief Counsel decision that becomes the final decision of the Administrator because it was not appealed within the stated timeframes.

              Pt. 604, App. B
              Appendix B to Part 604—Reasons for Removal
              The following is guidance on the terms contained in section 604.26(d) concerning reasons for which FTA may remove a registered charter provider or a qualified human service organization from the FTA charter registration Web site.
              What is bad faith?
              Bad faith is the actual or constructive fraud or a design to mislead or deceive another or a neglect or refusal to fulfill a duty or contractual obligation. It is not an honest mistake. Black's Law Dictionary, Revised Fourth Edition, West Publishing Company, St. Paul, Minn., 1968.
              For example, it would be bad faith for a registered charter provider to respond to a recipient's notification to registered charter providers of a charter service opportunity stating that it would provide the service with no actual intent to perform the charter service. It would also be bad faith if the registered charter provider fails to contact the customer or provide a quote for charter service within a reasonable time. Typically, if a registered charter provider fails to contact a customer or fails to provide a price quote to the customer at least 14 business days before an event, then FTA may remove the registered charter provider from the registration Web site, which would allow a transit agency to step back in to provide the service because the registered charter provider's response to the email would no longer be effective because it is not registered.
              Further, it would be bad faith for a registered charter provider to submit a quote for charter services knowing that the price is three to four times higher because of the distance the registered charter provider must travel (deadhead time). In those situations, FTA may interpret such quotes as bad faith because they appear to be designed to prevent the local transit agency from providing the service.
              On the other hand, FTA would not interpret an honest mistake of fact as bad faith. For example, if a registered charter provider fails to provide charter service in response to a recipient's notification when it honestly mistook the date, place or time the service was to be provided. It would not be bad faith if the registered charter provider responded affirmatively to the email notification sent by the public transit agency, but then later learned it could not perform the service and provided the transit agency reasonable notice of its changed circumstances.
              What is fraud?
              Fraud is the suggestion or assertion of a fact that is not true, by one who has no reasonable ground for believing it to be true; the suppression of a fact by one who is bound to disclose it; one who gives information of other facts which are likely to mislead; or a promise made without any intention of performing it. Black's Law Dictionary, Revised Fourth Edition, West Publishing Company, St. Paul, Minn., 1968.
              Examples of fraud include but are not limited to: (1) A registered charter provider indicates that it has a current state or Federal safety certification when it knows that it does not in fact have one; (2) a broker that owns no charter vehicles registers as a registered charter provider; or (3) a qualified human service organization represents that its serves the needs of the elderly, persons with disabilities, or lower-income individuals, but, in fact, only serves those populations tangentially.
              What is a lapse of insurance?
              A lapse of insurance occurs when there is no policy of insurance is in place. This may occur when there has been default in payment of premiums on an insurance policy and the policy is no longer in force. In addition, no other policy of insurance has taken its place. Black's Law Dictionary, Revised Fourth Edition, West Publishing Company, St. Paul, Minn., 1968.
              What is a lapse of other documentation?
              A lapse of other documentation means for example, but is not limited to, failure to have or loss or revocation of business license, operating authority, failure to notify of current company name, address, phone number, email address and facsimile number, failure to have a current state or Federal safety certification, or failure to provide accurate Federal or state motor carrier identifying number. Black's Law Dictionary, Revised Fourth Edition, West Publishing Company, St. Paul, Minn., 1968.
              What is a complaint that does not state a claim that warrants an investigation or further action by FTA?
              A complaint is a document describing a specific instance that allegedly constitutes a violation of the charter service regulations set forth in 49 CFR 604.28. More than one complaint may be contained in the same document. A complaint does not state a claim that warrants investigation when the allegations made in the complaint, without considering any extraneous material or matter, do not raise a genuine issue as to any material question of fact, and based on the undisputed facts stated in the complaint, there is no violation of the charter service statute or regulation as a matter of law. Based on Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 56(c).

              Examples of complaints that would not warrant an investigation or further action by FTA include but are not limited to: (1) A complaint against a public transit agency that does not receive FTA funding; (2) a complaint brought against a public transit agency by a private charter operator that is neither a registered charter provider nor its duly authorized representative; (3) a complaint that gives no information as to when or where the alleged prohibited charter service took place; or (4) a complaint filed solely for the purpose of harassing the public transit agency.
              [73 FR 44931, Aug. 1, 2008]
            
            
              Pt. 604, App. C
              Appendix C to Part 604—Frequently Asked Questions
              (a) Applicability (49 CFR Section 604.2)
              (1) Q: If the requirements of the charter rule are not applicable to me for a particular service I provide, do I have to report that service in my quarterly report?
              A: No. If the service you propose to provide meets one of the exemptions contained in this section, you do not have to report the service in your quarterly report.
              (2) Q: If I receive funds under 49 U.S.C. Sections 5310, 5311, 5316, or 5317, may I provide charter service for any purpose?
              A: No. You may only provide charter service for “program purposes,” which is defined in this regulation as “transportation that serves the needs of either human service agencies or targeted populations (elderly, individuals with disabilities, and/or low income individuals) * * *” 49 CFR Section 604.2(e). Thus, your service only qualifies for the exemption contained in this section if the service is designed to serve the needs of targeted populations. Charter service provided to a group, however, that includes individuals who are only incidentally members of those targeted populations, is not “for program purposes” and must meet the requirements of the rule (for example, an individual chartering a vehicle to take his relatives including elderly aunts and a cousin who is a disabled veteran to a family reunion).
              (3) Q: If I am providing service for program purposes under one of the FTA programs listed in 604.2.(e), do the human service organizations have to register on the FTA Charter Registration Web site?
              A: No. Because the service is exempt from the charter regulations, the organization does not have to register on the FTA Charter Registration Web site.
              (4) Q: What if there is an emergency such as an apartment fire or tanker truck spill that requires an immediate evacuation, but the President, Governor, or Mayor never declares it as an emergency? Can a transit agency still assist in the evacuation efforts?
              A: Yes. One part of the emergency exemption is designed to allow transit agencies to participate in emergency situations without worrying about complying with the charter regulations. Since transit agencies are often uniquely positioned to respond to such emergencies, the charter regulations do not apply. This is true whether or not the emergency is officially declared.
              (5) Q: Do emergency situations involve requests from the Secret Service or the police department to transport its employees?
              A. Generally no. Transporting the Secret Service or police officers for non-emergency preparedness or planning exercises does not qualify for the exemption under this section. In addition, if the Secret Service or the police department requests that a transit agency provide service when there is no immediate emergency, then the transit agency must comply with the charter service regulations.
              (6) Q: Can a transit agency provide transportation to transit employees for an event such as the funeral of a transit employee or the transit agency's annual picnic?
              A: Yes. These events do not fall within the definition of charter, because while the service is exclusive, it is not provided at the request of a third party and it is not at a negotiated price. Furthermore, a transit agency transporting its own employees to events sponsored by the transit agency for employee morale purposes or to events directly related to internal employee relations such as a funeral of an employee, or to the transit agency's picnic, is paying for these services as part of the transit agency's own administrative overhead.
              (7) Q: Is sightseeing service considered to be charter?
              A: “Sightseeing” is a different type of service than charter service. “Sightseeing” service is regularly scheduled round trip service to see the sights, which is often accompanied by a narrative guide and is open to the public for a set price. Public transit agencies may not provide sightseeing service with federally funded assets or assistance because it falls outside the definition of “public transportation” under 49 U.S.C. Section 5302(a) (10), unless FTA provides written concurrence for that service as an approved incidental use. While, in general, “sightseeing” service does not constitute charter service, “sightseeing” service that also meets the definition of charter service would be prohibited, even as an incidental use.
              (8) Q: If a private provider receives Federal funds from one of the listed programs in this section, does that mean the private provider cannot use its privately owned equipment to provide charter service?

              A: No. A private provider may still provide charter services even though it receives Federal funds under one of the programs listed in this section. The charter regulations only apply to a private provider during the time period when it is providing public transportation services under contract with a public transit agency.
              (9) Q: What does FTA mean by the phrase “non-FTA funded activities”?
              A: Non-FTA funded activities are those activities that are not provided under contract or other arrangement with a public transit agency using FTA funds.
              (10) Q: How does a private provider know whether an activity is FTA-funded or not?
              A: The private provider should refer to the contract with the public transit agency to understand the services that are funded with Federal dollars.
              (11) Q: What if the service is being provided under a capital cost of contracting scenario?
              A: When a private operator receives FTA funds through capital cost of contracting, the only expenses attributed to FTA are those related to the transit service provided. The principle of capital cost of contracting is to pay for the capital portion of the privately owned assets used in public transportation (including a share of preventive maintenance costs attributable to the use of the vehicle in the contracted transit service). When a private operator uses that same privately owed vehicle in non-FTA funded service, such as charter service, the preventive maintenance and capital depreciation are not paid by FTA, so the charter rule does not apply.
              (12) Q: What if the service is provided under a turn-key scenario?
              A: To the extent the private charter provider is standing in the shoes of the public transit agency, the charter rules apply. Under a turn-key contract, where the private operator provides and operates a dedicated transit fleet, then the private provider must abide by the charter regulations for the transit part of its business. The charter rule would not apply, however, to other aspects of that private provider's business. FTA also recognizes that a private operator may use vehicles in its fleet interchangeably. So long as the operator is providing the number, type, and quality of vehicles contractually required to be provided exclusively for transit use and is not using FTA funds to cross-subsidize private charter service, the private operator may manage its fleet according to best business practice.
              (13) Q: Does FTA's rule prohibit a private provider from providing charter service when its privately owned vehicles are not engaged in providing public transportation?
              A: No. The charter rule is only applicable to the actual public transit service provided by the private operator. As stated in 49 CFR 604.2(c), the rule does not apply to the non-FTA funded activities of private charter operators. The intent of this provision was to isolate the impacts of the charter rule on private operators to those instances where they stood in the shoes of a transit agency.
              (14) Q: May a private provider use vehicles whose acquisition was federally funded to provide private charter services?
              A: It depends. A private provider, who is a sub-recipient or sub-grantee, when not engaged in providing public transit using federally funded vehicles, may provide charter services using federally funded vehicles only in conformance with the charter regulations. Vehicles, whose only federal funding was for accessibility equipment, are not considered to be federally funded vehicles in this context. In other words, vehicles, whose lifts are only funded under FTA programs, may be used in charter service.
              (15) Q: May a public transit agency provide “seasonal service” (e.g., service May through September for the summer beach season)?
              A: “Seasonal service” that is regular and continuing, available to the public, and controlled by the public transit agency meets the definition of public transportation and is not charter service. The service should have a regular schedule and be planned in the same manner as all the other routes, except that it is run only during the periods when there is sufficient demand to justify public transit service; for example, the winter ski season or summer beach season. “Seasonal service” is distinguishable from charter service provided for a special event or function that occurs on an irregular basis or for a limited duration, because the seasonal transit service is regular and continuing and the demand for service is not triggered by an event or function. In addition, “seasonal service” is generally more than a month or two, and the schedule is consistent from year to year, based on calendar or climate, rather than being scheduled around a specific event.
              (b) Definitions (49 CFR Section 604.3)
              (16) Q: The definition of charter service does not include demand response services, but what happens if a group of individuals request demand response service?

              A: Demand response trips provide service from multiple origins to a single destination, a single origin to multiple destinations, or even multiple origins to multiple destinations. These types of trips are considered demand response transit service, not charter service, because even though a human service agency pays for the transportation of its clients, trips are scheduled and routed for the individuals in the group. Service to individuals can be identified by vehicle routing that includes multiple origins, multiple destinations, or both, based on the needs of individual members of the group, rather than the group as a whole. For example, demand response service that takes all of the members of a group home on an annual excursion to a baseball game. Some sponsored trips carried out as part of a Coordinated Human Services Transportation Plan, such as trips for Head Start, assisted living centers, or sheltered workshops may even be provided on an exclusive basis where clients of a particular agency cannot be mixed with members of the general public or clients of other agencies for safety or other reasons specific to the needs of the human service clients.
              (17) Q: Is it charter if a demand response transit service carries a group of individuals with disabilities from a single origin to a single destination on a regular basis?
              A: No. Daily subscription trips between a group living facility for persons with developmental disabilities to a sheltered workshop where the individuals work, or weekly trips from the group home to a recreation center is “special transportation” and not considered charter service. These trips are regular and continuous and do not meet the definition of charter.
              (18) Q: If a third party requests charter service for the exclusive use of a bus or van, but the transit agency provides the service free of charge, is it charter?
              A: No. The definition of charter service under 49 CFR Section 604.3(c) (1), requires a negotiated price, which implies an exchange of money. Thus, free service does not meet the negotiated price requirement. Transit agencies should note, however, that a negotiated price could be the regular fixed route fare or when a third party indirectly pays for the regular fare.
              (19) Q: If a transit agency accepts a subsidy for providing shuttle service for an entire baseball season, is that charter?
              A: Yes. Even though there are many baseball games over several months, the service is still to an event or function on an irregular basis or for a limited duration for which a third party pays in whole or in part. In order to provide the service, a transit agency must first provide notice to registered charter providers.
              (20) Q: If a transit agency contracts with a third party to provide free shuttle service during football games for persons with disabilities, is that charter?
              A: Yes. Even though the service is for persons with disabilities, the transit agency receives payment from a third party for an event or function that occurs on an irregular basis or for a limited duration. In order for a transit agency to provide the service, it must provide notice to the list of registered charter providers first.
              (21) Q: What if a business park pays the transit agency to add an additional stop on its fixed route to include the business park, is that charter?
              A: No. The service is not to an event or function and it does not occur on an irregular basis or for a limited duration.
              (22) Q: What if a university pays the transit agency to expand its regular fixed route to include stops on the campus, is that charter?
              A: No. The service is not to an event or function and it does not occur on an irregular basis or for a limited duration.
              (23) Q: What if a university pays the transit agency to provide shuttle service that does not connect to the transit agency's regular routes, is that charter?
              A: Yes. The service is provided at the request of a third party, the university, for the exclusive use of a bus or van by the university students and faculty for a negotiated price.
              (24) Q: What if the university pays the transit agency to provide shuttle service to football games and graduation, is that charter?
              A: Yes. The service is to an event or function that occurs on an irregular basis or for a limited duration. As such, in order to provide the service, a transit agency must provide notice to the list of registered charter providers.
              (25) Q: What happens if a transit agency does not have fixed route service to determine whether the fare charged is a premium fare?
              A: A transit agency should compare the proposed fare to what it might charge for a similar trip under a demand response scenario.
              (26) Q: How can a transit agency tell if the fare is “premium”?
              A: The transit agency should analyze its regular fares to determine whether the fare charged is higher than its regular fare for comparable services. For example, if the transit agency proposes to provide an express shuttle service to football games, it should look at the regular fares charged for express shuttles of similar distance elsewhere in the transit system. In addition, the service may be charter if the transit agency charges a lower fare or no fare because of a third party subsidy.
              (27) Q: What if a transit agency charges a customer an up front special event fare that includes the outbound and inbound trips, is that a premium fare?
              A: It depends. If the transit agency charges the outbound and inbound fares up front, but many customers don't travel both directions, then the fare may be premium. This would not be true generally for park and ride lots, where the customer parks his or her car, and, would most likely use transit to return to the same lot. Under that scenario, the transit agency may collect the regular outbound and inbound fare up front.
              (28) Q: What if a transit agency wishes to create a special pass for an event or function on an irregular basis or for a limited duration that allows a customer to ride the transit system several times for the duration of the event, is that charter?

              A: It depends. If the special pass costs more than the fare for a reasonable number of expected individual trips during the event, then the special pass represents a premium fare. FTA will also consider whether a third party provides a subsidy for the service.
              (29) Q: Is it a third party subsidy if a third party collects the regular fixed route fare for the transit agency?
              A. Generally no. If the service provided is not at the request of a third party for the exclusive use of a bus or van, then a third party collecting the fare would not qualify the service as charter. But, a transit agency has to consider carefully whether the service is at the request of an event planner. For example, a group offers to make “passes” for its organization and then later work out the payment to the transit agency. The transit agency can only collect the regular fare for each passenger.
              (30) Q: If the transit agency is part of the local government and an agency within the local government pays for service to an event or function of limited duration or that occurs on an irregular basis, is that charter?
              A: Yes. Since the agency pays for the charter service, whether by direct payment or transfer of funds through internal local government accounts, it represents a third party payment for charter service. Thus, the service would meet the definition of charter service under 49 CFR Section 604.3(c) (1).
              (31) Q: What if an organization requests and pays for service through an in-kind payment such as paying for a new bus shelter or providing advertising, is that charter?
              A: Yes. The service is provided at the request of a third party for a negotiated price, which would be the cost of a new bus shelter or advertising. The key here is the direct payment for service to an event or function. For instance, advertising that appears on buses for regular service does not make it charter.
              (32) Q: Under the definition of “Government Officials,” does the government official have to currently hold an office in government?
              A: Yes. In order to take advantage of the Government Official exception, the individual must hold currently a government position that is elected or appointed through a political process.
              (33) Q: Does a university qualify as a QHSO?
              A: No. Most universities do not have a mission of serving the needs of the elderly, persons with disabilities, or low income individuals.
              (34) Q: Do the Boy Scouts of America qualify as a QHSO?
              A: No. The Boy Scouts of America's mission is not to serve the needs of the elderly, persons with disabilities, or low income individuals.
              (35) Q: What qualifies as indirect financial assistance?
              A: The inclusion of “indirect” financial assistance as part of the definition of “recipient” covers “subrecipients.” In other words, “subrecipients” are subject to the charter regulation. FTA modified the definition of recipient in the final rule to clarify this point.
              (c) Exceptions (49 CFR Subpart B)
              (36) Q: In order to take advantage of the Government Officials exception, does a transit agency have to transport only elected or appointed government officials?
              A: No, but there has to be at least one elected or appointed government official on the trip.
              (37) Q: If a transit agency provides notice regarding a season's worth of service and some of the service will occur in less than 30 days, does a registered charter provider have to respond within 72 hours or 14 days?
              A: A transit agency should provide as much notice as possible for service that occurs over several months. Thus, a transit agency should provide notice to registered charter providers more than 30 days in advance of the service, which would give registered charter provider 14 days to respond to the notice. Under pressure to begin the service sooner, the transit agency could provide a separate notice for only that portion of the service occurring in less than 30 days.
              (38) Q: Does a transit agency have to contact registered charter providers in order to petition the Administrator for an event of regional or national significance?
              A: Yes. A petition for an event of regional or national significance must demonstrate that not only has the public transit agency contacted registered charter providers, but also demonstrate how the transit agency will include registered charter providers in providing the service to the event of regional or national significance.
              (39) Q: Where does a transit agency have to file its petition?

              A: A transit agency must file the petition with the ombudsman at ombudsman.charterservice@dot.gov. FTA will file all petitions in the Petitions to the Administrator docket (FTA-2007-0022) at http://www.regulations.gov.
              
              (40) Q: What qualifies as a unique and time sensitive event?
              A: In order to petition the Administrator for a discretionary exception, a public transit agency must demonstrate that the event is unique or that circumstances are such that there is not enough time to check with registered charter providers. Events that occur on an annual basis are generally not considered unique or time sensitive.
              (41) Q: Is there any particular format for quarterly reports for exceptions?

              A: No. The report must contain the information required by the regulations and clearly identify the exception under which the transit agency performed the service.
              
              (42) Q: May a transit agency lease its vehicles to one registered charter provider if there is another registered charter provider that can perform all of the requested service with private charter vehicles?
              A: No. A transit agency may not lease its vehicles to one registered charter provider when there is another registered charter provider that can perform all of the requested service. In that case, the transit vehicles would enable the first registered charter provider to charge less for the service than the second registered charter provider that uses all private charter vehicles.
              (43) Q: Where do I submit my reports?

              A: FTA has adapted its electronic grants making system, TEAM, to include charter rule reporting. Grantees should file the required reports through TEAM. These reports will be available to the public through FTA's charter bus service Web page at: http://ftateamweb.fta.dot.gov/Teamweb/CharterRegistration/QueryCharterReport.aspx. State Departments of Transportation are responsible for filing charter reports on behalf of its subrecipients that do not have access to TEAM.
              (d) Registration and Notification (49 CFR Subpart C)
              (44) Q: May a private provider register to receive notice of charter service requests from all 50 States?
              A: Yes. A private provider may register to receive notice from all 50 States; however, a private provider should only register for those states for which it can realistically originate service.
              (45) Q: May a registered charter provider select which portions of the service it would like to provide?
              A: No. A registered charter provider may not “cherry pick” the service described in the notice. In other words, if the e-mail notification describes service for an entire football season, then a registered charter provider that responds to the notice indicating it can provide only a couple of weekends of service would be non-responsive to the e-mail notice. Public transit agencies may, however, include several individual charter events in the e-mail notification. Under those circumstances, a registered charter provider may select from those individual events to provide service.
              (46) Q: May a transit agency include information on “special requests” from the customer in the notice to registered charter providers?
              A: No. A transit agency must strictly follow the requirements of 49 CFR Section 604.14, otherwise the notice is void. A transit agency may, however, provide a generalized statement such as “Please do not respond to this notice if you are not interested or cannot perform the service in its entirety.”
              (47) Q: What happens if a transit agency sends out a notice regarding charter service, but later decides to perform the service free of charge and without a third party subsidy?
              A: If a transit agency believes it may receive the authority to provide the service free of charge, with no third party subsidy, then it should send out a new e-mail notice stating that it intends to provide the service free of charge.
              (48) Q: What happens if a registered charter provider initially indicates interest in providing the service described in a notice, but then later is unable to perform the service?
              A: If the registered charter provider acts in good faith by providing reasonable notice to the transit agency of its changed circumstances, and that registered charter provider was the only one to respond to the notice, then the transit agency may step back in and provide the service.
              (49) Q: What happens if a registered charter provider indicates interest in providing the service, but then does not contact the customer?
              A: A transit agency may step back in and provide the service if the registered charter provider was the only one to respond affirmatively to the notice.
              (50) Q: What happens if a registered charter provider indicates interest in providing the service, contacts the customer, and then fails to provide a price quote to the customer?
              A: If the requested service is 14 days or less away, a transit agency may step back in and provide the service if the registered charter provider was the only one to respond affirmatively to the notice upon filing a complaint with FTA to remove the registered charter provider from the FTA Charter Registration Web site. If the complaint of “bad faith” negotiations is not sustained by FTA, the transit agency may face a penalty, as determined by FTA. If the requested service is more than 14 days away, and the transit agency desires to step back in, then upon filing a complaint alleging “bad faith” negotiations that is sustained by FTA, the transit agency may step back in.
              (51) Q: What happens if a transit agency entered into a contract to perform charter service before the effective date of the final rule?
              A: If the service described in the contract occurs after the effective date of the final rule, the service must be in conformance with the new charter regulation.
              (52) Q: What if the service described in the notice requires the use of park and ride lots owned by the transit agency?

              A: If the transit agency received Federal funds for those park and ride lots, then the transit agency should allow a registered charter provider to use those lots upon a showing of an acceptable incidental use (the transit agency retains satisfactory continuing control over the park and ride lot and the use does not interfere with the provision of public transportation) and if the registered charter provider signs an appropriate use and indemnification agreement.
              (53) Q: What if the registered charter provider does not provide quality charter service to the customer?
              A: If a registered charter provider does not provide service to the satisfaction of the customer, the customer may pursue a civil action against the registered charter provider in a court of law. If the registered charter provider also demonstrated bad faith or fraud, it can be removed from the FTA Charter Registration Web site.
              (e) Complaint & Investigation Process
              (54) Q: May a trade association or other operators that are unable to provide requested charter service have the right to file a complaint against the transit agency?
              A: Yes. A registered charter operator or its duly authorized representative, which can include a trade association, may file a complaint under section 604.26(a). Under the new rule, a private charter operator that is not registered with FTA's charter registration Web site may not file a complaint.
              (55) Q: Is there a time limit for making complaints?
              A: Yes. Complaints must be filed within 90 days of the alleged unauthorized charter service.
              (56) Q: Are there examples of the likely remedies FTA may impose for a violation of the charter service regulations?
              A: Yes. Appendix D contains a matrix of likely remedies that FTA may impose for a violation of the charter service regulations.
              (57) Q: When a complaint is filed, who is responsible for arbitration or litigation costs?
              A: FTA will pay for the presiding official and the facility for the hearing, if necessary. Each party involved in the litigation is responsible for its own litigation costs.
              (58) Q: What affirmative defenses might be available in the complaint process?
              A: An affirmative defense to a complaint could state the applicability of one of the exceptions such as 49 CFR Section 604.6, which states that the service that was provided was within the allowable 80 hours of government official service.
              (59) Q: What can a transit agency do if it believes that a registered charter provider is not bargaining in good faith with a customer?
              A: If a transit agency believes that a registered charter provider is not bargaining in good faith with the customer, the transit agency may file a complaint to remove the registered charter provider from FTA's Charter Registration Web site.
              (60) Q: Does a registered charter provider have to charge the same fare or rate as a public transit agency?
              A: No. A registered charter provider is not under an obligation to charge the same fare or rate as public transit agency. A registered charter provider, however, must charge commercially reasonable rates.
              (61) Q: What actions can a private charter operator take when it becomes aware of a transit agency's plan to engage in charter service just before the date of the charter?
              A: As soon as a registered charter provider becomes aware of an upcoming charter event that it was not contacted about, then it should request an advisory opinion and cease and desist order. If the service has already occurred, then the registered charter provider may file a complaint.
              (62) Q: When a registered charter provider indicates that there are no privately owned vehicles available for lease, must the public transit agency investigate independently whether the representation by the registered charter provider is accurate?
              A: No. The public transit agency is not required to investigate independently whether the registered charter provider's representation is accurate unless there is reason to suspect that the registered charter provider is committing fraud. Rather, the public transit agency need only confirm that the number of vehicles owned by all registered charter providers in the geographic service area is consistent with the registered charter provider's representation.
              (63) Q: How will FTA determine the remedy for a violation of the charter regulations?
              A: Remedies will be based upon the facts of the situation, including but not limited to, the extent of deviation from the regulations and the economic benefit from providing the charter service. See section 604.47 and Appendix D for more details.
              (64) Q: Can multiple violations in a single finding stemming from a single complaint constitute a pattern of violations?
              A: Yes. A pattern of violations is defined as more than one finding of unauthorized charter service under this part by FTA beginning with the most recent finding of unauthorized charter service and looking back over a period not to exceed 72 months. While a single complaint may contain several allegations, the complaint must allege more than a single event that included unauthorized charter service in order to establish a pattern of violations.
              (f) Miscellaneous
              (65) Q: If a grantee operates assets that are locally funded are such assets subject to the charter regulations?

              A: It depends. If a recipient receives FTA funds for operating assistance or stores its vehicles in a FTA-funded facility or receives indirect FTA assistance, then the charter regulations apply. The fact that the vehicle was locally funded does not make the recipient exempt from the charter regulations. If both operating and capital funds are locally supplied, then the vehicle is not subject to the charter service regulations.
              (66) Q: What can a public transit agency do if there is a time sensitive event, such as a presidential inauguration, for which the transit agency does not have time to consult with all the private charter operators in its area?
              A: 49 Section 604.11 provides a process to petition the FTA Administrator for permission to provide service for a unique and time sensitive event. A presidential inauguration, however, is not a good example of a unique and time sensitive event. A presidential inauguration is an event with substantial advance planning and a transit agency should have time to contact private operators. If the inauguration also includes ancillary events, the public transit agency should refer the customer to the registration list.
              (67) Q: Are body-on-van-chassis vehicles classified as buses or vans under the charter regulation?
              A: Body-on-van-chassis vehicles are treated as vans under the charter regulation.
              (68) Q: When a new operator registers, may recipients continue under existing contractual agreements for charter service?
              A: Yes. If the contract was signed before the new private operator registered, the arrangement can continue for up to 90 days. During that 90 day period, however, the public transit agency must enter into an agreement with the new registrant. If not, the transit agency must terminate the existing agreement for all registered charter providers.
              (69) Q: Must a public transit agency continue to serve as the lead for events of regional or national significance, if after consultation with all registered charter providers, registered charter providers have enough vehicles to provide all of the service to the event?
              A. No. If after consultation with registered charter providers, there is no need for the public transit vehicles, then the public transit agency may decline to serve as the lead and allow the registered charter providers to work directly with event organizers. Alternatively, the public transit entity may retain the lead and continue to coordinate with event organizers and registered charter providers.
              (70) Q: What happens if a customer specifically requests a trolley from a transit agency and there are no registered charter providers that have a trolley?
              A: FTA views trolleys as buses. Thus, all the privately owned buses must be engaged in service and unavailable before a transit agency may lease its trolley. Alternatively, the transit agency could enter into an agreement with all registered charter providers in its geographic service area to allow it to provide trolley charter services.
              (71) Q: How does a transit agency enter into an agreement with all registered charter providers in its geographic service area?
              A: A public transit agency should send an email notice to all registered charter providers of its intent to provide charter service. A registered charter provider must respond to the email notice either affirmatively or negatively. The transit agency should also indicate in the email notification that failure to respond to the email notice results in concurrence with the notification.
              (72) Q: Can a registered charter provider rescind its affirmative response to an email notification?
              A: Yes. If after further consideration or a change in circumstances for the registered charter provider, a registered charter provider may notify the customer and the transit agency that it is no longer interested in providing the requested charter service. At that point, the transit agency may make the decision to step back in to provide the service.
              (73) Q: What happens after a registered charter provider submits a quote for charter services to a customer? Does the transit agency have to review the quote?
              A: Once a registered charter provider responds affirmatively to an email notification and provides the customer a commercially reasonable quote, then the transit agency may not step back in to perform the service. A transit agency is not responsible for reviewing the quote submitted by a registered charter provider. FTA recommends that a registered charter provider include in the quote an expiration date for the offer.

L. 93-503; November 26, 1974; 88 Stat. 1565). Section 109(a) adds a new section 3(g) to the Federal Mass Transit Act of 1964, as amended (49 U.S.C. 1602(g)) and differs from section 164(b) of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1973 (49 U.S.C. 1602a(b)) in that section 3(g) applies to all grants for the construction or operation of mass transportation facilities and equipment under the Federal Mass Transit Act, and is not limited to grants for the purchase of buses as is section 164(b).
              (b) By the terms of section 3(g) no Federal financial assistance may be provided for the construction or operation of facilities and equipment for use in providing public mass transportation service to an applicant unless the applicant and the Administrator enter into an agreement that the applicant will not engage in school bus operations exclusively for the transportation of students and school personnel, in competition with private school bus operators.
            
            
              § 605.2

                Adequate transportation means transportation for students and school personnel which the Administrator determines conforms to applicable safety laws; is on time; poses a minimum of discipline problems; is not subject to fluctuating rates; and is operated efficiently and in harmony with state educational goals and programs.
              
                Agreement means a contractual agreement required under section 3(g) of the Federal Mass Transit Act of 1964, as amended (49 U.S.C. 1602(g)).
              
                Applicant means applicant for assistance under the Acts.
              
                Assistance means Federal financial assistance for the purchase of buses and the construction or operation of facilities and equipment for use in providing mass transportation services under the Acts, but does not include research, development and demonstration projects funded under the Acts.

                Tripper service means regularly scheduled mass transportation service which is open to the public, and which is designed or modified to accommodate the needs of school students and personnel, using various fare collections or subsidy systems. Buses used in tripper service must be clearly marked as open to the public and may not carry designations such as “school bus” or “school special”. These buses may stop only at a grantee or operator's regular service stop. All routes traveled by tripper buses must be within a grantee's or operator's regular route service as indicated in their published route schedules.
              
                Urban area means the entire area in which a local public body is authorized by appropriate local, State and Federal law to provide regularly scheduled mass transportation service. This includes all areas which are either: (a) Within an “urbanized area” as defined and fixed in accordance with 23 CFR part 470, subpart B; or (b) within an “urban area” or other built-up place as determined by the Secretary under section 12(c)(4) of the Federal Mass Transit Act of 1964, as amended (49 U.S.C. 1608(c)(4)).

              Exemptions.
              A grantee or applicant may not engage in school bus operations in competition with private school bus operators unless it demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Administrator as follows:
              (a) That it operates a school system in its urban area and also operates a separate and exclusive school bus program for that school system; or
              (b) That private school bus operators in the urban area are unable to provide adequate transportation, at a reasonable rate, and in conformance with applicable safety standards; or

              (a) The Administrator will consider the comments filed by private school bus operators prior to making any findings regarding the applicant's proposed or existing school bus operations.
              (b) After a showing by the applicant that it has complied with the requirements of 49 U.S.C. 1602(d) and this subpart, the Administrator may approve its school bus operations.
              (c) If the Administrator finds that the applicant has not complied with the notice requirement of this part or otherwise finds that the applicant's proposed or existing school bus operations are unacceptable, he will so notify the applicant in writing, stating the reasons for his findings.

              § 605.30
              Filing a complaint.
              Any interested party may file a complaint with the Administrator alleging a violation or violations of terms of an agreement entered into pursuant to § 605.14. A complaint must be in writing, must specify in detail the action claimed to violate the agreement, and must be accompanied by evidence sufficient to enable the Administrator to make a preliminary determination as to whether probable cause exists to believe that a violation of the agreement has taken place.
            
            
              § 605.31
              Notification to the respondent.
              On receipt of any complaint under § 605.30, or on his own motion if at any time he shall have reason to believe that a violation may have occurred, the Administrator will provide written notification to the grantee concerned (hereinafter called “the respondent”) that a violation has probably occurred. The Administrator will inform the respondent of the conduct which constitutes a probable violation of the agreement.

              The Administrator will allow the respondent not more than 30 days to show cause, by submission of evidence, why no violation should be deemed to have occurred.

                Comptroller General of the  
              
                United States, 
              
                Washington, DC, December 7, 1966.
              
              
                Dear Mr. Wilson: The enclosure with your letter of October 4, 1966, concerns the legality of providing a grant under the Federal Mass Transit Act of 1964 to the City of San Diego, (City), California. The problem involved arises in connection with the definition in subsection 9(d)(5) of the Act, 49 U.S.C. 1608(d)(5), excluding charter or sightseeing service from the term “mass transportation.”

              It appears from the enclosure with your letter that the City originally included in its grant application a request for funds to purchase 8 buses designed for charter service. Subsequently the City amended its application by deleting a request for a portion of the funds attributable to the charter bus coaches. However, in addition to the 8 specially designed charter buses initially applied for, the City allegedly uses about 40 of its transit type buses to a substantial extent for charter-type services. In light of these factors surrounding the application by the City, the enclosure requests our opinion with regard to the legality of grants under the Act as it applies to certain matters (in effect questions), which are numbered and quoted below and answered in the order presented.
              Number one:
              “The grant of funds to a City to purchase buses and equipment which are intended for substantial use in the general charter bus business as well as in the Mass Transportation type business.”
              The Federal Mass Transit Act of 1964 does not authorize grants to assist in the purchase of buses or other equipment for any service other than urban mass transportation service. Section 3(a) of the Act limits the range of eligible facilities and equipment to “* * * buses and other rolling stock, and other real or personal property needed for an efficient and coordinated mass transportation system.” In turn, “mass transportation” is defined, in section 9(d)(5) of the Act, specifically to exclude charter service. We are advised by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) that under these provisions, the Department has limited its grants to the purchase of buses of types suitable to meet the needs of the particular kind of urban mass transportation proposed to be furnished by the applicant.”
              HUD further advises that:
              “One of the basic facts of urban mass transportation operations is that the need for rolling stock is far greater during the morning and evening rush hours on weekdays than at any other time. For that reason, any system which has sufficient rolling stock to meet the weekday rush-hour needs of its customers must have a substantial amount of equipment standing idle at other times, as well as drivers and other personnel being paid when there is little for them to do. To relieve this inefficient and uneconomical situation, quite a number of cities have offered incidental charter service using this idle equipment and personnel during the hours when the same are not needed for regularly scheduled runs. Among the cities so doing are Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Alameda, Tacoma, Detroit and Dallas.
              “Such service contributes to the success of urban mass transportation operations by bringing in additional revenues and providing full employment to drivers and other employees. It may in some cases even reduce the need for Federal capital grant assistance.
              “We do not consider that there is any violation of either the letter or the spirit of the Act as a result of such incidental use f buses in charter service. To guard against abuses, every capital facilities grant contract made by this Department contains the following provisions:
              “ ‘Sec. 4. Use of Project Facilities and Equipment—The Public Body agrees that the Project facilities and equipment will be used for the provision of mass transportation service within its urban area for the period of the useful life of such facilities and equipment. . . . The Public Body further agrees that during the useful life of the Project facilities and equipment it will submit to HUD such financial statements and other data as may be deemed necessary to assure compliance with this Section.’ ”

              It is our view that grants may be made to a city under section 3(a) of the Act to purchase buses needed by the city for an efficient and coordinated mass transportation system, even though the city may intend to use such buses for charter use when the buses are not needed on regularly scheduled runs (i.e., for mass transportation purposes) and would otherwise be idle.
              Number two:

              “Whether a grant of such funds is proper if charter bus use is incidental to mass public transportation operations. If so, what is the definition of incidental use.”
              We are advised by HUD that under its legislative authority, it cannot and does not take charter service requirements into consideration in any way in evaluating the needs of a local mass transportation system for buses or other equipment.
              HUD further advises that:
              “However, as indicated above, we are of the opinion that any lawful use of project equipment which does not detract from or interfere with the urban mass transportation service for which the equipment is needed would be deemed an incidental use of such equipment, and that such use of project equipment is entirely permissible under our legislation. What uses are in fact incidental, under this test, can be determined only on a case-by-case basis.”
              In view of what we stated above in answer to the first question, the first part of question two is answered in the affirmative.
              As to the second part of the question, in Security National Insurance Co. v. Secuoyah Marina, 246F.2d 830, “incident” is defined as meaning “that which appertains to something else which is primary.” Thus, we cannot say HUD's definition of incidental use as set forth above is unreasonable. Under the Act involved grants may be made to purchase buses only if the buses are needed for an efficient and coordinated mass transportation system. It would appear that if buses are purchased in order to meet this need, and are, in fact, used to meet such need, the use of such buses for charter service when not needed for mass transportation services would, in effect, be an “incidental use,” insofar as pertinent here. In our opinion such incidental use would not violate the provisions of the 1964 Act.
              Number three:
              “The grant of funds for mass public transportation purposes to a City which has expressed an intent to engage in the general charter bus business when such funds would in effect constitute a subsidy to the City of its intended charter bus operations; i.e. freeing Municipal funds with which to purchase charter bus equipment.”
              Section 4(a) of the 1954 Act (49 U.S.C. 1603(a)) provides, in part, as follows:
              “* * * The Administrator (now Secretary), on the basis of engineering studies, studies of economic feasibility, and data showing the nature and extent of expected utilization of the facilities and equipment, shall estimate what portion of the cost of a project to be assisted under section 1602 of this title cannot be reasonably financed from revenues—which portion shall hereinafter be called ‘net project cost’. The Federal grant for such a project shall not exceed two-thirds of the net project cost. The remainder of the net project cost shall be provided, in cash, from sources other than Federal funds * * *.”
              It is clear from the legislative history of the Act involved that the “revenues” to be considered are mass transportation system revenues including any revenues from incidental charter operations. There is nothing in the language of the Act which requires HUD to take into account the status of the general funds of an applicant city in determining how much capital grant assistance to extend to that city.
              It should be noted that in a sense nearly every capital grant to a city constitutes a partial subsidy of every activity of the city which is supported by tax revenues, since it frees tax revenues for such other uses.
              Number four:
              “With specific reference to the application of the City of San Diego for funds under its application to the Department of Housing and Urban Development dated June 2, 1966, whether the Act permits a grant to purchase equipment wherein 25 percent of such equipment will be used either exclusively or substantially in the operation of charter bus services.”
              As to the City of San Diego's grant application, we have been advised by HUD as follows:
              “As explained above, the Act authorizes assistance only for facilities to be used in mass transportation service. We could not, therefore, assist San Diego in purchasing any equipment to be used ‘exclusively’ in the operation of charter bus service. Furthermore, as also explained above, assisted mass transportation equipment can be used only incidentally for such charter services.
              “Whether equipment used ‘substantially’ in such service qualifies under this rule can be answered only in the light of the specifics of the San Diego situation. * * * we have already, during our preliminary review of the City's application, disallowed about $150,000 of the proposed project cost which was allocated to the purchase of eight charter-type buses.
              “The final application of the City of San Diego is presently under active consideration by this Department. In particular, we have requested the City to furnish additional information as to the nature and extent of the proposed use, if any, of project facilities and equipment in charter service, so that we can further evaluate the application under the criteria above set forth. We have also requested similar information from Mr. Fredrick J. Ruane, who has filed a taxpayers' suit (Superior Court for San Diego County Civil #297329) against the City, contesting its authority to engage in charter bus operations.”
              As indicated above, it is clear that under the Act in question grants may not legally be made to purchase buses to be used “exclusively” in the operation of charter bus service. However, in view of the purposes of the Act involved it is our opinion that a city which has purchased with grant funds buses needed for an efficient mass transportation system, is not precluded by the act from using such buses for charter service during idle or off-peak periods when the buses are not needed for regularly scheduled runs. As indicated above, such a use would appear to be an incidental use.
              The fourth question is answered accordingly.
              As requested, the correspondence enclosed with your letter is returned herewith.
              Sincerely yours,

            The purpose of this part is to establish formally the requirements of the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) on transportation for elderly and handicapped persons.
          
          
            § 609.3
            Definitions.
            As used herein:
            
              Elderly and handicapped persons means those individuals who, by reason of illness, injury, age, congenital malfunction, or other permanent or temporary incapacity or disability, including those who are nonambulatory wheelchair-bound and those with semi-ambulatory capabilities, are unable without special facilities or special planning or design to utilize mass transportation facilities and services as effectively as persons who are not so affected.
          
          
            § 609.5
            Applicability.
            This part, which applies to projects approved by the Federal Transit Administrator on or after May 31, 1976, applies to all planning, capital, and operating assistance projects receiving Federal financial assistance under sections 5307 or 5308 of the Federal transit laws (49 U.S.C. Chapter 53), and nonhighway public mass transportation projects receiving Federal financial assistance under: (1) Subsection (a) or (c) of section 142 of title 23, United States Code; and (2) paragraph (4) of subsection (e) of section 103, title 23, United States Code. However, under certain circumstances evident in §§ 609.13 through 609.21, the latter sections apply to fixed facilities and vehicles included in projects approved before May 31, 1976. Sections in this part on capital assistance applications, fixed facilities, and vehicles apply expressly to capital assistance projects receiving Federal financial assistance under any of the above statutes.

            § 609.23
            Reduced fare.
            Applicants for financial assistance under section 5307 of the Federal transit laws (49 U.S.C. Chapter 53), must, as a condition to receiving such assistance, give satisfactory assurances, in such manner and form as may be required by the Federal Transit Administrator and in accordance with such terms and conditions as the Federal Transit Administrator may prescribe, that the rates charged elderly and handicapped persons during non-peak hours for transportation utilizing or involving the facilities and equipment of the project financed with assistance under this section will not exceed one-half of the rates generally applicable to other persons at peak hours, whether the operation of such facilities and equipment is by the applicant or is by another entity under lease or otherwise.

            Pt. 609, App. A
            Appendix A to Part 609—Elderly and Handicapped
            The definitions of the term elderly and handicapped as applied under FTA's elderly and handicapped half-fare program (49 CFR part 609) shall apply to this rule. This permits a broader class of handicapped persons to take advantage of the exception than would be permitted under the more restrictive definition applied to the non-discrimination provisions of the Department's section 504 program (49 CFR 27.5), which includes only handicapped persons otherwise unable to use the recipient's bus service for the general public.

            Accordingly, for the purposes of this part, the definition of elderly persons may be determined by the FTA recipient but must, at a minimum, include all persons 65 years of age or over.
            Similarly, the definition of handicapped persons is derived from the existing regulations at 49 CFR 609.3 which provide that Handicapped persons means those individuals who, by reason of illness, injury, age, congenital malfunction, or other permanent or temporary incapacity or disability, including those who are nonambulatory wheelchair-bound and those with semi-ambulatory capabilities, are unable without special facilities or special planning or design to utilize mass transportation facilities and services as effectively as persons who are not so affected.
            To assist in understanding how the definitions might be applied to administration of the charter rule, the following questions and answers previously published by FTA for the half-fare program in FTA C 9060.1, April 20, 1978, are reproduced:
            1. Question: Can the definition of elderly or handicapped be restricted on the basis of residency, citizenship, income, employment status, or the ability to operate an automobile?
            
              Answer: No. Section 5(m) is applicable to elderly and handicapped persons. It is FTA's policy that such categorical exceptions are not permitted under the Act.
            2. Question: Can the eligibility of temporary handicaps be restricted on the basis of their duration?
            
              Answer: Handicaps of less than 90 days duration may be excluded. Handicaps of more than 90 days duration must be included.
            3. Question: Can the definition of handicap be limited in any way?
            
              Answer: FTA has allowed applicants to exclude some conditions which appear to meet the functional definition of handicap provided in section 5302(a)(5) of the Federal transit laws (49 U.S.C. Chapter 53). These include pregnancy, obesity, drug or alcohol addiction, and certain conditions which do not fall under the statutory definition (e.g., loss of a finger, some chronic heart or lung conditions, controlled epilepsy, etc.). Individuals may also be excluded whose handicap involves a contagious disease or poses a danger to the individual or other passengers. Other exceptions should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
            4. Question: Is blindness considered a handicap under Section 5(m)?
            
              Answer: Yes.
            5. Question: Is deafness considered a handicap under section 5(m)?
            
              Answer: As a rule, no, because deafness, especially on buses, is not considered a disability which requires special planning, facilities, or design. However, deafness is recognized as a handicap in the Department of Transportation's ADA regulation, and applicants for Section 5 assistance are encouraged to include the deaf as eligible for off-peak half-fares.
            6. Question: Is mental illness considered a handicap under section 5(m)?
            
              Answer: As a rule, no, because of the difficulty in establishing criteria or guidelines for defining eligibility. However, FTA encourages applicants to provide the broadest possible coverage in defining eligible handicaps, including mental illness.
            7. Question: Can operators delegate the responsibility for certifying individuals as eligible to other agencies?
            
              Answer: Yes, provided that such agencies administer the certification of individuals in an acceptable manner and are reasonably accessible to the elderly and handicapped. Many operators currently make extensive use of social service agencies (both public and private) to identify and certify eligible individuals.
            8. Question: Can operators require elderly and handicapped individuals to be recognized by any existing agency (e.g., require that handicapped persons be receiving Social Service or Veterans' Administration benefits)?
            
              Answer: Recognition by such agencies is commonly used to certify eligible individuals. However, such recognition should not be a mandatory prerequisite for eligibility. For example, many persons with eligible temporary handicaps may not be recognized as handicapped by social service agencies.
            9. Question: Can the operator require that elderly and handicapped persons come to a central office to register for an off-peak half-fare program?
            
              Answer: FTA strongly encourages operators to develop procedures which maximize the availability of off-peak half-fares to eligible individuals. Requiring individuals to travel to a single office which may be inconveniently located is not consistent with this policy, although it is not strictly prohibited. FTA reserves the right to review such local requirements on a case-by-case basis.
            10. Question: Must ID cards issued by one operator be transferable to another?
            
              Answer: No. However, FTA encourages consistency among off-peak procedures and the maximizing of availability to eligible individuals, especially among operators within a single urban area. Nevertheless, each operator is permitted to require its own certification of individuals using its service.
            11. Question: Can an operator require an elderly or handicapped person to submit to a procedure certifying their eligibility before they can receive half-fare? For example, if an operator requires eligible individuals to have a special ID card, can the half-fare be denied to an individual who can otherwise give proof of age, etc, but does not have an ID card?
            
              Answer: Yes, although FTA does not endorse this practice.

            Subpart A—General Provisions
            
              § 611.101
              Purpose and contents.
              (a) This part prescribes the process that applicants must follow to be considered eligible for fixed guideway capital investment grants for a new fixed guideway, an extension to a fixed guideway, or a corridor-based bus rapid transit system (known as New Starts and Small Starts). Also, this part prescribes the procedures used by FTA to evaluate and rate proposed New Starts projects as required by 49 U.S.C. 5309(d) and Small Starts projects as required by 49 U.S.C. 5309(h).
              (b) This part defines how the results of the evaluation described in paragraph (a) of this section will be used to:
              (1) Rate projects as “high,” “medium-high,” “medium,” “medium-low” or “low” as required by 49 U.S.C. 5309(g)(2)(A) and 49 U.S.C. 5309(h)(6);
              (2) Assign individual ratings for each of the project justification criteria specified in 49 U.S.C. 5309(d)(2)(B) and 49 U.S.C. 5309(h)(6);
              (3) Determine project eligibility for Federal funding commitments, in the form of full funding grant agreements (FFGA) for New Starts projects and expedited grant agreements (EGA) for Small Starts projects; and
              (4) Support funding recommendations for the New Starts and Small Starts programs for the President's annual budget request.

              (c) The information collected and ratings developed under this part will form the basis for the Annual Report on Funding Recommendations, required by 49 U.S.C. 5309(o)(1).
            
            
              § 611.103
              Applicability.
              (a) This part applies to all proposals for Federal major capital investment funds under 49 U.S.C. 5309 for new fixed guideways, extensions to fixed guideways, and corridor-based bus rapid transit systems.
              (b) This part does not apply to projects for which an FFGA or PCGA has already been executed, or to projects that have been approved into final design or project development unless the project sponsor requests to be covered by this part. The regulations in existence prior to the effective date of this rule will continue to apply to projects for which an FFGA or PCGA has already been executed and to projects approved into final design or project development unless a project sponsor requests to be covered by this part. New Starts projects approved for entry into final design shall be considered to be in the engineering phase of the New Starts process.

              (c) A New Starts project which has been approved for entry into preliminary engineering under the regulations in existence prior to the effective date of this rule shall be considered to be in the engineering phase of the New Starts process. For the purpose of completing engineering, the regulations in existence prior to the effective date of this rule will continue to apply to a New Starts project approved into preliminary engineering until such time as the sponsor requests an FFGA unless the project sponsor requests to be covered by this part prior to an FFGA.
            
            
              § 611.105
              Definitions.
              The definitions established by Titles 12 and 49 of the United States Code, the Council on Environmental Quality's regulation at 40 CFR parts 1500-1508, and FHWA-FTA regulations at 23 CFR parts 450 and 771 are applicable. In addition, the following definitions apply:
              
                Corridor-based bus rapid transit project means a bus capital project where the project represents a substantial investment in a defined corridor as demonstrated by features such as park-and-ride lots, transit stations, bus arrival and departure signage, intelligent transportation systems technology, traffic signal priority, off-board fare collection, advanced bus technology, and other features that support the long-term corridor investment.
              
                Current year means the most recent year for which data on the existing transit system and demographic data are available.
              
                Early system work agreement means a contract, pursuant to the requirements in 49 U.S.C. 5309(k)(3), that allows some construction work and other clearly defined elements of a project to proceed prior to execution of a full funding grant agreement (FFGA). It typically includes a limited scope of work that is less than the full project scope of work and specifies the amount of New Starts funds that will be provided for the defined scope of work included in the agreement.
              
                EGA means an expedited grant agreement.
              
              
                Engineering is a phase of development for New Starts projects during which the scope of the proposed project is finalized; estimates of project cost, benefits, and impacts are refined; project management plans and fleet management plans are developed; and final construction plans (including final construction management plans), detailed specifications, final construction cost estimates, and bid documents are prepared. During engineering, project sponsors must obtain commitments of all non-New Starts funding.
              
                ESWA means early system work agreement.
              
                Extension to fixed guideway means a project to extend an existing fixed guideway or planned fixed guideway.
              
                FFGA means a full funding grant agreement.
              
                Fixed guideway means a public transportation facility that uses and occupies a separate right-of-way or rail line for the exclusive use of public transportation and other high occupancy vehicles, or uses a fixed catenary system and a right of way usable by other forms of transportation. This includes, but is not limited to, rapid rail, light rail, commuter rail, automated guideway transit, people movers, ferry boat service, and fixed-guideway facilities for buses (such as bus rapid transit) and other high occupancy vehicles. A new fixed guideway means a newly-constructed fixed guideway in a corridor or alignment where no such guideway exists.
              
                FTA means the Federal Transit Administration.
              
                Full funding grant agreement means a contract that defines the scope of a New Starts project, the amount of New Starts funds that will be contributed, and other terms and conditions.
              
                Horizon year means a year roughly 10 years or 20 years in the future, at the option of the project sponsor. Horizon years are based on available socioeconomic forecasts from metropolitan planning organizations, which are generally prepared in five year increments such as for the years 2020, 2025, 2030, and 2035.
              
                Locally preferred alternative means an alternative evaluated through the local planning process, adopted as the desired alternative by the appropriate State and/or local agencies and official boards through a public process and identified as the preferred alternative in the NEPA process.
              
                Long-range transportation plan means a financially constrained long-range plan, developed pursuant to 23 CFR Part 450, that includes sufficient financial information for demonstrating that projects can be implemented using committed, available, or reasonably available revenue sources, with reasonable assurance that the Federally supported transportation system is being adequately operated and maintained. For metropolitan planning areas, this would be the metropolitan transportation plan and for other areas, this would be the long-range statewide transportation plan. In areas classified by the Environmental Protection Agency as “nonattainment” or “maintenance” of air quality standards, the long-range transportation plan must have been found by DOT to be in conformity with the applicable State Implementation Plan.
              
                Major capital transit investment means any project that involves the construction of a new fixed guideway, extension of an existing fixed guideway, or a corridor-based bus rapid transit system for use by public transit vehicles.
              
                NEPA process means those procedures necessary to meet the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), as amended, at 23 CFR Part 771; the NEPA process is completed when the project receives a categorical exclusion, a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) or a Record of Decision (ROD).
              
                New Starts means a new fixed guideway project, or a project that is an extension to an existing fixed guideway, that has a total capital cost of $250,000,000 or more or for which the project sponsor is requesting $75,000,000 or more in New Starts funding.
              
                New Starts funds mean funds granted by FTA for a New Starts project pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 5309(d).
              
                No-build alternative means an alternative that includes only the current transportation system as well as the transportation investments committed in the Transportation Improvement Plan (TIP) (when the horizon year is 10 years in the future) or the fiscally constrained long-range transportation plan (when the horizon year is 20 years in the future) required by 23 CFR Part 450.
              
                Secretary means the Secretary of Transportation.
              
                Small Starts means a new fixed guideway project, a project that is an extension to an existing fixed guideway, or a corridor-based bus rapid transit system project, with a total capital cost of less than $250,000,000 and for which the project sponsor is requesting less than $75,000,000 in Small Starts funding.
              
                Small Starts funds mean funds granted by FTA for a Small Starts project pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 5309(h).
              
                Small Starts project development is a phase in the Small Starts process during which the scope of the proposed project is finalized; estimates of project costs, benefits and impacts are refined; NEPA requirements are completed; project management plans and fleet management plans are further developed; and the project sponsors obtains commitment of all non-Small Starts funding. It also includes (but is not limited to) the preparation of final construction plans (including construction management plans), detailed specifications, construction cost estimates, and bid documents.
            
            
              § 611.107
              Relation to the planning processes.
              All New Starts and Small Starts projects proposed for funding assistance under this part must emerge from the metropolitan and Statewide planning process, consistent with 23 CFR part 450, and be included in the fiscally constrained long-range transportation plan required under 23 CFR part 450.
            
          
          
            Subpart B—New Starts
            
              § 611.201
              New Starts eligibility.
              (a) To be eligible for an engineering grant under this part for a new fixed guideway or an extension to a fixed guideway, a project must:
              (1) Be a New Starts project as defined in § 611.105; and
              (2) Be approved into engineering by FTA pursuant to § 611.209.
              (b) To be eligible for a construction grant under section 5309 for a new fixed guideway or extension to a fixed guideway, a project must:
              (1) Be a New Starts project as defined in § 611.105;
              (2) Have completed engineering;
              (3) Receive a “medium” or better rating on project justification pursuant to § 611.203;
              (4) Receive a “medium” or better rating on local financial commitment pursuant to § 611.205;
              (5) Meet the other requirements of 49 U.S.C. 5309.
            
            
              
              § 611.203
              New Starts project justification criteria.
              (a) To perform the statutorily required evaluations and assign ratings for project justification, FTA will evaluate information developed locally through the planning and NEPA processes.
              (1) The method used by FTA to evaluate and rate projects will be a multiple measure approach by which the merits of candidate projects will be evaluated in terms of each of the criteria specified by this section.
              (2) The measures for these criteria are specified in appendix A to this part and elaborated on in policy guidance. This policy guidance, which is subject to a public comment period, is issued periodically by FTA whenever significant changes to the process are proposed, but not less frequently than every two years, as required by 49 U.S.C. 5309(g)(5).
              (3) The measures will be applied to projects defined by project sponsors that are proposed to FTA for New Starts funding.
              (4) The ratings for each of the criteria in § 611.203(b)(1) through (6) will be expressed in terms of descriptive indicators, as follows: “high,” “medium-high,” “medium,” “medium-low,” or “low.”
              (b) The project justification criteria are as follows:
              (1) Mobility improvements.
              (2) Environmental benefits.
              (3) Congestion relief.
              (4) Economic development effects.
              (5) Cost-effectiveness, as measured by cost per rider.
              (6) Existing land use.
              (c) In evaluating proposed New Starts projects under these project justification criteria:
              (1) As a candidate project proceeds through engineering, a greater level of commitment will be expected with respect to transit supportive plans and policies evaluated under the economic development criterion and the project sponsor's technical capacity to implement the project.
              (2) For any criteria under paragraph (b) of this section that use incremental measures, the point for comparison will be the no-build alternative.
              (d) FTA may amend the measures for these project justification criteria. Any such amendment will be included in policy guidance and subject to a public comment process.
              (e) From time to time FTA may publish through policy guidance standards based on characteristics of projects and/or corridors to be served. If a proposed project can meet the established standards, FTA may assign an automatic rating on one or more of the project justification criteria outlined in this section.
              (f) The individual ratings for each of the criteria described in this section will be combined into a summary project justification rating of “high,” “medium-high,” “medium,” “medium-low,” or “low,” through a process that gives comparable, but not necessarily equal, weight to each criterion. The process by which the project justification rating will be developed, including the assigned weights, will be described in policy guidance.
            
            
              § 611.205
              New Starts local financial commitment criteria.
              In order to approve a grant under 49 U.S.C. 5309 for a New Starts project, FTA must find that the proposed project is supported by an acceptable degree of local financial commitment, as required by 49 U.S.C. 5309(d)(4)(iv). The local financial commitment to a proposed project will be evaluated according to the following measures:
              (a) The proposed share of the project's capital costs to be funded from sources other than New Starts funds, including both the non-New Starts match required by Federal law and any additional state, local or other Federal capital funding (also known as “overmatch”);
              (b) The current capital and operating financial condition of the project sponsor;
              (c) The commitment of capital and operating funds for the project and the entire transit system including consideration of private contributions; and
              (d) The accuracy and reliability of the capital and operating costs and revenue estimates and the financial capacity of the project sponsor.

              (e) From time to time FTA may publish through policy guidance standards based on characteristics of projects and/or corridors to be served. If a proposed project can meet the established standards, FTA may assign an automatic rating on one or more of the local financial commitment criteria outlined in this section.
              (f) As a candidate project proceeds through engineering, a greater level of local financial commitment will be expected.
              (g) FTA may amend the measures for these local financial commitment criteria. Any such amendment will be included in policy guidance and subject to a public comment process.
              (h) For each proposed project, ratings for paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section will be reported in terms of descriptive indicators, as follows: “high,” “medium-high,” “medium,” “medium-low,” or “low.” For paragraph (a) of this section, the percentage of New Starts funding sought from 49 U.S.C. 5309 will be rated and used to develop the summary local financial commitment rating, but only if it improves the rating and not if it worsens the rating.
              (i) The ratings for each measure described in this section will be combined into a summary local financial commitment rating of “high,” “medium-high,” “medium,” “medium-low,” or “low.” The process by which the summary local financial commitment rating will be developed, including the assigned weights to each of the measures, will be described in policy guidance.
            
            
              § 611.207
              Overall New Starts project ratings.
              (a) [Reserved]
              (b) FTA will assign overall project ratings to each proposed project of “high,” “medium-high, “medium,” “medium-low,” or “low” as required by 49 U.S.C. 5309(g)(2)(A).
              (1) These ratings will indicate the overall merit of a proposed New Starts project at the time of evaluation.
              (2) Ratings for individual projects will be developed upon entry into engineering and prior to an FFGA. Additionally, ratings may be updated while a project is in engineering if the project scope and cost have changed materially since the most recent rating was assigned.
              (c) These ratings will be used to:
              (1) Approve or deny advancement of a proposed project into engineering ;
              (2) Approve or deny projects for ESWAs and FFGAs; and

              (3) Support annual funding recommendations to Congress in the Annual Report on Funding Recommendations required by 49 U.S.C. 5309(o)(1).
              (d) [Reserved]

              § 611.211
              New Starts Before and After study.
              (a) During engineering, project sponsors shall submit to FTA a plan for collection and analysis of information to identify the characteristics, costs, and impacts of the New Starts project and the accuracy of the forecasts prepared during development of the project.
              (1) The Before and After study plan shall consider:
              (i) Characteristics including the physical scope of the project, the service provided by the project, any other changes in service provided by the transit system, and the schedule of transit fares;
              (ii) Costs including the capital costs of the project and the operating and maintenance costs of the transit system in appropriate detail; and
              (iii) Impacts including changes in transit service quality, ridership, and fare levels.
              (2) The plan shall provide for:
              (i) Documentation and preservation of the predicted scope, service levels, capital costs, operating costs, and ridership of the project;
              (ii) Collection of “before” data on the transit service levels and ridership patterns of the current transit system including origins and destinations, access modes, trip purposes, and rider characteristics;
              (iii) Documentation of the actual capital costs of the as-built project;
              (iv) Collection of “after” data two years after opening of the project, including the analogous information on transit service levels and ridership patterns, plus information on operating costs of the transit system in appropriate detail;

              (v) Analysis of the costs and impacts of the project; and
              
              (vi) Analysis of the consistency of the predicted and actual characteristics, costs, and impacts of the project and identification of the sources of any differences.
              (vii) Preparation of a final report within three years of project opening to present the actual characteristics, costs, and impacts of the project and an assessment of the accuracy of the predictions of these outcomes.
              (3) For funding purposes, preparation of the plan for collection and analysis of data is an eligible part of the proposed project.
              (b) The FFGA will require implementation of the plan prepared in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.
              (1) Satisfactory progress on implementation of the plan required under paragraph (a) of this section shall be a prerequisite to approval of an FFGA.
              (2) For funding purposes, collection of the “before” data, collection of the “after” data, and the development and reporting of findings are eligible parts of the proposed project.
              (3) FTA may condition receipt of funding provided for the project in the FFGA upon satisfactory submission of the report required under this section.

              (1) As a candidate project proceeds through project development, a greater level of commitment will be expected with respect to transit supportive land use plans and policies and the project sponsor's technical capacity to implement the project.
              (2) For any criteria under paragraph (b) of this section that use incremental measures, the point for comparison will be the no-build alternative.

              (d) FTA may amend the measures for these project justification criteria. Any such amendment will be included in policy guidance and subject to a public comment process.
              (e) From time to time FTA may publish through policy guidance standards based on characteristics of projects and/or corridors to be served. If a proposed project can meet the established standards, FTA may assign an automatic rating on one or more of the project justification criteria outlined in this section.
              (f) The individual ratings for each of the criteria described in this section will be combined into a summary project justification rating of “high,” “medium-high,” “medium,” “medium-low,” or “low” through a process that gives comparable, but not necessarily equal, weight to each criterion. The process by which the project justification rating will be developed, including the assigned weights, will be described in policy guidance.
            
            
              § 611.305
              Small Starts local financial commitment criteria.
              In order to approve a grant under 49 U.S.C. 5309 for a Small Starts project, FTA must find that the proposed project is supported by an acceptable degree of local financial commitment, as required by 49 U.S.C. 5309(h)(3)(c). The local financial commitment to a proposed project will be evaluated according to the following measures:
              (a) The proposed share of the project's capital costs to be funded from sources other than Small Starts funds, including both the non-Small Starts match required by Federal law and any additional state, local, or other Federal capital funding (known as “overmatch”);
              (b) The current capital and operating financial condition of the project sponsor;
              (c) The commitment of capital and operating funds for the project and the entire transit system including consideration of private contributions; and
              (d) The accuracy and reliability of the capital and operating costs and revenue estimates and the financial capacity of the project sponsor.
              (e) From time to time FTA may publish through policy guidance standards based on characteristics of projects and/or the corridors to be served. If a proposed project can meet the established standards, FTA may assign an automatic rating on one or more of the local financial commitment criteria outlined in this section.
              (f) FTA may amend the measures for these local financial commitment criteria. Any such amendment will be included in policy guidance and subject to a public comment process.
              (g) As a candidate project proceeds through project development, a greater level of local financial commitment will be expected.
              (h) For each proposed project, ratings for paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section will be reported in terms of descriptive indicators, as follows: “high,” “medium-high,” “medium,” “medium-low,” or “low.” For paragraph (a) of this section, the percentage of Small Starts funding sought from 49 U.S.C. 5309 will be rated and used to develop the summary local financial commitment rating, but only if it improves the rating and not if it worsens the rating.
              (i) The ratings for each measure described in this section will be combined into a summary local financial commitment rating of “high,” “medium-high,” “medium,” “medium-low,” or “low.” The process by which the summary local financial commitment rating will be developed, including the assigned weights to each of the measures, will be described in policy guidance.
            
            
              § 611.307
              Overall Small Starts project ratings.
              (a) The summary ratings developed for project justification and local financial commitment (§§ 611.303(f) and 611.305(i)) will form the basis for the overall rating for each project.
              (b) FTA will assign overall project ratings to each proposed project of “high,” “medium-high, “medium,” ”medium-low,” or “low,” as required by 49 U.S.C. 5309(e)(8).
              (1) These ratings will indicate the overall merit of a proposed Small Starts project at the time of evaluation.
              (2) Ratings for individual projects will be developed prior to an EGA.
              (c) These ratings will be used to:
              (1) Approve or deny projects for EGAs; and
              

              (2) Support annual funding recommendations to Congress in the Annual Report on Funding Recommendations required by 49 U.S.C. 5309(k)(1).
              (d) FTA will assign overall ratings for proposed Small Starts projects by averaging the summary ratings for project justification and local financial commitment. When the average of these ratings is unclear (e.g., summary project justification rating of “medium-high” and summary local financial commitment rating of “medium”), FTA will round up the overall rating to the higher rating except in the following circumstances:
              (1) A “medium” overall rating requires a rating of at least “medium” on both project justification and local financial commitment.
              (2) If a project receives a “low” rating on either project justification or local financial commitment, the overall rating will be “low.”

              Pt. 611, App. A
              Appendix A to Part 611—Description of Measures Used for Project Evaluation
              Project Justification
              New Starts
              New Starts Project Justification
              FTA will evaluate candidate New Starts projects according to the six project justification criteria established by 49 U.S.C. 5309(d)(2)(A)(iii). From time to time, but not less frequently than every two years as directed by 49 U.S.C. 5309(g)(5), FTA publishes for public comment policy guidance on the application of these measures, and the agency expects it will continue to do so. Moreover, FTA may choose to amend these measures, pending the results of ongoing studies regarding transit benefit and cost evaluation methods. In addition, FTA may establish warrants for one or more of these criteria through which an automatic rating would be assigned based on the characteristics of the project and/or its corridor. FTA will develop these warrants based on analysis of the features of projects and/or corridor characteristics that would produce satisfactory ratings on one or more of the criteria. Such warrants would be included in policy guidance issued for public comment before being finalized.
              (a) Definitions. In this Appendix, the following definitions apply:
              (1) Enrichments mean certain improvements to the transit project desired by the grant recipient that are non-integral to the basic functioning of the project, whose benefits are not captured in whole by other criteria, and are carried out simultaneous with grant execution and may be included in the Federal grant. Enrichments include but are not limited to artwork, landscaping, and bicycle and pedestrian improvements such as sidewalks, paths, plazas, site and station furniture, site lighting, signage, public artwork, bike facilities, and permanent fencing. Enrichments also include sustainable building design features of up to 2.5 percent of the total cost of the facilities (when such facilities are designed to achieve a third-party certification or to optimize a building's design to use less energy, water and reduce greenhouse gas emissions that may not lead directly to an official certification).
              (2) Transit dependent person as used in this context means either a person from a household that owns no cars or a person whose household income places them in the lowest income stratum of the local travel demand model. For those project sponsors choosing to use the simplified national model “transit dependent persons” will be defined as individuals residing in households that do not own a car. Project sponsors that choose to continue to use their local travel model rather than the FTA developed simplified national model to estimate trips will define transit dependent persons as individuals in the lowest socioeconomic stratum as defined in the local model, which is usually either households with no cars or households in the lowest locally defined income bracket.
              (3) Trips mean linked trips riding on any portion of the New Starts or Small Starts project.
              (b) Mobility Improvements. (1) The total number of trips using the proposed project. Extra weight may be given to trips that would be made on the project by transit dependent persons in the current year, and, at the discretion of the project sponsor, in the horizon year. The method for assigning extra weight is set forth in policy guidance.
              (2) If the project sponsor chooses to consider project trips in the horizon year in addition to the current year, trips will be based on the weighted average of current year and horizon year.
              (c) Environmental Benefits. (1) The monetized value of the anticipated direct and indirect benefits to human health, safety, energy, and the air quality environment that are expected to result from implementation of the proposed project compared to:

              (i) The existing environment with the transit system in the current year or, (ii) at the discretion of the project sponsor, both the existing environment with the transit system in the current year and the no-build environment and transit system in the horizon year. The monetized benefits will be divided by the annualized capital and operating cost of the New Starts project, less the cost of enrichments.
              (2) Environmental benefits used in the calculation would include:
              (i) Change in air quality criteria pollutants,
              (ii) Change in energy use,
              (iii) Change in greenhouse gas emissions and
              (iv) Change in safety,
              .(3) If the project sponsor chooses to consider environmental benefits in the horizon year in addition to the current year, environmental benefits will be based on the weighted average of current year and horizon year.
              (d) Congestion Relief. [Reserved]
              (e) Cost-effectiveness. (1) The annualized cost per trip on the project, where cost includes changes in capital, operating, and maintenance costs, less the cost of enrichments, compared to:
              (i) The existing transit system in the current year, or
              (ii) At the discretion of the project sponsor, both the existing transit system in the current year and the no-build transit system in the horizon year.
              (2) If the project sponsor chooses to consider cost-effectiveness in the horizon year in addition to the current year, cost-effectiveness will be based on the weighted average of current year and horizon year.
              (f) Existing Land Use. (1) Existing corridor and station area development;
              (2) Existing corridor and station area development character;
              (3) Existing station area pedestrian facilities, including access for persons with disabilities;
              (4) Existing corridor and station area parking supply; and
              (5) Existing affordable housing in the project corridor.
              (g) Economic Development. (1) The extent to which a proposed project is likely to enhance additional, transit-supportive development based on a qualitative assessment of the existing local plans and policies to support economic development proximate to the project including:
              (i) Growth management plans and policies;
              (ii) Local plans and policies in place to support maintenance of or increases to affordable housing in the project corridor; and
              (iii) Demonstrated performance and impact of policies.
              (2) At the option of the project sponsor, an additional quantitative analysis (scenario-based estimate) of indirect changes in VMT resulting from changes in development patterns that are anticipated to occur with implementation of the proposed project. The resulting environmental benefits from the indirect VMT would be calculated, monetized, and compared to the annualized capital and operating cost of the New Starts project in a manner similar to that under the environmental benefits criterion. Such benefits are not included in the environmental benefits measure.
              New Starts Local Financial Commitment
              From time to time, but not less than frequently than every two years as directed by U.S.C. 5309(g)(5), FTA publishes policy guidance on the application of these measures, and the agency expects it will continue to do so. Moreover, FTA may choose to amend these measures, pending the results of ongoing studies. In addition, FTA may establish warrants for one or more of these criteria through which an automatic rating would be assigned based on the characteristics of the project and/or its corridor. FTA will develop these warrants based on analysis of the features of projects and/or corridor characteristics that would produce satisfactory ratings on one or more of the criteria. Such warrants would be included in draft policy guidance issued for comment before being finalized.
              FTA will use the following measures to evaluate the local financial commitment of a proposed New Starts project:
              (a) The proposed share of total project costs from sources other than New Starts funds, including other Federal transportation funds and the local match required by Federal law;
              (b) The current financial condition, both capital and operating, of the project sponsor;
              (c) The commitment of funds for both the proposed project and the ongoing operation and maintenance of the existing transit system once the project is built including consideration of private contributions.
              (d) The reasonableness of the financial plan, including planning assumptions, cost estimates, and the capacity to withstand funding shortfalls or cost overruns.
              Small Starts
              Small Starts Project Justification

              FTA will evaluate candidate Small Starts projects according to the six project justification criteria established by 49 U.S.C. 5309(h)(4), From time to time, but not less than frequently than every two years as directed by 49 U.S.C. 5309(g)(5), FTA publishes for public comment policy guidance on the application of these measures. Moreover, FTA may choose to amend these measures, pending the results of ongoing studies regarding transit benefit and cost evaluation methods. In addition, FTA may establish warrants for one or more of these criteria through which an automatic rating would be assigned based on the characteristics of the project and/or its corridor. Such warrants would be included in the policy guidance so that they may be subject to public comment.
              (a) Mobility Improvements. (1) The total number of trips using the proposed project with extra weight given to trips that would be made on the project by transit dependent persons in the current year, and, at the discretion of the project sponsor, in the horizon year.
              (2) If the project sponsor chooses to consider project trips in the horizon year in addition to the current year, trips will be based on the weighted average of current year and horizon year.
              (b) Environmental Benefits. (1) The monetized value of the anticipated direct and indirect benefits to human health, safety, energy, and the air quality environment that are expected to result from implementation of the proposed project compared to:
              (i) The existing environment with the transit system in the current year or,
              (ii) At the discretion of the project sponsor, both the existing environment with the transit system in the current year and the no-build environment and transit system in the horizon year. The monetized benefits will be divided by the annualized federal share of the project.
              (2) Environmental benefits used in the calculation would include:
              (i) Change in air quality criteria pollutants,
              (ii) Change in energy use,
              (iii) Change in greenhouse gas emissions, and
              (iv) Change in safety.
              (3) If the project sponsor chooses to consider environmental benefits in the horizon year in addition to the current year, environmental benefits will be based on the weighted average of current year and horizon year.
              (c) Congestion Relief. [Reserved]
              (d) Cost-effectiveness. (1) The annualized federal share per trip on the project where federal share includes funds from the major capital investment program as well as other federal funds, compared to:
              (i) The existing transit system in the current year, or
              (ii) At the discretion of the project sponsor, both the existing transit system in the current year and the no-build transit system in the horizon year.
              (2) If the project sponsor chooses to consider cost-effectiveness in the horizon year in addition to the current year, cost-effectiveness will be based on the weighted average of current year and horizon year.
              (e) Existing Land Use. (1) Existing corridor and station area development;
              (2) Existing corridor and station area development character;
              (3) Existing station area pedestrian facilities, including access for persons with disabilities;
              (4) Existing corridor and station area parking supply; and
              (5) Existing affordable housing in the project corridor.
              (f) Economic Development. (1) The extent to which a proposed project is likely to enhance additional, transit-supportive development based on the existing plans and policies to support economic development proximate to the project including:
              (i) Growth management plans and policies;
              (ii) Policies in place to support maintenance of or increases to the share of affordable housing in the project corridor; and
              (iii) Demonstrated performance and impact of policies.
              (2) At the option of the project sponsor, an additional quantitative analysis (scenario-based estimate) to estimate indirect changes in VMT resulting from changes in development patterns that are anticipated to occur with implementation of the proposed project. The resulting environmental benefits would be calculated, monetized, and compared to the annualized federal share of the project.
              Small Starts Local Financial Commitment
              If the Small Starts project sponsor can demonstrate the following, the project will qualify for a highly simplified financial evaluation:
              (a) A reasonable plan to secure funding for the local share of capital costs or sufficient available funds for the local share;
              (b) The additional operating and maintenance cost to the agency of the proposed Small Starts project is less than 5 percent of the project sponsor's existing operating budget; and
              (c) The project sponsor is in reasonably good financial condition, as demonstrated by the past three years' audited financial statements.
              Small Starts projects that meet these measures and request greater than 50 percent Small Starts funding would receive a local financial commitment rating of “Medium.” Small Starts projects that request 50 percent or less in Small Starts funding would receive a “High” rating for local financial commitment.
              FTA will use the following measures to evaluate the local financial commitment to a proposed Small Starts project if it cannot meet the conditions listed above:
              (a) The proposed share of total project costs from sources other than Small Starts funds, including other Federal transportation funds and the local match required by Federal law;

              (b) The current financial condition, both capital and operating, of the project sponsor;
              
              (c) The commitment of funds for both the proposed project and the ongoing operation and maintenance of the project sponsor's system once the project is built.
              (d) The reasonableness of the financial plan, including planning assumptions, cost estimates, and the capacity to withstand funding shortfalls or cost overruns.

              Appendix B to Part 625—Relationship Amongst SGR Performance Measures, SGR Definition, and SGR Principles
              
                EXAMPLE Relationship amongst SGR performance measures, SGR definition, and SGR principles:

              (a) A tier I provider has a TAM asset inventory containing, in total across all modes, over 150 revenue vehicles in peak revenue service, no rail fixed guideway, multiple passenger and exclusive use maintenance facilities, and various pieces of equipment over $50,000. Their asset inventory is itemized at the level of detail they use in their capital program of projects; it also includes capital assets they do not own but use. The provider conducts condition assessments on those assets in its inventory for which it has direct financial responsibility. The results of the condition assessment indicate that there is an identified unacceptable safety risk in the deteriorated condition of one of their non-revenue service vehicles, but that the non-revenue service vehicles are being used as designed. The condition assessment results show the provider that one non-revenue service vehicle is not in SGR.
              (b) The condition assessment results also inform the investment prioritization process, which for this provider is a regression analysis in a spreadsheet software program. The provider's criteria, as well as their weightings, are locally determined to produce the ranked list of programs and projects in their investment prioritization. The provider batches its projects by low, medium or high priority, identifying in which funding year each project will proceed. The provider has elected to use the ULB defaults, provided by FTA, for each of their modes until such time as they have resources and expertise to develop customized ULBs.
              (c) The provider separates assets within each asset category by class to determine their current performance measure metric. For example, the equipment listed in its TAM asset inventory includes HVAC equipment and service vehicles; however, the SGR performance metric for the equipment category only requires the non-revenue vehicle metrics. Thus, the provider measures only non-revenue vehicles that exceed the default ULB for the modes they own, operate, or manage. This metric is the baseline the provider uses to determine its target for the forthcoming year.
              (d) The provider's equipment baseline, its investment priorities that show minimal funding for non-revenue vehicles over the next 4 years, and its TAM policies, strategies and key asset management activities are used to project its target for the equipment category. Since one of its non-revenue service vehicles indicated an unacceptable safety risk, it is elevated in the investment prioritization for maintenance or replacement. The provider's target may indicate a decline in the condition of their equipment overall, but it addresses the unacceptable safety risk as an immediate priority.
              (e) The cyclic nature of investment prioritization and SGR performance target setting requires the provider to go through the process more than once to settle on the balance of priorities and targets that best reflects its local needs and funding availability from all sources. The provider's accountable executive has ultimate responsibility for accepting and approving the TAM plan and SGR targets. The targets are then submit to the NTD and shared with the provider's planning organization. The narrative report, which describes the SGR performance measure metrics, is also submitted to the NTD.

            § 630.5
            Failure to report data.
            Failure to report data in accordance with this part may result in the noncompliant reporting entity being ineligible to receive any funding under 49 U.S.C. chapter 53, directly or indirectly, until such time as a report is filed in accordance with this part.

            § 630.6
            Late and incomplete reports.
            (a) Late reports. Each reporting entity shall ensure that FTA receives its report by the due dates prescribed in the reference documents. A reporting entity may request a 30 day extension to submit its report. FTA will treat a failure to submit the required report by the due date or the extension date as failure to report data under § 630.5.
            (b) Incomplete reports. FTA will treat an NTD submission that does not contain all of the required data; or does not contain the required certifications, where applicable; or that is not in substantial conformance with the definitions, procedures, and format requirements set out in the reference documents as a failure to report data under § 630.5, unless the reporting entity has exhausted all possibilities for obtaining this information.
          
          
            § 630.7
            Failure to respond to questions.
            FTA will review each NTD submission to verify the reasonableness of the data submitted. If any of the data do not appear reasonable, FTA will notify the reporting entity of this fact in writing, and request written justification from the reporting entity to either document the accuracy of the questioned data, or to revise the questioned data with a more accurate submission. Failure of a reporting entity to make a good-faith written response to this request will be treated as a failure to report data under § 630.5.
          
          
            § 630.8
            Questionable data items.
            FTA may enter a zero, or adjust any questionable data item(s), in any reporting entity's NTD submission that is used in computing the Section 5307 apportionment. These adjustments may be made if any data appears to be inaccurate, have not been collected and reported in accordance with FTA reference documents, or if there is not adequate documentation and a reliable recordkeeping system.
          
          
            § 630.9
            Notice of FTA action.
            Before taking final action under §§ 630.5 or 630.8, FTA will transmit a written request to the reporting entity to provide the necessary information within a specified reasonable period of time. FTA will advise the reporting entity of its final decision.
          
          
            § 630.10
            Waiver of reporting requirements.
            Waivers of one or more sections of the reporting requirements may be granted at the discretion of the Administrator on a written showing that the party seeking the waiver cannot furnish the required data without unreasonable expense and inconvenience. Each waiver will be for a specified period of time.
          
          
            § 630.11
            Data adjustments.
            Errors in the data used in making the Section 5307 apportionment may be discovered after any particular year's apportionment is completed. If so, FTA shall make adjustments to correct these errors in a subsequent year's apportionment to the extent feasible.

            Subpart A—General Provisions
            
              § 633.1
              Purpose.
              This part implements section 324 of the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987 (Pub. L. 100-17), which added section 23 to the FT Act. The part provides for a two-part program for major capital projects receiving assistance from the agency. First, subpart B discusses project management oversight, designed primarily to aid FTA in its role of ensuring successful implementation of federally-funded projects. Second, subpart C discusses the project management plan (PMP) required of all major capital projects. The PMP is designed to enhance the recipient's planning and implementation efforts and to assist FTA's grant application analysis efforts.
            
            
              § 633.3
              Scope.
              This rule applies to a recipient of Federal financial assistance undertaking a major capital project using funds made available under:
              (a) Sections 3, 9, or 18 of the Federal Mass Transit Act of 1964, as amended;
              (b) 23 U.S.C. 103(e)(4); or
              (c) Section 14(b) of the National Capital Transportation Amendments of 1979 (93 Stat. 1320, Pub. L. 96-184).
            
            
              § 633.5
              Definitions.
              As used in this part:
              
                Administrator means the Administrator of the Federal Transit Administration or the Administrator's designee.
              
                Days means calendar days.
              
                Fixed guideway means any public transportation facility which utilizes and occupies a separate right-of-way or rails. This includes, but is not limited to, rapid rail, light rail, commuter rail, automated guideway transit, people movers, and exclusive facilities for buses and other high occupancy vehicles.
              
                Full funding agreement means a written agreement between FTA and a recipient that establishes a financial ceiling with respect to the Government's participation in a project; sets forth the scope of a project; and sets forth the mutual understanding, terms, and conditions relating to the construction and management of a project.
              
                Major capital project means a project that:
              (1) Involves the construction of a new fixed guideway or extension of an existing fixed guideway;
              (2) Involves the rehabilitation or modernization of an existing fixed guideway with a total project cost in excess of $100 million; or
              (3) The Administrator determines is a major capital project because the project management oversight program will benefit specifically the agency or the recipient. Typically, this means a project that:
              (i) Generally is expected to have a total project cost in excess of $100 million or more to construct;
              (ii) Is not exclusively for the routine acquisition, maintenance, or rehabilitation of vehicles or other rolling stock;
              (iii) Involves new technology;
              (iv) Is of a unique nature for the recipient; or
              (v) Involves a recipient whose past experience indicates to the agency the appropriateness of the extension of this program.
              
                Project management oversight means the monitoring of a major capital project's progress to determine whether a project is on time, within budget, in conformance with design criteria, constructed to approved plans and specifications and is efficiently and effectively implemented.
              
                Project management plan means a written document prepared by a recipient that explicitly defines all tasks necessary to implement a major capital project.
              
                Recipient means a direct recipient of Federal financial assistance from FTA.
              
                FT Act means the Federal Mass Transit Act of 1964, as amended.
              
                FTA means the Federal Transit Administration.
            
          
          
            
            Subpart B—Project Management Oversight Services
            
              § 633.11
              Covered projects.
              The Administrator may contract for project management oversight services when the following two conditions apply:
              (a) The recipient is using funds made available under section 3, 9, or 18 of the Federal Mass Transit Act of 1964, as amended; 23 U.S.C. 103(e)(4); or section 14(b) of the National Capital Transportation Amendments of 1979; and
              (b) The project is a “major capital project”.
            
            
              § 633.13
              Initiation of PMO services.
              PMO services will be initiated as soon as it is practicable, once the agency determines this part applies. In most cases, this means that PMO will begin during the preliminary engineering phase of the project. However, consistent with other provisions in this part, the Administrator may determine that a project is a “major capital project” at any point during its implementation. Should this occur, PMO will begin as soon as practicable after this agency determination.
            
            
              § 633.15
              Access to information.
              A recipient of FTA funds for a major capital project shall provide the Administrator and the PMO contractor chosen under this part access to its records and construction sites, as reasonably may be required.
            
            
              § 633.17
              PMO contractor eligibility.
              (a) Any person or entity may provide project management oversight services in connection with a major capital project, with the following exceptions:
              (1) An entity may not provide PMO services for its own project; and
              (2) An entity may not provide PMO services for a project if there exists a conflict of interest.
              (b) In choosing private sector persons or entities to provide project management oversight services, FTA uses the procurement requirements in the government-wide procurement regulations, found at 48 CFR CH I.
            
            
              § 633.19
              Financing the PMO program.
              (a) FTA is authorized to expend up to 1/2 of 1 percent of the funds made available each fiscal year under sections 3, 9, or 18 of the FT Act, 23 U.S.C. 103(e)(4), or section 14(b) of the National Capital Transportation Amendments of 1979 (93 Stat. 1320) to contract with any person or entity to provide a project management oversight service in connection with a major capital project as defined in this part.
              (b) A contract entered into between FTA and a person or entity for project management oversight services under this part will provide for the payment by FTA of 100 percent of the cost of carrying out the contract.
            
          
          
            Subpart C—Project Management Plans
            
              § 633.21
              Basic requirement.
              (a) If a project meets the definition of major capital project, the recipient shall submit a project management plan prepared in accordance with § 633.25 of this part, as a condition of Federal financial assistance. As a general rule, the PMP must be submitted during the grant review process and is part of FTA's grant application review. This section applies if:
              (1) The project fails under one of the automatic major capital investment project categories (§ 633.5(1) or (2) of this part); or
              (2) FTA makes a determination that a project is a major capital project, consistent with the definition of major capital project in § 633.5. This determination normally will be made during the grant review process. However, FTA may make such determination after grant approval.

              (b)(1) FTA will notify the recipient when it must submit the PMP. Normally, FTA will notify the recipient sometime during the grant review process. If FTA determines the project is major under its discretionary authority after the grant has been approved, FTA will inform the recipient of its determination as soon as possible.
              
              (2) Once FTA has notified the recipient that it must submit a plan, the recipient will have a minimum of 90 days to submit the plan.
            
            
              § 633.23
              FTA review of PMP.
              Within 60 days of receipt of a project management plan, the Administrator will notify the recipient that:
              (a) The plan is approved;
              (b) The plan is disapproved, including the reasons for the disapproval;
              (c) The plan will require modification, as specified, before approval; or
              (d) The Administrator has not yet completed review of the plan, and state when it will be reviewed.
            
            
              § 633.25
              Contents of a project management plan.
              At a minimum, a recipient's project management plan shall include—
              (a) A description of adequate recipient staff organization, complete with well-defined reporting relationships, statements of functional responsibilities, job descriptions, and job qualifications;
              (b) A budget covering the project management organization, appropriate consultants, property acquisition, utility relocation, systems demonstration staff, audits, and such miscellaneous costs as the recipient may be prepared to justify;
              (c) A construction schedule;
              (d) A document control procedure and recordkeeping system;
              (e) A change order procedure which includes a documented, systematic approach to the handling of construction change orders;
              (f) A description of organizational structures, management skills, and staffing levels required throughout the construction phase;
              (g) Quality control and quality assurance programs which define functions, procedures, and responsibilities for construction and for system installation and integration of system components;
              (h) Material testing policies and procedures;
              (i) Plan for internal reporting requirements including cost and schedule control procedures; and
              (j) Criteria and procedures to be used for testing the operational system or its major components;
            
            
              § 633.27
              Implementation of a project management plan.
              (a) Upon approval of a project management plan by the Administrator the recipient shall begin implementing the plan.
              (b) If a recipient must modify an approved project management plan, the recipient shall submit the proposed changes to the Administrator along with an explanation of the need for the changes.
              (c) A recipient shall submit periodic updates of the project management plan to the Administrator. Such updates shall include, but not be limited to:
              (1) Project budget;
              (2) Project schedule;
              (3) Financing, both capital and operating;
              (4) Ridership estimates, including operating plan; and
              (5) Where applicable, the status of local efforts to enhance ridership when estimates are contingent, in part, upon the success of such efforts.
              (d) A recipient shall submit current data on a major capital project's budget and schedule to the Administrator on a monthly basis.
            
            
              § 633.29
              PMP waivers.
              A waiver will be considered upon initiation by the grantee or by the agency itself. The Administrator may, on a case-by-case basis, waive:
              (a) Any of the PMP elements in § 633.25 of this part if the Administrator determines the element is not necessary for a particular plan; or
              (b) The requirement of having a new project management plan submitted for a major capital project if a recipient seeks to manage the major capital project under a previously-approved project management plan.

              § 650.11
              Private investment project procedures.
              (a) A recipient may, subject to the requirements of this part, submit applications to modify or waive existing FTA requirements for an eligible project. For projects with multiple recipients, recipients may, but are not required to, submit an application for a project jointly; however, only one application per phase of a project may be submitted. Applications may contain requests for modification or waiver of more than one FTA requirement. All applications shall comply with the requirements of § 650.31.
              (b) Subject to § 650.13, the Administrator may modify or waive FTA requirements if the Administrator determines the recipient has demonstrated that—
              (1) The FTA requirement proposed for modification discourages the use of a public-private partnership, a joint development, or other private sector investment in a federally assisted public transportation capital project,
              (2) The proposed modification or waiver of the FTA requirements is likely to have the effect of encouraging a public-private partnership, a joint development, or other private sector investment in a Federally-assisted public transportation capital project,
              (3) The amount of private sector participation or risk transfer proposed is sufficient to warrant modification or waiver of FTA requirements, and
              (4) Modification or waiver of the FTA requirements can be accomplished while protecting the public interest and any public investment in the proposed federally assisted public transportation capital project.
            
            
              § 650.13
              Limitation.
              (a) Nothing in this part may be construed to allow the Administrator to modify or waive any requirement under—
              (1) 49 U.S.C. 5333;

              (2) The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321, et seq.); or
              (3) Any other provision of Federal statute.
              (b) The Administrator's approval of an application under this part does not commit Federal-aid funding for the project.
            
          
          
            Subpart C—Reporting
            
              § 650.21
              Lessons learned report.

              For a project for which the Administrator has modified or waived any FTA requirement pursuant to this part, not later than one year after completion of construction, and not later than two years after a project that includes private entity involvement in operations or maintenance activities has entered revenue operations, the recipient shall submit to FTA a report that evaluates the effects of the modification or waiver of Federal requirements on the delivery of the project. The report shall describe the modification or waiver applied to the project; evaluate the success or failure of the modification or waiver; evaluate the extent to which the modification or waiver addressed impediments to greater use of public-private partnerships and private investment in public transportation capital projects; and may include any recommended statutory, regulatory or other changes with an explanation of how the changes would encourage greater use of public-private partnerships and private investment in public transportation capital projects.
            
          
          
            Subpart D—Applications
            
              § 650.31
              Application process.

              (a) Applications must be submitted to the FTA Private Sector Liaison at FTA Headquarters and provide a copy to the FTA Regional Administrator for the region in which the project is located. Addresses for FTA Headquarters and Regions are available at www.transit.dot.gov.
              
              (b) To be considered, an application submitted under this part must—
              (1) Describe the proposed project with respect to anticipated scope, cost, schedule, and anticipated source and amount of Federal financial assistance,
              (2) Identify whether the project is to be delivered as a public-private partnership, as a joint development or with other private sector investment,
              (3) Describe in detail the role of the private sector investor, if any, in delivering the project,
              (4) Identify the specific FTA requirement(s) that the recipient requests to have modified or waived and a proposal as to how the requirement(s) should be modified,
              (5) Provide a justification for the modification(s) or waiver(s), including an explanation of how the FTA requirement(s) presents an impediment to a public-private partnership, joint development, or other private sector investment,
              (6) Explain how the public interest and public investment in the project will be protected and how FTA can ensure the appropriate level of public oversight and control, as determined by the Administrator, is undertaken if the modification(s) or waiver(s) is allowed,
              (7) Provide other recipients' concurrence with submission of the application and waiver of the right to submit a separate application for the same project, where a project has more than one recipient at the time of application,
              (8) Provide a financial plan identifying sources and uses of funds proposed or committed to the project, and
              (9) Explain the expected benefits that the modification or waiver of FTA requirements would provide to address impediments to the greater use of public-private partnerships and private investment in the project.
              (c) The Administrator shall notify the recipient in writing if the application fails to meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. If the recipient does not supplement an incomplete application within thirty days of the date of the Administrator's notification, the application will be considered withdrawn without prejudice. The Administrator will not consider an application until the application is complete. The Administrator reserves the right to request additional information beyond the requirements in paragraph (b) upon determining that more information is needed to evaluate an application.
              (d) For applications that have been deemed complete, the Administrator will notify the recipient in writing as to whether the request for modification or waiver is approved or denied. Any approval may be given in whole or in part and may be conditioned or contingent upon the recipient satisfying the conditions identified in the approval.
              (e) FTA will publish on its public website information related to waivers the FTA Administrator has granted. This may include a copy of the waiver application and any supporting documents, with proprietary information redacted.
              Under authority delegated in 49 CFR 1.91.

              Pre-employment drug testing.
              (a)(1) Before allowing a covered employee or applicant to perform a safety-sensitive function for the first time, the employer must ensure that the employee takes a pre-employment drug test administered under this part with a verified negative result. An employer may not allow a covered employee, including an applicant, to perform a safety-sensitive function unless the employee takes a drug test administered under this part with a verified negative result.

              (2) When a covered employee or applicant has previously failed or refused a pre-employment drug test administered under this part, the employee must provide the employer proof of having successfully completed a referral, evaluation and treatment plan as described in § 655.62.

              Pre-employment alcohol testing.
              An employer may, but is not required to, conduct pre-employment alcohol testing under this part. If an employer chooses to conduct pre-employment alcohol testing, the employer must comply with the following requirements:
              (a) The employer must conduct a pre-employment alcohol test before the first performance of safety-sensitive functions by every covered employee (whether a new employee or someone who has transferred to a position involving the performance of safety-sensitive functions).

              (b) The employer must treat all covered employees performing safety-sensitive functions the same for the purpose of pre-employment alcohol testing (i.e., you must not test some covered employees and not others).
              (c) The employer must conduct the pre-employment tests after making a contingent offer of employment or transfer, subject to the employee passing the pre-employment alcohol test.
              (d) The employer must conduct all pre-employment alcohol tests using the alcohol testing procedures set forth in 49 CFR Part 40.
              (e) The employer must not allow a covered employee to begin performing safety-sensitive functions unless the result of the employee's test indicates an alcohol concentration of less than 0.02.
            
            
              § 655.43
              Reasonable suspicion testing.
              (a) An employer shall conduct a drug and/or alcohol test when the employer has reasonable suspicion to believe that the covered employee has used a prohibited drug and/or engaged in alcohol misuse.
              (b) An employer's determination that reasonable suspicion exists shall be based on specific, contemporaneous, articulable observations concerning the appearance, behavior, speech, or body odors of the covered employee. A supervisor(s), or other company official(s) who is trained in detecting the signs and symptoms of drug use and alcohol misuse must make the required observations.
              (c) Alcohol testing is authorized under this section only if the observations required by paragraph (b) of this section are made during, just preceding, or just after the period of the workday that the covered employee is required to be in compliance with this part. An employer may direct a covered employee to undergo reasonable suspicion testing for alcohol only while the employee is performing safety-sensitive functions; just before the employee is to perform safety-sensitive functions; or just after the employee has ceased performing such functions.
              (d) If an alcohol test required by this section is not administered within two hours following the determination under paragraph (b) of this section, the employer shall prepare and maintain on file a record stating the reasons the alcohol test was not promptly administered. If an alcohol test required by this section is not administered within eight hours following the determination under paragraph (b) of this section, the employer shall cease attempts to administer an alcohol test and shall state in the record the reasons for not administering the test.

              Post-accident testing.
              (a) Accidents. (1) Fatal accidents. (i) As soon as practicable following an accident involving the loss of human life, an employer shall conduct drug and alcohol tests on each surviving covered employee operating the public transportation vehicle at the time of the accident. Post-accident drug and alcohol testing of the operator is not required under this section if the covered employee is tested under the fatal accident testing requirements of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration rule 49 CFR 389.303(a)(1) or (b)(1).
              (ii) The employer shall also drug and alcohol test any other covered employee whose performance could have contributed to the accident, as determined by the employer using the best information available at the time of the decision.
              (2) Nonfatal accidents. (i) As soon as practicable following an accident not involving the loss of human life in which a public transportation vehicle is involved, the employer shall drug and alcohol test each covered employee operating the public transportation vehicle at the time of the accident unless the employer determines, using the best information available at the time of the decision, that the covered employee's performance can be completely discounted as a contributing factor to the accident. The employer shall also drug and alcohol test any other covered employee whose performance could have contributed to the accident, as determined by the employer using the best information available at the time of the decision.
              (ii) If an alcohol test required by this section is not administered within two hours following the accident, the employer shall prepare and maintain on file a record stating the reasons the alcohol test was not promptly administered. If an alcohol test required by this section is not administered within eight hours following the accident, the employer shall cease attempts to administer an alcohol test and maintain the record. Records shall be submitted to FTA upon request of the Administrator.
              (b) An employer shall ensure that a covered employee required to be drug tested under this section is tested as soon as practicable but within 32 hours of the accident.
              (c) A covered employee who is subject to post-accident testing who fails to remain readily available for such testing, including notifying the employer or the employer representative of his or her location if he or she leaves the scene of the accident prior to submission to such test, may be deemed by the employer to have refused to submit to testing.
              (d) The decision not to administer a drug and/or alcohol test under this section shall be based on the employer's determination, using the best available information at the time of the determination that the employee's performance could not have contributed to the accident. Such a decision must be documented in detail, including the decision-making process used to reach the decision not to test.
              (e) Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the delay of necessary medical attention for the injured following an accident or to prohibit a covered employee from leaving the scene of an accident for the period necessary to obtain assistance in responding to the accident or to obtain necessary emergency medical care.
              (f) The results of a blood, urine, or breath test for the use of prohibited drugs or alcohol misuse, conducted by Federal, State, or local officials having independent authority for the test, shall be considered to meet the requirements of this section provided such test conforms to the applicable Federal, State, or local testing requirements, and that the test results are obtained by the employer. Such test results may be used only when the employer is unable to perform a post-accident test within the required period noted in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

              Random testing.

              (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing shall be 50 percent of covered employees; the random alcohol testing rate shall be 10 percent. As provided in paragraph (b) of this section, this rate is subject to annual review by the Administrator.

              (b) The Administrator's decision to increase or decrease the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug and alcohol testing is based, respectively, on the reported positive drug and alcohol violation rates for the entire industry. All information used for this determination is drawn from the drug and alcohol Management Information System (MIS) reports required by this part. In order to ensure reliability of the data, the Administrator shall consider the quality and completeness of the reported data, may obtain additional information or reports from employers, and may make appropriate modifications in calculating the industry's verified positive results and violation rates. Each year, the Administrator will publish in the Federal Register the minimum annual percentage rates for random drug and alcohol testing of covered employees. The new minimum annual percentage rate for random drug and alcohol testing will be applicable starting January 1 of the calendar year following publication.
              (c) Rates for drug testing. (1) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing is 50 percent, the Administrator may lower this rate to 25 percent of all covered employees if the Administrator determines that the data received under the reporting requirements of § 655.72 for the two preceding consecutive calendar years indicate that the reported positive rate is less than 1.0 percent.
              (2) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing is 25 percent, and the data received under the reporting requirements of § 655.72 for the calendar year indicate that the reported positive rate is equal to or greater than 1.0 percent, the Administrator will increase the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug or random alcohol testing to 50 percent of all covered employees.
              (d) Rates for alcohol testing. (1)(i) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing is 25 percent or more, the Administrator may lower this rate to 10 percent of all covered employees if the Administrator determines that the data received under the reporting requirements of § 655.72 for two consecutive calendar years indicate that the violation rate is less than 0.5 percent.
              (ii) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing is 50 percent, the Administrator may lower this rate to 25 percent of all covered employees if the Administrator determines that the data received under the reporting requirements of § 655.72 for two consecutive calendar years indicate that the violation rate is less than 1.0 percent but equal to or greater than 0.5 percent.
              (2)(i) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing is 10 percent, and the data received under the reporting requirements of § 655.72 for that calendar year indicate that the violation rate is equal to or greater than 0.5 percent, but less than 1.0 percent, the Administrator will increase the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing to 25 percent of all covered employees.
              (ii) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing is 25 percent or less, and the data received under the reporting requirements of § 655.72 for that calendar year indicate that the violation rate is equal to or greater than 1.0 percent, the Administrator will increase the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing to 50 percent of all covered employees.
              (e) The selection of employees for random drug and alcohol testing shall be made by a scientifically valid method, such as a random number table or a computer-based random number generator that is matched with employees' Social Security numbers, payroll identification numbers, or other comparable identifying numbers. Under the selection process used, each covered employee shall have an equal chance of being tested each time selections are made.

              (f) The employer shall randomly select a sufficient number of covered employees for testing during each calendar year to equal an annual rate not less than the minimum annual percentage rates for random drug and alcohol testing determined by the Administrator. If the employer conducts random drug and alcohol testing through a consortium, the number of employees to be tested may be calculated for each individual employer or may be based on the total number of covered employees covered by the consortium who are subject to random drug and alcohol testing at the same minimum annual percentage rate under this part.
              (g) Each employer shall ensure that random drug and alcohol tests conducted under this part are unannounced and unpredictable, and that the dates for administering random tests are spread reasonably throughout the calendar year. Random testing must be conducted at all times of day when safety-sensitive functions are performed.
              (h) Each employer shall require that each covered employee who is notified of selection for random drug or random alcohol testing proceed to the test site immediately. If the employee is performing a safety-sensitive function at the time of the notification, the employer shall instead ensure that the employee ceases to perform the safety-sensitive function and proceeds to the testing site immediately.
              (i) A covered employee shall only be randomly tested for alcohol misuse while the employee is performing safety-sensitive functions; just before the employee is to perform safety-sensitive functions; or just after the employee has ceased performing such functions. A covered employee may be randomly tested for prohibited drug use anytime while on duty.
              (j) If a given covered employee is subject to random drug and alcohol testing under the testing rules of more than one DOT agency for the same employer, the employee shall be subject to random drug and alcohol testing at the percentage rate established for the calendar year by the DOT agency regulating more than 50 percent of the employee's function.
              (k) If an employer is required to conduct random drug and alcohol testing under the drug and alcohol testing rules of more than one DOT agency, the employer may—
              (1) Establish separate pools for random selection, with each pool containing the covered employees who are subject to testing at the same required rate; or
              (2) Randomly select such employees for testing at the highest percentage rate established for the calendar year by any DOT agency to which the employer is subject.
            
            
              § 655.46
              Return to duty following refusal to submit to a test, verified positive drug test result and/or breath alcohol test result of 0.04 or greater.
              Where a covered employee refuses to submit to a test, has a verified positive drug test result, and/or has a confirmed alcohol test result of 0.04 or greater, the employer, before returning the employee to duty to perform a safety-sensitive function, shall follow the procedures outlined in 49 CFR Part 40.

              If an employer chooses to permit a covered employee to perform a safety-sensitive function within 8 hours of an alcohol test indicating an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04, the employer shall retest the covered employee to ensure compliance with the provisions of § 655.35. The covered employee may not perform safety-sensitive functions unless the confirmation alcohol test result is less than 0.02.
            
            
              § 655.49
              Refusal to submit to a drug or alcohol test.

              (a) Each employer shall require a covered employee to submit to a post-accident drug and alcohol test required under § 655.44, a random drug and alcohol test required under § 655.45, a reasonable suspicion drug and alcohol test required under § 655.43, or a follow-up drug and alcohol test required under § 655.47. No employer shall permit an employee who refuses to submit to such a test to perform or continue to perform safety-sensitive functions.
              
              (b) When an employee refuses to submit to a drug or alcohol test, the employer shall follow the procedures outlined in 49 CFR Part 40.

              Retention of records.
              (a) General requirement. An employer shall maintain records of its anti-drug and alcohol misuse program as provided in this section. The records shall be maintained in a secure location with controlled access.
              (b) Period of retention. In determining compliance with the retention period requirement, each record shall be maintained for the specified minimum period of time as measured from the date of the creation of the record. Each employer shall maintain the records in accordance with the following schedule:
              (1) Five years. Records of covered employee verified positive drug or alcohol test results, documentation of refusals to take required drug or alcohol tests, and covered employee referrals to the substance abuse professional, and copies of annual MIS reports submitted to FTA.
              
              (2) Two years. Records related to the collection process and employee training.
              (3) One year. Records of negative drug or alcohol test results.
              (c) Types of records. The following specific records must be maintained:
              (1) Records related to the collection process:
              (i) Collection logbooks, if used.
              (ii) Documents relating to the random selection process.
              (iii) Documents generated in connection with decisions to administer reasonable suspicion drug or alcohol tests.
              (iv) Documents generated in connection with decisions on post-accident drug and alcohol testing.
              (v) MRO documents verifying existence of a medical explanation of the inability of a covered employee to provide an adequate urine or breathe sample.
              (2) Records related to test results:
              (i) The employer's copy of the custody and control form.
              (ii) Documents related to the refusal of any covered employee to submit to a test required by this part.
              (iii) Documents presented by a covered employee to dispute the result of a test administered under this part.
              (3) Records related to referral and return to duty and follow-up testing: Records concerning a covered employee's entry into and completion of the treatment program recommended by the substance abuse professional.
              (4) Records related to employee training:
              (i) Training materials on drug use awareness and alcohol misuse, including a copy of the employer's policy on prohibited drug use and alcohol misuse.
              (ii) Names of covered employees attending training on prohibited drug use and alcohol misuse and the dates and times of such training.
              (iii) Documentation of training provided to supervisors for the purpose of qualifying the supervisors to make a determination concerning the need for drug and alcohol testing based on reasonable suspicion.
              (iv) Certification that any training conducted under this part complies with the requirements for such training.
              (5) Copies of annual MIS reports submitted to FTA.
            
            
              § 655.72
              Reporting of results in a management information system.
              (a) Each recipient shall annually prepare and maintain a summary of the results of its anti-drug and alcohol misuse testing programs performed under this part during the previous calendar year.
              (b) When requested by FTA, each recipient shall submit to FTA's Office of Safety and Security, or its designated agent, by March 15, a report covering the previous calendar year (January 1 through December 31) summarizing the results of its anti-drug and alcohol misuse programs.
              (c) Each recipient shall be responsible for ensuring the accuracy and timeliness of each report submitted by an employer, contractor, consortium or joint enterprise or by a third party service provider acting on the recipient's or employer's behalf.

              (d) As an employer, you must use the Management Information System (MIS) form and instructions as required by 49 CFR part 40, § 40.25 and appendix H. You may also use the electronic version of the MIS form provided by the DOT. The Administrator may designate means (e.g., electronic program transmitted via the Internet), other than hard-copy, for MIS form submission. For information on where to submit MIS forms and for the electronic version of the form, see: http://transit-safety.volpe.dot.gov/DAMIS.
              

              (e) To calculate the total number of covered employees eligible for random testing throughout the year, as an employer, you must add the total number of covered employees eligible for testing during each random testing period for the year and divide that total by the number of random testing periods. Covered employees, and only covered employees, are to be in an employer's random testing pool, and all covered employees must be in the random pool. If you are an employer conducting random testing more often than once per month (e.g., you select daily, weekly, bi-weekly), you do not need to compute this total number of covered employees rate more than on a once per month basis. As an employer, you may use a service agent (e.g., C/TPA) to perform random selections for you; and your covered employees may be part of a larger random testing pool of covered employees. However, you must ensure that the service agent you use is testing at the appropriate percentage established for your industry and that only covered employees are in the random testing pool.
              (f) If you have a covered employee who performs multi-DOT agency functions (e.g., an employee drives a paratransit vehicle and performs pipeline maintenance duties for you), count the employee only on the MIS report for the DOT agency under which he or she is random tested. Normally, this will be the DOT agency under which the employee performs more than 50% of his or her duties. Employers may have to explain the testing data for these employees in the event of a DOT agency inspection or audit.
              (g) A service agent (e.g., Consortia/Third Party Administrator as defined in 49 CFR part 40) may prepare the MIS report on behalf of an employer. However, a company official (e.g., Designated Employer Representative as defined in 49 CFR part 40) must certify the accuracy and completeness of the MIS report, no matter who prepares it.

              (b) A covered employee is entitled, upon written request, to obtain copies of any records pertaining to the covered employee's use of prohibited drugs or misuse of alcohol, including any records pertaining to his or her drug or alcohol tests. The employer shall provide promptly the records requested by the employee. Access to a covered employee's records shall not be contingent upon the employer's receipt of payment for the production of those records.
              (c) An employer shall permit access to all facilities utilized and records compiled in complying with the requirements of this part to the Secretary of Transportation or any DOT agency with regulatory authority over the employer or any of its employees or to a State oversight agency authorized to oversee rail fixed guideway systems.
              (d) An employer shall disclose data for its drug and alcohol testing programs, and any other information pertaining to the employer's anti-drug and alcohol misuse programs required to be maintained by this part, to the Secretary of Transportation or any DOT agency with regulatory authority over the employer or covered employee or to a State oversight agency authorized to oversee rail fixed guideway systems, upon the Secretary's request or the respective agency's request.
              (e) When requested by the National Transportation Safety Board as part of an accident investigation, employers shall disclose information related to the employer's drug or alcohol testing related to the accident under investigation.
              (f) Records shall be made available to a subsequent employer upon receipt of a written request from the covered employee. Subsequent disclosure by the employer is permitted only as expressly authorized by the terms of the covered employee's request.
              (g) An employer may disclose information required to be maintained under this part pertaining to a covered employee to the employee or the decisionmaker in a lawsuit, grievance, or other proceeding initiated by or on behalf of the individual, and arising from the results of a drug or alcohol test under this part (including, but not limited to, a worker's compensation, unemployment compensation, or other proceeding relating to a benefit sought by the covered employee.)
              (h) An employer shall release information regarding a covered employee's record as directed by the specific, written consent of the employee authorizing release of the information to an identified person.

              (i) An employer may disclose drug and alcohol testing information required to be maintained under this part, pertaining to a covered employee, to the State oversight agency or grantee required to certify to FTA compliance with the drug and alcohol testing procedures of 49 CFR parts 40 and 655.

            § 661.7
            Waivers.
            (a) Section 5323(j)(2) of Title 49 United States Code provides that the general requirements of 49 U.S.C. 5323(j)(1) shall not apply in four specific instances. This section sets out the conditions for the three statutory waivers based on public interest, non-availability, and price-differential. Section 661.11 of this part sets out the conditions for the fourth statutory waiver governing the procurement of rolling stock and associated equipment.

            (b) Under the provision of 49 U.S.C. 5323(j)(2)(A), the Administrator may waive the general requirements of 49 U.S.C. 5323(j)(1) if the Administrator finds that their application would be inconsistent with the public interest. In determining whether the conditions exist to grant this public interest waiver, the Administrator will consider all appropriate factors on a case-by-case basis, unless a general exception is specifically set out in this part. When granting a public interest waiver, the Administrator shall issue a detailed written statement justifying why the waiver is in the public interest. The Administrator shall publish this justification in the Federal Register, providing the public with a reasonable time for notice and comment of not more than seven calendar days.
            (c) Under the provision of 49 U.S.C. 5323(j)(2), the Administrator may waive the general requirements of 49 U.S.C. 5323(j) if the Administrator finds that the materials for which a waiver is requested are not produced in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available quantities and of a satisfactory quality.
            (1) It will be presumed that the conditions exist to grant this non-availability waiver if no responsive and responsible bid is received offering an item produced in the United States.

            (2) In the case of a sole source procurement, the Administrator will grant this non-availability waiver only if the grantee provides sufficient information which indicates that the item to be procured is only available from a single source or that the item to be procured is not produced in sufficient and reasonably available quantities of a satisfactory quality in the United States.
            
            (3) After contract award, the Administrator may grant a non-availability waiver under this paragraph, in any case in which a bidder or offeror originally certified compliance with the Buy America requirements in good faith, but can no longer comply with its certification. The Administrator will grant a non-availability waiver only if the grantee provides sufficient evidence that the original certification was made in good faith and that the item to be procured cannot now be obtained domestically due to commercial impossibility or impracticability. In determining whether the conditions exist to grant a post-award non-availability waiver, the Administrator will consider all appropriate factors on a case-by-case basis.
            (d) Under the provision of section 165(b)(4) of the Act, the Administrator may waive the general requirements of section 165(a) if the Administrator finds that the inclusion of a domestic item or domestic material will increase the cost of the contract between the grantee and its supplier of that item or material by more than 25 percent. The Administrator will grant this price-differential waiver if the amount of the lowest responsive and responsible bid offering the item or material that is not produced in the United States multiplied by 1.25 is less than the amount of the lowest responsive and responsible bid offering the item or material produced in the United States.
            (e) The four statutory waivers of 49 U.S.C. 5323(j)(2) as set out in this part shall be treated as being separate and distinct from each other.
            (f) The waivers described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section may be granted for a component or subcomponent in the case of the procurement of the items governed by 49 U.S.C. 5323(j)(2)(C) (requirements for rolling stock). If a waiver is granted for a component or a subcomponent, that component or subcomponent will be considered to be of domestic origin for the purposes of § 661.11 of this part.
            (g) The waivers described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section may be granted for a specific item or material that is used in the production of a manufactured product that is governed by the requirements of § 661.5(d) of this part. If such a waiver is granted to such a specific item or material, that item or material will be treated as being of domestic origin.
            (h) The provisions of this section shall not apply to products produced in a foreign country if the Secretary, in consultation with the United States Trade Representative, determines that:
            (1) That foreign country is party to an agreement with the United States pursuant to which the head of an agency of the United States has waived the requirements of this section; and
            (2) That foreign country has violated the terms of the agreement by discriminating against products covered by this section that are produced in the United States and are covered by the agreement.
            
              Appendix A to § 661.7—General Waivers
              (a) All waivers published in 48 CFR 25.104 which establish excepted articles, materials, and supplies for the Buy American Act of 1933 (41 U.S.C. 10a-d), as the waivers may be amended from time to time, apply to this part under the provisions of § 661.7 (b) and (c).
              (b) Under the provisions of § 661.7 (b) and (c) of this part, a general public interest waiver from the Buy America requirements applies to microprocessors, computers, microcomputers, or software, or other such devices, which are used solely for the purpose of processing or storing data. This general waiver does not extend to a product or device which merely contains a microprocessor or microcomputer and is not used solely for the purpose of processing or storing data.
              (c) Under the provisions of § 661.7(b) of this part, a general public interest waiver from the Buy America requirements for “small purchases” (as defined in the “common grant rule,” at 49 CFR 18.36(d)) made by FTA grantees with capital, planning, or operating assistance.

            § 661.9
            Application for waivers.

            (a) This section sets out the application procedures for obtaining all waivers, except those general exceptions set forth in this part for which individual applications are unnecessary and those covered by 49 U.S.C. 5323(j)(2)(C). The procedures for obtaining an exception covered by 49 U.S.C. 5323(j)(2)(C) are set forth in § 661.11 of this part.
            
            (b) A bidder or offeror who seeks to establish grounds for an exception must seek the exception, in a timely manner, through the grantee.
            (c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, only a grantee may request a waiver. The request must be in writing, include facts and justification to support the waiver, and be submitted to the Administrator through the appropriate Regional Office.
            (d) FTA will consider a request for a waiver from a potential bidder, offeror, or supplier only if the waiver is being sought under § 661.7 (f) or (g) of this part.
            (e) The Administrator will issue a written determination setting forth the reasons for granting or denying the exception request. Each request for an exception, and FTA's action on the request, are available for public inspection under the provisions of 49 CFR part 601, subpart C.
            [56 FR 932, Jan. 9, 1991, as amended at 71 FR 14117, Mar. 21, 2006; 72 FR 53697, Sept. 20, 2007]
          
          
            § 661.11
            Rolling stock procurements.
            (a) The provisions of § 661.5 do not apply to the procurement of buses and other rolling stock (including train control, communication, and traction power equipment), if the cost of components produced in the United States is more than 60 percent of the cost of all components and final assembly takes place in the United States.
            (b) The domestic content requirements in paragraph (a) of this section also apply to the domestic content requirements for components set forth in paragraphs (i), (j), and (l) of this section.
            (c) A component is any article, material, or supply, whether manufactured or unmanufactured, that is directly incorporated into an end product at the final assembly location.
            (d) A component may be manufactured at the final assembly location if the manufacturing process to produce the component is an activity separate and distinct from the final assembly of the end product.
            (e) A component is considered to be manufactured if there are sufficient activities taking place to advance the value or improve the condition of the subcomponents of that component; that is, if the subcomponents have been substantially transformed or merged into a new and functionally different article.
            (f) Except as provided in paragraph (k) of this section, a subcomponent is any article, material, or supply, whether manufactured or unmanufactured, that is one step removed from a component (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section) in the manufacturing process and that is incorporated directly into a component.
            (g) For a component to be of domestic origin, more that 60 percent of the subcomponents of that component, by cost, must be of domestic origin, and the manufacture of the component must take place in the United States. If, under the terms of this part, a component is determined to be of domestic origin, its entire cost may be used in calculating the cost of domestic content of an end product.
            (h) A subcomponent is of domestic origin if it is manufactured in the United States.
            (i) If a subcomponent manufactured in the United States is exported for inclusion in a component that is manufactured outside the United States and it receives tariff exemptions under the procedures set forth in 19 CFR 10.11 through 10.24, the subcomponent retains its domestic identity and can be included in the calculation of the domestic content of an end product even if such a subcomponent represents less than 60 percent of the cost of a particular component.
            (j) If a subcomponent manufactured in the United States is exported for inclusion in a component manufactured outside the United States and it does not receive tariff exemption under the procedures set forth in 19 CFR 10.11 through 10.24, the subcomponent loses its domestic identity and cannot be included in the calculation of the domestic content of an end product.

            (k) Raw materials produced in the United States and then exported for incorporation into a component are not considered to be a subcomponent for the purpose of calculating domestic content. The value of such raw materials is to be included in the cost of the foreign component.
            
            (l) If a component is manufactured in the United States, but contains less than 60 percent domestic subcomponents, by cost, the cost of the domestic subcomponents and the cost of manufacturing the component may be included in the calculation of the domestic content of the end product.
            (m) For purposes of this section, except as provided in paragraph (o) of this section:
            (1) The cost of a component or a subcomponent is the price that a bidder or offeror must pay to a subcontractor or supplier for that component or subcomponent. Transportation costs to the final assembly location must be included in calculating the cost of foreign components and subcomponents.
            (2) If a component or subcomponent is manufactured by the bidder or offeror, the cost of the component is the cost of labor and materials incorporated into the component or subcomponent, an allowance for profit, and the administrative and overhead costs attributable to that component or subcomponent under normal accounting principles.
            (n) The cost of a component of foreign origin is set using the foreign exchange rate at the time the bidder or offeror executes the appropriate Buy America certificate.
            (o) The cost of a subcomponent that retains its domestic identity consistent with paragraph (j) of this section shall be the cost of the subcomponent when last purchased, f.o.b. United States port of exportation or point of border crossing as set out in the invoice and entry papers or, if no purchase was made, the value of the subcomponent at the time of its shipment for exportation, f.o.b. United States port of exportation or point of border crossing as set out in the invoice and entry papers.
            (p) In accordance with 49 U.S.C. 5323(j), labor costs involved in final assembly shall not be included in calculating component costs.
            (q) The actual cost, not the bid price, of a component is to be considered in calculating domestic content.
            (r) Final assembly is the creation of the end product from individual elements brought together for that purpose through application of manufacturing processes. If a system is being procured as the end product by the grantee, the installation of the system qualifies as final assembly.

            § 661.13
            Grantee responsibility.
            (a) The grantee shall adhere to the Buy America clause set forth in its grant contract with FTA.
            (b) The grantee shall include in its bid or request for proposal (RFP) specification for procurement within the scope of this part an appropriate notice of the Buy America provision. Such specifications shall require, as a condition of responsiveness, that the bidder or offeror submit with the bid or offer a completed Buy America certificate in accordance with §§ 661.6 or 661.12 of this part, as appropriate.

            (1) A bidder or offeror who has submitted an incomplete Buy America certificate or an incorrect certificate of noncompliance through inadvertent or clerical error (but not including failure to sign the certificate, submission of certificates of both compliance and non-compliance, or failure to submit any certification), may submit to the FTA Chief Counsel within ten (10) days of bid opening of submission or a final offer, a written explanation of the circumstances surrounding the submission of the incomplete or incorrect certification in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 1746, sworn under penalty of perjury, stating that the submission resulted from inadvertent or clerical error. The bidder or offeror will also submit evidence of intent, such as information about the origin of the product, invoices, or other working documents. The bidder or offeror will simultaneously send a copy of this information to the FTA grantee.
            (i) The FTA Chief Counsel may request additional information from the bidder or offeror, if necessary. The grantee may not make a contract award until the FTA Chief Counsel issues his/her determination, except as provided in § 661.15(m).
            (ii) [Reserved]
            (2) For negotiated procurements, compliance with the Buy America requirements shall be determined on the basis of the certification submitted with the final offer or final revised proposal. However, where a grantee awards on the basis of initial proposals without discussion, the certification submitted with the initial proposal shall control.
            (3) Certification based on ignorance of the proper application of the Buy America requirements is not an inadvertent or clerical error.
            (c) Whether or not a bidder or offeror certifies that it will comply with the applicable requirement, such bidder or offeror is bound by its original certification (in the case of a sealed bidding procurement) or its certification submitted with its final offer (in the case of a negotiated procurement) and is not permitted to change its certification after bid opening or submission of a final offer. Where a bidder or offeror certifies that it will comply with the applicable Buy America requirements, the bidder, offeror, or grantee is not eligible for a waiver of those requirements.

            § 661.15
            Investigation procedures.
            (a) It is presumed that a bidder or offeror who has submitted the required Buy America certificate is complying with the Buy America provision. A false certification is a criminal act in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1001.
            (b) Any party may petition FTA to investigate the compliance of a successful bidder or offeror with the bidder's or offeror's certification. That party (“the petitioner”) must include in the petition a statement of the grounds of the petition and any supporting documentation. If FTA determines that the information presented in the petition indicates that the presumption in paragraph (a) of this section has been overcome, FTA will initiate an investigation.
            (c) In appropriate circumstances, FTA may determine on its own to initiate an investigation without receiving a petition from a third party.
            (d) When FTA determines under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section to conduct an investigation, it requests that the grantee require the successful bidder or offeror to document its compliance with its Buy America certificate. The successful bidder or offeror has the burden of proof to establish that it is in compliance. Documentation of compliance is based on the specific circumstances of each investigation, and FTA will specify the documentation required in each case.
            (e) The grantee shall reply to the request under paragraph (d) of this section within 15 working days of the request. The investigated party may correspond directly with FTA during the course of investigation, if it informs the grantee that it intends to do so, and if the grantee agrees to such action in writing. The grantee must inform FTA, in writing, that the investigated party will respond directly to FTA. An investigated party may provide confidential or proprietary information (see paragraph (l) of this section) directly to FTA while providing other information required to be submitted as part of the investigation through the grantee.
            (f) Any additional information requested or required by FTA must be submitted within 5 working days after the receipt of such request unless specifically exempted by FTA.

            (g) The grantee's reply (or that of the bidder or offeror) will be transmitted to the petitioner. The petitioner may submit comments on the reply to FTA within 10 working days after receipt of the reply. The grantee and the low bidder or offeror will be furnished with a copy of the petitioner's comments, and their comments must be received by FTA within 5 working days after receipt of the petitioner's comments.
            (h) The failure of a party to comply with the time limits stated in this section may result in resolution of the investigation without consideration of untimely filed comments.
            (i) During the course of an investigation, with appropriate notification to affected parties, FTA may conduct site visits of manufacturing facilities and final assembly locations as it considers appropriate.
            (j) FTA will, upon request, make available to any interested party information bearing on the substance of the investigation which has been submitted by the petitioner, interested parties or grantees, except to the extent that withholding of information is permitted or required by law or regulation.
            (k) If a party submitting information considers that the information submitted contains proprietary material which should be withheld, a statement advising FTA of this fact may be included, and the alleged proprietary information must be identified wherever it appears. Any comments on the information provided shall be submitted within a maximum of ten days.
            (l) For purposes of paragraph (j) of this section, confidential or proprietary material is any material or data whose disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm to the party claiming that the material is confidential or proprietary.
            (m) When a petition for investigation has been filed before award, the grantee will not make an award before the resolution of the investigation, unless the grantee determines that:
            (1) The items to be procured are urgently required;
            (2) Delivery of performance will be unduly delayed by failure to make the award promptly; or
            (3) Failure to make prompt award will otherwise cause undue harm to the grantee or the Federal Government.
            (n) In the event that the grantee determines that the award is to be made during the pendency of an investigation, the grantee will notify FTA before to making such award. FTA reserves the right not to participate in the funding of any contract awarded during the pendency of an investigation.
            (o) Initial decisions by FTA will be in written form. Reconsideration of an initial decision of FTA may be requested by any party involved in an investigation. FTA will only reconsider a decision only if the party requesting reconsideration submits new matters of fact or points of law that were not known or available to the party during the investigation. A request for reconsideration of a decision of FTA shall be filed not later than ten (10) working days after the initial written decision. A request for reconsideration will be subject to the procedures in this section consistent with the need for prompt resolution of the matter.

            § 661.17
            Failure to comply with certification.
            If a successful bidder or offeror fails to demonstrate that it is in compliance with its certification, it will be required to take the necessary steps in order to achieve compliance. If a bidder or offeror takes these necessary steps, it will not be allowed to change its original bid price or the price of its final offer. If a bidder or offeror does not take the necessary steps, it will not be awarded the contract if the contract has not yet been awarded, and it is in breach of contract if a contract has been awarded.

            (a) Affixed a label bearing a “Made in America” inscription, or an inscription with the same meaning, to a product not made in the United States, but sold in or shipped to the United States and used in projects to which this section applies, or
            (b) Otherwise represented that any such product was produced in the United States.

            Rights of parties.

            (a) A party adversely affected by an FTA action under this subsection shall have the right to seek review under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. 702 et seq.
            
            (b) Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the sole right of any third party under the Buy America provision is to petition FTA under the provisions of § 661.15 of this part. No third party has any additional right, at law or equity, for any remedy including, but not limited to, injunctions, damages, or cancellation of the Federal grant or contracts of the grantee.

            State Buy America provisions.
            (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, any State may impose more stringent Buy America or buy national requirements than contained in section 165 of the Act and the regulations in this part.
            (b) FTA will not participate in contracts governed by the following:
            (1) State Buy America or Buy National preference provisions which are not as strict as the Federal requirements.
            (2) State and local Buy National or Buy America preference provisions which are not explicitly set out under State law. For example, administrative interpretations of non-specific State legislation will not control.
            (3) State and local Buy Local preference provisions.

              Purpose.

              This part implements section 12(j) of the Federal Mass Transit Act of 1964, as amended, which was added by section 319 of the 1987 Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act (Pub.

              (b) Post-delivery means the time period in the procurement process from when the rolling stock is delivered to the recipient until title to the rolling stock is transferred to the recipient or the rolling stock is put into revenue service, whichever is first.
              (c) Recipient means a recipient of Federal financial assistance from FTA.
              (d) Revenue service means operation of rolling stock for transportation of fare-paying passengers as anticipated by the recipient.

              (f) Audit means a review resulting in a report containing the necessary certifications of compliance with Buy America standards, purchaser's requirements specifications, and, where appropriate, a manufacturer's certification of compliance with or inapplicability of the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, required by section 319 of STURAA and this part.
              (g) FTA means the Federal Transit Administration.

              (a) An audit under this part is limited to verifying compliance with
              (1) Applicable Buy America requirements [section 165 of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982, as amended,]; and
              (2) Solicitation specification requirements of the recipient.
              (b) An audit under this part includes, where appropriate, a copy of a manufacturer's self certification information that the vehicle complies with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards or a certification that such standards are inapplicable.
              (c) An audit conducted under this part is separate from the single annual audit requirement established by Office of Management and Budget Circular A-128, “Audits of State and Local Governments,” dated May 16, 1985.
            
            
              § 663.11

              A Buy America certification under this part shall be issued in addition to any certification which may be required by part 661 of this title. Nothing in this part precludes FTA from conducting a Buy America investigation under part 661 of this title.
            
            
              § 663.15
              Compliance.
              A recipient subject to this part shall comply with all applicable requirements of this part. Such compliance is a condition of receiving Federal financial assistance from FTA. A recipient determined not to be in compliance with this part will be subject to the immediate suspension, withholding, or repayment of Federal financial assistance from FTA or other appropriate actions unless and until it comes into compliance with this part.

              Pre-award Buy America certification.
              For purposes of this part, a pre-award Buy America certification is a certification that the recipient keeps on file that—
              (a) There is a letter from FTA which grants a waiver to the rolling stock to be purchased from the Buy America requirements under section 165(b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(4) of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982, as amended; or
              (b) The recipient is satisfied that the rolling stock to be purchased meets the requirements of section 165(a) or (b)(3) of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982, as amended, after having reviewed itself or through an audit prepared by someone other than the manufacturer or its agent documentation provided by the manufacturer which lists—

              § 665.27
              Procedures during testing.
              (a) Upon receipt of a bus approved for testing the operator of the Bus Testing Facility shall:
              (1) Inspect the bus design configuration and compare it to the configuration documented in the test request;
              (2) Determine if the bus, when loaded to Gross Weight, does not exceed its Gross Vehicle Weight Rating, Gross Axle Weight Ratings, or maximum tire load ratings;
              (3) Determine if the bus is capable of negotiating the durability test track at curb weight, seated load weight, and Gross Vehicle Weight;
              (4) Determine if the bus is capable of performing the Fuel Economy and Emissions Test duty cycles within the established standards for speed deviation.
              (b) The operator shall present the results obtained from the activities of 665.27(a) and present them to the bus manufacturer and the FTA Bus Testing Program Manager for review prior to initiating testing using the Bus testing program funds. FTA will provide a written response within five (5) business days to authorize the start of testing or to request clarification for any discrepancies noted from the activities of 665.27(a). Testing can commence after five (5) business days if FTA does not provide a response.
              (c) The operator shall perform all maintenance and repairs on the test vehicle, consistent with the manufacturer's specifications, unless the operator determines that the nature of the maintenance or repair is best performed by the manufacturer under the operator's supervision.
              (d) The manufacturer shall be permitted to observe all tests. The manufacturer shall not provide maintenance or service unless requested to do so by the operator.
              (e) The operator shall investigate each occurrence of unauthorized maintenance and repairs and determine the potential impact to the validity of the test results. Tests where the results could have been impacted must be repeated at the manufacturer's expense.
              (f) The operator shall perform all modifications on the test vehicle, consistent with the manufacturer's specifications, unless the operator determines that the nature of the modification is best performed by the manufacturer under the operator's supervision. All vehicle modifications performed after the test has started will first require review and approval by FTA. If the modification is determined to be a major change, some or all of the tests already completed shall be repeated or extended at FTA's discretion.
              (g) The operator shall halt testing after any occurrence of unapproved, unauthorized, or unsupervised test vehicle modifications. Following an occurrence of unapproved or unsupervised test vehicle modifications, the vehicle manufacturer shall submit a new test request to FTA that addresses all the requirements in 665.11 to reenter the Bus testing program.
              (h) The operator shall perform eight categories of tests on new bus models. The eight tests and their corresponding performance standards are described in the following paragraphs.
              (1) Maintainability test. The Maintainability test shall include bus servicing, preventive maintenance, inspection, and repair. It shall also include the removal and reinstallation of the engine and drive-train components that would be expected to require replacement during the bus's normal life cycle. Much of the maintainability data should be obtained during the Bus Durability Test. All servicing, preventive maintenance, and repair actions shall be recorded and reported. These actions shall be performed by test facility staff, although manufacturers shall be allowed to maintain a representative on-site during the testing. Test facility staff may require a manufacturer to provide vehicle servicing or repair under the supervision of the facility staff. Since the operator may not be familiar with the detailed design of all new bus models that are tested, tests to determine the time and skill required for removing and reinstalling an engine, a transmission, or other major propulsion system components may require advice from the bus manufacturer. All routine and corrective maintenance shall be carried out by the operator in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications.
              (i) The Maintainability Test Report shall include the frequency, personnel hours, and replacement parts or supplies required for each action during the test. The accessibility of selected components and other observations that could be important to a bus purchaser shall be included in the report.
              (ii) The performance standard for Maintainability is that no greater than 125 hours of total unscheduled maintenance shall be accumulated over the execution of a full test.
              (2) Reliability test. Reliability shall not be a separate test, but shall be addressed by recording all bus failures and breakdowns during all other testing. The detected bus failures, repair time, and the actions required to return the bus to operation shall be presented in the report. The performance standard for Reliability is that the vehicle under test experience no more than one uncorrected Class 1 failure and two uncorrected Class 2 failures over the execution of a full test. Class 1 failures are addressed in the Safety Test, below. An uncorrected Class 2 failure is a failure mode not addressed by a design or component modification that would cause a transit vehicle to be unable to complete its transit route and require towing or on-route repairs. A failure is considered corrected when a design or component modification is validated through sufficient remaining or additional reliability testing in which the failure does not reoccur.
              (3) Safety test. The Safety Test shall consist of a Handling and Stability Test, a Braking Performance Test, and a review of the Class 1 reliability failures that occurred during the test. The Handling and Stability Test shall be an obstacle avoidance double-lane change test performed on a smooth and level test track. The lane change course will be set up using pylons to mark off two 12 foot center to center lanes with two 100 foot lane change areas 100 feet apart. Bus speed shall be held constant throughout a given test run. Individual test runs shall be made at increasing speeds up to a specified maximum or until the bus can no longer be operated safely over the course, whichever speed is lower. Both left- and right-hand lane changes shall be tested. The performance standard is that the test vehicle can safely negotiate and remain within the lane change test course at a speed of no less than 45 mph.
              (i) The functionality and performance of the service, regenerative (if applicable), and parking brake systems shall be evaluated at the test track. The test bus shall be subjected to a series of brake stops from specified speeds on high, low, and split-friction surfaces. The parking brake shall be evaluated with the bus parked facing both up and down a steep grade. There are three performance standards for braking. The stopping distance from a speed of 45 mph on a high friction surface shall satisfy the bus stopping distance requirements of FMVSS 105 or 121 as applicable. The bus shall remain within a standard 12-foot lane width during split coefficient brake stops. The parking brake shall hold the test vehicle stationary on a 20 percent grade facing up and down the grade for a period of 5 minutes.

              (ii) A review of all the Class 1 failures that occurred during the test shall be conducted as part of the Safety Test. Class 1 failures include those failures that, when they occur, could result in a loss of vehicle control; in serious injury to the driver, passengers, pedestrians, or other motorists; and in property damage or loss due to collision or fire. The performance standard is that at the completion of testing with no uncorrected Class 1 failure modes. A failure is considered corrected when a design or component modification is validated through sufficient remaining or additional Reliability Tests in which the failure does not reoccur over a number of miles equal to or greater than the additional failure up to 100% of the durability test mileage for the service life category of the tested bus.
              (4) Performance test. The Performance Test shall measure the maximum acceleration, speed, and gradeability capability of the test vehicle. In determining the transit vehicle's maximum acceleration and speed, the bus shall be accelerated at full throttle from rest until it achieves its maximum speed on a level roadway. The performance standard for acceleration is that the maximum time that the test vehicle requires to achieve 30 mph is 18 seconds on a level grade. The gradeability test of the test vehicle shall be calculated based on the data measured on a level grade during the Acceleration Test. The performance standard for the gradeability test is that the test vehicle achieves a sustained speed of at least 40 mph on a 2.5 percent grade and a sustained speed of at least 10 mph on a 10 percent grade.
              (5) Structural integrity tests. Two complementary Structural Integrity Tests shall be performed. Structural Strength and Distortion Tests shall be performed at the Bus Testing Center, and the Structural Durability Test shall be performed at the test track.
              (i) Structural strength and distortion tests. (1) The bus shall be loaded to GVW, with one wheel on top of a curb and then in a pothole. This test shall be repeated for all four wheels. The test verifies:
              (i) Normal operation of the steering mechanism and;
              (ii) Operability of all passenger doors, passenger escape mechanisms, windows, and service doors. A water leak test shall be conducted in each suspension travel condition. The performance standard shall be that all vehicle passenger exits remain operational throughout the test.
              (2) Using a load-equalizing towing sling, a static tension load equal to 1.2 times the curb weight shall be applied to the bus towing fixtures (front and rear). The load shall be removed and the two eyes and adjoining structure inspected for damages or permanent deformations. The performance standard shall be that no permanent deformation is experienced at static loads up to 1.2 times the vehicle curb weight.
              (3) The bus shall be towed at CW with a heavy wrecker truck for 5 miles at 20 mph and then inspected for structural damage or permanent deformation. The performance standard shall be that the vehicle is towable with a standard commercial vehicle wrecker without experiencing any permanent damage to the vehicle.
              (4) With the bus at CW, probable damages and clearance issues due to tire deflating and hydraulic jacking shall be assessed. The performance standard shall be that the vehicle is capable of being lifted with a standard commercial vehicle hydraulic jack.
              (5) With the bus at CW, possible damages or deformation associated with lifting the bus on a two post hoist system or supporting it on jack stands shall be assessed. The performance standard shall be that the vehicle is capable of being supported by jack stands rated for the vehicle's weight.
              (i) Structural durability test. The Structural Durability Test shall be performed on the durability course at the test track, simulating twenty-five percent of the vehicle's normal service life. The bus structure shall be inspected regularly during the test, and the mileage and identification of any structural anomalies and failures shall be reported in the Reliability Test. There shall be two performance standards for the Durability Test, one to address the vehicle frame and body structure and one to address the bus propulsion system. The performance standard for the vehicle frame and body structure shall be that there are no uncorrected failure modes of the vehicle frame and body structure at the completion of the full vehicle test. The performance standard for the vehicle propulsion system is that there are no uncorrected powertrain failure modes at the completion of a full test.
              (ii) [Reserved]
              (6) Fuel economy test. The Fuel Economy Test shall be conducted using duty cycles that simulate a diverse range of transit service operating profiles. This test shall measure the fuel economy or fuel consumption of the vehicle and present the results in metrics that minimize the number of unit conversions for mass, volume, and energy.
              
              (i) The Fuel Economy Test shall be designed only to enable FTA recipients to compare the relative fuel economy of buses operating at a consistent loading condition on the same set of typical transit driving cycles. The results of this test are not directly comparable to fuel economy estimates by other agencies, such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) or U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or for other purposes.
              (ii) The performance standard for fuel economy shall be the prevailing model year fuel consumption standards for heavy-duty vocational vehicles outlined in the NHTSA's Medium and Heavy-Duty Fuel Efficiency Program (49 CFR part 535).
              (7) Noise test. The Noise Test shall measure interior noise and vibration while the bus is idling (or in a comparable operating mode) and driving over smooth and irregular road surfaces, and also shall measure the transmission of exterior noise to the interior while the bus is not running. The exterior noise shall be measured as the bus is operated past a stationary measurement instrument. There shall be two minimum noise performance standards: One to address the maximum interior noise during vehicle acceleration from a stop, and one to address the maximum exterior noise during vehicle acceleration from a stop. The performance standard for interior noise while the vehicle accelerates from 0-35 mph shall be no greater than 80 decibels A-weighted. The performance standard for exterior noise while the vehicle accelerates from 0-35 miles per hour shall be no greater than 83 decibels A-weighted.
              (8) Emissions test. The Emissions Test shall measure tailpipe emissions of those exhaust constituents regulated by the United States EPA for transit bus emissions, plus carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), as the bus is operated over specific repeatable transit vehicle driving cycles. The Emissions test shall be conducted using an emission testing laboratory equipped with a chassis dynamometer capable of both absorbing and applying power.
              (i) The Emissions Test is not a certification test, and is designed only to enable FTA recipients to relatively compare the emissions of buses operating on the same set of typical transit driving cycles. The results of this test are not directly comparable to emissions measurements reported to other agencies, such as the EPA, or for other purposes.
              (ii) The emissions performance standard shall be the prevailing EPA emissions requirements for heavy-duty vehicles outlined in 40 CFR part 86 and 40 CFR part 1037.

              Appendix A to Part 665—Bus Model Scoring System and the Pass/Fail Standard
              1. Bus Model Scoring System
              The Bus Model Scoring System shall be used to score the test results using the performance standards in each category. A bus model that fails to meet a minimum performance standard shall be deemed to have failed the test and will not receive an aggregate score. For buses that have passed all the minimum performance standards, an aggregate score shall be generated and presented in each Bus Testing Report. A bus model that just satisfies the minimum baseline performance standard and does not exceed any of the standards shall receive a score of 60. The maximum score a bus model shall receive is 100. The minimum and maximum points available in each test category shall be as shown below in Table A. The Bus Testing report will include a scoring summary table that displays the resulting scores in each of the test categories and subcategories. The scoring summary table shall have a disclaimer footnote stating that the use of the scoring system is not mandatory, only that the bus being procured receive a passing score.
              2. Pass/Fail Standard
              The passing standard shall be a score of 60. Bus models that fail to meet one or more of the minimum baseline performance standards will be ineligible to obtain an aggregate passing score.

              (2) The Deputy Administrator determines that an unsafe condition or practice, or a combination of unsafe conditions and practices exists such that there is a substantial risk of death or personal injury, or damage to property or equipment; or
              (3) For any other purpose where the Deputy Administrator determines that the public interest requires the avoidance or mitigation of a hazard or risk through immediate compliance.
              (b) Effective date. A special directive is effective upon notice provided by the Deputy Administrator under paragraph (c) of this section.
              (c) Notice. The Deputy Administrator will provide notice to a recipient that is subject to a special directive. The Deputy Administrator may initially provide notice through telephonic or electronic communication; however, written notice will be served by personal service or by U.S. mail following telephonic or electronic communication. Notice will include the following information, at minimum—
              (1) The name of the recipient or recipients to which the directive applies;

              (d) Petition for reconsideration. Within thirty (30) days of service of a notice issued under paragraph (c) of this section, a recipient may file a petition for reconsideration with the Administrator. Unless explicitly stayed or modified by the Administrator, a special directive will remain in effect and must be observed pending review of a petition for reconsideration. Any such petition:
              (1) Must be in writing and signed by a recipient's Accountable Executive or equivalent entity;
              (2) Must include a brief explanation of why the recipient believes the special directive should not apply to it or why compliance with the special directive is not possible, is not practicable, is unreasonable, or is not in the public interest; and

              (3) May include relevant information regarding the factual basis upon which the special directive was issued, information in response to any alleged violation or in mitigation thereof, recommend alternative means of compliance for consideration, and any other information deemed appropriate by the recipient.
              (e) Request for extension. Upon written request, the Administrator may extend the time for filing a request for reconsideration for good cause shown.
              (f) Filing a petition for reconsideration. A petition must be submitted to the Office of the Administrator, Federal Transit Administration, using one of the following methods—
              (1) Email to FTA, sent to an email address provided in the notice of special directive;
              (2) Facsimile to FTA at 202-366-9854; or
              (3) Mail to FTA at: FTA, Office of the Administrator, 1200 New Jersey Ave. SE., Washington, DC 20590.
              (g) Processing of petitions for reconsideration—(1) General.

No hearing, argument or other proceeding will be held directly on a petition before its disposition under this section.
              (2) Grants. If the Administrator determines the petition contains adequate justification, he or she may grant the petition, in whole or in part.
              (3) Denials. If the Administrator determines the petition does not justify modifying, rescinding or revoking the directive, in whole or in part, he or she may deny the petition.
              (4) Notification. The Administrator will issue notification to a recipient of his or her decision.
              (h) Judicial review. A recipient may seek judicial review in an appropriate United States District Court after a final action of FTA under this section, as provided in 5 U.S.C. 701-706.

              § 674.13
              Designation of oversight agency.
              (a) Every State that must establish a State Safety Oversight program in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 5329(e) must also establish a SSOA for the purpose of overseeing the safety of rail fixed guideway public transportation systems within that State. Further, the State must ensure that:
              (1) The SSOA is financially and legally independent from any public transportation agency the SSOA is obliged to oversee;
              (2) The SSOA does not directly provide public transportation services in an area with a rail fixed guideway public transportation system the SSOA is obliged to oversee;
              (3) The SSOA does not employ any individual who is also responsible for administering a rail fixed guideway public transportation system the SSOA is obliged to oversee;
              (4) The SSOA has authority to review, approve, oversee, and enforce the public transportation agency safety plan for a rail fixed guideway public transportation system required by 49 U.S.C. 5329(d);
              (5) The SSOA has investigative and enforcement authority with respect to the safety of all rail fixed guideway public transportation systems within the State;

              (6) At least once every three years, the SSOA audits every rail fixed guideway public transportation system's compliance with the public transportation agency safety plan required by 49 U.S.C. 5329(d); and
              (7) At least once a year, the SSOA reports the status of the safety of each rail fixed guideway public transportation system to the Governor, the FTA, and the board of directors, or equivalent entity, of the rail fixed guideway public transportation system.
              (b) At the request of the Governor of a State, the Administrator may waive the requirements for financial and legal independence and the prohibitions on employee conflict of interest under paragraphs (a)(1) and (3) of this section, if the rail fixed guideway public transportation systems in design, construction, or revenue operations in the State have fewer than one million combined actual and projected rail fixed guideway revenue miles per year or provide fewer than ten million combined actual and projected unlinked passenger trips per year. However:
              (1) If a State shares jurisdiction over one or more rail fixed guideway public transportation systems with another State, and has one or more rail fixed guideway public transportation systems that are not shared with another State, the revenue miles and unlinked passenger trips of the rail fixed guideway public transportation system under shared jurisdiction will not be counted in the Administrator's decision whether to issue a waiver.
              (2) The Administrator will rescind a waiver issued under this subsection if the number of revenue miles per year or unlinked passenger trips per year increases beyond the thresholds specified in this subsection.
            
            
              § 674.15
              Designation of oversight agency for multi-state system.
              In an instance of a rail fixed guideway public transportation system that operates in more than one State, all States in which that rail fixed guideway public transportation system operates must either:
              (a) Ensure that uniform safety standards and procedures in compliance with 49 U.S.C. 5329 are applied to that rail fixed guideway public transportation system, through an SSO program that has been approved by the Administrator; or
              (b) Designate a single entity that meets the requirements for an SSOA to serve as the SSOA for that rail fixed guideway public transportation system, through an SSO program that has been approved by the Administrator.
            
            
              § 674.17
              Use of Federal financial assistance.
              (a) In accordance with 49 U.S.C. 5329(e)(6), FTA will make grants of Federal financial assistance to eligible States to help the States develop and carry out their SSO programs. This Federal financial assistance may be used for reimbursement of both the operational and administrative expenses of SSO programs, consistent with the uniform administrative requirements for grants to States under 2 CFR parts 200 and 1201. The expenses eligible for reimbursement include, specifically, the expense of employee training and the expense of establishing and maintaining a SSOA in compliance with 49 U.S.C. 5329(e)(4).
              (b) The apportionments of available Federal financial assistance to eligible States will be made in accordance with a formula, established by the Administrator, following opportunity for public notice and comment. The formula will take into account fixed guideway vehicle revenue miles, fixed guideway route miles, and fixed guideway vehicle passenger miles attributable to all rail fixed guideway systems within each eligible State not subject to the jurisdiction of the FRA.
              (c) The grants of Federal financial assistance for State safety oversight shall be subject to terms and conditions as the Administrator deems appropriate.
              (d) The Federal share of the expenses eligible for reimbursement under a grant for State safety oversight activities shall be eighty percent of the reasonable costs incurred under that grant.

              (e) The non-Federal share of the expenses eligible for reimbursement under a grant for State safety oversight activities may not be comprised of Federal funds, any funds received from a public transportation agency, or any revenues earned by a public transportation agency.
            
            
              § 674.19
              Certification of a State Safety Oversight Program.
              (a) The Administrator must determine whether a State's SSO program meets the requirements of 49 U.S.C. 5329(e). Also, the Administrator must determine whether a SSO program is adequate to promote the purposes of 49 U.S.C. 5329, including, but not limited to, the National Public Transportation Safety Plan, the Public Transportation Safety Certification Training Program, and the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plans.
              (b) The Administrator must issue a certification to a State whose SSO program meets the requirements of 49 U.S.C. 5329(e). The Administrator must issue a denial of certification to a State whose SSO program does not meet the requirements of 49 U.S.C. 5329(e).
              (c) In an instance in which the Administrator issues a denial of certification to a State whose SSO program does not meet the requirements of 49 U.S.C. 5329(e), the Administrator must provide a written explanation, and allow the State an opportunity to modify and resubmit its SSO program for the Administrator's approval. In the event the State is unable to modify its SSO program to merit the Administrator's issuance of a certification, the Administrator must notify the Governor of that fact, and must ask the Governor to take all possible actions to correct the deficiencies that are precluding the issuance of a certification for the SSO program. In his or her discretion, the Administrator may also impose financial penalties as authorized by 49 U.S.C. 5329(e), which may include:
              (1) Withholding SSO grant funds from the State;
              (2) Withholding up to five percent of the 49 U.S.C. 5307 Urbanized Area formula funds appropriated for use in the State or urbanized area in the State, until such time as the SSO program can be certified; or
              (3) Requiring all rail fixed guideway public transportation systems governed by the SSO program to spend up to 100 percent of their Federal funding under 49 U.S.C. chapter 53 only for safety-related improvements on their systems, until such time as the SSO program can be certified.
              (d) In making a determination whether to issue a certification or a denial of certification for a SSO program, the Administrator must evaluate whether the cognizant SSOA has sufficient authority, resources, and expertise to oversee the number, size, and complexity of the rail fixed guideway public transportation systems that operate within the State, or will attain the necessary authority, resources, and expertise in accordance with a developmental plan and schedule set forth to a sufficient level of detail in the SSO program.
            
            
              § 674.21

              (a) In making a decision to impose financial penalties as authorized by 49 U.S.C. 5329(e), and determining the nature and amount of the financial penalties, the Administrator shall consider the extent and circumstances of the noncompliance; the operating budgets of the SSOA and the rail fixed guideway public transportation systems that will be affected by the financial penalties; and such other matters as justice may require.
              (b) If a State fails to establish a SSO program that has been approved by the Administrator within three years of the effective date of this part, FTA will be prohibited from obligating Federal financial assistance apportioned under 49 U.S.C. 5338 to any entity in the State that is otherwise eligible to receive that Federal financial assistance, in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 5329(e)(3).
            
            
              § 674.23
              Confidentiality of information.
              (a) A State, an SSOA, or an RTA may withhold an investigation report prepared or adopted in accordance with these regulations from being admitted as evidence or used in a civil action for damages resulting from a matter mentioned in the report.
              (b) This part does not require public availability of any data, information, or procedures pertaining to the security of a rail fixed guideway public transportation system or its passenger operations.

An SSOA must enforce the execution of a Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan, through an order of a corrective action plan or any other means, as necessary or appropriate. An SSOA must ensure that a Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan meets the requirements at 49 U.S.C. 5329(d).
              (c) An SSOA has primary responsibility for the investigation of any allegation of noncompliance with a Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan. These responsibilities do not preclude the Administrator from exercising his or her authority under 49 U.S.C. 5329(f) or 49 U.S.C. 5330.
              (d) An SSOA has primary responsibility for the investigation of an accident on a rail fixed guideway public transportation system. This responsibility does not preclude the Administrator from exercising his or her authority under 49 U.S.C. 5329(f) or 49 U.S.C. 5330.
              (e) An SSOA may enter into an agreement with a contractor for assistance in overseeing accident investigations; performing independent accident investigations; and reviewing incidents and occurrences; and for expertise the SSOA does not have within its own organization.
              (f) All personnel and contractors employed by an SSOA must comply with the requirements of the Public Transportation Safety Certification Training Program as applicable.
            
            
              § 674.27
              State safety oversight program standards.
              (a) An SSOA must adopt and distribute a written SSO program standard, consistent with the National Public Transportation Safety Plan and the rules for Public Transportation Agency Safety Plans. This SSO program standard must identify the processes and procedures that govern the activities of the SSOA. Also, the SSO program standard must identify the processes and procedures an RTA must have in place to comply with the standard. At minimum, the program standard must meet the following requirements:
              (1) Program management. The SSO program standard must explain the authority of the SSOA to oversee the safety of rail fixed guideway public transportation systems; the policies that govern the activities of the SSOA; the reporting requirements that govern both the SSOA and the rail fixed guideway public transportation systems; and the steps the SSOA will take to ensure open, on-going communication between the SSOA and every rail fixed guideway public transportation system within its oversight.
              (2) Program standard development. The SSO program standard must explain the SSOA's process for developing, reviewing, adopting, and revising its minimum standards for safety, and distributing those standards to the rail fixed guideway public transportation systems.
              (3) Program policy and objectives. The SSO program standard must set an explicit policy and objectives for safety in rail fixed guideway public transportation throughout the State.
              (4) Oversight of Rail Public Transportation Agency Safety Plans and Transit Agencies' internal safety reviews. The SSO program standard must explain the role of the SSOA in overseeing an RTA's execution of its Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan and any related safety reviews of the RTA's fixed guideway public transportation system. The program standard must describe the process whereby the SSOA will receive and evaluate all material submitted under the signature of an RTA's accountable executive. Also, the program standard must establish a procedure whereby an RTA will notify the SSOA before the RTA conducts an internal review of any aspect of the safety of its rail fixed guideway public transportation system.
              (5) Triennial SSOA audits of Rail Public Transportation Agency Safety Plans. The SSO program standard must explain the process the SSOA will follow and the criteria the SSOA will apply in conducting a complete audit of the RTA's compliance with its Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan at least once every three years, in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 5329. Alternatively, the SSOA and RTA may agree that the SSOA will conduct its audit on an on-going basis over the three-year timeframe. The program standard must establish a procedure the SSOA and RTA will follow to manage findings and recommendations arising from the triennial audit.
              (6) Accident notification. The SSO program standard must establish requirements for an RTA to notify the SSOA of accidents on the RTA's rail fixed guideway public transportation system. These requirements must address, specifically, the time limits for notification, methods of notification, and the nature of the information the RTA must submit to the SSOA.
              (7) Investigations. The SSO program standard must identify thresholds for accidents that require the RTA to conduct an investigation. Also, the program standard must address how the SSOA will oversee an RTA's internal investigation; the role of the SSOA in supporting any investigation conducted or findings and recommendations made by the NTSB or FTA; and procedures for protecting the confidentiality of the investigation reports.
              (8) Corrective actions. The program standard must explain the process and criteria by which the SSOA may order an RTA to develop and carry out a Corrective Action Plan (CAP), and a procedure for the SSOA to review and approve a CAP. Also, the program standard must explain the SSOA's policy and practice for tracking and verifying an RTA's compliance with the CAP, and managing any conflicts between the SSOA and RTA relating either to the development or execution of the CAP or the findings of an investigation.
              (b) At least once a year an SSOA must submit its SSO program standard and any referenced program procedures to FTA, with an indication of any revisions made to the program standard since the last annual submittal. FTA will evaluate the SSOA's program standard as part of its continuous evaluation of the State Safety Oversight Program, and in preparing FTA's report to Congress on the certification status of that State Safety Oversight Program, in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 5329.
            
            
              § 674.29
              Public Transportation Agency Safety Plans: general requirements.
              (a) In determining whether to approve a Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan for a rail fixed guideway public transportation system, an SSOA must evaluate whether the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan is consistent with the regulations implementing such Plans; is consistent with the National Public Transportation Safety Plan; and is in compliance with the program standard set by the SSOA.

              (b) In determining whether a Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan is compliant with 49 CFR part 673, an SSOA must determine, specifically, whether the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan is approved by the RTA's board of directors or equivalent entity; sets forth a sufficiently explicit process for safety risk management, with adequate means of risk mitigation for the rail fixed guideway public transportation system; includes a process and timeline for annually reviewing and updating the safety plan; includes a comprehensive staff training program for the operations personnel directly responsible for the safety of the RTA; identifies an adequately trained safety officer who reports directly to the general manager, president, or equivalent officer of the RTA; includes adequate methods to support the execution of the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan by all employees, agents, and contractors for the rail fixed guideway public transportation system; and sufficiently addresses other requirements under the regulations at 49 CFR part 673.
              (c) In an instance in which an SSOA does not approve a Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan, the SSOA must provide a written explanation, and allow the RTA an opportunity to modify and resubmit its Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan for the SSOA's approval.
            
            
              § 674.31
              Triennial audits: general requirements.
              At least once every three years, an SSOA must conduct a complete audit of an RTA's compliance with its Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan. Alternatively, an SSOA may conduct the audit on an on-going basis over the three-year timeframe. At the conclusion of the three-year audit cycle, the SSOA shall issue a report with findings and recommendations arising from the audit, which must include, at minimum, an analysis of the effectiveness of the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan, recommendations for improvements, and a corrective action plan, if necessary or appropriate. The RTA must be given an opportunity to comment on the findings and recommendations.
            
            
              § 674.33
              Notifications of accidents.
              (a) Two-hour notification. In addition to the requirements for accident notification set forth in an SSO program standard, an RTA must notify both the SSOA and the FTA within two hours of any accident occurring on a rail fixed guideway public transportation system. The criteria and thresholds for accident notification and reporting are defined in a reporting manual developed for the electronic reporting system specified by FTA as required in § 674.39(b), and in appendix A.
              (b) FRA notification. In any instance in which an RTA must notify the FRA of an accident as defined by 49 CFR 225.5 (i.e., shared use of the general railroad system trackage or corridors), the RTA must also notify the SSOA and FTA of the accident within the same time frame as required by the FRA.
            
            
              § 674.35
              Investigations.
              (a) An SSOA must investigate or require an investigation of any accident and is ultimately responsible for the sufficiency and thoroughness of all investigations, whether conducted by the SSOA or RTA. If an SSOA requires an RTA to investigate an accident, the SSOA must conduct an independent review of the RTA's findings of causation. In any instance in which an RTA is conducting its own internal investigation of the accident or incident, the SSOA and the RTA must coordinate their investigations in accordance with the SSO program standard and any agreements in effect.
              (b) Within a reasonable time, an SSOA must issue a written report on its investigation of an accident or review of an RTA's accident investigation in accordance with the reporting requirements established by the SSOA. The report must describe the investigation activities; identify the factors that caused or contributed to the accident; and set forth a corrective action plan, as necessary or appropriate. The SSOA must formally adopt the report of an accident and transmit that report to the RTA for review and concurrence. If the RTA does not concur with an SSOA's report, the SSOA may allow the RTA to submit a written dissent from the report, which may be included in the report, at the discretion of the SSOA.
              (c) All personnel and contractors that conduct investigations on behalf of an SSOA must be trained to perform their functions in accordance with the Public Transportation Safety Certification Training Program.
              (d) The Administrator may conduct an independent investigation of any accident or an independent review of an SSOA's or an RTA's findings of causation of an accident.
            
            
              § 674.37
              Corrective action plans.

              (a) In any instance in which an RTA must develop and carry out a CAP, the SSOA must review and approve the CAP before the RTA carries out the plan; however, an exception may be made for immediate or emergency corrective actions that must be taken to ensure immediate safety, provided that the SSOA has been given timely notification, and the SSOA provides subsequent review and approval. A CAP must describe, specifically, the actions the RTA will take to minimize, control, correct, or eliminate the risks and hazards identified by the CAP, the schedule for taking those actions, and the individuals responsible for taking those actions. The RTA must periodically report to the SSOA on its progress in carrying out the CAP. The SSOA may monitor the RTA's progress in carrying out the CAP through unannounced, on-site inspections, or any other means the SSOA deems necessary or appropriate.
              (b) In any instance in which a safety event on the RTA's rail fixed guideway public transportation system is the subject of an investigation by the NTSB, the SSOA must evaluate whether the findings or recommendations by the NTSB require a CAP by the RTA, and if so, the SSOA must order the RTA to develop and carry out a CAP.
            
            
              § 674.39
              State Safety Oversight Agency annual reporting to FTA.
              (a) On or before March 15 of each year, an SSOA must submit the following material to FTA:
              (1) The SSO program standard adopted in accordance with § 674.27, with an indication of any changes to the SSO program standard during the preceding twelve months;
              (2) Evidence that each of its employees and contractors has completed the requirements of the Public Transportation Safety Certification Training Program, or, if in progress, the anticipated completion date of the training;
              (3) A publicly available report that summarizes its oversight activities for the preceding twelve months, describes the causal factors of accidents identified through investigation, and identifies the status of corrective actions, changes to Public Transportation Agency Safety Plans, and the level of effort by the SSOA in carrying out its oversight activities;
              (4) A summary of the triennial audits completed during the preceding twelve months, and the RTAs' progress in carrying out CAPs arising from triennial audits conducted in accordance with § 674.31;
              (5) Evidence that the SSOA has reviewed and approved any changes to the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plans during the preceding twelve months; and
              (6) A certification that the SSOA is in compliance with the requirements of this part.
              (b) These materials must be submitted electronically through a reporting system specified by FTA.
            
            
              § 674.41
              Conflicts of interest.
              (a) An SSOA must be financially and legally independent from any rail fixed guideway public transportation system under the oversight of the SSOA, unless the Administrator has issued a waiver of this requirement in accordance with § 674.13(b).
              (b) An SSOA may not employ any individual who provides services to a rail fixed guideway public transportation system under the oversight of the SSOA, unless the Administrator has issued a waiver of this requirement in accordance with § 674.13(b).
              (c) A contractor may not provide services to both an SSOA and a rail fixed guideway public transportation system under the oversight of that SSOA, unless the Administrator has issued a waiver of this prohibition.

            § 700.1
            Purpose.
            This part describes the organization and functioning of Amtrak and the availability to the public of documents and information concerning its policies, procedures and activities.
          
          
            § 700.2
            Organization and functioning of Amtrak.

            The creation of the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (“Amtrak”) was authorized by the Rail Passenger Service Act, as amended, 84 Stat. 1327, 45 U.S.C. 541 et seq. (“the Act”). The Act requires that Amtrak be operated and managed as a for-profit corporation, that it be incorporated under the District of Columbia Business Corporation Act, and subject to the provisions of that statute to the extent not inconsistent with the Act, and that it provide a balanced transportation system by developing, operating, and improving intercity rail passenger service. The Act also states that Amtrak will not be an agency or establishment of the United States Government. Amtrak thus is a corporation created by Congress to compete for the transportation business of the intercity traveller, to the end that the travelling public will have a choice of travel modes. The address of its headquarters is 400 North Capitol Street, NW., Washington, DC 20001. Telephone: (202) 383-3000.
            (a) Board of Directors. Amtrak's major policies are established by its board of directors. The nine members of the board are selected as follows: The Secretary of Transportation serves as an ex-officio member and Amtrak's President, ex-officio, is Chairman of the Board; three members are appointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the Senate (representing labor, State Governors, and business); two represent commuter authorities and are selected by the President from lists drawn up by those authorities; and two are selected by the Corporation's preferred stockholder, the Department of Transportation.
            (b) Officers and central management. Amtrak is managed by a President and a Management Committee consisting of four Executive Vice Presidents. Reporting to the Executive Vice Presidents are eleven vice presidents representing sales, transportation marketing, planning and development, computer services, labor relations, finance and treasurer, personnel, passenger and operating services, government affairs, operations and maintenance, engineering, and the General Counsel. Areas handled as special matters with the authority of vice presidents, such as corporate communications, safety, real estate, procurement, materials management, police and security, contract administration, and internal audit are supervised by assistant vice presidents and directors.
            (c) Regional and field structure. The need for decentralization of functions in the areas of passenger services and transportation operations has led to the creation of Amtrak's regional and field structure. Field offices are located in major cities such as Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, Albany, Boston, Chicago, Seattle and Los Angeles. Pursuant to overall policies established at headquarters in Washington, DC, these offices handle matters like the assignment and scheduling of employees who work on board moving trains; purchase, stowage and preparation of food for dining service; maintenance and rehabilitation of rolling stock; and daily operating arrangements such as the make-up of trains or the cleaning and repairing of cars on trains.
            (d) Route system. Amtrak's basic route system has been established pursuant to statutory guidelines, and in some cases by specific statutory directive. Out of a route system covering about 23,000 route-miles, Amtrak owns a right-of-way of about 2,600 track miles in the Northeast Corridor (Washington-New York-Boston; New Haven-
            
            Springfield; and Philadelphia-Harrisburg) and small segments of track near Albany, New York, and Kalamazoo, Michigan. In the Northeast Corridor Amtrak trains are run by operating crews consisting of Amtrak employees. On other routes, Amtrak operates trains on the tracks of about twenty different privately owned railroads and compensates the railroad for the use of their facilities and for the services of their employees, including engineers, conductors, and maintenance personnel. Those private railroads are responsible for the conditions of the roadbed and for coordinating the flow of traffic over their lines.
            (e) Operations. Amtrak provides about 250 trains daily, serving about 500 stations in over forty states. Amtrak owns most of its cars and locomotives, some of its stations, and most of its repair facilities. Its capital improvements and almost half of its operating losses are supported principally through Federal financing, with some State, regional and local financial support for some trains and stations. Congress requires Amtrak to earn revenues equivalent to at least fifty percent of its operating costs, and it currently does so.
            (f) Revenue production. The sale of tickets for transportation and accommodations, Amtrak's principal source of revenue, is accomplished through Amtrak ticket agents at stations, travel agencies, and five central reservation offices which service a nationwide telephone network. National Timetables contain basic information about routes, stations, and services.
          
          
            § 700.3
            Availability of documents, assistance, and information.
            (a) A member of the public having need for assistance or information concerning any of the matters described in § 700.2 should address his or her concerns in a letter or other written communication directed to the appropriate vice president or to the Director of Corporate Communications. Amtrak will bring such communications to the attention of the appropriate official if they are misdirected in the first instance. Formal requests for “records” under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3) of the Freedom of Information Act are to be made in accordance with the provisions of 49 CFR 701.4.
            (b) The National Train Timetables described in § 700.2(f) are widely distributed in the continental United States and are available in major cities in Europe, Canada and Mexico. When they are updated (usually in April and October each year) each printing involves about 1,000,000 copies. They are ordinarily available at staffed Amtrak stations and copies are usually kept on hand in the offices of about 9800 travel agents who are authorized to sell Amtrak tickets. A person unable to obtain a copy locally should request one from the Director of Corporate Communications at the Washington, DC headquarters. The timetable depicts the major Amtrak train routes on a map of the United States, and most of the remainder of the booklet shows the schedules for specific trains. Several pages are used to offer travel information dealing with the availability of assistance to handicapped travellers, red cap service, purchase of tickets on board, use of credit cards and personal checks, handling of baggage, refunds for unused tickets and similar matters.
            (c) Also available to members of the public at most staffed Amtrak stations, and usually maintained in the offices of travel agencies authorized to sell Amtrak tickets, is a copy of the Reservations and Ticketing Manual (RTM) which constitutes a compendium of information governing Amtrak employees in furnishing transportation to the travelling public. It contains substantial segments dedicated to the following topics: Amtrak's computer system and its communication codes; interline service agreements; passenger and baggage services; customer relations functions; reservations policy and procedures; acceptance of checks and credit cards; refunds; missed connection policies; ticketing; accommodations; employee pass travel; location maps for Amtrak stations; and intermodal state maps.

            (d) A full statement of Amtrak's tariffs containing the fares for point-to-point travel, regional plan travel and all relevant travel conditions, such as excursions, discounts, family plans, accommodations, etc., is contained in the privately published Official Railway Guide, which is available by subscription from its publisher at 424 West 33rd Street, New York, New York 10001. A copy of the guide can usually be found at each staffed Amtrak station, and at the offices of travel agents authorized to sell Amtrak tickets. Tariff changes which occur between issues of the Guide are published and widely distributed by Amtrak pending their publication in the next issue of the Guide.
            (e) Each of the documents described in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section is available to the public for inspection during regular business hours at the office of Amtrak's Freedom of Information Office at its headquarters at 400 North Capitol Street, NW., Washington, DC 20001, and at the office of the Division Manager, Human Resources, in New Haven, Philadelphia, Baltimore, New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. Each document has its own index. Since each index is useful only in connection with the document to which it pertains, and since requests for indices are uncommon, Amtrak has determined that publication of its indices as described in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2) would be unnecessary and impracticable.

            § 701.3
            Policy.

            (a) Amtrak will make records of the Corporation available to the public to the greatest practicable extent in keeping with the spirit of the law. Therefore, records of the Corporation are available electronically, which can be accessed at the Amtrak FOIA Web site http://www.amtrak.com/foia and www.amtrak.com, as provided in this part with the exception of those that the Corporation specifically determines should not be disclosed either in the public interest, for the protection of private rights, or for the efficient conduct of public or corporate business, but only to the extent withholding is permitted by law.
            (b) A record of the Corporation, or parts thereof, may be withheld from disclosure if the Corporation reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by a FOIA exemption or when disclosure is prohibited by law. Disclosure to a properly constituted advisory committee, to Congress, or to Federal agencies does not waive the exemption.
            (c) In the event full disclosure of a requested record is not possible, any reasonably segregable portion of the record will be made available to the requesting person after deletion of the exempt portions. The entire record may be withheld if a determination is made that nonexempt material is so inextricably intertwined that disclosure would leave only essentially meaningless words or phrases, or when it can be reasonably assumed that a skillful and knowledgeable person could reconstruct the deleted information.
            (d) The procedures in this part apply only to records in existence at the time of a request. The Corporation has no obligation to create a record solely for the purpose of making it available under the FOIA or to provide a record that will be created in the future.
            (e) Each officer and employee of the Corporation dealing with FOIA requests is directed to cooperate in making records available for disclosure under the Act in a prompt manner consistent with this part.
            (f) The FOIA time limits will not begin to run until a request has been identified as being made under the Act and deemed received by the FOIA Office.
            (g) Generally, when a member of the public complies with the procedures established in this part for obtaining records under the FOIA, the request shall receive prompt attention, and a response shall be made within twenty business days.
          
          
            § 701.4
            Amtrak public information.
            (a) Amtrak FOIA Web site. Amtrak will make available electronically records created by the Corporation that are required under the FOIA to be made available for public inspection which can be accessed at the Amtrak FOIA Web site http://www.amtrak.com/foia and www.amtrak.com.
            
            (b) Frequently requested information. The FOIA requires that copies of records, regardless of form or format, that have been released pursuant to a FOIA request under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3) be made publicly available in an electronic format if because of the nature of their subject matter they have become or are likely to become the subject of subsequent requests for substantially the same records or they have been requested three or more times.
            (1) Amtrak shall decide on a case-by-case basis whether records fall into the first category of “frequently requested FOIA records” based on the following factors:
            (i) Previous experience with similar records;
            (ii) The nature and type of information contained in the records;
            (iii) The identity and number of requesters and whether there is widespread media or commercial interest in the records.
            (c) Guide for making requests. A guide on how to use the FOIA for requesting records from Amtrak shall be made available to the public upon request. Amtrak's major information systems will be described in the guide.
          
          
            § 701.5
            Requirements for making requests.
            (a) General requirements. (1) A FOIA request can be made by “any person” as defined in 5 U.S.C. 551(2), which encompasses individuals (including foreign citizens; partnerships; corporations; associations; and local, state, tribal, and foreign governments). A FOIA request may not be made by a Federal agency.
            (2) A request must be in writing, indicate that it is being made under the FOIA, and provide an adequate description of the records sought. The request should also include applicable information regarding fees as specified in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.
            (b) How to submit a request. (1) The request letter and envelope should be marked prominently that it is a Freedom of Information Act or “FOIA” request to ensure that it is properly routed.

            (2) The request must be addressed to the Freedom of Information Office; National Railroad Passenger Corporation; 60 Massachusetts Avenue NE., Washington, DC 20002. Requests will also be accepted by facsimile at (202) 906-2004 or via email at foiarequests@amtrak.com. Amtrak cannot assure that a timely or satisfactory response under this part will be given to written requests addressed to Amtrak offices, officers, or employees other than the FOIA Office. Amtrak employees receiving a communication in the nature of a FOIA request shall forward it to the FOIA Office expeditiously. Amtrak shall advise the requesting party of the date that an improperly addressed request is received by the FOIA Office.
            (c) Content of the request—(1) Description of records. Identification of records sought under the FOIA is the responsibility of the requester. The records sought should be described in sufficient detail so that Amtrak personnel can locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. When possible, the request should include specific information such as dates, title or name, author, recipient, subject matter of the record, file designation or number, or other pertinent details for each record or category of records sought. Requesters may contact Amtrak's FOIA Public Liaison to discuss the records they seek and to receive assistance in describing the records.
            (2) Reformulation of a request. Amtrak is not obligated to act on a request until the requester provides sufficient information to locate the record. Amtrak may offer assistance in identifying records and reformulating a request where: The description is considered insufficient, the production of voluminous records is required, or a considerable number of work hours would be required that would interfere with the business of the Corporation. The FOIA Office shall notify the requester within ten business days of the type of information that will facilitate the search. The requesting party shall be given an opportunity to supply additional information and may submit a revised request. Requesters may contact Amtrak's FOIA Public Liaison to receive assistance in reformulating or modifying their request.
            (d) Payment of fees. The submission of a FOIA request constitutes an agreement to pay applicable fees accessed up to $25.00 unless the requesting party specifies a willingness to pay a greater or lesser amount or seeks a fee waiver or reduction in fees.
            
            (1) Fees in excess of $25.00. When Amtrak determines or estimates that applicable fees are likely to exceed $25.00, the requesting party shall be notified of estimated or actual fees, unless a commitment has been made in advance to pay all fees. If only a portion of the fee can be estimated readily, Amtrak shall advise the requester that the estimated fee may be a portion of the total fee.
            (i) In order to protect requesters from large and/or unexpected fees, Amtrak will request a specific commitment when it estimates or determines that fees will exceed $100.00.
            (ii) A request shall not be considered received and further processing shall not be carried out until the requesting party agrees to pay the anticipated total fee. Any such agreement must be memorialized in writing. A notice under this paragraph will offer the requesting party an opportunity to discuss the matter in order to reformulate the request to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost.
            (iii) Amtrak will hold in abeyance for a reasonable amount of time requests requiring agreement to pay fees and will thereafter deem the request closed. This action will not prevent the requesting party from refiling the FOIA request with a fee commitment at a subsequent date.
            (2) Fees in excess of $250. When Amtrak estimates or determines that allowable charges are likely to exceed $250, an advance deposit of the entire fee may be required before continuing to process the request.
            (e) Information regarding fee category. In order to determine the appropriate fee category, a request should indicate whether the information sought is intended for commercial use or whether the requesting party is a member of an educational or noncommercial scientific institution or a representative of the news media.
            (f) Records concerning other individuals. If the request is for records concerning another individual, either of the following may be required in order to process the request:
            (1) A notarized written authorization signed by that individual permitting disclosure of those records to the requesting party, together with a copy of a photo ID of that individual; or
            (2) Proof that the individual is deceased (i.e., a copy of a death certificate or an obituary). A form of identification from the requesting party may also be required. Such records are also subject to any applicable FOIA exemptions.
          
          
            § 701.6
            Release and processing procedures.
            (a) General provisions. In determining records that are responsive to a request, Amtrak will ordinarily include only records that exist and are in the possession and control of the Corporation as of the date that the search is begun. If any other date is used, the requesting party will be informed of that date.
            (b) Authority to grant or deny requests. Amtrak's FOIA Officer is authorized to grant or deny any request for records.
            (c) Notice of referral. If Amtrak refers all or any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another organization, the requesting party will be notified. A referral shall not be considered a denial of access within the meaning of this part. All consultations and referrals of requests will be handled according to the date that the FOIA request was initially received.
            (d) Creating a record. There is no obligation on the part of Amtrak to create a record to satisfy a FOIA request. Amtrak may create a new record in its sole discretion, however, when doing so would result in a more useful response to the requesting party or would be less burdensome to Amtrak than providing existing records. The cost of creating such a record may not be charged to the requester unless the fee for creating the record is equal to or less than the fee that would be charged for providing the existing record.
            (e) Incomplete records. If the records requested are not complete at the time of a request, Amtrak may, at its discretion, inform the requester that complete nonexempt records will be provided when available without having to submit an additional request.
            (f) Electronic records. Amtrak is not obligated to process a request for electronic records where creation of a record, programming, or a particular format would result in a significant expenditure of resources or interfere with the corporation's operations.
          
          
            § 701.7
            Timing of responses to requests.
            (a) General. (1) The time limits prescribed in the FOIA will begin only after the requirements for submitting a request as established in § 701.5 have been met, and the request is deemed received by the FOIA Office.
            (2) A request for records shall be considered to have been received on the later of the following dates:
            (i) The requester has agreed in writing to pay applicable fees in accordance with § 701.5(d); or
            (ii) The fees have been waived in accordance with § 701.11(k); or
            (iii) Payment in advance has been received from the requester when required in accordance with § 701.11(i).
            (3) The time for responding to requests set forth in paragraph (b) of this section may be delayed if:
            (i) The request does not sufficiently identify the fee category applicable to the request;
            (ii) The request does not state a willingness to pay all fees;
            (iii) A request seeking a fee waiver does not address the criteria for fee waivers set forth in § 701.11(k);
            (iv) A fee waiver request is denied, and the request does not include an alternative statement indicating that the requesting party is willing to pay all fees.
            (b) Initial determination. Whenever possible, an initial determination to release or deny a record shall be made within twenty business days after receipt of the request. In “unusual circumstances” as described in paragraph (d) of this section, the time for an initial determination may be extended for ten business days.
            (c) Multitrack processing. (1) Amtrak may use two or more processing tracks by distinguishing between simple, complex, and expedited requests based on the amount of work and/or time needed to process a request or the number of pages involved.
            (2) In general, when requests are received, Amtrak's FOIA Office will review and categorize them for tracking purposes. Requests within each track will be processed according to date of receipt.
            (3) The FOIA Office may contact a requester when a request does not appear to qualify for fast track processing to provide an opportunity to limit the scope of the request and qualify for a faster track. Such notification shall be at the discretion of the FOIA Office and will depend largely on whether it is believed that a narrowing of the request could place the request on a faster track.
            (d) Unusual circumstances. (1) The requesting party shall be notified in writing if the time limits for processing a request cannot be met because of unusual circumstances, and it will be necessary to extend the time limits for processing the request. The notification shall set forth the unusual circumstances for such extension and shall include the date by which the request can be expected to be completed. Where the extension is for more than ten business days, the requesting party will be afforded an opportunity to either modify the request so that it may be processed within the time limits or to arrange an alternative time period for processing the initial request or modified request. In such a case, the requesting party has the right to seek assistance from Amtrak's FOIA Public Liaison and to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS).
            (2) If Amtrak believes that multiple requests submitted by a requester or by a group of requesters acting in concert constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances and the requests involve clearly related matters, the requests may be aggregated. Multiple requests concerning unrelated matters may not be aggregated.
            (3) Unusual circumstances that may justify delay include:
            (i) The need to search for and collect the requested records from other facilities that are separate from Amtrak's headquarters offices.
            (ii) The need to search for, collect, and examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records sought in a single request.

            (iii) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with agencies having a substantial interest in the determination of the request, or among two or more Amtrak components having a substantial subject-matter interest in the request.
            (e) Exceptional circumstances. If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist, as defined by the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limits shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.
            (f) Expedited processing. (1) Requests and appeals may be taken out of order and given expedited treatment whenever it is determined that they involve a compelling need, which means:
            (i) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; and
            (ii) An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Amtrak activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information.
            (2) A request for expedited processing may be made at the time of the initial request for records or at a later date.
            (3) A requester seeking expedited processing must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct to the best of that person's knowledge and belief, explaining in detail the basis for requesting expedited processing. This statement must accompany the request in order to be considered and responded to within the ten calendar days required for decisions on expedited access.
            (4) A requester who is not a full-time member of the news media must establish that he is a person whose main professional activity or occupation is information dissemination, though it need not be his sole occupation. A requester must establish a particular urgency to inform the public about the Amtrak activity involved in the request.
            (5) Within ten business days of receipt of a request for expedited processing, Amtrak shall determine whether to grant such a request and notify the requester of the decision. If a request for expedited treatment is granted, the request shall be given priority and shall be processed as soon as practicable.
            (6) Amtrak shall provide prompt consideration of appeals of decisions denying expedited processing.
          
          
            § 701.8
            Responses to requests.
            (a) Granting of requests. When an initial determination is made to grant a request in whole or in part, the requesting party shall be notified in writing and advised of any fees charged under § 701.11(e). The records shall be disclosed to the requesting party promptly upon payment of applicable fees. The requesting party has the right to seek assistance from Amtrak's FOIA Public Liaison.
            (b) Adverse determination of requests—(1) Types of denials. The requesting party shall be notified in writing of a determination to deny a request in any respect. Adverse determinations or denials of records consist of:
            (i) A determination to withhold any requested record in whole or in part;
            (ii) A determination that a requested record does not exist or cannot be located;
            (iii) A denial of a request for expedited treatment; and
            (iv) A determination on any disputed fee matter including a denial of a request for a fee waiver.
            (2) Deletions. Records disclosed in part shall be marked clearly to show both the amount of the information deleted and the exemption under which the deletion was made unless doing so would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption. If technically feasible, the amount of the information deleted and the exemption under which the deletion is made shall be indicated at the place in the record where such deletion is made.
            (3) Content of denial letter. The denial letter shall be signed by the FOIA Officer or designee and shall include:
            (i) A brief statement of the reason(s) for the adverse determination including any FOIA exemptions applied in denying the request;

            (ii) An estimate of the volume of information withheld (number of pages or some other reasonable form of estimation). An estimate does not need to be provided if the volume is indicated through deletions on records disclosed in part, or if providing an estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption;
            (iii) A statement that an appeal may be filed under § 701.10 and a description of the requirements of that section and of the right of the requesting party to seek dispute resolution services from either Amtrak's FOIA Public Liaison or the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS); and
            (iv) The name and title or position of the person responsible for the denial.
          
          
            § 701.9
            Business information.
            (a) General. Business information held by Amtrak will be disclosed under the FOIA only under this section.
            (b) Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:
            (1) Business information means commercial or financial information held by Amtrak that may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4).
            (2) Submitter means any person or entity including partnerships; corporations; associations; and local, state, tribal, and foreign governments.
            (c) Designation of business information. A submitter of business information will use good faith efforts to designate, by appropriate markings, either at the time of submission or at a reasonable time thereafter, any portions of its submission that it considers to be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4. These designations will expire ten years after the date of the submission unless the submitter requests and provides justification for a longer designation period.
            (d) Notice to submitters. Amtrak shall provide a submitter with prompt written notice of an FOIA request or an appeal that seeks its business information when required under paragraph (e) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, in order to give the submitter an opportunity to object to disclosure of any specified portion of the information under paragraph (f). The notice shall either describe the business information requested or include copies of the requested records or portions of records containing the information.
            (e) When notice is required. Notice shall be given to a submitter when:
            (1) The information has been designated in good faith by the submitter as information considered protected from disclosure under Exemption 4; or
            (2) Amtrak has reason to believe that the information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4.
            (f) Opportunity to object to disclosure. Amtrak will allow a submitter a reasonable amount of time, as determined by Amtrak in its sole discretion, to respond to the notice described in paragraph (d) of this section.
            (1) A detailed written statement must be submitted to Amtrak if the submitter has any objection to disclosure. The statement must specify all grounds for withholding any specified portion of the information sought under the FOIA. In the case of Exemption 4, it must show why the information is a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential.
            (2) Unless otherwise specified, in the event that a submitter fails to respond within the time specified in the notice, the submitter may, in Amtrak's discretion, be considered to have no objection to disclosure of the information sought under the FOIA.
            (3) Information provided by a submitter in response to the notice may be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.
            (g) Notice of intent to disclose. Amtrak shall consider a submitter's objections and specific grounds for disclosure in making a determination whether to disclose the information. In any instance, when a decision is made to disclose information over the objection of a submitter, Amtrak shall give the submitter written notice which shall include:
            (1) A statement of the reason(s) why each of the submitter's objections to disclosure was not sustained;
            (2) A description of the information to be disclosed; and
            (3) A specified disclosure date, which shall be a reasonable time subsequent to the notice as determined by Amtrak in its sole discretion.
            (h) Exceptions to notice requirements. The notice requirements of this section shall not apply if:

            (1) Amtrak determines that the information should not be disclosed;
            
            (2) The information has been published or has been officially made available to the public;
            (3) Disclosure of the information is required by law (other than the FOIA);
            (4) The designation made by the submitter under paragraph (c) of this section appears obviously frivolous. In such a case, Amtrak shall, prior to a specified disclosure date, give the submitter written notice of the final decision to disclose the information; or
            (5) The information requested is not designated by the submitter as exempt from disclosure in accordance with this part, unless Amtrak has substantial reason to believe that disclosure of the information would result in competitive harm.
            (i) Notice of a FOIA lawsuit. Whenever a FOIA requester files a lawsuit seeking to compel disclosure of business information, Amtrak shall promptly notify the submitter.
            (j) Notice to requesters. (1) When Amtrak provides a submitter with notice and an opportunity to object to disclosure under paragraph (f) of this section, the FOIA Office shall also notify the requester(s).
            (2) When Amtrak notifies a submitter of its intent to disclose requested information under paragraph (g) of this section, Amtrak shall also notify the requester(s).
            (3) When a submitter files a lawsuit seeking to prevent the disclosure of business information, Amtrak shall notify the requester(s).
          
          
            § 701.10
            Appeals.
            (a) Appeals of adverse determinations. (1) The requesting party may appeal:
            (i) A decision to withhold any requested record in whole or in part;
            (ii) A determination that a requested record does not exist or cannot be located;
            (iii) A denial of a request for expedited treatment; or
            (iv) Any disputed fee matter or the denial of a request for a fee waiver.
            (2) The appeal must be addressed to the President and Chief Executive Officer, in care of the Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel; National Railroad Passenger Corporation; 60 Massachusetts Avenue NE., Washington, DC 20002.
            (3) The appeal must be in writing and specify the relevant facts and the basis for the appeal. The appeal letter and envelope should be marked prominently that it is a Freedom of Information Act or “FOIA” appeal to ensure that it is properly routed.
            (4) The appeal must be received by the President's Office within ninety days of the date of denial.
            (5) An appeal will not be acted upon if the request becomes a matter of FOIA litigation.
            (b) Responses to appeals. The decision on any appeal shall be made in writing.
            (1) A decision upholding an adverse determination in whole or in part shall contain a statement of the reason(s) for such action, including any FOIA exemption(s) applied. The requesting party shall also be advised of the provision for judicial review of the decision contained in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(B).
            (2) Engaging in dispute resolution services provided by OGIS. Mediation is a voluntary process. If Amtrak agrees to participate in the mediation services provided by OGIS, it will actively engage as a partner to the process in an attempt to resolve the dispute.
            (3) If the adverse determination is reversed or modified on appeal in whole or in part, the requesting party shall be notified, and the request shall be reprocessed in accordance with the decision.
            (c) When appeal is required. The requesting party generally must timely appeal any adverse determination prior to seeking judicial review.
          
          
            § 701.11
            Fees.
            (a) General. Amtrak shall charge for processing requests under the FOIA in accordance with this section. A fee of $38 per hour shall be charged for search and review. For information concerning other processing fees, refer to paragraph (e) of this section. Amtrak shall collect all applicable fees before releasing copies of requested records to the requesting party. Payment of fees shall be made by check or money order payable to the National Railroad Passenger Corporation.
            (b) Definitions. For purposes of this section:
            (1) Direct costs means those expenses actually incurred in searching for and reproducing (and, in the case of commercial use requests, reviewing) records to respond to a FOIA request. Direct costs include such costs as the salary of the employee performing the work (the basic rate of pay for the employee plus applicable benefits and the cost of operating reproduction equipment). Direct costs do not include overhead expenses such as the costs of space and heating or lighting of the facility.
            (2) Reproduction means the making of a copy of a record or the information contained in it in order to respond to a FOIA request. Copies can take the form of paper, microform, audiovisual materials, or electronic records (i.e., magnetic tape or disk) among others. Amtrak shall honor a requester's specified preference for the form or format of disclosure if the record is readily reproducible with reasonable effort in the requested form or format by the office responding to the request.
            (3) Review means the process of examining a record located in response to a request to determine whether one or more of the statutory exemptions of the FOIA apply. Processing any record for disclosure includes doing all that is necessary to redact the record and prepare it for release. Review time includes time spent considering formal objection to disclosure by a commercial submitter under § 701.9 but does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions. Review costs are recoverable even if a record ultimately is not disclosed.
            (4) Search means the process of looking for and retrieving records or information responsive to a request. It includes page-by-page or line-by-line identification of information within records and also includes reasonable efforts to locate and retrieve information from records maintained in electronic form or format.
            (c) Fee categories. There are four categories of FOIA requesters for fee purposes: “commercial use requesters,” “representatives of the news media,” “educational and non-commercial scientific institution requesters,” and “all other requesters.” The categories are defined in the following paragraphs (c)(1) through (5), and applicable fees, which are the same for two of the categories, will be assessed as specified in paragraph (d) of this section.
            (1) Commercial requesters. The term “commercial use” request refers to a request from or on behalf of a person who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers his commercial, trade, or profit interests, including furthering those interests through litigation. Amtrak shall determine, whenever reasonably possible, the use to which a requester will put the records sought by the request. When it appears that the requesting party will put the records to a commercial use, either because of the nature of the request itself or because Amtrak has reasonable cause to doubt the stated intended use, Amtrak shall provide the requesting party with an opportunity to submit further clarification. Where a requester does not explain the use or where explanation is insufficient, Amtrak may draw reasonable inferences from the requester's identity and charge accordingly.
            (2) Representative of the news media or news media requester refers to any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. In this paragraph, the term `news' means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news-media entities are television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large and publishers of periodicals (but only if such entities qualify as disseminators of `news') who make their products available for purchase by or subscription by or free distribution to the general public. These examples are not all-inclusive. Moreover, as methods of news delivery evolve (for example, the adoption of the electronic dissemination of newspapers through telecommunications services), such alternative media shall be considered to be news-media entities. A freelance journalist shall be regarded as working for a news-media entity if the journalist can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that entity, whether or not the journalist is actually employed by the entity. A publication contract would present a solid basis for such an expectation, but Amtrak may also consider the past publication record of the requester in making such a determination.
            (3) Educational institution refers to a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an institution of graduate higher education, an institution of professional education, or an institution of vocational education that operates a program of scholarly research. To be in this category, a requester must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for commercial use but to further scholarly research.
            (4) Noncommercial scientific institution refers to an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis, as that term is defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. To be in this category, the requesting party must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for commercial use but to further scientific research.
            (5) Other requesters refers to requesters who do not come under the purview of paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section.
            (d) Assessing fees. In responding to FOIA requests, Amtrak shall charge the following fees unless a waiver or a reduction in fees has been granted under paragraph (k) of this section:
            (1) “Commercial use” requesters: The full allowable direct costs for search, review, and duplication of records.
            (2) “Representatives of the news media” and “educational and non-commercial scientific institution” requesters: Duplication charges only, excluding charges for the first 100 pages.
            (3) “All other” requesters: The direct costs of search and duplication of records. The first 100 pages of duplication and the first two hours of search time shall be provided without charge.
            (e) Schedule of fees—(1) Manual searches. Personnel search time includes time expended in either manual searches for paper records, searches using indices, review of computer search results for relevant records, and personal computer system searches.
            (2) Computer searches. The direct costs of conducting a computer search will be charged. These direct costs will include the cost of operating a central processing unit for that portion of the operating time that is directly attributable to searching for responsive records as well as the costs of operator/programmer salary apportionable to the search.
            (3) Duplication fees. Duplication fees will be charged all requesters subject to limitations specified in paragraph (d) of this section. Amtrak shall charge 25 cents per page for a paper photocopy of a record. For copies produced by computer (such as tapes or printouts), Amtrak will charge the direct costs, including the operator time in producing the copy. For other forms of duplication, Amtrak will charge the direct costs of that duplication.
            (4) Review fees. Review fees will be assessed for commercial use requests. Such fees will be assessed for review conducted in making an initial determination, or upon appeal, when review is conducted to determine whether an exemption not previously considered is applicable.
            (5) Charges for other services. The actual cost or amount shall be charged for all other types of output, production, and duplication (e.g., photographs, maps, or printed materials). Determinations of actual cost shall include the commercial cost of the media, the personnel time expended in making the item available for release, and an allocated cost for the equipment used in producing the item. The requesting party will be charged actual production costs when a commercial service is required. Items published and available through Amtrak will be made available at the publication price.
            (6) Charges for special services. Apart from the other provisions of this section, when Amtrak chooses as a matter of discretion to provide a special service such as sending records by other than ordinary mail, the direct costs of providing such services shall be charged.
            
            (f) Commitment to pay fees. When Amtrak determines or estimates that applicable fees will likely exceed $25.00, the requesting party will be notified of the actual or estimated amount unless a written statement has been received indicating a willingness to pay all fees. To protect requesters from large and/or unexpected fees, Amtrak will request a specific commitment when it is estimated or determined that fees will exceed $100.00. See § 701.5(d) for additional information.
            (g) Restrictions in accessing fees—(1) General. Fees for search and review will not be charged for a quarter-hour period unless more than half of that period is required.
            (2) Minimum fee. No fees will be charged if the cost of collecting the fee is equal to or greater than the fee itself. That cost includes the costs to Amtrak for billing, receiving, recording, and processing the fee for deposit, which has been deemed to be $10.00.
            (3) Computer searches. With the exception of requesters seeking documents for commercial use, Amtrak shall not charge fees for a computer search until the cost of search equals the equivalent dollar amount of two hours of the salary of the operator performing the search.
            (4) Unusual circumstances. If Amtrak has determined that unusual circumstances (as defined in the FOIA) apply and Amtrak has provided timely written notice to the requester in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B), Amtrak may assess search or duplication fees, as applicable, for an additional 10 days. If Amtrak fails to comply with the extended time limit, no search fees (or, in the case of requesters described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, no duplication fees) may be charged unless more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, timely written notice has been sent out, and Amtrak has discussed with the requesting party via written mail, email, or telephone (or made not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requesting party could effectively limit the scope of the request.
            (h) Nonproductive searches. Amtrak may charge for time spent for search and review even if responsive records are not located or if the records located are determined to be entirely exempt from disclosure.
            (i) Advance payments. (1) When Amtrak estimates or determines that charges are likely to exceed $250, an advance payment of the entire fee may be required before continuing to process the request.
            (2) Where a requester has previously failed to pay a properly charged FOIA fee within thirty (30) days of the date of billing, Amtrak may require the full amount due plus applicable interest and an advance payment of the full amount of anticipated fees before beginning to process a new request or continuing to process a pending request. The time limits of the FOIA will begin only after Amtrak has received such payment.
            (3) Amtrak will hold in abeyance for thirty days requests where deposits are due.
            (4) Monies owed for work already completed (i.e., before copies are sent to a requester) shall not be considered an advance payment.
            (5) Amtrak shall not deem a request as being received in cases in which an advance deposit or payment is due, and further work will not be done until the required payment is received.
            (j) Charging interest. Amtrak may charge interest on any unpaid bill for processing charges starting on the 31st day following the date of billing the requester. Interest charges will be assessed at the rate that Amtrak pays for short-term borrowing.
            (k) Waiver or reduction of fees—(1) Automatic waiver of fees. When the costs for a FOIA request total $10.00 or less, fees shall be waived automatically for all requesters regardless of category.
            (2) Other fee waivers. Decisions to waive or reduce fees that exceed the automatic waiver threshold shall be made on a case-by-case basis. Records responsive to a request will be furnished without charge or at below the established charge where Amtrak determines, based on all available information, that disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because:

            (i) It is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of Amtrak, and
            
            (ii) It is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requesting party.
            (3) To determine whether the fee waiver requirement in paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section is met, Amtrak will consider the following factors:
            (i) The subject of the request—whether the subject of the requested records concerns the operations or activities of Amtrak. The subject of the requested records must concern identifiable operations or activities of Amtrak with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated.
            (ii) The informative value of the information to be disclosed—whether the disclosure is likely to contribute to an understanding of Amtrak operations or activities. The disclosable portions of the requested records must be meaningfully informative about Amtrak's operations or activities in order to be found to be likely to contribute to an increased public understanding of those operations or activities. The disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in either a duplicative or a substantially identical form, would not be as likely to contribute to such understanding where nothing new would be added to the public's understanding.
            (iii) The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the public likely to result from disclosure—whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to public understanding. The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's ability and expertise in the subject area as well as the requester's intention to effectively convey information to the public shall be considered. It shall be presumed that a representative of the news media will satisfy this consideration.
            (iv) The significance of the contribution to public understanding—whether the disclosure is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of Amtrak operations or activities. The public's understanding of the subject in question, as compared to the level of public understanding existing prior to the disclosure, must be enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent.
            (4) To determine whether the fee waiver requirement in paragraph (k)(2)(ii) of this section is met, Amtrak will consider the following factors:
            (i) The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest—whether the requesting party has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. Amtrak shall consider any commercial interest of the requesting party (with reference to the definition of “commercial use” in paragraph (c)(1) of this section) or any person on whose behalf the requesting party may be acting that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. Requesters shall be given an opportunity to provide explanatory information regarding this consideration.
            (ii) The primary interest in disclosure—whether the magnitude of the identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently large in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is “primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.” A fee waiver or reduction is justified where the public interest standard is satisfied and public interest is greater in magnitude than any identified commercial interest in disclosure.
            (5) Requests for a fee waiver will be considered on a case-by-case basis, based upon the merits of the information provided. Where it is difficult to determine whether the request is commercial in nature, Amtrak may draw inference from the requester's identity and the circumstances of the request.
            (6) Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees must address the factors listed in paragraphs (k)(3) and (4) of this section. In all cases, the burden shall be on the requesting party to present evidence of information in support of a request for a waiver of fees.
            (l) Aggregating requests. A requester may not file multiple requests at the same time in order to avoid payment of fees. Where Amtrak reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requesters acting in concert is attempting to divide a request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding fees, Amtrak may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly. Amtrak may presume that multiple requests of this type made within a thirty-day period have been made in order to avoid fees. Where requests are separated by a longer period, Amtrak may aggregate them only when there exists a reasonable basis for determining that aggregation is warranted in view of all the circumstances involved. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters may not be aggregated.
          
          
            § 701.12
            Other rights and services.
            Nothing in this part shall be construed as entitling any person, as of right, to any service or the disclosure of any record to which such person is not entitled under the FOIA.

              § 800.34
              Contents of notices of proposed rulemaking.

              (a) Each notice of proposed rulemaking is published in the Federal Register.
              (b) Each notice includes:
              (1) A statement of the time, place, and nature of the proposed rulemaking proceeding;

              § 800.35
              Participation of interested persons.

              (a) Any interested person may participate in a rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments,information, views or arguments.

              § 800.36
              Petitions for extension of time to comment.

              A petition for extension of the time to submit comments must be received not later than 10 days before the end of the comment period stated in the notice. The petition must be submitted to: General Counsel, National Transportation Safety Board, 490 L'Enfant Plaza SW., Washington, DC 20594-2003. The filing of the petition does not automatically extend the time for petitioner's comments. Such a petition is granted only if the petitioner shows good cause for the extension, and if the extension is consistent with the public interest. If an extension is granted, it is granted to all persons, and the NTSB will publish a notice of the extension of the comment period in the Federal Register.
            
            
              § 800.37
              Contents of written comments.
              All written comments shall be in English. Unless otherwise specified in a notice requesting comments, comments may not exceed 15 pages in length, but necessary attachments may be appended to the submission without regard to the 15-page limit. Any commenter shall submit as a part of his or her written comments all material he or she considers relevant to any statement of fact made in the comment. Commenters should avoid incorporation by reference. However, if incorporation by reference is necessary, the incorporated material shall be identified with respect to document and page. The NTSB may reject comments if they are frivolous, abusive, or repetitious. The NTSB may also reject comments filed electronically if the commenter does not adhere to the electronic filing instructions at the Federal Docket Management System Web site.
            
            
              § 800.38
              Consideration of comments received.
              All timely comments are considered before final action is taken on a rulemaking proposal. Late filed comments may be considered to the extent practicable.
            
            
              § 800.39
              Additional rulemaking proceedings.
              The NTSB may initiate any further rulemaking proceedings it finds necessary or desirable. For example, interested persons may be invited to make oral arguments, to participate in conferences between the Board or a representative of the Board and interested persons at which minutes of the conference are kept, to appear at informal hearings presided over by officials designated by the Board, at which a transcript or minutes are kept, or participate in any other proceeding to assure informed administrative action and to protect the public interest.
            
            
              § 800.40
              Hearings.
              (a) Sections 556 and 557 of title 5, United States Code, do not apply to hearings held under this part. Unless otherwise specified, hearings held under this part are informal, fact-finding proceedings, at which there are no formal pleadings or adverse parties. Any rule issued in a case in which an informal hearing is held is not necessarily based exclusively on the record of the hearing.
              (b) The NTSB designates a representative to conduct any hearing held under this part. The General Counsel or a designated member of his or her staff may serve as legal officer at the hearing.
            
            
              § 800.41
              Adoption of final rules.

              Final rules are prepared by representatives of the office concerned and the Office of the General Counsel. The rule is then submitted to the Board for its consideration. If the Board adopts the rule, it is published in the Federal Register.
            
            
              § 800.42
              Petitions for rulemaking.
              (a) Any interested person may petition the Chairman to establish, amend, or repeal a rule.
              (b) Each petition filed under this section must:

              (1) Be submitted in duplicate to the Chairman, National Transportation Safety Board, 490 L'Enfant Plaza SW., Washington, DC 20594-0003;
              (2) Set forth the text or substance of the rule or amendment proposed, or specify the rule the petitioner seeks to have repealed, as the case may be;
              (3) Explain the interest of the petitioner in the action requested; and
              (4) Contain any information and arguments available to the petitioner to support the action sought.
            
            
              § 800.43
              Processing of petition.
              (a) Unless the NTSB otherwise specifies, no public hearing, argument, or other proceeding is held directly on a petition before its disposition under this section.
              (b) Grants. If the agency determines the petition contains adequate justification, it initiates rule making action this subpart.
              (c) Denials. If the agency determines the petition does not justify rulemaking, it denies the petition.
              (d) Notification. Whenever the agency determines a petition should be granted or denied, the Office of the General Counsel prepares a notice of the grant or denial for issuance to the petitioner, and the agency issues it to the petitioner.
            
            
              § 800.44
              Direct final rulemaking procedures.

              A direct final rule makes regulatory changes and states those changes will take effect on a specified date unless the NTSB receives an adverse comment or notice of intent to file an adverse comment by the date specified in the direct final rule published in the Federal Register.
              (a) Types of actions appropriate for direct final rulemaking. Rules the Board determines to be non-controversial and unlikely to result in adverse public comments may be published in the final rule section of the Federal Register as direct final rules. These include non-controversial rules that:
              (1) Make non-substantive clarifications or corrections to existing rules;
              (2) Incorporate by reference the latest or otherwise updated versions of technical or industry standards;
              (3) Affect internal NTSB procedures;
              (4) Update existing forms; and
              (5) Make minor changes to rules regarding statistics and reporting requirements, such as a change in reporting period (for example, from quarterly to annually) or eliminating a type of data collection no longer necessary.
              (b) Adverse comment. An adverse comment is a comment the NTSB judges to be critical of the rule, to suggest the rule should not be adopted, or to suggest a change should be made to the rule. Under the direct final rule process, the NTSB does not consider the following types of comments to be adverse:
              (1) Comments recommending another rule change, unless the commenter states the direct final rule will be ineffective without the change;
              (2) Comments outside the scope of the rule and comments suggesting the rule's policy or requirements should or should not be extended to other topics outside the scope of the rule;
              (3) Comments in support of the rule; or
              (4) Comments requesting clarification.
              (c) Confirmation of effective date. The NTSB will publish a confirmation rule document in the Federal Register if it has not received an adverse comment or notice of intent to file an adverse comment by the date specified in the direct final rule. The confirmation rule document informs the public of the effective date of the rule.
              (d) Withdrawal of a direct final rule. (1) If the NTSB receives an adverse comment or a notice of intent to file an adverse comment within the comment period, it will publish a rule document in the Federal Register, before the effective date of the direct final rule, advising the public and withdrawing the direct final rule.
              (2) If the NTSB withdraws a direct final rule because of an adverse comment, the NTSB may issue a notice of proposed rulemaking if it decides to pursue the rulemaking.
            
            
              § 800.45
              Interim rulemaking procedures.

              (a) An interim rule may be issued when it is in the public interest to promulgate an effective rule while keeping the rulemaking open for further refinement. For example, an interim rule may be issued in instances when normal procedures for notice and comment prior to issuing an effective rule are not required, minor changes to the final rule may be necessary after the interim rule has been in place for some time, or the interim rule only implements portions of a proposed rule, while other portions of the proposed rule are still under development.
              (b) An interim rule will be published in the Federal Register with an effective date on or after the date of publication. After the effective date, an interim rule is enforceable and is codified in the next annual revision of the Code of Federal Regulations.
            
            
              Pt. 801
              Appendix to Part 800—Request to the Secretary of the Department of Transportation To Investigate Certain Aircraft Accidents
              (a) Acting pursuant to the authority vested in it by Title VII of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (49 U.S.C. 1441) and section 304(a)(1) of the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974, the National Transportation Safety Board (Board) hereby requests the Secretary of the Department of Transportation (Secretary) to exercise his authority subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of Title VII and section 304(a)(1) of the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974, and as set forth below to investigate the facts, conditions, and circumstances surrounding certain fixed-wing and rotorcraft aircraft accidents and to submit a report to the Board from which the Board may make a determination of the probable cause.
              (b) The authority to be exercised hereunder shall include the investigation of all civil aircraft accidents involving rotorcraft, aerial application, amateur-built aircraft, restricted category aircraft, and all fixed-wing aircraft which have a certificated maximum gross takeoff weight of 12,500 pounds or less except:
              (1) Accidents in which fatal injuries have occurred to an occupant of such aircraft, but shall include accidents involving fatalities incurred as a result of aerial application operations, amateur-built aircraft operations, or restricted category aircraft operations.
              (2) Accidents involving aircraft operated in accordance with the provisions of Part 135 of the Federal Air Regulations entitled “Air Taxi Operators and Commercial Operators of Small Aircraft.”
              (3) Accidents involving aircraft operated by an air carrier authorized by certificate of public convenience and necessity to engage in air transportation.
              (4) Accidents involving midair collisions.
              (c) Provided, That the Board may, through the chiefs of its field offices, or their designees who receive the initial notifications, advise the Secretary, through his appropriate designee, that the Board will assume the full responsibility for the investigation of an accident included in this request in the same manner as an accident not so included; and Provided further, That the Board, through the chiefs of its field offices, or their designees who receive initial notifications may request the Secretary, through his appropriate designee, to investigate an accident not included in this request, which would normally be investigated by the Board under section (b) (1) through (4) above, and in the same manner as an accident so included.
              (d) Provided, That this authority shall not be construed to authorize the Secretary to hold public hearings or to determine the probable cause of the accident; and Provided further, That the Secretary will report to the Board in a form acceptable to the Board the facts, conditions, and circumstances surrounding each accident from which the Board may determine the probable cause.
              (e) And provided further, That this request includes authority to conduct autopsies and such other tests of the remains of deceased persons aboard the aircraft at the time of the accident, who die as a result of the accident, necessary to the investigations requested hereunder and such authority may be delegated and redelegated to any official or employee of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). For the purpose of this provision, designated aviation examiners are not deemed to be officials or employees of the FAA.
              (f) Invoking the provisions of section 701(f) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, and section 304(a)(1) of the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974, is necessary inasmuch as sufficient funds have not been made available to the Board to provide adequate facilities and personnel to investigate all accidents involving civil aircraft. This request, therefore, is considered to be temporary in nature and may be modified or terminated by written notice to the Secretary.

              § 801.1
              Applicability.
              (a) This part contains the rules that the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) follows in processing requests for records under the Freedom of Information Act, as amended (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552. These rules should be read together with the FOIA, which provides additional information about public access to records maintained by the NTSB.
              (b) This part also provides for document services and the fees for such services, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 9701.
              (c) This part applies only to records existing when the request for the information is made. The NTSB is not required to create records for the sole purpose of responding to a FOIA request.
              (d) Subpart F of this part describes records that are exempt from public disclosure.
            
            
              § 801.2
              Presumption of openness.
              (a) In implementing the FOIA, it is the policy of the NTSB to make information available to the public to the greatest extent possible, consistent with the mission of the NTSB. The NTSB will withhold records under the FOIA only when the NTSB reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by a FOIA exemption or is prohibited by law. Whenever the NTSB determines that full disclosure of a requested record is not possible, the NTSB will consider whether partial disclosure is possible and will take reasonable steps to segregate and release nonexempt material. Information the NTSB routinely provides to the public as part of a regular NTSB activity (such as press releases and information disclosed on the NTSB's public Website) may be provided to the public without compliance with this part.
              (b) The NTSB will release on its website a “public docket” containing documentation that the agency deemed pertinent to the investigation. Requesters may access these public dockets without submitting a FOIA request. The NTSB encourages all requesters to review the public docket materials before submitting a FOIA request.
            
            
              § 801.3
              Definitions.
              The following definitions apply in this part:
              
                Chairman means the Chairman or Acting Chairman of the NTSB.
              
                FOIA Public Liaison means a supervisory official, designated by the Chief FOIA Officer, who is responsible for assisting in reducing delays, increasing transparency and understanding of the status of requests, and assisting in resolving disputes.
              
                Managing Director means the Managing Director of the NTSB.
              
                Non-docket items include records from an accident that are not directly pertinent to the investigation, and are not in the public docket.
              
                Public Docket includes a collection of records from an accident investigation that the agency deemed pertinent to the investigation.
              
                Record, document, or any other term used to reference information includes:
              (1) Any writing, drawing, map, recording, tape, film, photo, or other documentary material by which information is preserved. In this part, “document” and “record” have the same meaning;
              (2) Any information that would be an agency record subject to the requirements of this section when maintained by the NTSB in any format, including an electronic format; and
              (3) Any information described under subparagraphs (1) or (2) that is maintained for the NTSB by an entity under Government contract, for the purposes of records management.
              
                Redact refers to the act of making a portion of text illegible by placing a black mark on top of the text.
              
                Requester means any person, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 551(2), who submits a request pursuant to the FOIA.

              § 801.10
              General.
              (a) The NTSB's Chief FOIA Officer provides high level oversight and support to NTSB's FOIA programs, and recommends adjustments to agency practices, personnel, and funding as may be necessary to improve FOIA administration. The Chief FOIA Officer is responsible for the initial determination of whether to release records within the 20-working-day time limit, or the extension, specified in the Freedom of Information Act. The Chief FOIA Officer is also responsible for designating one or more FOIA Public Liaisons.
              (b) The NTSB's Chief, Records Management Division:
              (1) Is responsible for the custody and control of all NTSB records required to be preserved under the Federal Records Act, 44 U.S.C. Chapters 21, 29, 31, and 33.

              (3) Maintains a public access link on the NTSB's FOIA Website for requesters to electronically submit a FOIA request and track the status of the request.
              (c) The NTSB maintains in its electronic reading room and makes available for public inspection in its public reference room:
              (1) Records that have been provided pursuant to a FOIA request, and
              (i) Have been requested at least three times or
              (ii) Are likely to be the subject of repeat requests.
              (2) A general index of the records in paragraph (c)(1) of this section;
              (3) Final opinions, including concurring and dissenting opinions, as well as orders, made in the adjudication of appeals under parts 821 and 825 of this chapter.

              (4) Statements of policy and interpretations which have been adopted by the agency and are not published in the Federal Register;
              (5) Administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect a member of the public;
              (6)(i) The annual report submitted to the Attorney General and the Office of Government Information Services in the National Archives and Records Administration (OGIS), under 5 U.S.C. 552(e)(1); and
              (ii) The raw statistical data used in the annual report in an aggregate, searchable, and downloadable format, provided without charge, license, or registration requirement;

              (7) A guide for requesting records or information from the NTSB that includes an index of the agency's major information systems, major information and record locator systems, concise descriptions of FOIA exemptions, and general categories of NTSB records to which the exemptions apply; and
              (8) A record of the votes of each Member in NTSB proceedings.
              (d) FOIA requests for records or information not publicly available on the NTSB Website may be submitted electronically by email or through the public access link, or in writing to: National Transportation Safety Board, Attention: FOIA Requester Service Center, CIO-40, 490 L'Enfant Plaza SW, Washington, DC 20594-003. All requests must reasonably identify the record requested and contain the name, address, email address, and telephone number of the person making the request. A requester must inform the NTSB of changes to the requester's contact information. Requests mailed to the NTSB must prominently display the letters “FOIA” to distinguish the FOIA request from other types of document requests. For requests regarding an investigation of a particular accident, requesters should include the date and location of the accident, as well as the NTSB investigation number.
              (e) In response to broad requests for records regarding a particular investigation, the FOIA Office will notify the requester that a public docket has been or will be opened for the investigation, and attempt to clarify whether the information in the docket satisfies the request.
              (f) The NTSB will not release records originally generated by other agencies or entities. Instead, the NTSB will refer such requests for other agencies' records to the appropriate agency, which will make a release determination upon receiving and processing the referred request.
              (g) Where a requester seeks a record on behalf of another person, and the record contains that person's personal information protected by 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(6) and § 801.56, the personal information will not be provided to the requester unless the requester submits a notarized statement of consent from the person whose personal information is contained in the record.
              (h) In general, the NTSB will deny requests for records concerning a pending investigation, pursuant to appropriate exemptions under the FOIA. The FOIA Office will notify the requester of this denial in accordance with § 801.21(b), and provide the requester additional information regarding how the requester may receive information on the investigation once the investigation is complete.
            
            
              § 801.11
              Segregability of records.
              The initial decision of the FOIA Officer will include a determination of segregability. If it is reasonable to do so, the exempt portions of a record will be segregated and, where necessary, redacted, and the nonexempt portions will be sent to the requester.
            
            
              § 801.12
              Protection of records.
              No person may, without permission, remove from the place where it is made available any record made available for inspection or copying under § 801.10(c). Removing, concealing, altering, mutilating, obliterating, or destroying, in whole or in part, such a record is deemed a criminal offense pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 641, 2071(a).
            
          
          
            Subpart C—Time Limits
            
              § 801.20
              Processing of requests.
              (a) Multi-track processing. The FOIA Office processes FOIA requests in one of three tracks:
              (1) Track 1: Requests that meet the criteria for expedited processing, or requests that seek records that have been produced in response to a prior request.
              (2) Track 2: Requests that do not involve voluminous records or lengthy consultations with other entities.
              (3) Track 3: Requests that involve voluminous records and for which lengthy or numerous consultations are required, or those requests which may involve sensitive records.
              (b) Expedited processing. (1) A requester may submit a statement demonstrating with reasonable particularity that the requester has a compelling need for expedited processing in Track 1. The requester must certify that the statement is true and correct to the best of the requester's knowledge. Within 10 calendar days after receipt of the statement, the FOIA Office will inform the requester whether the request qualifies for expedited processing, and if not, provide the requester with the information in § 801.21(b).
              
              (2) In this section, “compelling need” means:
              (i) That a failure to expedite the request could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or
              (ii) With respect to a request made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information, urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity.
              (3) The requester may appeal the FOIA Office's decision regarding expedited processing to the Managing Director within 90 calendar days. The Managing Director will decide the appeal on an expedited basis, and no later than 20 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after receipt of the appeal. The final determination will notify the requester of the statutory right to seek judicial review of the determination pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(E)(iii), and will inform the requester of the dispute resolution services offered by OGIS.
            
            
              § 801.21
              Initial determination.
              (a) The NTSB FOIA Officer will make an initial determination as to whether to comply with the request within 20 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the request is received.
              (b) Upon the FOIA Office's receipt of a FOIA request, the time limit is tolled while the FOIA Office seeks reasonable information from the requester:
              (1) About the scope of the request, such as whether docket items and other publicly available information on the NTSB website satisfy the request; and
              (2) Necessary to resolve fee assessment issues.
              (c) If unusual circumstances exist, this time limit may be extended up to 10 additional days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) in accordance with § 801.23. The requester will be notified immediately of an extension in accordance with § 801.23. If a determination is made to release the requested record(s), such record(s) will be made available promptly.
              (d) If the FOIA Officer determines not to release the record(s), the FOIA Office will notify the requester of:
              (1) The reason for the determination;
              (2) The right to appeal the determination to the Managing Director within 90 calendar days;
              (3) The name and title or positions of each person responsible for the denial of the request;
              (4) The right to seek dispute resolution services from the NTSB's FOIA Public Liaison or OGIS.
            
            
              § 801.22
              Final determination.
              Requesters seeking an appeal of the FOIA Officer's initial determination must send a written appeal to the NTSB's Managing Director within 90 calendar days. The NTSB's Managing Director will determine whether to grant or deny any appeal within 20 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after receipt of such appeal, except that this time limit may be extended by as many as 10 additional days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays), in accordance with § 801.23. The final determination will notify the requester of the statutory right to seek judicial review of the determination pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(B), and will inform the requester of the dispute resolution services offered by OGIS.
            
            
              § 801.23
              Extension.
              (a) In unusual circumstances as specified in this section, the time limits prescribed in either § 801.21 or § 801.22 may be extended by no more than 10 days (excluding Saturdays, Sunday, and legal public holidays) by providing written notice to the requester setting forth the reasons for the extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be dispatched.
              (b) If the request cannot be processed within the extended time limit specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the requester will be:
              (1) Notified in writing;
              (2) Given an opportunity to limit the scope of the request so that it may be processed within that time limit, or an opportunity to arrange with the agency an alternative time frame for processing the request or a modified request; and

              (3) Advised of the requester's right to seek assistance from the NTSB's FOIA Public Liaison and seek dispute resolution services from OGIS.
              (c) As used in this paragraph (c), “unusual circumstances,” as they relate to any delay that is reasonably necessary to the proper processing of the particular request, means:
              (1) The need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the office processing the request;
              (2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine and process a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are the subject of a single request; or
              (3) The need to consult with another agency that has a substantial interest in the disposition of the request or with two or more components of the agency having substantial subject-matter interest therein.
            
          
          
            Subpart D—Accident Investigation Records
            
              § 801.30
              Records from accident investigations.
              Upon completion of an accident investigation, the NTSB will compile a public docket containing investigators' factual reports, and documents and exhibits that the agency deemed pertinent to the investigation. The Chief, Records Management Division, will then make the docket available on the NTSB Website and available for public inspection and copying in the NTSB's public reference room.
            
            
              § 801.31
              Public hearings regarding investigations.
              Within approximately four (4) weeks after a public investigative hearing conducted in accordance with part 845, subpart A, of this chapter, the Chief, Records Management Division, will make the hearing transcript available in the electronic reading room and the public reference room. On or before the date of the hearing, the Chief, Records Management Division, will make the exhibits introduced at the hearing available on the NTSB Website and available for public inspection and copying in the NTSB's public reference room.
            
            
              § 801.32
              Accident reports.
              (a) The NTSB will report the facts, conditions, circumstances, and its determination of the probable causes of U.S. civil transportation accidents, in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 1131(e).
              (b) These reports will be made available on the NTSB Website and available for public inspection and copying in the NTSB's public reference room.
            
          
          
            Subpart E—Other Agency Documents

Interested parties may purchase the report from the U.S. Government Publishing Office or review it in the NTSB's public reference room. All other reports or comments to Congress will be available in the NTSB's electronic reading room and in its public reference room for inspection or by ordering a copy after issuance.
            
          
          
            Subpart F—Exemption From Public Disclosure
            
              § 801.50
              Exemptions from disclosure.
              Title 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and (b) exempt certain records from public disclosure. Examples of records given in this subpart included within a particular statutory exemption are not necessarily illustrative of all types of records covered by the applicable exemption.
            
            
              § 801.51
              National defense and foreign policy secrets.

              Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1), national defense and foreign policy secrets established by Executive Order, as well as properly classified documents, are exempt from public disclosure. Requests to the NTSB for such records will be transferred to the source agency as appropriate, where such classified records are identified. (See, e.g., Executive Order 12,958, as amended on March 25, 2003.)
            
            
              § 801.52
              Internal personnel rules and practices of the NTSB.
              Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(2), the following records are exempt from disclosure under FOIA:
              (a) Records relating solely to internal personnel rules and practices, including memoranda pertaining to personnel matters such as staffing policies, and procedures for the hiring, training, promotion, demotion, or discharge of employees, and management plans, records, or proposals relating to labor-management relations.
              (b) Records regarding:
              (1) Internal matters of a relatively trivial nature that have no significant public interest, and
              (2) Predominantly internal matters, the release of which would risk circumvention of a statute or agency regulation.
            
            
              § 801.53
              Records exempt by statute from disclosure.
              Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(3), the NTSB will not disclose records specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than 5 U.S.C. 552(b)), provided that such statute:
              (a)(1) Requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or
              (2) Establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld; and
              (b) If enacted after the date of enactment of the Open FOIA Act of 2009, Public Law 111-83, Title V, section 564, 123 Stat. 2142, Oct. 28, 2009, specifically cites to 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(3).
            
            
              § 801.54
              Trade secrets and commercial or financial information.
              Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), trade secrets and items containing commercial or financial information that are obtained from a person and are privileged or confidential are exempt from public disclosure.
            
            
              § 801.55
              Interagency and intra-agency exchanges.
              (a) Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(5), any record prepared by an NTSB employee for internal Government use is exempt from public disclosure to the extent that it contains—
              (1) Opinions made in the course of developing official action by the NTSB but not actually made a part of that official action, or
              (2) Information concerning any pending NTSB proceeding, or similar matter, including any claim or other dispute to be resolved before a court of law, administrative board, hearing officer, or contracting officer.
              (b) The purpose of this section is to protect the full and frank exchange of ideas, views, and opinions necessary for the effective functioning of the NTSB. These resources must be fully and readily available to those officials upon whom the responsibility rests to take official NTSB action. Its purpose is also to protect against the premature disclosure of material that is in the developmental stage, if premature disclosure would be detrimental to the authorized and appropriate purposes for which the material is being used, or if, because of its tentative nature, the material is likely to be revised or modified before it is officially presented to the public.
              (c) Examples of materials covered by this section include, but are not limited to, staff papers containing advice, opinions, or suggestions preliminary to a decision or action; preliminary notes; advance information on such things as proposed plans to procure, lease, or otherwise hire and dispose of materials, real estate, or facilities; documents exchanged in preparation for anticipated legal proceedings; material intended for public release at a specified future time, if premature disclosure would be detrimental to orderly processes of the NTSB; records of inspections, investigations, and surveys pertaining to internal management of the NTSB; and matters that would not be routinely disclosed in litigation but which are likely to be the subject of litigation.
              (d) The deliberative process privilege does not apply to records created 25 years or more before the date on which the records were requested.
            
            
              
              § 801.56
              Unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.
              Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(6), any personal, medical, or similar file is exempt from public disclosure if its disclosure would harm the individual concerned or would be a clearly unwarranted invasion of the person's personal privacy.
            
            
              § 801.57
              Records compiled for law enforcement purposes.
              Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7), any records compiled for law or regulatory enforcement are exempt from public disclosure to the extent that disclosure would interfere with enforcement, would be an unwarranted invasion of privacy, would disclose the identity of a confidential source, would disclose investigative procedures and practices, or would endanger the life or security of law enforcement personnel.
            
            
              § 801.58
              Records for regulation of financial institutions.
              Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(8), records compiled for agencies regulating or supervising financial institutions are exempt from public disclosure.
            
            
              § 801.59
              Geological records.
              Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(9), records concerning geological wells are exempt from public disclosure.
            
          
          
            Subpart G—Fee Schedule
            
              § 801.60
              Fee schedule.
              (a) Authority. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(i) and the Office of Management and Budget's Uniform Freedom of Information Act Fee Schedule and Guidelines, 52 FR 10012, Mar. 27, 1987, the NTSB may charge certain fees for processing requests under the FOIA in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, except where fees are limited under paragraph (d) of this section, or where a waiver or reduction of fees is granted under paragraph (e) of this section. The NTSB does not require advance payment of any fee unless the requester has previously failed to pay fees in a timely fashion, or the NTSB determines that the fee will exceed $250.00. A requester must pay fees in accordance with the instructions provided on the invoice the FOIA Office sends to the requester.
              (b) Definitions. For purposes of this section:
              
                Commercial use request means a request from or on behalf of a person who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers his or her commercial, trade, or profit interests. This includes the furtherance of commercial interests through litigation. When it appears that the requester will use the requested records for a commercial purpose, either because of the nature of the request or because the NTSB has reasonable cause to doubt a requester's stated use, the NTSB will provide the requester with a reasonable opportunity to submit further clarification.
              
                Direct costs mean those expenses that an agency incurs in searching for, reviewing, and duplicating records in response to a FOIA request. This includes the salaries of NTSB employees performing the work, as listed below, but does not include overhead expenses such as the costs of office space.
              
                Duplication means the copying of a record, or of the information contained in a record, in response to a FOIA request. Copies can take the form of paper, audiovisual materials, or electronic records, among others.
              
                Educational institution means any school, or institution of vocational education that operates a program of scholarly research. In order for a requester to demonstrate that their request falls within the category of an “educational institution,” the requester must show that the request is authorized by the qualifying institution and that the requester does not seek the records for commercial use, but only to further scholarly research.
              
                Representative of the news media or news media requester means any person actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public. For “freelance” journalists to be regarded as working for a news organization, they must demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that organization (for example, a journalist may submit a copy of a publication contract for which the journalist needs NTSB records).
              
              
                Review means the examination of a record located in response to a request in order to determine whether any portion of it is exempt from disclosure. Review also includes processing the record(s) for disclosure, which includes redacting and otherwise preparing releasable records for disclosure. Review does not include time spent resolving legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions nor will the NTSB charge for review during the administrative appeal stage, if applicable. The NTSB may recover review costs even if the NTSB ultimately does not release the record(s).
              
                Search means the process of looking for and retrieving records or information within the scope of a request. Search includes page-by-page or line-by-line identification of information within records and also includes reasonable efforts to locate and retrieve electronic records. The NTSB will make an effort to conduct such searches in the least expensive manner.
              (c) Fees. In responding to FOIA requests, the NTSB will charge the following fees, subject to the limitations in paragraph (d) of this section, unless a waiver or reduction of fees has been granted under paragraph (e) of this section:
              (1) Search. (i) The NTSB will charge search fees except for a request from an educational institution, a noncommercial scientific institution, or a news media representative. The NTSB may charge for time spent searching even if the NTSB does not locate any responsive record or if the NTSB withholds the record(s) located because such record(s) are exempt from disclosure.
              (ii) In searching for and retrieving records, the NTSB will charge $4.00 for each quarter of an hour spent by administrative personnel, $7.00 for each quarter of an hour spent by professional personnel, and $10.25 for each quarter of an hour spent by management personnel.
              (2) Duplication. (i) The NTSB will charge duplication fees. The NTSB will honor a requester's preference for receiving a record in a particular format when the FOIA Office can readily reproduce it in the format requested.
              (ii) The NTSB will charge $0.10 per page for the duplication of a standard-size paper record. For other forms of duplication, the NTSB will charge the direct costs of the duplication.
              (iii) Where the NTSB certifies records upon request, the NTSB will charge the direct cost of certification.
              (3) Review. For a commercial use request, the NTSB will charge fees for the initial review of a record to determine whether the record falls within the scope of a request and whether the record is exempt from disclosure. The NTSB will not charge for subsequent review of the request and responsive record. For example, in general, the NTSB will not charge additional fees for review at the administrative appeal level when the NTSB has already applied an exemption. The NTSB will charge review fees at the same rate as those charged for a search under paragraph (c)(1)(ii).
              (d) Limitations on charging fees. (1) The NTSB will not charge fees if it fails to comply with the time limits in §§ 801.21 or 801.22, including an extension of time pursuant to § 801.23(a), except:
              (i) If the NTSB determines there are unusual circumstances, as defined by 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(iii) and § 801.23(c), and more than 5,000 pages are responsive to the request, the FOIA Office may charge fees if timely written notice of the unusual circumstances has been provided to the requester and the FOIA Office has discussed with the requestor (or made not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could limit the scope of the request.
              (ii) If a court determines there are exceptional circumstances, as defined by 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(C), a failure to comply with the time limits will be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.

              (2) The NTSB will not charge a fee for notices, decisions, orders, etc. provided to persons acting as parties in the investigation under the procedures set forth in part 831 of this chapter, or where required by law to be served on a party to any proceeding or matter before the NTSB. Likewise, the NTSB will not charge fees for requests made by family members of accident victims, when the NTSB has investigated the accident that is the subject of the FOIA request.
              (3) The NTSB will not charge a search fee or review fee for a quarter-hour period unless more than half of that period is required for search or review.
              (4) Except for requesters seeking records for commercial use, the NTSB will provide the following items without charge:
              (i) The first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent) of a record; and
              (ii) The first two hours of search (or the cost equivalent) for a record.
              (5) Whenever the total fee calculated under paragraph (c) of this section is $14.00 or less for any request, the NTSB will not charge a fee.
              (6) The NTSB will not charge fees for ordinary packaging and mailing costs.
              (7) When the FOIA Office determines or estimates that fees to be charged under this section will amount to more than $25.00, the Office will notify the requester of the actual or estimated amount of the fees, including a breakdown of the fees for the search, review or duplication, unless the requester has indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. If the FOIA Office is able to estimate only a portion of the expected fee, the FOIA Office will advise the requester that the estimated fee may be only a portion of the total fee. Where the FOIA Office notifies a requester that the actual or estimated fees will exceed $25.00, the NTSB will not expend additional agency resources on the request until the requester agrees in writing to pay the anticipated total fee. The NTSB does not accept payments in installments.
              (8) In circumstances involving a total fee that will exceed $250.00, or if the requester has previously failed to pay fees in a timely fashion, the NTSB may require the requester to make an advance payment or deposit of a specific amount before beginning to process the request. If the requester does not pay the advance payment within 30 calendar dates after the date of the FOIA Office's fee determination, the request will be closed.
              (9) The NTSB may charge interest on any unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the date of billing the requester. Interest charges will be assessed at the rate provided at 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the date of the billing until the NTSB receives payment. The NTSB will follow the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982, Public Law 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749, as amended, and its administrative procedures, including the use of consumer reporting agencies, collection agencies, and offset.
              (10) Where the NTSB reasonably believes that a requester or group of requesters acting together is attempting to divide a request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding fees, the NTSB may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly.
              (11) The NTSB will make the FOIA Public Liaison available to assist the requester in reformulating a request to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost.
              (e) Requirements for waiver or reduction of fees. (1) For fee purposes, the NTSB will determine, whenever reasonably possible, the use to which a requester will put the requested records. The NTSB will furnish records responsive to a request without charge, or at a reduced charge, where the NTSB determines, based on all available information, that the requester has shown that:
              (i) Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations of activities of the government; and
              (ii) Disclosure of the requested information is not primarily in the commercial interest or for the commercial use of the requester.
              (2) In determining whether disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest, the NTSB will consider the following factors:
              (i) Whether the subject of the requested records concerns identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government, with a connection that is direct and clear, and not remote or attenuated. In this regard, the NTSB will consider whether a requester's use of the documents would enhance transportation safety or contribute to the NTSB's programs.

              (ii) Whether the portions of a record subject to disclosure are meaningfully informative about government operations or activities. The disclosure of information already in the public domain, in either a duplicative or substantially identical form, would not be as likely to contribute to such understanding where nothing new would be added to the public's understanding.
              (iii) Whether disclosure of the requested information would contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. The NTSB will consider a requester's expertise in the subject area and ability to effectively convey information to the public.
              (iv) Whether the disclosure is likely to enhance the public's understanding of government operations or activities.
              (3) The NTSB's decision to designate the FOIA request as commercial will be made on a case-by-case basis based on the NTSB's review of the requester's intended use of the information. The NTSB will provide the requester with a reasonable opportunity to submit further clarification. In determining whether the request is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester, the NTSB will consider the following factors:
              (i) The existence and magnitude of any commercial interest the requester may have, or of any person on whose behalf the requester may be acting. The NTSB will provide requesters with an opportunity in the administrative process to submit explanatory information regarding this consideration.
              (ii) Whether the commercial interest is greater in magnitude than any public interest in disclosure.
              (4) Additionally, the NTSB may, at its discretion, waive search, duplication, and review fees for qualifying foreign countries, international organizations, nonprofit public safety entities, state and federal transportation agencies, and colleges and universities, after approval by the Chief, Records Management Division.
              (5) Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the requirements for a waiver of fees, the NTSB will grant a waiver for those particular records.
              (6) Requests for the waiver or reduction of fees should address the factors listed in paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section, insofar as they apply to each request. The NTSB will exercise its discretion to consider the cost-effectiveness of its use of administrative resources in determining whether to grant waivers or reductions of fees.
              (f) Services available free of charge. (1) The following documents are available without commercial reproduction cost until limited supplies are exhausted:
              (i) Press releases;
              (ii) NTSB regulations (Chapter VIII of Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations);
              (iii) Indexes to initial decisions, Board orders, opinion and orders, and staff manuals and instructions;
              (iv) Safety recommendations; and
              (v) NTSB Annual Reports.
              (2) The NTSB public Website, http://www.ntsb.gov, also includes an email subscription service for press releases, safety recommendations, and other announcements.
            
            
              § 801.61
              Appeals of fee determinations.
              Requesters seeking an appeal of the FOIA Office's fee or fee waiver determination must send a written appeal to the Managing Director within 90 calendar days. The Managing Director will determine whether to grant or deny any appeal made pursuant to § 801.21 within 20 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after receipt of such appeal, except that this time limit may be extended for as many as 10 additional days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays), in accordance with § 801.23.

              § 802.5
              Procedures for requests pertaining to individual records in a record system.
              The NTSB may not disclose any record to any person or other agency, except pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior written consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains, provided the record under the control of the NTSB is maintained in a system of records from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other particular assigned to such individual. Written consent is not required if the disclosure is:
              (a) To officers or employees of the NTSB who require the information in the official performance of their duties;

              § 802.6
              Types of requests and specification of records.
              (a) Types of requests. An individual may make the following request respecting records about himself maintained by NTSB in any system of records subject to the Act:
              (1) Whether information concerning himself is contained in any system of records.
              (2) Access to a record concerning himself. Such request may include a request to review the record and/or obtain a copy of all or any portion thereof.
              (3) Correction or amendment of a record concerning himself.
              (4) Accounting of disclosure to any other person or Government agency of any record concerning himself contained in any system of records controlled by NTSB, except: (i) Disclosures made pursuant to the FOIA; (ii) disclosures made within the NTSB; (iii) disclosures made to another Government agency or instrumentality for an authorized law enforcement activity pursuant to subsection (b)(7) of the Act; and (iv) disclosures expressly exempted by NTSB from the requirements of subsection (c)(3) of the Act, pursuant to subsection (k) thereof.
              (b) Specification of records. All requests for access to records must reasonably describe the system of records and the individual's record within the system of records in sufficient detail to permit identification of the requested record. Specific information regarding the system name, the individual's full name, and other information helpful in identifying the record or records shall be included. Requests for correction or amendment of records shall, in addition, specify the particular record involved, state the nature of the correction or amendment sought, and furnish justification for the correction or amendment.
              (c) Inadequate identification of record. Requests which do not contain information sufficient to identify the record requested will be returned promptly to the requester, with a notice indicating what information is lacking. Individuals making requests in person will be informed of any deficiency in the specification of the records at the time the request is made. Individuals making requests in writing will be notified of any such deficiency when their request is acknowledged.
            
            
              § 802.7
              Requests: How, where, and when presented; verification of identity of individuals making requests; accompanying persons; and procedures for acknowledgment of requests.
              (a) Requests—general. Requests may be made in person or in writing. Assistance regarding requests or other matters relating to the Act may be obtained by writing to the Director, Bureau of Administration, National Transportation Safety Board, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20594. The Director, Bureau of Administration, or his designee, on request, will aid an individual in preparing an amendment to the record or to an appeal following denial of a request to amend the record, pursuant to subsection (f)(4) of the Act.
              (b) Written requests. Written requests shall be made to the Director, Bureau of Administration at the address given above, and shall clearly state on the envelope and on the request itself, “Privacy Act Request,” “Privacy Act Statement of Disagreement,” “Privacy Act Disclosure Accounting Request,” “Appeal from Privacy Act Adverse Determination,” or “Privacy Act Correction Request,” as the case may be. Actual receipt by the Director, Bureau of Administration, or his designee, shall constitute receipt.
              (c) Requests made in person. Requests may be made in person during official working hours of the NTSB at the office where the record is located, as listed in the “Notice of Systems of Records” for the system in which the record is contained.
              (d) Verification of identity of requester. (1) For written requests, the requester's identity must be verified before the release of any record, unless exempted under the FOIA. This may be accomplished by adequate proof of identity in the form of a driver's license or other acceptable item of the same type.
              (2) For requests in person, the requester's identity may be established by a single document bearing a photograph (such as a passport or identification badge) or by two items of identification containing name, address, and signature (such as a driver's license or credit card).
              (3) Where a request is made for reproduced records which are to be delivered by mail, the request must include a notarized statement verifying the requester's identity.
              (e) Inability to provide requisite documentation of identity. A requester who cannot provide the necessary documentation of identity may provide a notarized statement, swearing or affirming his identity and the fact that he is aware of the penalties for false statement imposed pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1001, and subsection (i)(3) of the Act. Where requested, the Director, Bureau of Administration, or his designee, will assist the requester in formulating the necessary document.
              (f) Accompanying persons. A requester may wish to have a person of his choice accompany him to review the requested record. Prior to the release of the record, the NTSB will require the requester to furnish the Director, Bureau of Administration or his designee, with a written statement authorizing disclosure of the record in the accompanying person's presence.
              (g) Acknowledgment of requests. Written requests to verify the existence of, to obtain access to, or to correct or amend records about the requester maintained by NTSB in any system of records subject to the Act, shall be acknowledged in writing by the Director, Bureau of Administration, or his designee, within 3 working days after the date of actual receipt of the request by the Director, Bureau of Administration, or his designee. The acknowledgment shall advise the requester of the need for any additional information to process the request. Wherever practicable, the acknowledgment shall notify the individual whether his request has been granted or denied. When a request is made in person, every effort will be made to determine immediately whether the request will be granted. If such decision cannot be made, the request will be processed in the same manner as a written request. Records will be made available for immediate inspection whenever possible.

              § 802.8
              Disclosure of requested information.
              (a) The System Manager may initially determine that the request be granted. If so, the individual making the request shall be notified orally, or in writing, and the notice shall include:
              (1) A brief description of the information to be made available;
              (2) The time and place where the record may be inspected, or alternatively, the procedure for delivery by mail to the requesting party;

              (3) The estimated cost for furnishing copies of the record;
              
              (4) The requirements for verification of identity;
              (5) The requirements for authorizing discussion of the record in the presence of an accompanying person; and
              (6) Any additional requirements needed to grant access to a specific system of records or record.
              (b) Within 10 working days after actual receipt of the request by the Director, Bureau of Administration, or his designee, in appropriate cases, the requester will be informed:
              (1) That the request does not reasonably describe the system of records or record sought to permit its identification, and shall set forth the additional information needed to clarify the request; or
              (2) That the system of records identified does not include a record retrievable by the requester's name or other identifying particulars.
              (c) The System Manager shall advise the requester within 10 working days after actual receipt of the request by the Director, Bureau of Administration, or his designee, that the request for access has been denied, and the reason for the denial, or that the determination has been made to grant the request, either in whole or in part, in which case the relevant information will be provided.

            Subpart D—Correction or Amending the Record
            
              § 802.10
              Request for correction or amendment to record.

              (c)(1) Review of denial of access. If the appeal upholds the denial of access to records, the Board shall: Notify the requester in writing, explaining the Board's determination; state that the denial is a final agency action and that judicial review is available in a district court of the United States in the district where the requester resides or has his principal place of business, or where the agency records are located, or in the District of Columbia; and request a filing with the Board of a concise statement enumerating the reasons for the requester's disagreement with the denial, pursuant to subsection (g) of the Act.
              (2) Review of denial of correction or amendment. If the appeal upholds the denial in whole or in part for correction or amendment of the record, the same notification and judicial review privileges described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall apply.
              (d) If the denial is reversed on appeal, the Board shall notify the requester in writing of the reversal. The notice shall include a brief statement outlining those portions of the individual's record which were not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete, and corrections of the record which were made, and shall provide the individual with a courtesy copy of the corrected record.
              (e) Copies of all appeals and written determinations will be furnished by the System Manager to the Board.
              (f) In unusual circumstances, time limits may be extended by not more than 10 working days by written notice to the individual making the request. The notice shall include the reasons for the extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be forthcoming. “Unusual circumstances” as used in this section shall include circumstances where a search and collection of the requested records from field offices or other establishments are required, cases where a voluminous amount of data is involved, and cases where consultations are required with other agencies or with others having a substantial interest in the determination of the request.
              (g) Statements of Disagreement. (1) Written Statements of Disagreement may be furnished by the individual within 30 working days of the date of actual receipt of the final adverse determination of the Board. They shall be addressed to the Director, Bureau of Administration, National Transportation Safety Board, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20594, and shall be clearly marked, both on the statement and on the envelope, “Privacy Act Statement of Disagreement.”
              (2) The Director, Bureau of Administration, or his designee, shall be responsible for ensuring that:
              (i) The Statement of Disagreement is included in the system of records in which the disputed item of information is maintained; and
              (ii) The original record is marked to indicate the information disputed, the existence of the Statement of Disagreement, and its location within the relevant system of records.

              (3) The Director, Bureau of Administration, or his designee, may, if he deems it appropriate, prepare a concise Statement of Explanation indicating why the requested amendments or corrections were not made. Such Statement of Explanation shall be included in the system of records in the same manner as the Statement of Disagreement. Courtesy copies of the NTSB Statement of Explanation and the notation of dispute, as marked on the original record, shall be furnished to the individual who requested correction or amendment of the record.
              
              (h) Notices of correction and/or amendment, or dispute. After a record has been corrected or a Statement of Disagreement has been filed, the Director, Bureau of Administration, or his designee, shall within 30 working days thereof, advise all previous recipients of the affected record as to the correction or the filing of the Statement of Disagreement. The identity of such recipients shall be determined pursuant to an accounting of disclosures required by the Act or any other accounting previously made. Any disclosure of disputed information occurring after a Statement of Disagreement has been filed shall clearly identify the specific information disputed and shall be accompanied by a copy of the Statement of Disagreement and a copy of any NTSB Statement of Explanation.
              (i) Disclosure to others of records concerning individuals. Neither the Board nor other NTSB personnel shall disclose any record which is contained in a system of records maintained by NTSB, by any means of communication, including oral communication, to any person, or to another Government agency, except pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior written consent, of the individual to whom the record pertains, unless disclosure of the record is:

                  1 The advance written statement of assurance shall state the purpose for which the record is requested and certify that it will be used only for statistical purposes. Prior to release under this paragraph, the record shall be stripped of all personally identifiable information and reviewed to ensure that the identity of any individual cannot reasonably be determined by combining two or more statistical records.
              
              (6) To the National Archives of the United States as a record which has sufficient historical or other value to warrant its continued preservation by the U.S. Government, or to the Administrator of the General Services Administration, or his designee, for evaluation to determine whether the record has such value;
              (7) To another agency or to an instrumentality of any governmental jurisdiction within or under the control of the United States for a civil or criminal law enforcement activity if the activity is authorized by law, and if the head of the agency or instrumentality has made a written request to NTSB specifying the particular portion of the record desired and the law enforcement activity for which the record is sought; 2

              (8) To any person upon a showing of compelling circumstances affecting the health or safety of any individual;

            (c) Within one working day of any vote taken pursuant to this section, the NTSB shall make available a written copy of such vote reflecting the vote of each Member on the question and, if a portion of a meeting is to be closed to the public a full written explanation of its action closing the meeting and a list of all persons expected to attend and their affiliation.

            (d) Before every closed meeting, the General Counsel of the NTSB shall publicly certify that, in his or her opinion, the meeting may be closed to the public and shall state each relevant exemptive provision. A copy of such certification, together with a statement of the presiding officer setting forth the time and place of the meeting and the persons present, shall be retained by the NTSB as part of the transcript, recording, or minutes required by § 804.9.

            (b) The subject matter of a meeting or the determination of the Board to open or to close a meeting, or a portion thereof, to the public may be changed following public announcement only if:

Copies of the nonexempt portions of the transcript or minutes, or transcription of such recordings disclosing the identity of each speaker, shall be furnished to any person at the actual cost of transcription or duplication. The NTSB shall maintain a complete verbatim copy of the transcript, a complete copy of the minutes, or a complete electronic recording of each meeting, or a portion thereof, closed to the public for at least two years after such meeting, or until one year after the conclusion of any NTSB proceeding with respect to which the meeting, or a portion thereof, was held, whichever occurs later.

            § 806.1
            General policy.
            (a) The interests of the United States and its citizens are best served by making information regarding the affairs of Government readily available to the public. This concept of an informed citizenry is reflected in the Freedom of Information Act and in the current public information policies of the executive branch.
            (b) Within the Federal Government there is some official information and material which, because it bears directly on the effectiveness of our national defense and the conduct of our foreign relations, must be subject to some constraints for the security of our Nation and the safety of our people and our allies. To protect against actions hostile to the United States, of both an overt and covert nature, it is essential that such official information and material be given only limited dissemination.
          
          
            § 806.2
            Applicability.
            This rule supplements Executive Order 12065 within the Board with regard to national security information. It establishes general policies and certain procedures for the classification and declassification of information which is generated, processed, and/or stored by the Board. In this connection, the Board does not have any original classification authority but infrequently does receive classified information from other agencies.
          
          
            § 806.3
            Definitions.
            (a) Classified information. Information or material, herein collectively termed information, that is owned by, produced for or by, or under the control of, the United States Government and that has been determined pursuant to Executive Order 12065, or prior orders, to require protection against unauthorized disclosure and that is so designated. One of the following classifications will be shown:
            (1) Top secret means information, the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security.
            (2) Secret means information, the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause serious damage to national security.
            (3) Confidential means information, the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause identifiable damage to the national security.
            (b) Foreign government information means either: (1) Information provided to the United States by a foreign government or international organization of governments in the expectation, express or implied, that the information is to be kept in confidence; or (2) information produced by the United States pursuant to a written joint arrangement with a foreign government or international organization of governments requiring that either the information or the arrangements or both, be kept in confidence.
            (c) National security means the national defense and foreign relations of the United States.
            (d) Declassification event means an event which would eliminate the need for continued classification.
          
          
            § 806.4
            Mandatory review for declassification.

            (a) Requests for mandatory review for declassification under section 3-501 of E.O. 12065 must be in writing and should be addressed to: National Security Oversight Officer, National Transportation Safety Board, Washington, DC 20594.
            (b) The requester shall be informed of the date of receipt of the request at the Board. This date will be the basis for the time limits specified by section 3-501 of E.O. 12065. If the request does not reasonably describe the information sought, the requester shall be notified that, unless additional information is provided or the request is made more specific, no further action will be taken.
            (c) When the Board receives a request for information in a document which is in its custody but which was classified by another agency, it shall refer the request to the appropriate agency for review, together with a copy of the document containing the information requested, where practicable. The Board shall also notify the requester of the referral, unless the association of the reviewing agency with the information requires protection. The reviewing agency shall review the document in coordination with any other agency involved or which had a direct interest in the classification of the subject matter. The reviewing agency shall respond directly to the requester in accordance with the pertinent procedures described above and, if requested, shall notify the Board of its determination.

            § 807.140
            Employment.
            No qualified handicapped person shall, on the basis of handicap, be subjected to discrimination in employment under any program or activity conducted by the agency. The definitions, requirements, and procedures of section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791), as established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR part 1613, shall apply to employment in federally conducted programs or activities.

            § 807.149
            Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.
            Except as otherwise provided in § 807.150, no qualified handicapped person shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.
          
          
            § 807.150
            Program accessibility: Existing facilities.
            (a) General. The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not—
            (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons; or
            (2) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 807.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.
            (b) Methods. The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is nor required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.
            (c) Time period for compliance. The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by June 6, 1986, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by April 7, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.
            (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by October 7, 1986, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—
            (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped persons;
            (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;
            (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and
            (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.

            § 807.151
            Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.
            Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this section.

            (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal entities, and members of the public.
            (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.
            (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the handicapped person.
            (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.
            (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.
            (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.
            (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.

            (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 807.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.

            (d) The agency shall accept and investigate all complete complaints for which it has jurisdiction. All complete complaints must be filed within 180 days of the alleged act of discrimination. The agency may extend this time period for good cause.
            (e) If the agency receives a complaint over which it does not have jurisdiction, it shall promptly notify the complainant and shall make reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate government entity.
            (f) The agency shall notify the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a building or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), or section 502 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 792), is not readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons.
            (g) Within 180 days of the receipt of a complete complaint for which it has jurisdiction, the agency shall notify the complainant of the results of the investigation in a letter containing—

            (k) The time limits cited in paragraphs (g) and (j) of this section may be extended with the permission of the Assistant Attorney General.

              The provisions of this part govern all air safety proceedings, including proceedings before a law judge on petition for review of the denial of any airman certificate (including a medical certificate), or on appeal from any order of the Administrator amending, modifying, suspending or revoking a certificate. The provisions of this part also govern all proceedings on appeal from an order of the Administrator imposing a civil penalty on a flight engineer, mechanic, pilot or repairman, or a person acting in such capacity. All proceedings on appeal to the Board from any initial decision or order of a law judge are also governed by this part.
            
            
              § 821.3
              Description of docket numbering system.

              In addition to sequential numbering of cases as received, each case formally handled by the Board will receive a letter prefix. These letter prefixes reflect the case type: “SE” for safety enforcement (certificate suspension/revocation) cases; “SM” (safety medical) for cases involving denials of medical certification; “CD” for cases involving non-medical certificate denials; “SR” for cases involving safety registration issues under 49 U.S.C. 44101 et seq.; “CP” for cases involving the imposition of civil penalties; “NA” for cases in which a petition for review or appeal is not accepted because of a patent procedural deficiency; and “EAJA” for cases involving applications for fees and expenses under the Equal Access to Justice Act, governed by Part 826.

              Appearances and rights of witnesses.
              (a) Any party to a proceeding may appear and be heard in person, or by an attorney or other representative designated by that party. Upon hearing, and for good cause shown, the Board may suspend or bar any person from practicing before it.
              (b) Any person appearing in any proceeding governed by this part may be accompanied, represented and advised, and may be examined by, his or her own counsel or representative.
              (c) Any person who submits data or evidence in a proceeding governed by this part may, by timely request, procure a copy of any document submitted by him or her, or a copy of any transcript made of his or her testimony, on payment of reasonable costs. Original documents, data or evidence may be retained by a party upon permission of the law judge or the Board, upon substitution of a copy thereof.
              (d) Any party to a proceeding who is represented by an attorney or representative shall, in a separate written document, notify the Board of the name, address and telephone number of that attorney or representative. In the event of a change in representation or a withdrawal of representation, the party shall immediately, in a separate written document, notify the Board (in the manner provided in § 821.7) and the other parties to the proceeding (pursuant to § 821.8), before the new attorney or representative may participate in the proceeding in any way. Parties, and their attorneys and representatives, must notify the Board immediately of any changes in their contact information.

If the proceeding has not yet been assigned to a law judge, documents shall be addressed to the Case Manager. Paragraph (a)(3) of this section provides the acceptable methods for filing documents under this provision.
              (2) Subsequent to the filing of a notice of appeal with the Office of Administrative Law Judges from a law judge's initial decision or appealable order, the issuance of a decision permitting an interlocutory appeal, or the expiration of the period within which an appeal from the law judge's initial decision or appealable order may be filed, all documents are to be filed with the Office of General Counsel, National Transportation Safety Board, 490 L'Enfant Plaza East SW., Washington, DC 20594. Paragraph (a)(3) of this section provides the acceptable methods for filing documents under this provision.
              (3) Documents shall be filed: By personal delivery, by U.S. Postal Service first-class mail, by overnight delivery service, by facsimile or by electronic mail as specified on the “Administrative Law Judges” Web page on the NTSB's public Web site. Documents filed by electronic mail must be signed and transmitted as specified on the “Administrative Law Judges” Web page on the NTSB's public Web site.

              (4) Documents shall be deemed filed on the date of personal delivery; on the send date shown on the facsimile or the item of electronic mail; and, for mail delivery service, on the mailing date shown on the certificate of service, on the date shown on the postmark if there is no certificate of service, or on the mailing date shown by other evidence if there is no certificate of service and no postmark. Where the document bears a postmark that cannot reasonably be reconciled with the mailing date shown on the certificate of service, the document will be deemed filed on the date of the postmark.
              (b) Number of copies. Service on the Board of petitions for review, appeals from orders of the Administrator, and notices of appeal from law judges' initial decisions and appealable orders shall be by executed original and 3 copies. Service of all other documents shall be by executed original and one copy. Copies need not be signed, but the name of the person signing the original shall be shown thereon.
              (c) Form. (1) Petitions for review, appeals to the Board from orders of the Administrator, and notices of appeal from law judges' initial decisions and appealable orders may be in the form of a letter signed by the petitioner or appealing party, and shall be typewritten or in legible handwriting.
              (2) Documents filed with the Board consisting of more than one page may be affixed only in the upper left-hand corner by staple or clip, and shall not be bound or hole-punched. Any document failing to comply with this requirement is subject to being returned to the filing party.
              (d) Content. Each document filed with the Board shall contain a concise and complete statement of the facts relied upon, and the relief sought, by the filing party.
              (e) Subscription. The original of every document filed shall be signed by the filing party, or by that party's attorney or representative.
              (f) Designation of person to receive service.

              (g) To whom directed. All motions, requests and documents submitted in connection with petitions for review and appeals to the Board from orders of the Administrator shall designate, and be addressed to, the law judge to whom the proceeding has been assigned, if any. If the proceeding has not yet been assigned to a law judge, the document shall bear the designation “unassigned,” and shall be addressed to the Case Manager. All motions, requests and documents submitted subsequent to the filing of a notice of appeal from a law judge's initial decision or appealable order, or a decision permitting an interlocutory appeal, or after the expiration of the period within which an appeal from the law judge's initial decision or appealable order may be filed, shall be addressed to the Board's General Counsel.

              § 821.8
              Service of documents.
              (a) Who must be served. (1) Copies of all documents filed with the Board must be simultaneously served on (i.e., sent to) all other parties to the proceeding, on the date of filing, by the person filing them. A certificate of service shall be a part of each document and any copy or copies thereof tendered for filing, and shall certify concurrent service on the Board and the parties. A certificate of service shall be in substantially the following form:
              
              
                I hereby certify that I have this day served the foregoing [specify document] on the following party's counsel or designated representatives [or party, if without counsel or representative], at the address indicated, by [specify the method of service (e.g., first-class mail, electronic mail, personal service, etc.)] [List names and addresses of all persons served] Dated at ___this__ day of_____ 20_ (Signature)_____ For (on behalf of)_____
              
              
              (2) Service shall be made on the person designated in accordance with § 821.7(f) to receive service. If no such person has been designated, service shall be made directly on the party.
              (b) Method of Service. (1) Service of documents by any party on any other party shall be accomplished by any method prescribed in § 821.7(a)(3) for the filing of documents with the Board. A party may waive the applicability of this paragraph, and elect to be served with documents by the other parties to the proceeding solely by electronic mail, by filing a written document with the Board (with copies to the other parties) expressly stating such a preference.
              (2) Notices of hearing, written initial decisions, law judges' appealable orders and Board orders on appeal shall be served by the Board on parties other than the Administrator by certified mail. Such documents may be served on the Administrator by first-class mail or facsimile. The Board may serve all other documents on the parties by first-class mail or facsimile.
              (c) Where service shall be made. Except for electronic mail, personal service, parties shall be served at the address appearing in the official record, which the Board must receive under §§ 821.6(d) and 821.7(f). In the case of an agent designated by an air carrier under 49 U.S.C. 46103, service may be accomplished only at the agent's office or usual place of residence.
              (d) Presumption of service. There shall be a presumption of lawful service:
              (1) When receipt has been acknowledged by a person who customarily or in the ordinary course of business receives mail at the residence or principal place of business of the party or of the person designated under § 821.7(f);
              (2) When a properly addressed envelope, sent to the most current address in the official record, by regular, registered or certified mail, has been returned as unclaimed or refused; or
              (3) When a document is transmitted by facsimile or electronic mail and there is evidence to confirm its successful transmission to the intended recipient.
              (e) Date of service. The date of service shall be determined in the same manner as the filing date is determined under § 821.7(a)(4).

              § 821.9
              Intervention and amicus appearance.
              (a) Intervention. Any person may move for leave to intervene in a proceeding, and may become a party thereto, if it is found that such person has a property, financial or other legitimate interest that will not be adequately represented by the existing parties, and that such intervention will not unduly broaden the issues or delay the proceeding. Except for good cause shown, no motion for leave to intervene will be entertained if filed less than 15 days prior to the hearing. The extent to which an intervenor may participate in the proceeding is wholly within the law judge's discretion.
              (b) Amicus curiae briefs. A brief of amicus curiae in a matter on appeal from a law judge's initial decision or appealable order may be filed, if accompanied by written consent of all the parties, or by leave of the General Counsel if, in his or her opinion, the brief will not unduly broaden the matters at issue or prejudice any party to the proceeding. A brief may be conditionally filed with motion for leave. The motion for leave shall identify the interest of the movant and shall state the reasons why a brief of amicus curiae is desirable. Such brief and motion shall be filed within the briefing time allowed the party whose position the brief would support, unless good cause for late filing is shown, in which event the General Counsel may provide an opportunity for response in determining whether to accept the amicus brief.
            
            
              § 821.10
              Computation of time.
              In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by this part, by notice or order of a law judge or the Board, or by any applicable statute, the date of the act, event or default after which the designated period of time begins to run is not to be included in the computation. The last day of the period so computed is to be included unless it is a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday for the Board, in which event the period runs until the end of the next day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday. In all cases, Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays for the Board shall be included in the computation of time, except they shall not be included in computations of time respecting petitions for review of determinations as to the existence of emergencies under § 821.54.
            
            
              
              § 821.11
              Extensions of time.
              (a) On written request filed with the Board and served on all other parties, or oral request with any extension granted confirmed in writing and served on all other parties by the requestor, and for good cause shown, the law judge or the Board may grant an extension of time to file any document; however, no extension of time will be granted for the filing of a document to which a statutory time limit applies.
              (b) Extensions of time to file petitions for reconsideration shall not be granted upon a showing of good cause, but only in extraordinary circumstances.
              (c) The General Counsel is authorized to grant unopposed extensions of time on timely oral request without a showing of good cause in cases on appeal to the Board from a law judge's initial decision or appealable order. Written confirmation of such a grant of extension of time must promptly be sent by the requesting party to the Board and served on all other parties to the proceeding.
            
            
              § 821.12
              Amendment and withdrawal of pleadings.
              (a) Amendment. At any time more than 15 days prior to the hearing, a party may amend its pleadings by filing an amended pleading with the Board and serving copies thereof on all other parties. After that time, amendment shall be allowed only at the discretion of the law judge. In the case of amendment of an answerable pleading, the law judge shall allow any adverse party a reasonable time to object or answer. Amendments to complaints shall be consistent with the requirements of 49 U.S.C. 44709(c) and 44710(c).
              (b) Withdrawal. Except in the case of a petition for review, an appeal to the Board, a complaint, or an appeal from a law judge's initial decision or appealable order, pleadings may be withdrawn only upon approval of the law judge or the Board. The law judge may dismiss the case after receiving a motion to dismiss based on withdrawal of the complaint. The law judge shall accept arguments or motions, oral or written, from the parties, if offered, on the issue of whether a dismissal resulting from the withdrawal of a complaint should be deemed to occur with or without prejudice.

              § 821.13
              Waivers.
              Waivers of any rights provided by statute or regulation shall either be in writing or by stipulation made at the hearing and entered into the record, and shall set forth the precise terms and conditions of the waiver.
            
            
              § 821.14
              Motions.
              (a) General. Any application to a law judge or to the Board for an order or ruling not otherwise provided for in this part shall be by motion. Prior to the assignment of the proceeding to a law judge, all motions shall be addressed to the Case Manager. Thereafter, and prior to the expiration of the period within which an appeal from the law judge's initial decision may be filed, all motions shall be addressed to the law judge. At all other times, motions shall be addressed to the General Counsel.
              (b) Form and content. Unless made during a hearing, motions shall be made in writing, shall state with particularity the grounds for the relief requested, and shall be accompanied by affidavits or other evidence relied upon. Motions introduced during a hearing may be made orally on the record, unless the law judge directs otherwise.
              (c) Replies to motions. Except when a motion is made during a hearing, any party may file a reply, accompanied by such affidavits or other evidence as that party desires to rely upon, within 15 days after the date of service of the motion on that party. Upon notice to the parties, the law judge or the Board may, where appropriate, set a shorter time for filing a reply. Where a motion is made during a hearing, the reply may be made at the hearing, or orally or in writing within such time as the law judge may fix.
              (d) Oral argument; briefs. No oral argument will be heard on a motion unless the law judge or the Board directs otherwise.
              (e) Effect of pendency of motions. Except as provided in §§ 821.17(a) and 821.18(a), the filing or pendency of a motion shall not automatically alter or extend the time fixed in this part (or any extension thereof previously granted) for the parties to take any actions.
            
            
              § 821.15
              Motion to disqualify a Board Member.
              A motion requesting that a Board Member disqualify himself or herself from participating in a proceeding under this part shall be filed in writing with the Board.
            
            
              § 821.16
              Interlocutory appeals from law judges' rulings on motions.
              Rulings of law judges on motions which are not dispositive of the proceeding as a whole may not be appealed to the Board prior to its consideration of the entire proceeding, except in extraordinary circumstances and with the consent of the law judge who made the ruling. Interlocutory appeals shall be disallowed unless the law judge finds, either orally on the record or in writing, that to allow such an appeal is necessary to prevent substantial detriment to the public interest or undue prejudice to a party. If an interlocutory appeal is allowed, any party may file a brief with the Board within such time as the law judge directs. No oral argument will be heard unless the Board directs otherwise.
            
            
              § 821.17
              Motions to dismiss, for judgment on the pleadings and for summary judgment.
              (a) Motions to dismiss petition for review or complaint. A motion to dismiss a petition for review or a complaint may be filed in lieu of an answer, within the time limit for filing an answer set forth in § 821.24(c) or § 821.31(b). If such motion is not granted in its entirety, the answer shall be filed within 10 days after service of the law judge's order on the motion.
              (b) Motions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. A motion to dismiss on the ground that the Board lacks jurisdiction may be made by any party at any time.
              (c) Motions for judgment on the pleadings. A party may file a motion for judgment on the pleadings on the basis that no answer has been filed, or that the pleadings disclose that there are no material issues of fact to be resolved and that party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
              (d) Motions for summary judgment. A party may file a motion for summary judgment on the basis that the pleadings and other supporting documentation establish that there are no material issues of fact to be resolved and that party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
              (e) Appeals of dismissal, judgment on the pleadings and summary judgment orders. When a law judge grants a motion to dismiss, a motion for judgment on the pleadings or a motion for summary judgment, and terminates the proceeding without a hearing, an appeal of such order to the Board may be filed pursuant to the provisions of § 821.47. When a motion to dismiss, a motion for judgment on the pleadings or a motion for summary judgment is granted in part, § 821.16 applies.
            
            
              § 821.18
              Motion for a more definite statement.
              (a) A party may, in lieu of an answer, file a motion requesting that the petitioner's statement of reasons and supporting facts in a petition for review or the Administrator's allegations of fact in a complaint be made more definite and certain. The motion shall cite the defects complained of and the details sought. If the motion is granted and the law judge's order is not complied with within 15 days after service thereof, the law judge shall strike the portion or portions of the petition for review or complaint to which the motion is directed. If the motion is denied, the moving party shall file an answer within 10 days after service of the law judge's order on the motion.
              (b) A party may file a motion to clarify an answer in the event that the answer fails to respond clearly to the petition for review or the complaint.
            
            
              § 821.19
              Depositions and other discovery.
              (a) Depositions. After a petition for review or a complaint is filed, any party may take the testimony of any person, including a party, by deposition, upon oral examination or written questions, without seeking prior Board approval. Reasonable notice shall be given in writing to the other parties, stating the name of the witness and the time and place of the taking of the deposition, in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. A copy of any notice of deposition shall be served on the law judge to whom the proceeding has been assigned or, if no law judge has been assigned, on the Case Manager. In other respects, the taking of any deposition shall be compliance with the provisions of 49 U.S.C. 46104(c).
              (b) Exchange of information by the parties. The parties must exchange information in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Copies of discovery requests and responses shall be served on the law judge to whom the proceeding has been assigned or, if no law judge has been assigned, on the Case Manager. In the event of a dispute, either the assigned law judge or another law judge delegated this responsibility (if a law judge has not yet been assigned or if the assigned law judge is unavailable) may issue an appropriate order, including an order directing compliance with any ruling previously made with respect to discovery.
              (c) Failure to provide or preserve evidence. The failure of any party to comply with a law judge's order compelling discovery, or to cooperate with a timely request for the preservation of evidence, may result in a negative inference against that party with respect to the matter sought and not provided or preserved, a preclusion order, dismissal or other relief deemed appropriate by the law judge.
              (d) Failure to provide copy of releasable portion of Enforcement Investigative Report (EIR). (1) Except as provided in § 821.55 with respect to emergency proceedings, where the respondent requests the EIR and the Administrator fails to provide the releasable portion of the EIR to the respondent by the time he or she serves the complaint on the respondent, the respondent may move to dismiss the complaint or for other relief and, unless the Administrator establishes good cause for that failure, the law judge shall order such relief as he or she deems appropriate, after considering the parties' arguments.
              (2) The releasable portion of the EIR shall include all information in the EIR, except for the following:
              (i) Information that is privileged;
              (ii) Information that constitutes work product or reflects internal deliberative process;
              (iii) Information that would disclose the identity of a confidential source;
              (iv) Information of which applicable law prohibits disclosure;
              (v) Information about which the law judge grants leave to withhold as not relevant to the subject matter of the proceeding or otherwise, for good cause shown; or
              (vi) Sensitive security information, as defined at 49 U.S.C. 40119 and 49 CFR 15.5.
              (3) Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as preventing the Administrator from releasing to the respondent information in addition to that which is contained in the releasable portion of the EIR.

              § 821.20
              Subpoenas, witness fees, and appearances of Board Members, officers and employees.
              (a) Subpoenas. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, subpoenas requiring the attendance of witnesses, or the production of documentary or tangible evidence, for the purpose of taking depositions or at a hearing, may be issued by the presiding law judge (or the chief law judge, if the proceeding has not been assigned to a law judge) upon application by any party. The application shall show the general relevance and reasonable scope of the evidence sought. Any person upon whom a subpoena is served may, within 7 days after service of the subpoena, but in any event prior to the return date thereof, file with the law judge who issued the subpoena a motion to quash or modify the subpoena, and such filing shall stay the effectiveness of the subpoena pending final action by the law judge on the motion.
              (b) Witness fees. Witnesses shall be entitled to the same fees and expenses for mileage as are paid to witnesses in the courts of the United States. The fees and expenses shall be paid by the party at whose request the witness is subpoenaed or appears. The Board may decline to process a proceeding further should a party fail to compensate a witness pursuant to this paragraph.
              (c) Board Members, officers and employees. In order to encourage a free flow of information to the Board's accident investigators, the Board disfavors the use of its personnel in enforcement proceedings. Therefore, the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section are not applicable to Board Members, officers and employees, or the production of documents in their custody. Applications for subpoenas requiring the attendance of such persons, or the production of such documents, must be addressed to the General Counsel, and shall set forth the need of the moving party for the testimony or documents sought, and a showing that such material is not now, and was not otherwise, reasonably available from other sources. Only upon the General Counsel's written approval for the issuance of a subpoena requiring a Board Member, officer or employee to provide testimony and/or to produce documents in connection with discovery or at a hearing may a law judge issue such a subpoena. The law judge shall not permit the testimony or documentary evidence provided by a Board Member, officer or employee to include any expression of opinion, or any account of statements of a party made during the Board's investigation of any accident.
            
            
              § 821.21
              Official notice.
              Where a law judge or the Board intends to take official notice of a material fact not appearing in the evidence in the record, notice shall be given to all parties, who may within 10 days file a petition disputing that fact.
            
          
          
            Subpart C—Special Rules Applicable to Proceedings Under 49 U.S.C. 44703
            
              § 821.24
              Initiation of proceeding.
              (a) Petition for review. Where the Administrator has denied an application for the issuance or renewal of an airman certificate, the applicant may file with the Board a petition for review of the Administrator's denial. The petition must be filed with the Board within 60 days after the date on which notice of the Administrator's denial was served on the petitioner.
              (b) Form and content of petition. The petition may be in letter form. It shall identify the Administrator's certificate denial action, and contain a complete but concise statement of the reasons why the petitioner believes the certificate denial was erroneous.
              (c) Answer to petition. The Administrator shall file an answer to the petition for review within 20 days after the date of service of the petition. The answer shall specifically address each of the reasons set forth in the petition as to why the petitioner believes the certificate denial was erroneous.
              (d) Stay of proceeding pending request for special issuance (restricted) medical certificate. The Board lacks the authority to review requests for special issuance (restricted) medical certificates, or to direct that they be issued. Where a request for a special issuance certificate has been filed with the Administrator pursuant to the Federal Aviation Regulations, the Board will, upon the petitioner's written request, hold a petition for review of a denial of an unrestricted medical certificate in abeyance pending final action by the Administrator on the special issuance request, but for no longer than 180 days after the date on which the unrestricted medical certificate denial was issued.
              (e) New evidence. Where review of a denial of an unrestricted medical certificate is at issue, if the petitioner has undergone medical testing or evaluation in addition to that already submitted or known to the Administrator, and wishes to introduce the results into the record, such new medical evidence must be served on the Administrator at least 30 days prior to the hearing. Absent good cause, failure to so timely serve the new medical evidence on the Administrator will result in the exclusion of such evidence from the record. The Administrator may amend his or her answer to respond to such new medical evidence within 10 days after the date on which he or she was served therewith.
            
            
              
              § 821.25
              Burden of proof.
              In proceedings under 49 U.S.C. 44703, the burden of proof shall be upon the petitioner.
            
            
              § 821.26
              Motion to dismiss petition for review for lack of standing.
              Upon motion by the Administrator within the time limit for filing an answer, a petition for review shall be dismissed for lack of standing in either of the following instances:
              (a) If the petition seeks the issuance of the same type of certificate that was under an order of suspension on the date of the denial; or
              (b) If the petition seeks the issuance of the same type of certificate that had been revoked within one year of the date of the denial, unless the order revoking such certificate provides otherwise.
            
          
          
            Subpart D—Special Rules Applicable to Proceedings Under 49 U.S.C. 44709
            
              § 821.30
              Initiation of proceeding.
              (a) Appeal. Where the Administrator has issued an order amending, modifying, suspending or revoking a certificate, the affected certificate holder (respondent) may file with the Board an appeal from the Administrator's order. The respondent shall simultaneously serve a copy of the appeal on the Administrator. The appeal must be filed with the Board within 20 days after the date on which the Administrator's order was served on the respondent, except as provided with respect to emergency and other immediately effective orders under § 821.53(a).
              (b) Form and content of appeal. The appeal may be in letter form. It shall identify the certificate or certificates affected and the Administrator's action from which the appeal is sought.
              (c) Effect of filing timely appeal with the Board. Timely filing with the Board of an appeal from an order of the Administrator shall postpone the effective date of the order until final disposition of the appeal by the law judge or the Board, except where the order appealed from is an emergency or other immediately effective order, in which case the effectiveness of the order will not be so stayed during the pendency of the appeal.
            
            
              § 821.31
              Complaint procedure.
              (a) Filing, time of filing and service on respondent. The order of the Administrator from which an appeal has been taken shall serve as the complaint. The Administrator shall (except as provided in § 821.55(a) with respect to emergency proceedings) file the complaint with the Board within 10 days after the date on which he or she was served with the appeal by the respondent, and shall simultaneously serve a copy of the complaint on the respondent. If the Administrator has determined that the respondent lacks qualification to be a certificate holder, the order filed as the complaint, or an accompanying statement, shall identify the pleaded factual allegations on which this determination is based.
              (b) Answer to complaint. The respondent shall (except as provided in § 821.55(b) with respect to emergency proceedings) file with the Board an answer to the complaint within 20 days after the date on which the complaint was served by the Administrator, and shall simultaneously serve a copy of the answer on the Administrator. Failure by the respondent to deny the truth of any allegation or allegations in the complaint may be deemed an admission of the truth of the allegation or allegations not answered. The answer shall also identify any affirmative defenses that the respondent intends to raise at the hearing. The answer may be amended to include affirmative defenses in accordance with the provisions of § 821.12(a).
            
            
              § 821.32
              Burden of proof.
              In proceedings under 49 U.S.C. 44709, the burden of proof shall be upon the Administrator.
            
            
              § 821.33
              Motion to dismiss stale complaint.

              Where the complaint states allegations of offenses which occurred more than 6 months prior to the Administrator's advising the respondent as to reasons for proposed action under 49 U.S.C. 44709(c), the respondent may move to dismiss such allegations as stale pursuant to the following provisions:
              (a) In those cases where the complaint does not allege lack of qualification of the respondent:
              (1) The Administrator shall be required to show, by reply filed within 15 days after the date of service of the respondent's motion, that good cause existed for the delay in providing such advice, or that the imposition of a sanction is warranted in the public interest, notwithstanding the delay or the reasons therefor.
              (2) If the Administrator does not establish good cause for the delay, or for the imposition of a sanction in the public interest notwithstanding the delay, the law judge shall dismiss the stale allegations and proceed to adjudicate the remaining portion of the complaint, if any.
              (b) In those cases where the complaint alleges lack of qualification of the respondent, the law judge shall first determine whether an issue of lack of qualification would be presented if all of the allegations, stale and timely, are assumed to be true. If so, the law judge shall deny the respondent's motion. If not, the law judge shall proceed as in paragraph (a) of this section.
            
          
          
            Subpart E—Law Judges
            
              § 821.35
              Assignment, duties and powers.
              (a) Assignment of law judge and duration of assignment. The chief law judge shall assign a law judge to preside over each proceeding. Until such assignment, motions, requests and documents shall be addressed to the Case Manager for handling by the chief law judge, who may handle these matters personally or delegate them to other law judges for decision. After assignment of a proceeding to a law judge, all motions, requests and documents shall be addressed to that law judge. The authority of the assigned law judge shall terminate upon the expiration of the period within which appeals from initial decisions or appealable orders may be filed, or upon the law judge's withdrawal from the proceeding.
              (b) Powers of law judge. Law judges shall have the following powers:
              (1) To give notice of, and to hold, prehearing conferences and hearings, and to consolidate proceedings which involve a common question of law or fact;
              (2) To hold conferences, before or during the hearing, for the settlement or simplification of issues;
              (3) To issue subpoenas, and to take depositions or cause depositions to be taken;
              (4) To dispose of procedural requests or similar matters;
              (5) To rule on motions;
              (6) To regulate the conduct of hearings;
              (7) To administer oaths and affirmations;
              (8) To examine witnesses;
              (9) To receive evidence and rule upon objections and offers of proof; and
              (10) To issue initial decisions and dispositional orders.
              (c) Disqualification. A law judge shall withdraw from a proceeding if, at any time, he or she deems himself or herself disqualified. If the law judge does not withdraw, and if an appeal from the law judge's initial decision is filed, the Board will, on motion of a party, determine whether the law judge should have withdrawn and, if so, order appropriate relief.

              § 821.37
              Notice of hearing.
              (a) Time and location of hearing. The law judge to whom the proceeding is assigned (or the chief judge) shall set a reasonable date, time and place for the hearing. Except as provided with respect to emergency proceedings in § 821.56(a), a written notice of hearing shall be served on the parties at least 30 days in advance of the hearing. The law judge may set the hearing for a date fewer than 30 days after the date of the issuance of the notice of hearing if all of the parties consent to an earlier hearing date. In setting the date of the hearing, due regard shall be given to the parties' discovery needs. In setting the place of the hearing, due regard shall be given to the location of the subject incident, the convenience of the parties and their witnesses, and the conservation of Board funds. Another relevant factor in determining the place of the hearing is the convenience of the hearing site to scheduled transportation service. Only in the most extraordinary circumstances may consideration be given to locating a hearing in a foreign country.
              (b) Hearing in several sessions. Where appropriate, the law judge may hold a hearing in more than one session, at the same or different locations.
            
            
              § 821.38
              Evidence.
              In any proceeding under the rules in this part, all evidence which is relevant, material, reliable and probative, and not unduly repetitious or cumulative, shall be admissible. All other evidence shall be excluded. The Federal Rules of Evidence will be applied in these proceedings to the extent practicable.

              § 821.39
              Argument and submissions.
              At the hearing, the law judge shall give the parties adequate opportunity for the presentation of arguments in support of, or in opposition to, motions, objections and proposed rulings. Prior to the issuance of the initial decision, the parties shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to submit for consideration proposed findings and conclusions, and supporting reasons therefor.
            
            
              § 821.40
              Record.
              The transcript of testimony and exhibits, together with all papers, requests and rulings filed in the proceeding before the law judge, shall constitute the exclusive record of the proceeding. Copies of the transcript may be obtained by any party upon payment of the reasonable cost thereof. A copy of the transcript may be examined at the National Transportation Safety Board, Office of Administrative Law Judges, Public Docket Section.

              § 821.42
              Initial decision by law judge.
              (a) Written or oral decision. The law judge may render his or her initial decision orally at the close of the hearing, or in writing at a later date, except as provided with respect to emergency proceedings in § 821.56(c).
              (b) Content. The initial decision shall include findings and conclusions upon all material issues of fact, credibility of witnesses, law and discretion presented on the record, together with a statement of the reasons therefor.
              (c) Furnishing parties with, and issuance date of, oral decision. If the initial decision is rendered orally, a copy thereof, excerpted from the hearing transcript, shall be furnished to the parties by the Office of Administrative Law Judges. Irrespective of the date on which the copy of the decision is transmitted to the parties, the issuance date of the decision shall be the date on which it was orally rendered.
            
            
              § 821.43
              Effect of law judge's initial decision or appealable order and appeal therefrom.
              If no appeal from the law judge's initial decision or appealable order is timely filed, the initial decision or order shall become final with respect to the parties, but shall not be binding precedent for the Board. The filing of a timely notice of appeal with the Board shall stay the effectiveness of the law judge's initial decision or order, unless the basis for the decision or order is that the Board lacks jurisdiction.
            
          
          
            Subpart H—Appeal From Initial Decision
            
              § 821.47
              Notice of appeal.
              (a) Time within which to file notice of appeal. A party may appeal from a law judge's initial decision or appealable order by filing with the Board, and simultaneously serving on the other parties, a notice of appeal, within 10 days after the date on which the oral initial decision was rendered or the written initial decision or appealable order was served (except as provided in § 821.57(a) with respect to emergency proceedings). At any time before the time limit for filing an appeal from an initial decision or appealable order has passed, the law judge may, for good cause, reopen the matter on notice to the parties.
              (b) Request for reconsideration of law judge's initial decision or order. A law judge may not reconsider an initial decision or appealable order after the time for appealing to the Board from the decision or order has expired, or after an appeal has been filed with the Board. However, a timely request for reconsideration by the law judge of the initial decision or appealable order, filed before an appeal to the Board is taken, will stay the deadline for filing an appeal until 10 days after the date on which the law judge serves his or her decision on the reconsideration request. For the purpose of this paragraph, if a request for reconsideration and a notice of appeal are filed on the same day, the reconsideration request will be deemed to have been filed first.
            
            
              § 821.48
              Briefs and oral argument.
              (a) Appeal brief. Except as provided in § 821.57(b) with respect to emergency proceedings, each appeal must be perfected, within 50 days after the date on which the oral initial decision was rendered, or 30 days after the date on which the written initial decision or appealable order was served, by the filing, and simultaneous service on the other parties, of a brief in support of the appeal. An appeal may be dismissed by the Board, either on its own initiative or on motion of another party, where a party who has filed a notice of appeal fails to perfect the appeal by filing a timely appeal brief.
              (b) Form and content of appeal brief. (1) In addition to the general form requirements for documents set forth in § 821.7(c)(2), the appeal brief must be typewritten, double-spaced, on 81/2-by-11 inch paper. The appeal brief shall set forth the name, address and telephone number of the party, or the attorney or other representative filing the brief on the party's behalf. No appeal brief may contain more than 35 pages of text without prior leave of the General Counsel, upon a showing of good cause.
              (2) The appeal brief shall enumerate the appealing party's objections to the law judge's initial decision or appealable order, and shall state the reasons for such objections, including any legal precedent relied upon in support thereof.
              (3) Any error contained in the initial decision which is not objected to in the appeal brief may be deemed waived.
              (c) Reply brief. Any other party to the proceeding may file a brief in reply to the appeal brief within 30 days after the date on which the appeal brief was served on that party (except as provided in § 821.57(b) with respect to emergency proceedings). A copy of the reply brief shall simultaneously be served on the appealing party and any other parties to the proceeding. The form requirements governing the appeal brief set forth in paragraph (b)(1) also apply to the reply brief.
              (d) Other filings. Subsequent to the filing of the appeal and reply briefs, the parties may file citations to supplemental authorities. This procedure may be used only for identifying new and relevant legal authority, and not to correct omissions in briefing or to respond to a reply brief. No argument may be included with such a filing. Such filing shall include a reference to the page of the brief to which the cited legal authority pertains. Any response shall be filed within 10 days of the date of service of the supplemental filing, and shall be similarly limited in scope. With these exceptions, the parties may make no other submissions, except by leave of the Board, upon on a showing of good cause.
              (e) Oral argument. Oral argument before the Board will not be held in proceedings under this part unless the Board, on motion of a party or on its own initiative, determines that oral argument is needed.
            
            
              § 821.49
              Issues on appeal.
              (a) On appeal, the Board will consider only the following issues:
              (1) Are the findings of fact each supported by a preponderance of reliable, probative and substantial evidence?
              (2) Are conclusions made in accordance with law, precedent and policy?
              (3) Are the questions on appeal substantial?
              (4) Have any prejudicial errors occurred?

              (b) If the Board determines that the law judge erred in any respect, or that his or her initial decision or order should be changed, the Board may make any necessary findings and may issue an order in lieu of the law judge's initial decision or order, or may remand the proceeding for any such purpose as the Board may deem necessary.
            
            
              § 821.50
              Petition for rehearing, reargument, reconsideration or modification of an order of the Board.
              (a) General. Any party to a proceeding may petition the Board for rehearing, reargument, reconsideration or modification of a Board order on appeal from a law judge's initial decision or order. An initial decision or appealable order of a law judge that has become final because no timely appeal was taken therefrom may not be the subject of a petition under this section.
              (b) Timing and service. The petition must be filed with the Board, and simultaneously served on the other parties, within 30 days after the date of service of the Board's order on appeal from the law judge's initial decision or order.
              (c) Content. The petition shall state briefly and specifically the matters of record alleged to have been erroneously decided, and the ground or grounds relied upon. If the petition is based, in whole or in part, upon new matter, it shall set forth such new matter and shall contain affidavits of prospective witnesses, authenticated documents, or both, or an explanation of why such substantiation is unavailable, and shall explain why such new matter could not have been discovered in the exercise of due diligence prior to the date on which the evidentiary record closed. To the extent the petition is not based upon new matter, the Board will not consider arguments that could have been made in the appeal or reply briefs received prior to the Board's decision.
              (d) Repetitious petitions. Repetitious petitions will not be entertained by the Board, and will be summarily dismissed.
              (e) Reply to petition. Any other party to the proceeding may file a reply to the petition within 15 days after the date on which the petition was served on that party. A copy of such reply shall simultaneously be served on the petitioner and any other parties to the proceeding.
              (f) Stay of effective date of Board's order. The filing of a petition under this section shall operate to stay the effective date of the Board's order, unless the Board directs otherwise.

            Subpart I—Special Rules Applicable to Proceedings Involving Emergency and Other Immediately Effective Orders
            
              § 821.52
              General.
              (a) Applicability. This subpart shall apply to any order issued by the Administrator under 49 U.S.C. 44709 as an emergency order, as an order not designated as an emergency order but later amended to be an emergency order, and any order designated as immediately effective or effective immediately.
              (b) Effective date of emergency. The procedure set forth herein shall apply as of the date on which written advice of the emergency character of the Administrator's order is received and docketed by the Board.
              (c) Computation of time. Time shall be computed in accordance with the provisions of § 821.10.
              (d) Waiver. Except as provided in § 821.54(f), or where the law judge or the Board determines that it would unduly burden another party or the Board, a certificate holder (respondent) affected by an emergency or other immediately effective order of the Administrator may, at any time after filing an appeal from such an order, waive the applicability of the accelerated time limits of this subpart; however, such a waiver shall not serve to lengthen any period of time for doing an act prescribed by this subpart which expired before the date on which the waiver was made.
              (e) Acceptable methods of filing and service. All documents submitted by a party in a proceeding governed by this subpart must be filed with the Board by overnight delivery, facsimile or electronic mail, and simultaneously served on all other parties by the same means. If filing by electronic mail, parties must adhere to the requirements in § 821.7(a)(3).

              § 821.53
              Appeal.
              (a) Time within which to file appeal. An appeal from an emergency or other immediately effective order of the Administrator must be filed within 10 days after the date on which the Administrator's order was served on the respondent. The respondent shall simultaneously serve a copy of the appeal on the Administrator.
              (b) Form and content of appeal. The appeal may be in letter form. It shall identify the certificate or certificates affected and indicate that an emergency or other immediately effective order of the Administrator is being appealed.
            
            
              § 821.54
              Petition for review of Administrator's determination of emergency.
              (a) Time within which to file petition. A respondent may, within 2 days after the date of receipt of an emergency or other immediately effective order of the Administrator, file with the Board a petition for review of the Administrator's determination that an emergency, requiring the order to be effective immediately, exists. This 2-day time limit is statutory and the Board has no authority to extend it. If the respondent has not previously filed an appeal from the Administrator's emergency or other immediately effective order, the petition shall also be considered a simultaneously filed appeal from the order under § 821.53.
              (b) Form, content and service of petition. The petition may be in letter form. A copy of the Administrator's order, from which review of the emergency determination is sought, must be attached to the petition. If a copy of the order is not attached, the petition will be dismissed. While the petition need only request that the Board review the Administrator's determination as to the existence of an emergency requiring the order be effective immediately, it may also enumerate the respondent's reasons for believing that the Administrator's emergency determination is not warranted in the interest of aviation safety. The respondent may include attachments to the petition for review (e.g., affidavits, other documents or records) limited to evidence the respondent believes supports the reasons enumerated in the petition for why the Administrator's emergency determination is not warranted in the interest of aviation safety. The petition must be filed with the Board by overnight delivery service or facsimile and simultaneously served on the Administrator by the same means.
              (c) Reply to petition. If the petition enumerates the respondent's reasons for believing that the Administrator's emergency determination is unwarranted, the Administrator may, within 2 days after the date of service of the petition, file a reply, which shall be strictly limited to matters of rebuttal. No submissions other than the respondent's petition and the Administrator's reply in rebuttal will be accepted, except in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.
              (d) Hearing. No hearing shall be held on a petition for review of an emergency determination. However, the law judge may, on his or her own initiative, and strictly in keeping with the prohibition on ex parte communications set forth in § 821.61, solicit from the parties additional information to supplement that previously provided by the parties.
              (e) Disposition. Within 5 days after the Board's receipt of the petition, the chief law judge (or, if the case has been assigned to a law judge other than the chief law judge, the law judge to whom the case is assigned) shall dispose of the petition by written order, and, in so doing, shall consider whether, based on the acts and omissions alleged in the Administrator's order, and assuming the truth of such factual allegations, the Administrator's emergency determination was appropriate under the circumstances, in that it supports a finding that aviation safety would likely be compromised by a stay of the effectiveness of the order during the pendency of the respondent's appeal. In making this determination, however, the law judge is not so limited to the order's factual allegations themselves, but also shall permit evidence, if appropriate, pertaining to the propriety of the emergency determination, presented by the respondent with the petition and the Administrator with the reply to the petition. This evidence can include affidavits or other such records.
              (f) Effect of law judge's ruling. If the law judge grants the petition, the effectiveness of the Administrator's order shall be stayed until final disposition of the respondent's appeal by a law judge or by the Board. In such cases, the remaining provisions of this subpart (§§ 821.55-821.57) shall continue to apply, unless the respondent, with the Administrator's consent, waives their applicability. If the petition is denied, the Administrator's order shall remain in effect, and the remaining provisions of this subpart shall continue to apply, unless their applicability is waived by the respondent. The law judge's ruling on the petition shall be final, and is not appealable to the Board. However, in the event of an appeal to the Board from a law judge's decision on the merits of the emergency or other immediately effective order, the Board may, at its discretion, note, in its order disposing of the appeal, its views on the law judge's ruling on the petition, and such views shall serve as binding precedent in all future cases.

              § 821.55
              Complaint, answer to complaint, motions and discovery.
              (a) Complaint. In proceedings governed by this subpart, the Administrator's complaint shall be filed and simultaneously served on the respondent within 3 days after the date on which the Administrator received the respondent's appeal, or within 3 days after the date of service of an order disposing of a petition for review of an emergency determination, whichever is later.
              (b) Answer to complaint. The respondent shall file with the Board an answer to the complaint within 5 days after the date on which the complaint was served by the Administrator, and shall simultaneously serve a copy of the answer on the Administrator. Failure by the respondent to deny the truth of any allegation or allegations in the complaint may be deemed an admission of the truth of the allegation or allegations not answered. The answer shall also identify any affirmative defenses that the respondent intends to raise at the hearing.
              (c) Motion to dismiss and motion for more definite statement. In proceedings governed by this subpart, no motion to dismiss the complaint or for a more definite statement of the complaint's allegations shall be made, but the substance thereof may be stated in the respondent's answer. The law judge may permit or require a more definite statement or other amendment to any pleading at the hearing, upon good cause shown and upon just and reasonable terms.
              (d) Discovery. Discovery is authorized in proceedings governed by this subpart. Given the short time available for discovery, the parties shall cooperate to ensure timely completion of the discovery process prior to the hearing. Discovery requests shall be served by the parties as soon as possible. A motion to compel discovery should be expeditiously filed where any dispute arises, and the law judge shall promptly rule on such a motion. Time limits for compliance with discovery requests shall be set by the parties so as to accommodate, and not conflict with, the accelerated adjudication schedule set forth in this subpart. The provisions of § 821.19 shall apply, modified as necessary to meet the exigencies of this subpart's accelerated timeframes.

              Hearing and initial decision or appealable order of law judge.
              (a) Notice of hearing. Within 3 days after the date on which the Board receives the Administrator's complaint, or immediately upon the issuance of a law judge's order disposing of a petition for review of the Administrator's emergency determination, if later, the parties shall be served with a written notice of hearing, setting forth the date, time and place of the hearing. The hearing shall be set for a date no later than 30 days after the date on which the respondent's appeal was received and docketed. To the extent that they are not inconsistent with this section, the provisions of § 821.37(a) shall also apply.
              (b) Conduct of hearing. The provisions of §§ 821.38, 821.39 and 821.40, concerning the taking of evidence, argument and submissions by the parties, and the composition of the hearing record, shall apply to proceedings governed by this subpart.
              (c) Initial decision and effect of initial decision or appealable order. The law judge's initial decision shall be made orally on the record at the termination of the hearing. The provisions of § 821.42, concerning the content of the initial decision, the furnishing of copies of the initial decision to the parties and the issuance date of the initial decision, and the provisions of § 821.43, concerning the effect of the law judge's initial decision or appealable order and any appeal therefrom, shall apply to proceedings governed by this subpart.
            
            
              § 821.57
              Procedure on appeal.
              (a) Time within which to file notice of appeal. A party may appeal from a law judge's initial decision or appealable order by filing with the Board, and simultaneously serving on the other parties, a notice of appeal, within 2 days after the date on which the initial decision was orally rendered or the appealable order was served. The time limitations for the filing of documents respecting appeals governed by this subpart will not be extended by reason of the unavailability of the hearing transcript.
              (b) Briefs and oral argument. Each appeal in proceedings governed by this subpart must be perfected, within 5 days after the date on which the notice of appeal was filed, by the filing, and simultaneous service on the other parties, of a brief in support of the appeal. Any other party to the proceeding may file a brief in reply to the appeal brief within 7 days after the date on which the appeal brief was served on that party. A copy of the reply brief shall simultaneously be served on the appealing party and any other parties to the proceeding. Aside from the time limits specifically mandated by this paragraph, the provisions of §§ 821.7(a)(3) and 821.48 shall apply.
              (c) Issues on appeal. The provisions of § 821.49(a) and (b) shall apply in proceedings governed by this subpart.
              (d) Petition for rehearing, reargument, reconsideration or modification of order. The only petitions for rehearing, reargument, reconsideration or modification of an order which the Board will entertain in proceedings governed by this subpart are those based on the ground that new matter has been discovered. Such petitions must:
              (1) Set forth the new matter;
              (2) Contain affidavits of prospective witnesses, authenticated documents, or both, or an explanation of why such substantiation is unavailable; and
              (3) Contain a statement explaining why such new matter could not have been discovered in the exercise of due diligence prior to the date on which the evidentiary record closed.

              § 821.60
              Definitions.
              As used in this subpart:
              
                Board decisional employee means a Board Member, law judge or other employee who is, or who may reasonably be expected to be, involved in the decisional process of the proceeding;
              
                Ex parte communication means an oral or written communication not on the public record with respect to which reasonable prior notice to all parties is not given, but does not include requests for status reports on any matter or proceeding covered by this part.
            
            
              § 821.61
              Prohibited ex parte communications.

              (a) The prohibitions of this section shall apply from the time a petition for review or an appeal is filed unless the person responsible for the communication has knowledge that a petition for review or an appeal will be filed, in which case the prohibitions shall apply at the time of the acquisition of such knowledge. Such prohibitions shall continue until the time of the Board's final disposition of the petition, appeal and any ancillary matters, such as the adjudication of a claim for fees and expenses under the Equal Access to Justice Act.
              
              (b) Except to the extent required for the disposition of ex parte matters as authorized by law:
              (1) No interested person outside the Board shall make or knowingly cause to be made to any Board decisional employee an ex parte communication relevant to the merits of the proceeding;
              (2) No Board decisional employee shall make or knowingly cause to be made to any interested person outside the Board an ex parte communication relevant to the merits of the proceeding. Ex parte communications solely relating to matters of Board procedure or practice are not prohibited by this section.
            
            
              § 821.62
              Procedures for handling ex parte communications.
              A Board decisional employee who receives, makes or knowingly causes to be made a communication prohibited by § 821.61 shall place in the public record of the proceeding:
              (a) All such written communications;
              (b) Memoranda stating the substance of all such oral communications; and
              (c) All written responses, and memoranda stating the substance of all oral responses, to the communications described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
            
            
              § 821.63
              Requirement to show cause and imposition of sanction.
              (a) Upon receipt of a communication made or knowingly caused to be made by a party in violation of § 821.61, the presiding law judge (or the chief law judge, if the proceeding has not been assigned to a law judge) or the Board may, to the extent consistent with the interests of justice and the policy of the underlying statutes it administers, require the party to show cause why its claim or interest in the proceeding should not be dismissed, denied, disregarded or otherwise adversely affected on account of such violation.
              (b) The Board may, to the extent consistent with the interest of justice and the policy of the underlying statutes it administers, consider a violation of § 821.61 sufficient grounds for a decision adverse to a party who has knowingly committed or knowingly caused such a violation to occur. Alternatively, the Board may impose a sanction on the party's attorney or representative, including suspending or barring the attorney or representative from practicing before it, where such action would be appropriate and penalizing the party represented would not be in the interest of justice.
            
          
          
            Subpart K—Judicial Review of Board Orders
            
              § 821.64
              Judicial review.
              (a) General. Judicial review of a final order of the Board may be sought as provided in 49 U.S.C. 1153 and 46110 by the filing of a petition for review with the appropriate United States Court of Appeals or United States District Court, pursuant to the provisions of Pub. L. 112-53, 126 Stat. 1159 (August 3, 2012), 49 U.S.C. 44703 note. Such petition is due within 60 days of the date of entry (i.e., service date) of the Board's order. Under the applicable statutes, any party may appeal the Board's decision. The Board is not a party in interest in such appellate proceedings and, accordingly, does not typically participate in the judicial review of its decisions. In matters appealed by the Administrator, the other parties should anticipate the need to make their own defense.
              (b) Stay pending judicial review. No request for a stay pending judicial review will be entertained unless it is served on the Board within 15 days after the date of service of the Board's order. The non-moving party may, within 5 days after the date of service of such a motion, file a reply thereto.

            (b) Oral argument before the Board will normally not be granted unless the Board finds good cause for such argument. If granted, the parties will be advised of the date.
          
          
            § 825.30
            Action by the Board.

            (b) On review by the Board, if reversible error is found in the Commandant's decision on appeal, the Board may:
            (1) Set aside the entire decision and dismiss the charges if it finds the error incurable; or
            (2) Set aside the order, or conclusions, or findings of the Commandant and remand the case to him for further consideration if it finds the error curable.
            (c) When a matter has been remanded to the Commandant under paragraph (b) of this section, the Commandant may act in accordance with the terms of the order of remand, or he may, as appropriate, further remand the matter to the administrative law judge of the Coast Guard who heard the case, or to another administrative law judge of the Coast Guard, with appropriate directions.

            (1) No interested person outside the Board shall make or knowingly cause to be made to any Board employee an ex parte communication relevant to the merits of the proceeding;

            (f) The Board may, to the extent consistent with the interests of justice and the policy of the underlying statutes administered by the Board, consider a violation of this section sufficient grounds for a decision adverse to a party who has knowingly committed such violation or knowingly caused such violation to occur.

              § 826.1
              Purpose of these rules.
              The Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504 (the Act), provides for the award of attorney fees and other expenses to eligible individuals and entities who are parties to certain administrative proceedings (adversary adjudications) before the National Transportation Safety Board. An eligible party may receive an award when it prevails over the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), unless the FAA's position in the proceeding was substantially justified or special circumstances make an award unjust. The rules in this part describe the parties eligible for awards and the proceedings that are covered. They also explain how to apply for awards, and the procedures and standards this Board will use to make them. As used hereinafter, the term “Administrator” refers to the Administrator of the FAA.

              § 826.2
              When the Act applies.
              The Act applies to any adversary adjudication identified in § 826.3 as covered under the Act.
              [59 FR 30531, June 14, 1994]
            
            
              § 826.3
              Proceedings covered.

              (a) The Act applies to certain adversary adjudications conducted by the Board. These are adjudications under 5 U.S.C. 554 in which the position of the FAA is presented by an attorney or other representative who enters an appearance and participates in the proceedings. Proceedings to grant or renew certificates or documents, hereafter referred to as “licenses,” are excluded, but proceedings to modify, suspend, or revoke licenses or to impose a civil penalty on a flight engineer, mechanic, pilot, or repairman (or person acting in that capacity) are covered if they are otherwise “adversary adjudications.” For the Board, the type of proceeding covered includes (but may not be limited to) aviation enforcement cases appealed to the Board under sections 501, 609, 611 and 901 of the Federal Aviation Act (49 U.S.C. 44101 et seq., 44720-44711, 44715, 46301).

              (b) The Board may also designate a proceeding not listed in paragraph (a) as an adversary adjudication for purposes of the Act by so stating in an order initiating the proceeding or designating the matter for hearing. The Board's failure to designate a proceeding as an adversary adjudication shall not preclude the filing of an application by a party who believes the proceeding is covered by the Act; whether the procedure is covered will then be an issue for resolution in proceedings on the application.
              (c) If a proceeding includes both matters covered by the Act and matters specifically excluded from coverage, any award made will include only fees and expenses related to covered issues.

              § 826.4
              Eligibility of applicants.
              (a) To be eligible for an award of attorney fees and other expenses under the Act, the applicant must be a party to the adversary adjudication for which it seeks an award. The term “party” is defined in 5 U.S.C. 551(3). The applicant must show that it meets all conditions of eligibility set out in this subpart and in subpart B.
              (b) The types of eligible applicants are as follows:
              (1) An individual with a net worth of not more than $2 million;
              (2) The sole owner of an unincorporated business who has a net worth of not more than $7 million, including both personal and business interests, and not more than 500 employees;
              (3) A charitable or other tax-exempt organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) with not more than 500 employees;
              (4) A cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)) with not more than 500 employees; and
              (5) Any other partnership, corporation, association, or public or private organization with a net worth of not more than $7 million and not more than 500 employees.
              (c) For the purpose of eligibility, the net worth and number of employees of an applicant shall be determined as of the date the proceeding was initiated.
              (d) An applicant who owns an unincorporated business will be considered an “individual” rather than a “sole owner of an unincorporated business” if the issues on which the applicant prevails are related primarily to personal interests rather than to business interests.
              (e) The employees of an applicant include all persons who regularly perform services for remuneration for the applicant, under the applicant's direction and control. Part-time employees shall be included on a proportional basis.
              (f) The net worth and number of employees of the applicant and all of its affiliates shall be aggregated to determine eligibility. Any individual, corporation, or other entity that directly or indirectly controls or owns a majority of the voting shares or other interest of the applicant, or any corporation or other entity of which the applicant directly or indirectly owns or controls a majority of the voting shares or other interest, will be considered an affiliate for purposes of this part, unless the administrative law judge determines that such treatment would be unjust and contrary to the purposes of the Act in light of the actual relationship between the affiliated entities. In addition, the administrative law judge may determine that financial relationships of the applicant other than those described in this paragraph constitute special circumstances that would make an award unjust.
              (g) An applicant that participates in a proceeding primarily on behalf of one or more other persons or entities that would be ineligible is not itself eligible for an award.
              [46 FR 48209, Oct. 1, 1981, as amended at 54 FR 10332, Mar. 13, 1989]
            
            
              § 826.5
              Standards for awards.
              (a) A prevailing applicant may receive an award for fees and expenses incurred in connection with a proceeding, or in a significant and discrete substantive portion of the proceeding, unless the position of the agency over which the applicant has prevailed was substantially justified. The burden of proof that an award should not be made to an eligible prevailing applicant is on the agency counsel, who may avoid an award by showing that the agency's position was reasonable in law and fact.
              (b) An award will be reduced or denied if the applicant has unduly or unreasonably protracted the proceeding or if special circumstances make the award sought unjust.
            
            
              
              § 826.6
              Allowable fees and expenses.
              (a) Awards will be based on rates customarily charged by persons engaged in the business of acting as attorneys, agents, and expert witnesses, even if the services were made available without charge or at a reduced rate to the applicant.
              (b)(1) No award for the fee of an attorney or agent under these rules may exceed $75 indexed as follows:
              
                ER14JN94.001
              
              The CPI to be used is the annual average CPI, All Urban Consumers, U.S. City Average, All Items, except where a local, All Item index is available. Where a local index is available, but results in a manifest inequity vis-a-vis the U.S. City Average, the U.S. City Average may be used. The numerator of that equation is the yearly average for the year(s) the services were provided, with each year calculated separately. If an annual average CPI for a particular year is not yet available, the prior year's annual average CPI shall be used. This formula increases the $75 statutory cap by indexing it to reflect cost of living increases, as authorized in 5 U.S.C. 504(b)(1)(A)(ii). Application of these increased rate caps requires affirmative findings under § 821.6(c) of this chapter. For ease of application, available U.S. City figures are reproduced as follows:

              (2) No award to compensate an expert witness may exceed the highest rate at which the agency pays expert witnesses. However, an award may also include the reasonable expenses of the attorney, agent, or witness as a separate item, if the attorney, agent, or witness ordinarily charges clients separately for such expenses.
              (c) In determining the reasonableness of the fee sought for an attorney, agent, or expert witness, the administrative law judge shall consider the following:
              (1) If the attorney, agent, or witness is in private practice, his or her customary fee for similar services, or if an employee of the applicant, the fully allocated cost of the services;
              (2) The prevailing rate for similar services in the community in which the attorney, agent, or witness ordinarily performs services;
              (3) The time actually spent in the representation of the applicant;
              (4) The time reasonably spent in light of the difficulty or complexity of the issues in the proceeding; and
              (5) Such other factors as may bear on the value of the services provided.
              (d) The reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test, project, or similar matter prepared on behalf of a party may be awarded, to the extent that the charge for the service does not exceed the prevailing rate for similar services, and the study or other matter was necessary for preparation of the applicant's case.

              § 826.7
              Rulemaking on maximum rates for attorney fees.

              (a) In addition to increases based on cost of living (see § 826.6), attorney fees in some or all of the proceedings covered by this part may also be increased beyond the statutory cap of $75 if warranted by special factors (such as limited availability of attorneys qualified to handle certain types of proceedings). The Board will conduct any rulemaking proceedings for this purpose under the informal rulemaking procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act.

              (b) Any person may file with the Board a petition for rulemaking to increase the maximum rate for attorney fees by demonstrating that a special factor(s) justifies a higher fee. The petition shall identify the rate the petitioner believes the Board should establish and the proceeding(s) or types of proceedings in which the rate should be used. It should also explain fully the reasons why the higher rate is warranted. The Board will respond to the petition within 60 days after it is filed, by initiating a rulemaking proceeding, denying the petition, or taking other appropriate action.

              When an applicant is entitled to an award because it prevails over an agency of the United States that participates in a proceeding before the Board and takes a position that is not substantially justified, the award shall be made against that agency.

              § 826.21
              Contents of application.
              (a) An application for an award of fees and expenses under the Act shall identify the applicant and the proceeding for which an award is sought. The application shall show that the applicant has prevailed and identify the position of the agency in the proceeding that the applicant alleges was not substantially justified. Unless the applicant is an individual, the application shall also state the number of employees of the applicant and describe briefly the type and purpose of its organization or business.
              (b) The application shall also include a statement that the applicant's net worth does not exceed $2 million (if an individual) or $7 million (for all other applicants, including their affiliates). However, an applicant may omit this statement if:
              (1) It attaches a copy of a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service that it qualifies as an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)), or in the case of a tax-exempt organization not required to obtain a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service on its exempt status, a statement that describes the basis for the applicant's belief that it qualifies under such section; or
              (2) It states that it is a cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)).
              (c) The application shall state the amount of fees and expenses for which an award is sought.
              (d) The application may also include any other matters that the applicant wishes this agency to consider in determining whether and in what amount an award should be made.
              (e) The application shall be signed by the applicant or an authorized officer or attorney for the applicant. It shall also contain or be accompanied by a written verification under oath or under penalty of perjury that the information provided in the application is true and correct.

              § 826.22
              Net worth exhibit.
              (a) Each applicant except a qualified tax-exempt organization or cooperative association must provide with its application a detailed exhibit showing the net worth of the applicant and any affiliates (as defined in § 826.4(f) of this part) when the proceeding was initiated. The exhibit may be in any form convenient to the applicant that provides full disclosure of the applicant's and its affiliates' assets and liabilities and is sufficient to determine whether the applicant qualifies under the standards in this part. The administrative law judge may require an applicant to file additional information to determine the eligibility for an award.

              (b) Ordinarily, the net worth exhibit will be included in the public record of the proceeding. However, an applicant that objects to public disclosure of information in any portion of the exhibit and believes there are legal grounds for withholding it from disclosure may submit that portion of the exhibit directly to the administrative law judge in a sealed envelope labeled “Confidential Financial Information,” accompanied by a motion to withhold the information from public disclosure. The motion shall describe the information sought to be withheld and explain, in detail, why it falls within one or more of the specific exemptions from mandatory disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b) (1) through (9), why public disclosure of the information would adversely affect the applicant, and why disclosure is not required in the public interest. The material in question shall be served on counsel representing the agency against which the applicant seeks an award, but need not be served on any other party to the proceeding. If the administrative law judge finds that the information should not be withheld from disclosure, it shall be placed in the public record of the proceeding. Otherwise, any request to inspect or copy the exhibit shall be disposed of in accordance with the Board's established procedures under the Freedom of Information Act as inplemented by Part 801 of the Board's rules.
            
            
              § 826.23
              Documentation of fees and expenses.
              The application shall be accompanied by full documentation of the fees and expenses, including the cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test, project or similar matter, for which an award is sought. A separate itemized statement shall be submitted for each professional firm or individual whose services are covered by the application, showing the hours spend in connection with the proceeding by each individual, a description of the specific services performed, the rate at which each fee has been computed, any expenses for which reimbursement is sought, the total amount claimed, and the total amount paid or payable by the applicant or by any other person or entity for the services provided. The administrative law judge may require the applicant to provide vouchers, receipts, or other substantiation for any expenses claimed.
            
            
              § 826.24
              When an application may be filed.
              (a) An application may be filed whenever the applicant has prevailed in the proceeding, but in no case no later than the 30 days after the Board's final disposition of the proceeding. This 30-day deadline is statutory and the Board has no authority to extend it.
              (b) If review or reconsideration is sought or taken of a decision to which an applicant believes it has prevailed, proceedings for the award of fees shall be stayed pending final disposition of the underlying controversy.
              (c) For purposes of this rule, final disposition means the later of (1) the date on which an unappealed initial decision by an administrative law judge becomes administratively final; (2) issuance of an order disposing of any petitions for reconsideration of the Board's final order in the proceeding; (3) if no petition for reconsideration is filed, the last date on which such a petition could have been filed; or (4) issuance of a final order or any other final resolution of a proceeding, such as a settlement or voluntary dismissal, which is not subject to a petition for reconsideration.

Unless agency counsel requests an extension of time for filing or files a statement of intent to negotiate under paragraph (b) of this section, failure to file an answer within the 30-day period may be treated as a consent to the award requested.
              (b) If agency counsel and the applicant believe that the issues in the fee application can be settled, they may jointly file a statement of their intent to negotiate a settlement. The filing of this statement shall extend the time for filing an answer for an additional 30 days, and further extensions may be granted by the administrative law judge upon request by agency counsel and the applicant.

              (c) The answer shall explain in detail any objections to the award requested and identify the facts relied on in support of agency counsel's position. If the answer is based on any alleged facts not already in the record of the proceeding, agency counsel shall include with the answer either supporting affidavits or a request for further proceedings under § 826.36.
            
            
              § 826.33
              Reply.
              Within 15 days after service of an answer, the applicant may file a reply. If the reply is based on any alleged facts not already in the record of the proceeding, the applicant shall include with the reply either supporting affidavits or a request for further proceedings under § 826.36.
            
            
              § 826.34
              Comments by other parties.
              Any party to a proceeding other than the applicant and agency counsel may file comments on an application within 30 days after it is served or on an answer within 15 days after it is served. A commenting party may not participate further in proceedings on the application unless the administrative law judge determines that the public interest requires such participation in order to permit full exploration of matters raised in the comments.
            
            
              § 826.35
              Settlement.
              The applicant and agency counsel may agree on a proposed settlement of the award before final action on the application, either in connection with a settlement of the underlying proceeding, or after the underlying proceeding has been concluded. If a prevailing party and agency counsel agree on a proposed settlement of an award before an application has been filed, the application shall be filed with the proposed settlement.
            
            
              § 826.36
              Further proceedings.
              (a) Ordinarily the determination of an award will be made on the basis of the written record; however, on request of either the applicant or agency counsel, or on his or her own initiative, the administrative law judge assigned to the matter may order further proceedings, such as an informal conference, oral argument, additional written submissions, or an evidentiary hearing. Such further proceedings shall be held only when necessary for full and fair resolution of the issues arising from the application and shall be conducted as promptly as possible.
              (b) A request that the administrative law judge order further proceedings under this section shall specifically identify the information sought or the disputed issues and shall explain why the additional proceedings are necessary to resolve the issues.
            
            
              § 826.37
              Decision.
              The administrative law judge shall issue an initial decision on the application within 60 days after completion of proceedings on the application. The decision shall include written findings and conclusions on the applicant's eligibility and status as a prevailing party and an explanation of the reasons for any difference between the amount requested and the amount awarded. The decision shall also include, if at issue, findings on whether the agency's position was substantially justified, whether the applicant unduly protracted the proceedings, or whether special circumstances make an award unjust.
            
            
              § 826.38
              Board review.
              Either the applicant or agency counsel may seek review of the initial decision on the fee application, or the Board may decide to review the decision on its own initiative, in accordance with subpart H of part 821 for FAA safety enforcement matters appealed under section 609 of the Federal Aviation Act. If neither the applicant nor agency counsel seeks review and the Board does not take review on its own initiative, the initial decision on the application shall become a final decision of the Board 30 days after it is issued. Whether to review a decision is a matter within the discretion of the Board. If review is taken, the Board will issue a final decision on the application or remand the application to the administrative law judge who issued the initial fee award determination for further proceedings.
            
            
              § 826.39
              Judicial review.
              Judicial review of final Board decisions on awards may be sought as provided in 5 U.S.C. 504(c)(2).
            
            
              
              § 826.40
              Payment of award.
              Within 5 days of the Board's service of a final decision granting an award of fees and expenses to an applicant, the Administrator shall transmit to the applicant instructions explaining how the applicant may obtain the award. These instructions may require, but are not limited to, the submission of the following information to the Administrator: a statement that the applicant will not seek review of the decision in the United States courts, bank routing numbers to which the Administrator may transmit payment, and the applicant's tax identification or Social Security number. The Administrator will pay the applicant the amount awarded within 60 days of receiving the necessary information from the applicant, unless judicial review of the award or of the underlying decision of the adversary adjudication has been sought by the applicant or any other party to the proceeding.

              [60 FR 40112, Aug. 7, 1995]
            
            
              § 830.2
              Definitions.
              As used in this part the following words or phrases are defined as follows:
              
                Aircraft accident means an occurrence associated with the operation of an aircraft which takes place between the time any person boards the aircraft with the intention of flight and all such persons have disembarked, and in which any person suffers death or serious injury, or in which the aircraft receives substantial damage. For purposes of this part, the definition of “aircraft accident” includes “unmanned aircraft accident,” as defined herein.
              
                Civil aircraft means any aircraft other than a public aircraft.
              
                Fatal injury means any injury which results in death within 30 days of the accident.
              
                Incident means an occurrence other than an accident, associated with the operation of an aircraft, which affects or could affect the safety of operations.
              
                Operator means any person who causes or authorizes the operation of an aircraft, such as the owner, lessee, or bailee of an aircraft.
              
                Public aircraft means an aircraft used only for the United States Government, or an aircraft owned and operated (except for commercial purposes) or exclusively leased for at least 90 continuous days by a government other than the United States Government, including a State, the District of Columbia, a territory or possession of the United States, or a political subdivision of that government. “Public aircraft” does not include a government-owned aircraft transporting property for commercial purposes and does not include a government-owned aircraft transporting passengers other than: transporting (for other than commercial purposes) crewmembers or other persons aboard the aircraft whose presence is required to perform, or is associated with the performance of, a governmental function such as firefighting, search and rescue, law enforcement, aeronautical research, or biological or geological resource management; or transporting (for other than commercial purposes) persons aboard the aircraft if the aircraft is operated by the Armed Forces or an intelligence agency of the United States. Notwithstanding any limitation relating to use of the aircraft for commercial purposes, an aircraft shall be considered to be a public aircraft without regard to whether it is operated by a unit of government on behalf of another unit of government pursuant to a cost reimbursement agreement, if the unit of government on whose behalf the operation is conducted certifies to the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration that the operation was necessary to respond to a significant and imminent threat to life or property (including natural resources) and that no service by a private operator was reasonably available to meet the threat.
              
                Serious injury means any injury which: (1) Requires hospitalization for more than 48 hours, commencing within 7 days from the date of the injury was received; (2) results in a fracture of any bone (except simple fractures of fingers, toes, or nose); (3) causes severe hemorrhages, nerve, muscle, or tendon damage; (4) involves any internal organ; or (5) involves second- or third-degree burns, or any burns affecting more than 5 percent of the body surface.
              
                Substantial damage means damage or failure which adversely affects the structural strength, performance, or flight characteristics of the aircraft, and which would normally require major repair or replacement of the affected component. Engine failure or damage limited to an engine if only one engine fails or is damaged, bent fairings or cowling, dented skin, small punctured holes in the skin or fabric, ground damage to rotor or propeller blades, and damage to landing gear, wheels, tires, flaps, engine accessories, brakes, or wingtips are not considered “substantial damage” for the purpose of this part.
              
                Unmanned aircraft accident means an occurrence associated with the operation of any public or civil unmanned aircraft system that takes place between the time that the system is activated with the purpose of flight and the time that the system is deactivated at the conclusion of its mission, in which:
              (1) Any person suffers death or serious injury; or
              (2) The aircraft has a maximum gross takeoff weight of 300 pounds or greater and sustains substantial damage.

            Subpart A—General
            
              § 831.1
              Applicability of this subpart.
              (a) Except as provided in Subpart E of this part regarding marine casualties, and unless specified by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the provisions of this subpart apply to all NTSB investigations conducted under its statutory authority.
              (b) Consistent with its statutory authority, the NTSB conducts investigations of transportation accidents that include, but are not limited to: accidents, collisions, crashes, derailments, explosions, incidents, mishaps, ruptures, or other similar accidents. Use of the term “accident” throughout this part includes all such occurrences.
              (c) Throughout this part, the term “IIC” means the NTSB investigator-in-charge.
            
            
              § 831.2
              Responsibility of the NTSB.
              The NTSB is required to investigate—
              (a) Aviation accidents as described in subpart B of this part;
              (b) Highway accidents as described in subpart C of this part;
              (c) Railroad, pipeline, and hazardous materials accidents as described in subpart D of this part; and
              (d) Any accident that occurs in connection with the transportation of people or property that, in the judgment of the NTSB, is catastrophic, involves problems of a recurring nature or would otherwise carry out the intent of its authorizing statutes. This authority includes selected events involving the transportation of hazardous materials, including their release.
            
            
              § 831.3
              Authority of Directors.
              Subject to the provisions of § 831.2 of this part and part 800 of this chapter, the Directors of the Office of Aviation Safety, Office of Highway Safety, or Office of Railroad, Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Investigations, may order an investigation into any transportation accident.
            
            
              § 831.4
              Nature of investigation.
              (a) General. The NTSB conducts investigations, or has them conducted, to determine the facts, conditions, and circumstances relating to an accident. The NTSB uses these results to determine one or more probable causes of an accident, and to issue safety recommendations to prevent or mitigate the effects of a similar accident. The NTSB is required to report on the facts and circumstances of accidents it investigates. The NTSB begins an investigation by monitoring the situation and assessing available facts to determine the appropriate investigative response. Following an initial assessment, the NTSB notifies persons and organizations it anticipates will be affected as to the extent of its expected investigative response.
              (b) NTSB products. An investigation may result in a report or brief of the NTSB's conclusions or other products designed to improve transportation safety. Other products may include factual records, safety recommendations, and other safety information.
              

              (c) NTSB investigations are fact-finding proceedings with no adverse parties. The investigative proceedings are not subject to the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.), and are not conducted for the purpose of determining the rights, liabilities, or blame of any person or entity, as they are not adjudicatory proceedings.
            
            
              § 831.5
              Priority of NTSB investigations.
              (a) Relationships with other agencies. (1) Except as provided in 49 U.S.C. 1131(a)(2)(B) and (C) regarding suspected criminal actions, an investigation conducted under the authority of the NTSB has priority over any investigation conducted by another Federal agency.
              (2) The NTSB will provide for appropriate participation by other Federal agencies in any NTSB investigation. Such agencies may not participate in the NTSB's probable cause determination.
              (3) The NTSB has first right to access wreckage, information, and resources, and to interview witnesses the NTSB deems pertinent to its investigation.
              (4) As indicated in § 831.9(c) of this part, the NTSB has exclusive authority to decide when and how the testing and examination of evidence will occur.
              (5) The NTSB and other Federal agencies will exchange information obtained or developed about the accident in the course of their investigations in a timely manner. Nothing in this section prohibits the NTSB from sharing factual information with other agencies.
              (6) Incident command system. The NTSB recognizes the role of incident command systems to address emergencies. The NTSB does not assume the role of a first responder agency.
              (i) The NTSB IIC or his designee will participate in the incident command system to identify and coordinate investigative needs related to the preservation and collection of information and evidence.
              (ii) The NTSB may collect information and evidence from the incident command in a timely and reasonable manner so as not to interfere with its operations.
              (b) Investigations by other Federal agencies. (1) Nothing in this section limits the authority of any Federal agency to conduct an investigation of an accident or incident under applicable provisions of law or to obtain information directly from parties involved in, and witnesses to, a transportation accident. Other agencies are expected to coordinate with the NTSB IIC to avoid interference with, and duplication of, the NTSB's investigative efforts. These agencies will not participate in the NTSB's probable cause determination.
              (2) The NTSB recognizes that state and local agencies may conduct activities related to an accident under investigation by the NTSB. These agencies will not participate in the NTSB's probable cause determination.
              (3) Except as described in § 831.30 of this part regarding highway investigations, the NTSB may request that a Federal agency provide to the NTSB the results of that agency's investigation of an accident when such investigation is intended to result in safety improvements or remedial action. The NTSB will not routinely request regulatory enforcement records or investigation results.
            
            
              § 831.6
              Request to withhold information.
              (a) Applicability. This section applies to information the NTSB receives from any source that may be subject to the Trade Secrets Act (18 U.S.C. 1905) or the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552).
              (b) Disclosure. The NTSB is authorized by 49 U.S.C. 1114(b) to disclose, under certain circumstances, confidential commercial information that would otherwise be subject to penalties for disclosure under the Trade Secrets Act, or excepted from disclosure under FOIA. The NTSB may exercise this authority when disclosure is necessary to support a key finding, a safety recommendation, or the NTSB's statement of probable cause of an accident.
              (c) Disclosure procedures. Information submitted to the NTSB that the submitter believes qualifies as a trade secret or as confidential commercial information subject either to the Trade Secrets Act or Exemption 4 of FOIA must be so identified by the submitter on each page that contains such information. In accordance with 49 U.S.C. 1114(b), the NTSB will provide the submitter of identified information (or information the NTSB has reason to believe qualifies as subject to the Trade Secrets Act or Exemption 4 of FOIA) the opportunity to comment on any disclosure contemplated by the NTSB. In all instances in which the NTSB decides to disclose such information pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 1114(b) or 5 U.S.C. 552, the NTSB will provide at least 10 days' advance notice to the submitter.
              (d) Voluntarily provided safety information. (1) The NTSB will not disclose safety-related information voluntarily submitted to the NTSB if the information is not related to the exercise of the NTSB's investigation authority, and if the NTSB finds disclosure of the information might inhibit the voluntary provision of that type of information.
              (2) The NTSB will review voluntarily provided safety information for confidential content, and will de-identify or anonymize any confidential content referenced in its products.
              (e) Other. Any person may make written objection to the public disclosure of any other information, such as interview summaries or transcripts, contained in any report or document filed, or otherwise obtained by the NTSB, stating the grounds for such objection. The NTSB on its own initiative or if such objection is made, may order such information withheld from public disclosure, when, in its judgment, the information may be withheld under the provisions of an exemption to the FOIA (see part 801 of this chapter), and its release is found not to be in the public interest.
            
            
              § 831.7
              Representation during an interview.
              (a) Any person interviewed in any manner by the NTSB has the right to be accompanied during the interview by no more than one representative of the witness's choosing. The representative—
              (1) May be an attorney;
              (2) May provide support and counsel to the witness;
              (3) May not supplement the witness's testimony; and
              (4) May not advocate for the interests of a witness's other affiliations (e.g., the witnesses employer).
              (b) An investigator conducting the interview may take any necessary action (including removal of the representative from the interview) to ensure a witness's representative acts in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section during the interview, and to prevent conduct that may be disruptive to the interview.
            
            
              § 831.8
              Investigator-in-charge.
              In addition to the subpoena and deposition authority delegated to investigative officers under this chapter, a person designated as IIC for an investigation is authorized to—
              (a) Organize, conduct, control, and manage the field phase of an investigation, even when a Board Member is present;
              (b) Coordinate all resources and supervise all persons (including persons not employed by the NTSB) involved in an on-site investigation; and
              (c) Continue his or her organizational and management responsibilities through all phases of the investigation, including consideration and adoption of a report or brief determining one or more probable causes of an accident.
            
            
              § 831.9
              Authority during investigations.
              (a) General authority of investigators. To carry out the statutory responsibilities of the agency, an NTSB investigator may—
              (1) Conduct hearings;
              (2) Administer oaths;
              (3) Require, by subpoena or otherwise, the production of evidence and witnesses;
              (4) Enter any property where an accident subject to the NTSB's jurisdiction has occurred, or wreckage from any such accident is located, and take all actions necessary to conduct a complete investigation of the accident;

              (5) Inspect, photograph, or copy any records or information (including medical records pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section), and correspondence regardless of the date of their creation or modification, for the purpose of investigating an accident;
              (6) Take possession of wreckage, records or other information if it determines such possession is necessary for an investigation; and
              (7) Question any person having knowledge relevant to a transportation accident.
              (b) Subpoenas. The NTSB may issue a subpoena, enforceable in Federal District Court, to obtain testimony or evidence related to an accident, including but not limited to personal electronic devices.
              (1) The NTSB's authority to issue subpoenas includes access to medical records and specimens.

              (2) For purposes of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), Public Law 104-191, and the regulations promulgated by the DHHS, 45 CFR 164.501 et seq., the NTSB is a “public health authority” to which protected health information may be disclosed by a HIPAA “covered entity” without the prior written authorization of the subject of the records. In addition, the NTSB may issue a subpoena to gain access to such information.
              (c) Examination of evidence. In accordance with 49 U.S.C. 1134(d), the NTSB has exclusive authority to decide timing, manner and method of testing and examination of evidence, and extraction of data.
            
            
              § 831.10
              Autopsies and postmortem testing.
              When a person dies as a result of having been involved in a transportation accident within the jurisdiction of the NTSB—
              (a) The NTSB is authorized to obtain, with or without reimbursement, a copy of a report of autopsy performed by a State or local authority on such person.
              (b) The NTSB may order an autopsy or other postmortem tests of any person as may be related to its investigation of a transportation accident. The IIC may direct that an autopsy or other test be performed if necessary for an investigation. Provisions of local law protecting religious beliefs with respect to autopsies shall be observed to the extent they are consistent with the needs of the investigation.
            
            
              § 831.11
              Parties to the investigation.
              (a) Participants. (1) The IIC may designate one or more entities to serve as parties in an investigation. Party status is limited to those persons, Federal, state, or local government agencies and organizations whose employees, functions, activities, or products were involved in the accident and that can provide suitable qualified technical personnel to actively assist in an investigation. To the extent practicable, a representative proposed by party organizations to participate in the investigation may not be a person who had direct involvement in the accident under investigation.
              (2) Except for the FAA, no entity has a right to participate in an NTSB investigation as a party.
              (3) The participation of the Administrator of the FAA and other Federal entities in aviation accident investigations is addressed in § 831.21 of this part.
              (4) Participants in an investigation (e.g., party representatives, party coordinators, and/or the larger party organization) must follow all directions and instructions from NTSB representatives. Party status may be revoked or suspended if a party fails to comply with assigned duties and instructions, withholds information, or otherwise acts in a manner prejudicial or disruptive to an investigation.
              (b) Prohibitions on serving as party representatives. (1) In accordance with § 845.6 of this chapter, no party representative may occupy a legal position or be a person who also represents claimants or insurers.
              (2) Failure to comply with these provisions may result in sanctions, including loss of party status.
              (c) Disclosures. (1) The name of a party and its representative may be disclosed in documents the NTSB places in the public docket for the investigation.

              (2) The NTSB may share information considered proprietary or confidential by one party with other parties during the course of an investigation, but will preserve the confidentiality of the information to the greatest extent possible.
              (3) Section 831.6(d) of this part describes how the NTSB will handle voluntarily submitted safety information, and the NTSB's determination whether to share any such information. The NTSB will de-identify the source of such information when deciding to share it.
              (d) Party agreement. Except for representatives of other Federal agencies, all party representatives must sign the “Statement of Party Representatives to NTSB Investigation” (Statement) upon acceptance of party status. Failure to timely sign the statement may result in sanctions, including loss of party status. Representatives of other Federal agencies, while not required to sign the Statement, will be provided notice of and must comply with the responsibilities and limitations set forth in the agreement.
              (e) Internal review by a party. (1) To assure coordination of concurrent efforts, a party to an investigation that conducts or authorizes a review of its own processes and procedures as a result of an accident the NTSB is investigating, by signing the party agreement, agrees to, in a timely manner—
              (i) Inform the IIC of the nature of the review; and
              (ii) Provide the IIC with the findings from the review.
              (2) If the findings from a review contain privileged information—,
              (i) The submitting party must inform the IIC that the review contains privileged information;
              (ii) The submitting party must identify the privileged content at the time of submission to the IIC; and
              (iii) The NTSB must, if informed that such information is being submitted, review the information for relevancy to the investigation, and determine whether public disclosure of the information is necessary for the investigation.
              (3) The NTSB may use the protections described in § 831.6 of this part, as applicable, to protect certain findings from public disclosure.
              (4) Investigations performed by other Federal agencies during an NTSB investigation are addressed in § 831.5 of this part.
            
            
              § 831.12
              Access to and release of wreckage, records, mail, and cargo.
              (a) Only persons authorized by the NTSB IIC may be permitted access to wreckage, records, mail, or cargo.
              (b) Wreckage, records, mail, and cargo in the NTSB's custody will be released when the NTSB determines it has no further need for such items. Recipients of released wreckage must sign an acknowledgement of release provided by the NTSB.
            
            
              § 831.13
              Provision and dissemination of investigative information.
              (a) Applicability. This section applies to:
              (1) Information related to the accident or incident;
              (2) Any information collected or compiled by the NTSB as part of its investigation, such as photographs, visual representations of factual data, physical evidence from the scene of the accident, interview statements, wreckage documentation, flight data and cockpit voice recorder information, and surveillance video; and
              (3) Any information regarding the status of an investigation, or activities conducted as part of the investigation.
              (b) Provision of information. All information described in paragraph (a) of this section and obtained by any person or organization participating in the investigation must be promptly provided to the NTSB, except where the NTSB authorizes the party to retain the information.
              (c) Release of information. Parties are prohibited from releasing information obtained during an investigation at any time prior to the NTSB's public release of information unless the release is consistent with the following criteria:
              (1) Information released at the scene of an accident—
              (i) Is limited to factual information concerning the accident and the investigation released in coordination with the IIC; and

              (ii) Will be made by the Board Member present at the scene as the official spokesperson for the NTSB. Additionally, the IIC or representatives from the NTSB's Office of Safety Recommendations and Communications may release information to media representatives, family members, and elected officials as deemed appropriate.
              (2) The release of information described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section by the NTSB at the scene of an accident does not authorize any party to the investigation to comment publicly on the information during the course of the investigation. Any dissemination of factual information by a party may be made only as provided in this section.
              (3) A party may disseminate information related to an investigation to those individuals within its organization who have a need to know for the purpose of addressing a safety issue including preventive or remedial actions. If such internal release of information results in a planned safety improvement, the party must inform the IIC of such planned improvement in a timely manner before it is implemented.
              (4) Any other release of factual information related to the investigation must be approved by the IIC prior to release, including:
              (i) Dissemination within a party organization, for a purpose not described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section;
              (ii) Documents that provide information concerning the investigation, such as written directives or informational updates for release to employees or customers of a party;
              (iii) Information related to the investigation released to an organization or person that is not a party to the investigation;
              (d) The release of recordings or transcripts from certain recorders may be made only in accordance with the statutory limitations of 49 U.S.C. 1114(c) and (d).
            
            
              § 831.14
              Proposed findings.
              (a) General. Any party to the investigation designated under § 831.11 may submit to the NTSB written proposed findings to be drawn from the evidence produced during the course of the investigation, a proposed probable cause, and/or proposed safety recommendation(s) designed to prevent future accidents.
              (b) Timing of submissions. The IIC will inform parties when submissions are due. All written submissions must be received by the IIC by the due date. If there is a Board meeting, the due date will be set prior to the date the matter is published in the Federal Register.
            
            
              § 831.15
              Civil penalties.
              The NTSB is required by the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, Public Law 101-410, 104 Stat. 890, as amended by the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015, Public Law 114-74, sec. 701, 129 Stat. 584 (codified at 28 U.S.C. 2461 note) to adjust the maximum amount of each civil monetary penalty within its jurisdiction by the rate of inflation. Accordingly, for violations of 49 U.S.C. 1132, 1134(b), 1134(f)(1), or 1136(g), the NTSB may assess a civil penalty pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 1155(a) no greater than $1,692 against any person, except a member of the armed forces of the United States or an employee of the Department of Defense subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, when the member or employee is performing official duties.

            Subpart B—Aviation Investigations
            
              § 831.20
              Authority of NTSB in aviation accident investigations.
              (a) Scope. The NTSB is authorized to investigate—
              (1) Each accident involving a civil aircraft in the United States, and any civil aircraft registered in the United States when an accident occurs in international waters;
              (2) Each accident involving a public aircraft as defined in 49 U.S.C. 40102(a)(41), except for aircraft operated by the U.S. Armed Forces or by an intelligence agency of the United States;
              (3) With the participation of appropriate military authorities, each accident involving a military aircraft and—
              (i) a civil aircraft; or
              (ii) certain public aircraft as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
              (b) Authority to examine or test. Pursuant to § 831.9 of this part, a credentialed employee of the NTSB is authorized to examine or test any civil or certain public aircraft, aircraft engine, propeller, appliance, or property aboard such aircraft involved in an accident or incident subject to the NTSB's authority.
            
            
              § 831.21
              Other Government agencies and NTSB aviation investigations.
              (a) Pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 1132(c) and 106(g)(1)(A), the NTSB will provide for the participation of the Administrator of the FAA in the investigation of an aircraft accident when participation is necessary to carry out the duties and powers of the FAA Administrator.
              (b) Title 49 U.S.C. 1131(a)(2) provides for the appropriate participation by other departments, agencies, or instrumentalities of the United States Government in the investigation of an aircraft accident by the NTSB.
              (c) Rights and duties of other Federal agencies. (1) The FAA and other Federal agencies named as parties to an aircraft accident investigation will be accorded the same rights and privileges, and are subject to the same limitations, as other parties. Participation in an investigation includes the duty to timely share with the NTSB any information that has been developed by the FAA or other Federal agency in the exercise of that agency's investigative authority.
              (2) In exercising its authority, the FAA or other Federal agency may obtain information directly from a party to an accident or incident under investigation by the NTSB.
              (3) Information obtained by another Federal agency must be timely shared with the NTSB.
              (4) Investigative activities by another Federal agency must be coordinated to ensure that they do not interfere with the NTSB's investigation.
              (5) Under no circumstances may an NTSB aviation accident investigation for which the FAA or any other Federal agency has conducted fact-finding be considered a joint investigation with shared responsibility. Decisions about what information to include in the public docket will be made by the NTSB.
              (6) Notwithstanding the rights and duties described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (5) of this section, determining the probable cause of an accident is exclusively the right and duty of the NTSB.
              (d) An FAA employee designated to act by the NTSB IIC has the same authority as an NTSB investigator when conducting activities under this part. The investigation remains that of the NTSB.
              (e) Nothing in this section may be construed as inhibiting the FAA from proceeding with activities intended to fulfill a statutory requirement or objective, including the collection of data for safety management or enforcement purposes. Section 831.5 of this part also applies to the investigation of aviation accidents.

              § 831.54
              Nature of investigation.
              (a) General. The NTSB conducts investigations, or has them conducted, to determine the facts, conditions, and circumstances relating to a major marine casualty or a marine casualty. The NTSB uses these results to determine one or more probable causes of a major marine casualty or a marine casualty, and to issue safety recommendations to prevent or mitigate the effects of a similar major marine casualty or a marine casualty. The NTSB is required to report on the facts and circumstances of major marine casualties or marine casualties it investigates. The NTSB begins an investigation by monitoring casualty situations and assessing available facts to determine the appropriate investigative response. Following an initial assessment, the NTSB notifies persons and organizations it anticipates will be affected as to the extent of its expected investigative response.
              (b) NTSB products. An investigation may result in a report or brief of the NTSB's conclusions and other products designed to improve transportation safety. Other products may include factual records, safety recommendations, and other safety information.

              (c) NTSB investigations are fact-finding proceedings with no adverse parties. The investigative proceedings are not subject to the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.), and are not conducted for the purpose of determining the rights, liabilities, or blame of any person or entity, as they are not adjudicatory proceedings.
            
            
              § 831.55
              Relationships with other agencies.
              (a) Relationship with the USCG. (1) The NTSB conducts marine casualty and major marine casualty investigations, in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 1131(a)(1)(E) and (F), and part 850 of this chapter. The NTSB and USCG work together to collect evidence related to marine casualties and major marine causalities.
              (2) The NTSB and USCG coordinate to avoid duplicative efforts to the maximum extent practicable.
              (3) The NTSB independently analyzes the evidence and determines the probable cause of marine casualties and major marine causalities.
              (b) Relationships with other Federal agencies. (1) Except as provided in 49 U.S.C. 1131(a)(2)(B) and (C) regarding suspected criminal actions, an investigation conducted under the authority of the NTSB has priority over any investigation conducted by another Federal agency.
              (2) The NTSB will provide for appropriate participation by other Federal agencies in any NTSB investigation. Such agencies may not participate in the NTSB's probable cause determination.
              (3) The NTSB has first right to access wreckage, information, and resources, and to interview witnesses the NTSB deems pertinent to its investigation.
              (4) The NTSB and other Federal agencies will exchange information obtained or developed in the course of their investigations in a timely manner. Nothing in this section prohibits the NTSB from sharing factual information with other agencies.
              (c) As indicated in § 831.59(c) of this part, the NTSB has exclusive authority to determine when and how the testing and examination of evidence will occur.
              (d) The NTSB may take possession of records, wreckage, or information if it determines such possession is necessary for an investigation.
              (e) Investigations by Federal agencies. (1) Nothing in this section impairs the authority of any other Federal agency to conduct an investigation of a marine casualty or major marine casualty.
              (f) Incident command system. (1) The NTSB recognizes the role of incident command systems to address emergencies. The NTSB does not assume the role of a first responder agency.
              (2) The NTSB IIC or his designee will participate in the incident command system to identify and coordinate investigative needs as it relates to the preservation and collection of information and evidence.
              (3) The NTSB IIC or his designee will coordinate with the Coast Guard Investigation Officer to identify and coordinate investigative needs as it relates to the preservation and collection of information and evidence.
              (4) The NTSB may collect information and evidence from an incident command in a timely and reasonable manner so as not to interfere with its operations.
            
            
              § 831.56
              Request to withhold information.
              (a) Applicability. This section applies to information the NTSB receives from any source that may be subject to the Trade Secrets Act (18 U.S.C. 1905) or the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552).
              (b) Disclosure. The NTSB is authorized by 49 U.S.C. 1114(b) to disclose, under certain circumstances, confidential commercial information that would otherwise be subject to penalties for disclosure under the Trade Secrets Act, or excepted from disclosure under FOIA. The NTSB may exercise this authority when disclosure is necessary to support a key finding, a safety recommendation, or the NTSB's statement of probable cause of a major marine casualty or a marine casualty.
              
              (c) Disclosure procedures. Information submitted to the NTSB that the submitter believes qualifies as a trade secret or as confidential commercial information subject either to the Trade Secrets Act or Exemption 4 of FOIA must be so identified by the submitter on each page that contains such information. In accordance with 48 U.S.C. 1114(b), the NTSB will provide the submitter of identified information (or information the NTSB has reason to believe qualifies as subject to the Trade Secrets Act or Exemption 4 of FOIA) the opportunity to comment on any disclosure contemplated by the NTSB. In all instances in which the NTSB decides to disclose such information pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 1114(b) or 5 U.S.C. 552, the NTSB will provide at least 10 days' notice to the submitter.
              (d) Voluntarily provided safety information. (1) The NTSB will not disclose safety-related information voluntarily submitted to the NTSB if the information is not related to the exercise of the NTSB's investigation authority, and if the NTSB finds disclosure of the information might inhibit the voluntary provision of that type of information.
              (2) The NTSB will review voluntarily provided safety information for confidential content, and will de-identify or anonymize any confidential content referenced in its products.
              (e) Other. Any person may make written objection to the public disclosure of any other information, such as interview summaries or transcripts, contained in any report or document filed, or otherwise obtained by the Board, stating the grounds for such objection. The Board, on its own initiative or if such objection is made, may order such information withheld from public disclosure when, in its judgment, the information may be withheld under the provisions of an exemption to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552, see part 801 of this chapter), and its release is found not to be in the public interest.
            
            
              § 831.57
              Representation during an interview.
              (a) Any person interviewed in any manner by the NTSB has the right to be accompanied during the interview by no more than one representative of the witness's choosing. The representative—
              (1) May be an attorney;
              (2) May provide support and counsel to the witness;
              (3) May not supplement the witness's testimony; and
              (4) May not advocate for the interests of a witness's other affiliations.
              (b) An investigator conducting the interview may take any necessary action (including removal of the representative from the interview) to ensure a witness's representative acts in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section during the interview, and to prevent conduct that may be disruptive to the interview.
            
            
              § 831.58
              Investigator-in-charge.

              (6) Question any person having knowledge relevant to a marine casualty or major marine casualty.
              (b) Subpoenas. The NTSB may issue a subpoena, enforceable in Federal District Court, to obtain testimony or evidence related to its investigation of a marine casualty or major marine casualty, including but not limited to personal electronic devices.
              (1) The NTSB's authority to issue subpoenas includes access to medical records and specimens.

              (2) For purposes of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), Public Law 104-191, and the regulations promulgated by the Department of Health and Human Services, 45 CFR 164.501 et seq., the NTSB is a “public health authority” to which protected health information may be disclosed by a HIPAA “covered entity” without the prior written authorization of the subject of the records. In addition, the NTSB may issue a subpoena to gain access to such information.
              (c) Examination of evidence. In accordance with 49 U.S.C. 1134(d), the NTSB has exclusive authority to decide when, and in what manner, testing, extraction of data, and examination of evidence will occur.

              (ii) Be a person who also represents claimants or insurers.

              (5) Party status may be revoked or suspended if a party fails to comply with either paragraph (a)(3) or (a)(4) of this section. Sanctions may also be imposed if a party withholds information or acts in a manner prejudicial or disruptive to an investigation.
              (b) Disclosures. (1) The name of a party or its representative may be disclosed in documents the NTSB places in the public docket for the investigation.
              (2) The NTSB may share information considered proprietary or confidential by one party with other parties during the course of an investigation, but will preserve the confidentiality of the information to the greatest extent possible.
              (3) Section 831.6(c) of this part describes how the NTSB will handle voluntarily submitted safety information, and the NTSB's determination whether to share any such information. The NTSB will de-identify the source of such information when deciding to share it.
              (c) Party agreement. All party representatives must sign the “Statement of Party Representatives to NTSB Investigation” (Statement) upon acceptance of party status. Failure to timely sign the Statement may result in sanctions, including loss of party status. Representatives of Federal agencies are not required to sign the Statement, but must comply with the responsibilities and limitations set forth in the agreement.
              (d) Internal review by a party. (1) To assure coordination of concurrent efforts, a party to an investigation that conducts or authorizes a review of its own processes and procedures as a result of a major marine casualty or a marine casualty the NTSB is investigating must inform the IIC in a timely manner of the nature of its review. A party performing such review must provide the IIC with the findings from this review.
              (2) If the findings from a review contain privileged information—
              (i) The submitting party must inform the IIC that the review contains privileged information;
              (ii) The submitting party must identify the privileged content at the time of submission to the IIC;
              (iii) The NTSB must, when informed that such information is being submitted, review the information for relevancy to the investigation, and determine whether the information is needed for the investigation or may be excluded from the party's response.
              (3) The NTSB may use the protections described in § 831.56 of this part, as applicable, to protect certain findings from public disclosure.
              (4) Investigations performed by other Federal agencies during an NTSB investigation are addressed in § 831.55 of this part.
            
            
              § 831.62
              Access to and release of wreckage, records, mail, and cargo.
              (a) Only persons authorized by the NTSB to participate in any particular investigation, examination or testing may be permitted access to wreckage, records, mail, or cargo.
              (b) Wreckage, records, mail, and cargo in the NTSB's custody will be released when the NTSB determines it has no further need for such items. Prior to release, the NTSB will inform the USCG of the upcoming release of wreckage or evidence. Recipients of released wreckage must sign an acknowledgement of release provided by the NTSB.
            
            
              § 831.63
              Provision and dissemination of investigative information.
              (a) Applicability. This section applies to:
              (1) Any information related to a marine casualty or major marine casualty;
              (2) Any information collected or compiled by the NTSB as part of its investigation, such as photographs, visual representations of factual data, physical evidence from the scene of the major marine casualty or the marine casualty, interview statements, wreckage documentation, voyage data recorder information, and surveillance video;
              (3) Any information regarding the status of an investigation, or activities conducted as part of the investigation.
              (b) Provision of information. All information described in paragraph (a) of this section and obtained by any person or organization participating in the investigation must be provided to the NTSB, except for information the NTSB authorizes the party to retain.
              
              (c) Release of information. Parties are prohibited from releasing information obtained during an investigation at any time prior to the NTSB's public release of information unless the release is consistent with the following criteria:
              (1) Information released at the scene of a marine casualty or major marine casualty:
              (i) Is limited to factual developments concerning the accident and the investigation released in coordination with the IIC; and
              (ii) Will be made by the Board Member present at the scene as the official spokesperson for the NTSB. If no Board Member is present, information will be released by a representative of the NTSB's Office of Media Relations or the IIC. To the maximum extent practicable, the NTSB will inform the USCG of its planned releases of information before the release occurs.
              (2) The release of information described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section by the NTSB at the scene of a marine casualty or major marine casualty does not authorize any party to the investigation to comment publicly on the information during the course of the investigation. Any dissemination of factual information by a party may be made only as provided in this section.
              (3) A party may disseminate information related to an investigation to those individuals within its organization who have a need to know for the purpose of addressing a safety issue, including preventive or remedial actions. If such internal release of information results in a planned safety improvement, the party must inform the IIC of such planned improvement in a timely manner before it is implemented.
              (4) Any other release of factual information related to the investigation must be approved by the IIC prior to release, including:
              (i) Dissemination within a party organization, for a purpose not described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section;
              (ii) Documents that provide information concerning the investigation, such as written directives or informational updates for release to employees or customers of a party; and
              (iii) Information related to the investigation released to an organization or person that is not a party to the investigation.
              (d) The release of recordings or transcripts from certain recorders may be made only in accordance with the statutory limitations of 49 U.S.C. 1114(c), 1114(d), and 1154(a).
            
            
              § 831.64
              Proposed findings.
              (a) General. Any party to an investigation designated under § 831.61 may submit to the NTSB written proposed findings to be drawn from the evidence produced during the course of the investigation, a proposed probable cause, and/or proposed safety recommendation(s) designed to prevent future major marine casualties and marine casualties.
              (b) Timing of submissions. The IIC will inform parties when submissions are due. All written submissions must be received by the due date. If there is a Board meeting, the due date will be set prior to the date the matter is published in the Federal Register.

            5 U.S.C. 301; Independent Safety Board Act of 1974, as amended (49 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.).
          
          
            § 835.1
            Purpose.

            This part prescribes policies and procedures regarding the testimony of employees of the National Transportation Safety Board (Board) in suits or actions for damages and criminal proceedings arising out of transportation accidents when such testimony is in an official capacity and arises out of or is related to accident investigation. The purpose of this part is to ensure that the time of Board employees is used only for official purposes, to avoid embroiling the Board in controversial issues that are not related to its duties, to avoid spending public funds for non-Board purposes, to preserve the impartiality of the Board, and to prohibit the discovery of opinion testimony.
            [63 FR 71607, Dec. 29, 1998]
          
          
            § 835.2
            Definitions.
            
              Accident, for purposes of this part includes “incident.”
            
              Board accident report means the report containing the Board's determinations, including the probable cause of an accident, issued either as a narrative report or in a computer format (“briefs” of accidents). Pursuant to section 701(e) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (FA Act), and section 304(c) of the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 (49 U.S.C. 1154(b)) (Safety Act), no part of a Board accident report may be admitted as evidence or used in any suit or action for damages growing out of any matter mentioned in such reports.
            
              Factual accident report means the report containing the results of the investigator's investigation of the accident. The Board does not object to, and there is no statutory bar to, admission in litigation of factual accident reports. In the case of a major investigation, group chairman factual reports are factual accident reports.
            [63 FR 71607, Dec. 29, 1998, as amended at 64 FR 5622, Feb. 4, 1999]
          
          
            § 835.3
            Scope of permissible testimony.
            (a) Section 701(e) of the FA Act and section 304(c) of the Safety Act preclude the use or admission into evidence of Board accident reports in any suit or action for damages arising from accidents. These sections reflect Congress' “strong * * * desire to keep the Board free of the entanglement of such suits.” Rep. No. 93-1192, 93d Cong., 2d Sess., 44 (1974), and serve to ensure that the Board does not exert an undue influence on litigation. The purposes of these sections would be defeated if expert opinion testimony of Board employees, which may be reflected in the views of the Board expressed in its reports, were admitted in evidence or used in litigation arising out of an accident. The Board relies heavily upon its investigators' opinions in its deliberations. Furthermore, the use of Board employees as experts to give opinion testimony would impose a significant administrative burden on the Board's investigative staff. Litigants must obtain their expert witnesses from other sources.
            (b) For the reasons stated in paragraph (a) of this section and § 835.1, Board employees may only testify as to the factual information they obtained during the course of an investigation, including factual evaluations embodied in their factual accident reports. However, they shall decline to testify regarding matters beyond the scope of their investigation, and they shall not give any expert or opinion testimony.
            (c) Board employees may testify about the firsthand information they obtained during an investigation that is not reasonably available elsewhere, including observations recorded in their own factual accident reports. Consistent with the principles cited in § 835.1 and this section, current Board employees are not authorized to testify regarding other employee's reports, or other types of Board documents, including but not limited to safety recommendations, safety studies, safety proposals, safety accomplishments, reports labeled studies, and analysis reports, as they contain staff analysis and/or Board conclusions.
            (d) Briefs of accidents may be released in conjunction with factual accident reports. Nevertheless, they are not part of those reports and are not to be admitted in evidence or used in a deposition approved under this part.
            (e) Not all material in a factual accident report may be the subject of testimony. The purpose of the factual accident report, in great part, is to inform the public at large, and as a result the factual accident report may contain information and conclusions for which testimony is prohibited by this part.

            (f) No employee may testify in any matter absent advance approval by the General Counsel as provided in this part.
            [55 FR 41541, Oct. 12, 1990, as amended at 63 FR 71607, Dec. 29, 1998; 64 FR 5622, Feb. 4, 1999]
          
          
            § 835.4
            Use of reports.
            (a) As a testimonial aid and to refresh their memories, Board employees may use copies of the factual accident report they prepared, and may refer to and cite from that report during testimony.
            (b) Consistent with section 701(e) of the FA Act and section 304(c) of the Safety Act, a Board employee may not use the Board's accident report for any purpose during his testimony.

            § 835.5
            Manner in which testimony is given in civil litigation.
            (a) Testimony of Board employees with unique, firsthand information may be made available for use in civil actions or civil suits for damages arising out of accidents through depositions or written interrogatories. Board employees are not permitted to appear and testify in court in such actions.
            (b) Normally, depositions will be taken and interrogatories answered at the Board's office to which the employee is assigned, and at a time arranged with the employee reasonably fixed to avoid substantial interference with the performance of his duties.
            (c) Board employees are authorized to testify only once in connection with any investigation they have made of an accident. Consequently, when more than one civil lawsuit arises as a result of an accident, it shall be the duty of counsel seeking the employee's deposition to ascertain the identity of all parties to the multiple lawsuits and their counsel, and to advise them of the fact that a deposition has been granted, so that all interested parties may be afforded the opportunity to participate therein.
            (d) Upon completion of the deposition of a Board employee, the original of the transcript will be provided the deponent for signature and correction, which the Board does not waive. A copy of the transcript of the testimony and any videotape shall be furnished, at the expense of the party requesting the deposition, to the Board's General Counsel at Washington, DC headquarters for the Board's files.

            § 835.6
            Request for testimony in civil litigation.
            (a) A written request for testimony by deposition or interrogatories of a Board employee relating to an accident shall be addressed to the General Counsel, who may approve or deny the request consistent with this part. Such request shall set forth the title of the civil case, the court, the type of accident (aviation, railroad, etc.), the date and place of the accident, the reasons for desiring the testimony, and a showing that the information desired is not reasonably available from other sources.

            (b) Where testimony is sought in connection with civil litigation, the General Counsel shall not approve it until the factual accident report is issued (i.e., in the public docket). In the case of major accident investigations where there are multiple factual reports issued and testimony of group chairmen is sought, the General Counsel may approve depositions regarding completed group factual reports at any time after incorporation of the report in the public docket. However, no deposition will be approved prior to the Board's public hearing, where one is scheduled or contemplated. The General Counsel may approve a deposition in the absence of a factual accident report when such a report will not be issued but all staff fact-finding is complete.
            (c) The General Counsel shall attach to the approval of any deposition such reasonable conditions as may be deemed appropriate in order that the testimony will be consistent with § 835.1, will be limited to the matters delineated in § 835.3, will not interfere with the performance of the duties of the employee as set forth in § 835.5, and will otherwise conform to the policies of this part.

            (d) A subpoena shall not be served upon a Board employee in connection with the taking of a deposition in civil litigation.

            § 835.7
            Testimony of former Board employees.
            It is not necessary to request Board approval for testimony of a former Board employee, nor is testimony limited to depositions. However, the scope of permissible testimony continues to be constrained by all the limitations set forth in § 835.3 and § 835.4.

            § 835.8
            Testimony by current Board employees regarding prior activity.
            Any testimony regarding any accident within the Board's jurisdiction, or any expert testimony arising from employment prior to Board service is prohibited absent approval by the General Counsel. Approval shall only be given if testimony will not violate § 835.1 and § 835.3, and is subject to whatever conditions the General Counsel finds necessary to promote the purposes of this part as set forth in § 835.1 and § 835.3.

            § 835.9
            Procedure in the event of a subpoena in civil litigation.
            (a) If the Board employee has received a subpoena to appear and testify in connection with civil litigation, a request for his deposition shall not be approved until the subpoena has been withdrawn.
            (b) Upon receipt of a subpoena, the employee shall immediately notify the General Counsel and provide all information requested by the General Counsel.
            (c) The General Counsel shall determine the course of action to be taken and will so advise the employee.

            § 835.10
            Testimony in Federal, State, or local criminal investigations and other proceedings.
            (a) As with civil litigation, the Board prefers that testimony be taken by deposition if court rules permit, and that testimony await the issuance of the factual accident report. The Board recognizes, however, that in the case of coroner's inquests and grand jury proceedings this may not be possible. The Board encourages those seeking testimony of Board employees to contact the General Counsel as soon as such testimony is being considered. Whenever the intent to seek such testimony is communicated to the employee, he shall immediately notify the General Counsel.
            (b) In any case, Board employees are prohibited from testifying in any civil, criminal, or other matter, either in person or by deposition or interrogatories, absent advance approval of the General Counsel. The Board discourages the serving of a subpoena for testimony but, if issued, it should be served on the General Counsel, rather than the employee.
            (c) If permission to testify by deposition or in person is granted, testimony shall be limited as set forth in § 835.3. Only factual testimony is authorized; no expert or opinion testimony shall be given.

            Obtaining Board accident reports, factual accident reports, and supporting information.

            It is the responsibility of the individual requesting testimony to obtain desired documents. There are a number of ways to obtain Board accident reports, factual accident reports, and accompanying accident docket files. Our rules at parts 801 and 837 of this chapter explain our procedures, as will our web site, at www.ntsb.gov. Or, you may call our Public Inquiries Branch, at (800) 877-6799. Documents will not be supplied by witnesses at depositions, nor will copying services be provided by deponents.

            § 837.1
            Purpose and scope.
            (a) This part sets forth procedures to be followed when requesting material for use in legal proceedings (including administrative proceedings) in which the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB or Board) is not a party, and procedures to be followed by the employee upon receipt of a subpoena, order, or other demand (collectively referred to here as a demand) by a court or other competent authority or by a private litigant. “Material,” as used in this part, means any type of physical or documentary evidence, including but not limited to paper documents, electronic media, videotapes, audiotapes, etc.
            (b) The purposes of this part are to:
            (1) Conserve the time of employees for conducting official business;
            (2) Minimize the possibility of involving the NTSB in controversial issues not related to its mission;
            (3) Maintain the impartiality of the Board among private litigants;
            (4) Avoid spending the time and money of the United States for private purposes; and
            (5) To protect confidential, sensitive information, and the deliberative processes of the Board.
          
          
            § 837.2
            Applicability.
            This part applies to requests to produce material concerning information acquired in the course of performing official duties or because of the employee's official status. Specifically, this part applies to requests for: material contained in NTSB files; and any information or material acquired by an employee of the NTSB in the performance of official duties or as a result of the employee's status. Two sets of procedures are here established, dependent on the type of material sought. Rules governing requests for employee testimony, as opposed to material production, can be found at 49 CFR part 835. Document production shall not accompany employee testimony, absent compliance with this part and General Counsel approval.

            Published reports, material contained in the public accident investigation dockets, and accident database data.
            (a) Demands for material contained in the NTSB's official public docket files of its accident investigations, or its computerized accident database(s) shall be submitted, in writing, to the Public Inquiries Branch. Demands for specific published reports and studies should be submitted to the National Technical Information Service. The Board does not maintain stock of these items. Demands for information collected in particular accident investigations and made a part of the public docket should be submitted to the Public Inquiries Branch or, directly, to our contractor. For information regarding the types of documents routinely issued by the Board, see 49 CFR part 801.
            (b) No subpoena shall be issued to obtain materials subject to this paragraph, and any subpoena issued shall be required to be withdrawn prior to release of the requested information. Payment of reproduction fees may be required in advance.
          
          
            § 837.4
            Other material.
            (a) Production prohibited unless approved. Except in the case of the material referenced in § 837.3, no employee or former employee of NTSB shall, in response to a demand of a private litigant, court, or other authority, produce any material contained in the files of the NTSB (whether or not agency records under 5 U.S.C. 552) or produce any material acquired as part of the performance of the person's official duties or because of the person's official status, without the prior written approval of the General Counsel.
            (b) Procedures to be followed for the production of material under this paragraph.

              § 845.2
              Investigative hearings.
              Investigative hearings are convened to assist the NTSB in further developing the facts, conditions, and circumstances of the transportation accident or incident, which will ultimately assist the Board in determining the cause or probable cause of the accident or incident, and in ascertaining measures that will tend to prevent such accidents or incidents and promote transportation safety. Investigative hearings are fact-finding proceedings with no adverse parties. They are not subject to the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 554) and are not conducted for the purpose of determining the rights, liabilities, or blame of any person or entity.

              § 845.4
              Determination to hold hearing.
              (a) The Board may order an investigative hearing as part of an investigation whenever a hearing is deemed necessary in the public interest.
              (b) If a quorum of the Board is not immediately available in the event of a catastrophic accident, the determination to hold an investigative hearing may be made by the Chairman of the Board.
            
            
              § 845.5

              (b) Duties of board of inquiry. The board of inquiry shall examine witnesses and secure, in the form of a public record, facts pertaining to the accident or incident under investigation and surrounding circumstances and conditions from which the Board may determine probable cause and may formulate recommendations and/or other documents for corrective or preventative action.
              (c) Chairman of board of inquiry. The chairman of the board of inquiry, or his or her designee, shall have the following powers:

              § 845.6
              Designation of parties.
              (a) The chairman of the board of inquiry shall designate as parties to the investigative hearing those persons and organizations whose participation in the hearing is deemed necessary in the public interest and whose special knowledge will contribute to the development of pertinent evidence. Parties to the investigative hearing shall be represented by suitable representatives who do not occupy legal positions.
              (b) No party to the investigation and/or investigative hearing shall be represented by any person who also represents claimants or insurers. Failure to comply with this provision shall result in loss of status as a party to the investigative hearing.

              Technical panel.
              The appropriate office director(s) and/or the hearing officer, in consultation with the NTSB Managing Director, shall determine if a technical panel is needed and, if so, shall designate members of the NTSB technical staff to participate in the investigative hearing. Members of the technical panel may conduct pre-screening of witnesses through interviews, and may take other actions to prepare for the hearing. At the hearing, the technical panel will initially examine the witnesses through questioning. The technical panel shall examine witnesses and secure, in the form of a public record, facts pertaining to the accident or incident under investigation and surrounding circumstances and conditions.
            
            
              § 845.9

At the prehearing conference, the parties shall be advised of the witnesses to be called at the investigative hearing, the topics about which they will be examined, and the exhibits that will be offered in evidence.
              (b) At the prehearing conference, parties to the investigative hearing shall submit copies of any additional documentary exhibits they desire to offer for admission at the hearing.
              (c) A party to the investigative hearing who, at the time of the prehearing conference, fails to advise the chairman of the board of inquiry of additional exhibits he or she intends to submit, or additional witnesses he or she desires to examine, shall be prohibited from introducing such evidence unless the chairman of the board of inquiry determines for good cause shown that such evidence should be admitted.
              (d) The board of inquiry may hold an investigative hearing on an expedited schedule. The chairman of the board of inquiry may hold a prehearing conference for an expedited investigative hearing. When an expedited investigative hearing is held, the chairman of the board of inquiry may waive the requirements in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section concerning the identification of witnesses, exhibits or other evidence.

The NTSB allows the appropriate office director, under his or her delegated authority as described in § 800.25 of this chapter, to issue a “brief,” which includes the probable cause and relevant facts, conditions, and circumstances concerning the accident or incident. Such briefs do not include recommendations. In particular circumstances, the Board in its discretion may choose to approve a brief.
              (b) Studies and reports—(1) NTSB studies and reports. The NTSB may issue reports describing investigations of more than one accident or incident that share commonalities. Such reports are similar to accident or incident investigation reports, as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Such reports often include safety recommendations and/or safety alerts, which the Board adopts.
              (2) Safety studies and reports. The NTSB issues safety studies and reports, which usually examine safety concerns that require the investigation of a number of related accidents or incidents to determine the extent and severity of the safety issues. Such studies and reports often include safety recommendations and/or safety alerts, which the Board adopts.
              (c) Safety recommendations. The Board may adopt and issue safety recommendations, either as part of a Board report or as a stand-alone Board product.
            
            
              § 845.31
              Public docket.
              (a) Investigations. (1) As described in § 801.3 of this chapter, the public docket shall include factual information concerning the accident or incident. Proposed findings submitted pursuant to § 831.14 or § 845.13 and petitions for reconsideration and modification submitted pursuant to § 845.32, comments thereon by other parties, and the Board's rulings on proposed findings and petitions shall also be placed in the public docket.
              (2) The NTSB shall establish the public docket following the accident or incident, and material shall be added thereto as it becomes available. Where an investigative hearing is held, the exhibits will be introduced into the record at the hearing and will be included in the public docket.
              (b) Other Board reports and documents. The NTSB may elect to open and place materials in a public docket concerning a safety study or report, special investigation report, or other agency product. The NTSB will establish the public docket following its issuance of the study or report.
              (c) Availability. The public docket shall be made available to any person for review, as described in § 801.30 of this chapter. Records within the public docket are available at www.ntsb.gov.
              
            
            
              § 845.32
              Petitions for reconsideration or modification of report.
              (a) Requirements. (1) The Board will only consider petitions for reconsideration or modification of findings and determination of probable cause from a party or other person having a direct interest in an investigation.

              (2) Petitions must be in writing and addressed to the NTSB Chairman. Please send your petition via email to correspondence@ntsb.gov. In the alternative, you may send your petition via postal mail to: NTSB Headquarters at 490 L'Enfant Plaza SW., Washington, DC 20594.

              (3) Petitions must be based on the discovery of new evidence or on a showing that the Board's findings are erroneous. (i) Petitions based on the discovery of new matter shall: Identify the new matter; contain affidavits of prospective witnesses, authenticated documents, or both, or an explanation of why such substantiation is unavailable; and state why the new matter was not available prior to Board's adoption of its findings.
              (ii) Petitions based on a claim of erroneous findings shall set forth in detail the grounds upon which the claim is based.
              (b) Acceptance of petitions. The Board will not consider petitions that are repetitious of proposed findings submitted pursuant to § 845.13, or of positions previously advanced.
              (c) Proof of service. (1) When a petition for reconsideration or modification is filed with the Board, copies of the petition and any supporting documentation shall be served on all other parties to the investigation or investigative hearing and proof of service shall be attached to the petition.
              (2) Any party served with a copy of the petition may file comments no later than 90 days after service of the petition.
              (d) Oral presentation. Oral presentation normally will not form a part of proceedings under this section. However, oral presentation may be permitted where a party or interested person specifically shows the written petition for reconsideration or modification is an insufficient means by which to present the party's or person's position.
            
            
              § 845.33
              Investigation to remain open.
              The Board never officially closes an investigation, but provides for the submission of new and pertinent evidence by any interested person. If the Board finds such evidence is relevant and probative, the evidence shall be made a part of the public docket and, where appropriate, the Board will provide parties an opportunity to examine such evidence and to comment thereon.
