      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, October 1, 2019), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Accounting Series Circulars.</E> Following the release of a Statement of Financial Accounting Standards by the FASB, and provided that the Office of Economics, and Administration of the Board considers such standards appropriate for the Board's accounting regulations, the Office of Economics shall issue an Accounting Series Circular (ASC) requiring carriers under the Board's jurisdiction to follow the new standards in their accounts and reports filed with the Board. The Office shall also specify in the ASC the proper accounting procedures that the carriers shall follow.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Carriers' and Interested Parties' Comments on the ASC.</E> The ASC issued by the Office of Economics, and Administration will remain effective until revoked by the Office of Economics, and Administration. After an ASC is issued, the Office of Economics, and Administration shall allow carriers and interested parties 45 days following the service date of the ASC during which the respondents may submit to the Office their comments and reasons either supporting or opposing the ASC.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Formal Adoption of the New Accounting Standards.</E> After considering the comments submitted in response to the ASC, and based on the proposal of the Office of Economics, and Administration, the Board will decide whether or not to adopt the new accounting standards specified in the ASC by revising the Uniform Systems of Accounts, (49 CFR 1201 through 1210).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Accounting Standards Not Appropriate for Board's Use.</E> The Office of Economics, and Administration may determine that a new FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards is not appropriate for use by carriers under the Board's jurisdiction. In such instances, the Office shall issue an ASC to advise the carriers that the new standards shall not be used in their reports filed with the Board. The carriers and interested parties shall be allowed 45 days following the ASC's service date to submit comments to the Board. The Board will then determine whether or not to revise the Uniform Systems of Accounts to conform to the new accounting standards.</P>

Also securities issued as dividends on stock.</P>
                  <P>4. <E T="03">Actually outstanding</E> as applied to funded debt securities or capital stock issued or assumed by the carrier means those which have been actually issued and are neither retired and canceled nor reacquired and held by or for the accounting company.</P>
                  <P>5. (a) <E T="03">Affiliated companies</E> means companies or persons that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries control, or are controlled by, or are under common control with, the accounting carrier.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Control</E> (including the terms <E T="03">controlling, controlled by,</E> and <E T="03">under common control with</E>) means the possession directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a company, whether such power is exercised through one or more intermediary companies, or alone, or in conjunction with, or pursuant to an agreement, and whether such power is established through a majority of minority ownership or voting of securities, common directors, officers or stockholders, voting trusts, holding trusts, associated companies, contract or any other direct or indirect means.</P>
                  <P>6. <E T="03">Amortization</E> means the gradual extinguishment of an amount in an account by distributing such amount over a fixed period dependent on the requirements of regulatory bodies, over the life of the asset or liability to which it applies, or over the period during which it is anticipated the benefit will be realized.</P>

Such arrangements include both outstanding borrowings and the assurance of future credit availability. (The compensating balance requirement should be adjusted by the amount of float unless such adjustment would cause the compensating balance to be greater than the cash balance per carrier's books.) The float adjustment is made by subtracting the float from the compensating balance requirement if the collected bank ledger balance exceeds the cash balance per carrier's books or by adding the float to the compensating balance requirement if the collected bank ledger balance is less than the cash balance per carrier's books.<PRTPAGE P="12"/>

                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Float</E> means deposits and withdrawals in transit which constitute a difference between the collected bank ledger balance and the cash balance per carrier's books.</P>

                  <P>(a) <E T="03">Marketable,</E> as applied to an equity security, means an equity security as to which sales prices or bid and ask prices are currently available on a national securities exchange (i.e., those registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission) or in the over-the-counter market. In the over-the-counter market, an equity security shall be considered marketable when a quotation is publicly reported by the National Association of Securities Dealers Automatic Quotations System or by the National Quotations Bureau, Inc. (provided, in the latter case, that quotations are available from at least three dealers). Equity securities traded in foreign markets shall be considered marketable when such markets are of a breadth and scope comparable to those referred to above. This definition is not met by restricted stock (securities for which sale is restricted by a governmental or contractual requirement except where such requirement terminates within one year or where the holder has the power to cause the requirement to be met within one year). Any portion of the stock which can reasonably be expected to qualify for sale within one year, such as may be the case under Rule 144 or similar rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, is not considered restricted.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Market value</E> refers to the aggregate of the market price of a single share or unit times the number of shares or units of each marketable equity security in the portfolio.

                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Cost,</E> as applied to a marketable equity security, refers to the original cost as adjusted for unrealized holding gains and losses.</P>
                  <P>17. (a) <E T="03">Income taxes</E> means taxes based on income determined under provisions <PRTPAGE P="13"/>of the United States Internal Revenue Code and foreign, state and other taxes (including franchise taxes) based on income.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Income tax expense</E> means the amount of income taxes (whether or not currently payable or refundable) allocable to a period in the determination of net income.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Pretax accounting income</E> means income or loss for a period, exclusive of related income tax expense.</P>

                  <P>(e) <E T="03">Timing differences</E> means differences between the periods in which transactions affect taxable income and the periods in which they enter into the determination of pretax accounting income. Timing differences originate in one period and reverse or <E T="03">turn around</E> in one or more subsequent periods. Some timing differences reduce income taxes that would otherwise be payable currently; others increase income taxes that would otherwise be payable currently.</P>
                  <P>(f) <E T="03">Permanent differences</E> means differences between taxable income and pretax accounting income arising from transactions that, under applicable tax laws and regulations, will not be offset by corresponding differences or <E T="03">turn around</E> in other periods.</P>
                  <P>(g) <E T="03">Tax effects</E> means differentials in income taxes of a period attributable to (1) revenue or expense transactions which enter into the determination of pretax accounting income in one period and into the determination of taxable income in another period, (2) deductions or credits that may be carried backward or forward for income tax purposes and (3) adjustments of prior periods and direct entries to other stockholders' equity accounts which enter into the determination of taxable income in a period but which do not enter into the determination of pretax accounting income of that period. A permanent difference does not result in a <E T="03">tax effect</E> as that term is used in this definition.</P>
                  <P>(h) <E T="03">Deferred taxes</E> means tax effects which are deferred for allocation to income tax expense of future periods.</P>
                  <P>(i) <E T="03">Interperiod tax allocation</E> means the process of apportioning income taxes among periods.</P>
                  <P>(j) <E T="03">Tax allocation within a period</E> means the process of apportioning income tax expenses applicable to a given period between income before extraordinary items and extraordinary items, and of associating the income tax effects of adjustments of prior periods and direct entries to other stockholders' equity accounts with these items.</P>
                  <P>18. (a) <E T="03">Investor</E> means a business entity that holds an investment in voting stock of another company.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Investee</E> means a corporation that issued voting stock held by an investor.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Corporate joint venture</E> is a company owned and operated as a separate and specific business or project for the mutual benefit of the members of the group. Joint facilities for purposes of this system of accounts are not considered corporate joint ventures.</P>

                  <P>1-1 <E T="03">Classification of carriers.</E> (a) For purposes of accounting and reporting, carriers are grouped into the following three classes:</P>
                  <P>Class I: Carriers having annual carrier operating revenues of $250 million or more after applying the railroad revenue deflator formula shown in Note A.</P>
                  <P>Class II: Carriers having annual carrier operating revenues of less than $250 million but in excess of $20 million after applying the railroad revenue deflator formula shown in Note A.</P>
                  <P>Class III: Carriers having annual carrier operating revenues of $20 million or less after applying the railroad revenue deflator formula shown in Note A.</P>
                  <P>(b)(1) The class to which any carrier belongs shall be determined by annual carrier operating revenues after the railroad revenue deflator adjustment. Families of railroads operating within the United States as a single, integrated rail system will be treated as a single carrier for classification purposes. Upward and downward reclassification will be effected as of January 1 in the year immediately following the third consecutive year of revenue qualification.</P>
                  <P>(2) If a Class II or Class III carrier's classification is changed based on three years' adjusted revenues the carrier shall complete and file the Classification Index Survey Form with the Board by March 31 of the year following the end of the period to which it relates.</P>
                  <P>(3) Newly organized carriers shall be classified on the basis of their annual carrier operating revenues after railroad revenue deflator adjustment for the latest period of operation. If actual data are not available, new carriers shall be classified on the basis of their carrier operating revenues known and estimated for a year (after railroad revenue deflator adjustment).</P>
                  <P>(4) When a business combination occurs, such as a merger, reorganization, or consolidation, the surviving carrier shall be reclassified effective January 1 of the next calendar year on the basis of the combined revenue for the year when the combination occurred (after railroad revenue deflator adjustment).</P>

                  <P>(5) In unusual circumstances, such as partial liquidation and curtailment or elimination of contracted services, where regulations will unduly burden the carrier, the carrier may request the Board for an exception to the regulations. This request shall be in writing <PRTPAGE P="16"/>specifying the conditions justifying an exception.</P>
                  <P>(c) Class I carriers shall keep all of the accounts of this system which are applicable to their operations. Class II and III carriers are not required to maintain the accounts of this system.</P>
                  <P>(d) All switching and terminal companies, regardless of their operating revenues will be designated Class III carriers.</P>

                  <P>(e) Unless provided for otherwise, all electric railway carriers, regardless of operating revenues, will be designated Class III carriers.

                  <P>1-2 <E T="03">Classification of accounts.</E> (a) Accounts are prescribed to cover cost of property used in transportation operations and operations incidental thereto and for revenues, expenses, taxes, rents, and other items of income for such operations. Separate accounts are prescribed for investment in property not used in transportation operations and for other investments and income therefrom; for unusual and infrequent items; for operations and disposal of discontinued segments; for extraordinary items and accounting changes; and for assets, liabilities and capital includable in the balance sheet statement. Retained earnings accounts form the connecting link between the income account and the equity section of the balance sheet. They are provided to record the transfer of net income or loss for the year; certain capital transactions; and, when authorized by the Board, other items.</P>
                  <P>(b) The cost of property, and the revenues, expenses, taxes and rents for miscellaneous operations involving the use of such facilities as hotels, restaurants, grain elevators, storage warehouses, power plants, cold storage plants, etc., shall not be included in the accounts prescribed for transportation operations unless the operation of the facilities is conducted by the railway companies in connection with furnishing transportation services. Likewise, the cost of property, the revenues, expenses, taxes, and rents arising from the operation of stockyards shall not be included in accounts prescribed for transportation operations unless operation of the facilities is conducted in connection with transportation of livestock. It is not intended that cost of property and income arising from incidental public stockyards service rendered by stockyards primarily devoted to transportation services shall be excluded from transportation operation accounts.</P>
                  <P>(c) Joint facility accounts are provided for the joint users of tracks, bridges, yards, wharves, stations, and other facilities in which to record items in settlement for use of such facilities. When the compensation for the use of facilities is a fixed amount or is based upon a charge per passenger, ton, car or other unit, the amount shall be fairly apportioned by the operating company among the joint facility operating expense and income accounts. The creditor shall show the distribution of these charges upon its bills, and such distribution shall be adhered to by the debtor. Train service in connection with the line haul of traffic, including that operated under a joint arrangement for the benefit of two or more carriers, is not considered a joint facility operation.</P>
                  <P>(d)(1) <E T="03">Extraordinary Items.</E> All items of profit and loss recognized during the year are includable in ordinary income unless evidence clearly supports their classification as extraordinary items.</P>
                  <P>Extraordinary items are characterized by both their unusual nature and infrequent occurrence taking into account the environment in which the firm operates; they must also meet the materiality standard.</P>
                  <P>Unusual means the event or transaction must possess a high degree of abnormality and be of a type clearly unrelated to, or only incidentally related to the ordinary and typical activities of the entity.</P>

                  <P>Infrequent occurrence means the event or transaction shall be of a type not reasonably expected to recur in the foreseeable future.<PRTPAGE P="17"/>
                  </P>
                  <P>(2) <E T="03">Unusual or Infrequent Items.</E> Material events unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence but not both, thus not meeting both criteria for classification as extraordinary, shall be includable in the accounts provided as separate components of income/expense from continuing operations.</P>
                  <P>(3) <E T="03">Discontinued Operations.</E> The results of continuing operations shall be reported separately from discontinued operations and any gain or loss resulting from disposal of a segment of a business (see definition 23(a)) shall be reported in conjunction with the related results of discontinued operations and not as an extraordinary item. The disposal of a segment of a business shall be distinguished from other disposals of assets incident to the evolution of the entity's business, such as the disposal of part of a line of business, the shifting of production or marketing activities for a particular line of business from one location to another, the phasing out of a product line or class of service, and other changes occasioned by technological improvements. If a loss is expected from the proposed sale or abandonment of a segment, the estimated loss shall be provided for at the measurement date (see definition 23(b)). If a gain is expected, it shall be recognized when realized, which ordinarily is the disposal date (see definition 23(c)).</P>
                  <P>(4) <E T="03">Prior period adjustments.</E> Only the following two items of profit and loss shall be accounted for and reported as prior period adjustments and excluded from the determination of net income for the current period:</P>
                  <P>(1) Correction of an error in the financial statements of a prior period, and</P>
                  <P>(2) Adjustments that result from realization of income tax benefits of preacquisition operating loss carryforwards of purchased subsidiaries.</P>
                  <P>With the exception of the two items just mentioned, all items of profit and loss recognized during a period shall be included in the determination of net income for that period.</P>
                  <NOTE>
                    <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
                    <P>The carrier shall follow generally accepted accounting principles where an interpretation of the rules is needed or obtain an interpretation from its public accountant or the Board.</P>
                  </NOTE>
                  <P>(5) <E T="03">Accounting Changes.</E> Errors in financial statements result from mathematical mistakes, mistakes in the application of accounting principles, or oversight or misuse of facts that existed at the time the financial statements were prepared. In contrast, a change in an accounting estimate results from new information or subsequent developments and from better insight or judgment. Correction of an error should be accomplished through a prior period adjustment [See Instruction 1-2(d)(4)]. Changes in an accounting estimate should be accounted for in the period of change (and future period if the change affects both)(See Instruction 1-7). A change in an accounting principle or accounting entity should be referred to this Board for approval. The cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle should ordinarily be reflected in the account provided for in determining net income.</P>
                  <P>(6) <E T="03">Materiality.</E> As a general standard an item shall be considered material when it exceeds 10 percent of annual income (loss) before extraordinary items. An item may also be considered in relation to the trend of annual earnings before extraordinary items or other appropriate criteria. Items shall be considered individually and not in the aggregate in determining materiality. However, the effects of a series of related transactions arising from a single specific and identifiable event or plan of action shall be aggregated to determine materiality.</P>
                  <P>(7) <E T="03">Board Approval and Accountant's Letter.</E> Items shall be included in the accounts provided for extraordinary items, unusual or infrequent items, discontinued operations, prior period adjustments and cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles only upon approval of the Board. If the carrier retains the service of an independent accountant, a request for using these accounts shall be accompanied by a letter from the independent accountant approving or otherwise commenting on the request.</P>
                  <NOTE>
                    <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
                    <P>The carrier may refer to generally accepted accounting principles for further guidance in applying paragraph (d) above.</P>

                  <P>(d) No carrier shall destroy any books, records, memoranda, etc., which support entries to its accounts unless destruction is permitted by the regulations governing preservation of records, Part 1220 of this chapter.</P>
                  <P>(e) In addition to prescribed accounts, clearing accounts, temporary accounts, and subdivisions of any accounts may be kept, provided the integrity of the prescribed accounts is not impaired.</P>

This provides for cost control and cost planning at any designated area of responsibility. These cost centers shall be similarly defined as the railroads' existing responsibility centers. Cost center information shall therefore be kept at the same level of detail presently collected, categorized, and maintained in railroad internal managerial accounting systems. This detailed information shall not be reported to the Board on an ongoing basis. However, the carrier shall keep the detailed information to provide a ready analysis and verification of the costs collected by cost center.</P>

                  <P>(b) A trial balance of the general ledger accounts shall be prepared at the close of each month setting out the account number, title, and amount of each ledger account. (Mechanical, electronic or automatic data processing printout documentation producing the equivalent of manually prepared trial balances shall identify balances by account numbers.) At the end of the calendar year, the revenue, expense, and other income accounts shall be closed into retained earnings account, and the balance sheet account balances shall be brought forward to the general ledger for the succeeding year.</P>

If no such price list exists, the charges shall be recorded at the lower of their cost to the originating affiliated supplier (less all applicable valuation reserves in case of asset sales, or their estimated fair market value determined on the basis of a representative study of similar competitive and arm's-length or bargained transaction. Any difference between actual transaction price and the above, as well as charges that are not transportation related, shall be considered of a financing nature and shall be recorded, accordingly, as nonoperating charges or credits.

                  <P>1-10 <E T="03">Accounting for income taxes.</E> (a) The interperiod tax allocation method of accounting shall be applied where material timing differences (see definition 17(e)) occur between pretax accounting income and taxable income. Carriers may elect, as provided by the Revenue Act of 1971, to account for the investment tax credit by either the flow through method or the deferred method of accounting. See paragraphs (d) and (e) below. All income taxes (Federal, state and other) currently accruable for income tax return purposes shall be charged to account 556, <E T="03">Income taxes on ordinary income,</E> and account 590, <E T="03">Income Taxes on Extraordinary Items,</E> as applicable.</P>
                  <P>(b) Under the interperiod tax allocation method of accounting the tax effect of timing differences (see definition 17) originating in the current accounting period are allocated to income tax expense of future periods when the timing differences reverse. Similar timing differences originating and reversing in the current accounting period should be combined into groups and the current tax rates applied to determine the tax effect of each group. A carrier shall not apply other than current tax rates in determining the tax effect of reversing differences except upon approval of the Board. When determining the amount of deferred taxes, rather than computing state and other taxes individually by jurisdiction, the Federal income tax rate may be increased by a percent equivalent to the effect of taxes imposed by the jurisdictions. In classifying a deferred charge or credit as current or noncurrent a carrier shall follow the classification criteria used for the related asset or liability which caused the timing difference. A deferred charge or credit that is not related to an asset or liability because (a) there is no associated asset or liability or (b) reduction of an associated asset or liability will not cause the timing difference to reverse shall be classified based on the expected reversal date of the specific timing difference. Such classification disregards any additional timing differences that may arise and is based on the criteria used for classifying other assets and liabilities.</P>
                  <P>(c) The future tax benefits of loss carryforwards shall normally be recognized in the year in which such loss is applied to reduce taxes. Only in those unusual instances when realization is assured beyond any reasonable doubt should the future tax benefits of loss carryforwards be recognized in the year of loss. The tax effects of any realizable loss carrybacks shall be recognized in the determination of net income (loss) of the loss periods; appropriate adjustments of existing net deferred tax credits may also be necessary in the loss period.</P>

                  <P>(d) Carriers electing to account for the investment tax credit by the flow through method shall credit account 556 <E T="03">Income taxes on ordinary income,</E> or account 590, <E T="03">Income taxes on extraordinary items,</E> as applicable, and charge account 760, <E T="03">Federal income taxes accrued,</E> with the amount of investment tax credit utilized in the current accounting period. When the flow through method is followed for the investment tax credit, account 557, <E T="03">Provision for Deferred Taxes,</E> shall reflect the difference between the tax payable (after recognition of allowable investment tax credit) based on taxable income and tax expense (with full recognition of investment tax credit that would be allowable based on accounting income) based on accounting income.</P>

                  <P>(e) Carriers electing to account for the investment tax credit by the deferred method shall concurrently with making the entries prescribed in (d) above charge account 557, <E T="03">Provision for deferred taxes,</E> or account 591, <E T="03">Provision for deferred taxes—extraordinary item,</E> as <PRTPAGE P="21"/>applicable, and shall credit account 786, <E T="03">Accumulated deferred income tax credits,</E> with the investment tax credit utilized as a reduction of the current year's tax liability but deferred for accounting purposes.

A derivative instrument is a financial instrument or other contract with all three of the following characteristics:</P>
                  <P>(1) The derivative instrument has one or more underlyings and a notional amount or payment provision. Those terms determine the amount of the settlement or settlements, and, in some cases, whether or not a settlement is required.</P>
                  <P>(2) The derivative instrument requires no initial net investment or an initial net investment that is smaller than would be required for other types of contracts that would be expected to have similar responses to changes in market factors.</P>
                  <P>(3) The derivative instrument's terms require or permit net settlement; the derivative instrument can readily be settled net by a means outside the contract; or the derivative instrument's terms provide for delivery of an asset that puts the recipient in a position not substantially different from net settlement.</P>

                  <P>(b) The accounting for the changes in the fair value of derivative instruments depends upon their intended use and designation. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges will be recorded in account 713.5, <E T="03">Derivative instrument assets,</E> or account 763.5, <E T="03">Derivative instrument liabilities,</E> as appropriate, with the gains or losses charged to earnings in account 551, <E T="03">Miscellaneous income charges</E>.</P>
                  <P>(c) A derivative instrument may be specifically designated as a fair-value or cash-flow hedge. A hedge may be used to manage risk to price, interest rates, or foreign currency transactions. An entity will maintain documentation of the hedge relationship at the inception of the hedge that details the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the nature of the risk being hedged, and how hedge effectiveness will be determined.</P>

                  <P>(d) If the carrier designates the derivative instrument as a fair-value hedge against exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset, liability, or a firm commitment, it will record the change in fair value of the derivative instrument designated as a fair-value hedge to account 713.6, <E T="03">Derivative instruments assets—hedges,</E> or account 763.6, <E T="03">Derivative instrument liabilities—hedges,</E> as appropriate, with a corresponding adjustment to the sub-account of the item being hedged. The ineffective portion of the hedge transaction will be reflected in the same income or expense account that would have been used if the hedged item had been disposed of or settled. In the case of a fair-value hedge of a firm commitment, a new asset or liability is created. As a result of the hedge relationship, the new asset or liability will become part of the carrying amount of the item being hedged.</P>

                  <P>(e) If the carrier designates the derivative instrument as a cash-flow hedge against exposure to variable cash flows of a probable forecasted transaction, it will record changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument in account 713.6, <E T="03">Derivative instrument assets—hedges,</E> or account 763.6, <E T="03">Derivative instrument liabilities—hedges,</E> as appropriate, with a corresponding amount in account 799.1, <E T="03">Other comprehensive income,</E> for the effective portion of the hedge. The ineffective portion of the hedge transaction will be reflected in the same income or expense account that would have been used if the hedged item had been disposed of or settled. Amounts recorded in Other Comprehensive Income will be reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods that the hedged forecasted item affects earnings.</P>

In any event, the rate used for valuation purposes will normally be at least equal to the rate at which the carrier can obtain financing of a similar nature from other sources at the date of the transaction (the carrier's incremental borrowing rate). In the case of a capital lease, when it is practical to ascertain the implicit rate computed by the lessor, and that rate is less than the carrier's incremental borrowing rate, the carrier should use the implicit rate. Acquisition date for a capital lease is the date the lease agreement is signed. If the property covered by the lease has yet to be constructed or has not been acquired by the lessor at the date the lease agreement or commitment is signed, the acquisition date shall be the date the property under construction is completed or the date the property not yet acquired is acquired by the lessor. (See Instruction 2-20.)</P>

                  <P>(c) Where actually incurred, interest cost is to be added to the cost of road and equipment deemed <E T="03">qualifying assets</E> during the period of time required to get them ready for their intended use (acquisition period). <E T="03">Qualifying assets</E> are those that are (1) either constructed or otherwise produced for a carrier's own use (including assets constructed or produced for the carrier by others for which deposits or progress payments have been made) or (2) assets intended for sale or lease that are constructed or otherwise produced as discrete projects. The amount of interest to be capitalized for qualifying assets shall be based upon the average amount of accumulated expenditures for the asset during the acquisition period at the rate used on specific new borrowings associated with the qualifying asset. If average accumulated expenditures for the asset exceed the amount of specific new borrowings associated with the asset, the rate to be applied to such excess shall be a weighted average of the rates applicable to other borrowings of the enterprise. The total amount of interest cost capitalized in an accounting period shall not exceed the total amount of interest cost incurred by the enterprise during that period.</P>
                  <P>(d) Suitable records shall be maintained showing expenditures during the year for original road and equipment and road extensions; for merger and purchase of existing lines and reorganizations; for additions and betterments; and credits for property retirement.</P>

                  <P>(e) When the carrier exchanges road and equipment for other road and equipment with no other consideration involved, the road and equipment received shall be recorded at the ledger value of the road and equipment relinquished. Where the carrier receives a monetary consideration in the exchange, the carrier shall recognize gain on the exchange to the extent that the consideration received exceeds a proportionate share of the recorded cost of the road and equipment surrendered. The portion of the cost applicable to the realized amount shall be based on the ratio of the monetary consideration to the total consideration received (monetary consideration plus the estimate fair value of the road and equipment received) or, if more clearly <PRTPAGE P="26"/>evident, the fair value of the road and equipment transferred. Where the carrier pays a monetary consideration in the exchange, it shall not recognize any gain on the transaction but shall record the road and equipment received at the amount of the monetary consideration paid plus the recorded costs of the road and equipment surrendered. If a loss is indicated by the terms of an exchange transaction, the carrier shall recognize the entire loss on the exchange. Immaterial gains and losses on these exchanges shall be included in account 519, Miscellaneous Income, or 551, Miscellaneous Income Charges, as appropriate. Material amounts shall be recorded in accordance with Instruction 1-2(d).</P>

                  <P>2-2 <E T="03">Minimum rule applicable to additions to property.</E> An exception to the rule in Instruction 2-1 is that when the cost of acquisition of units of road property and of additions to existing units of road property (other than land and tracks) is less than $5,000, such costs may be charged to operating expenses. This amount (rounded to the nearest $100) will be adjusted by the June Producer Price Index for all commodities when an aggregate adjustment is $500 or more. The revision will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and be effective as of January 1 of the following year. The carrier shall not parcel expenditures under a general plan bringing the accounting for such expenditures within this minimum rule. An amount of less than the current minimum capitalization level, for the railroad as a whole or for individual property accounts may be adopted for purposes of this rule provided the carrier first notifies the Board of the amount it proposes to adopt and thereafter makes no change in the amount unless authorized by the Board. An amount adopted shall be adhered to in reporting property changes for valuation purposes.</P>

                  <P>2-20 <E T="03">Accounting for leases.</E> (a) Leases shall be accounted for as capital leases whenever the lease meets one or more of the following four criteria:</P>
                  <P>(1) The lease transfers ownership of the property to the lessee by the end of the lease term,</P>
                  <P>(2) The lease contains a bargain purchase option,</P>
                  <P>(3) The lease term is equal to 75 percent or more of the estimated economic life of the property, and,</P>
                  <P>(4) The present value at the beginning of the lease term of the minimum lease payments equals or exceeds 90 percent of the fair value of the leased property to the lessor at the inception of the lease less any related investment tax credit retained by the lessor.</P>
                  <P>(b) If the lease does not meet any of the four criteria, the lease shall be classified and accounted for as an operating lease.</P>
                  <P>(c) When accounting for capital leases the lessee shall record the asset and the related obligation. The amount recorded as the asset and the obligation shall be the present value at the beginning of the lease term of the minimum lease payments during the lease term, excluding that portion of the payments representing executory costs such as insurance, maintenance, and taxes to be paid by the lessor. However, if that amount exceeds the fair value of the leased property, the amount recorded as the asset and the obligation shall be the fair value. The lessee shall compute the present value of the minimum lease payments using its incremental borrowing rate unless (1) it is practicable to learn the implicit rate computed by the lessor and (2) the implicit rate computed by the lessor is less than the lessee's incremental borrowing rate. If both of those conditions are met, the lessee shall use the implicit rate.</P>

                  <P>(d) Leased assets that meet the criteria for classification as a capital lease shall be subject to depreciation over their useful lives in the same manner as assets owned. If the capital lease meets the criteria of either Instruction 2-20(a)(1) or 2-20(a)(2), the asset shall be amortized in a manner consistent with the lessee's normal depreciation policy for owned assets. If the lease does not meet either of these two criteria, the asset shall be amortized in a manner consistent with the <PRTPAGE P="37"/>lessee's normal depreciation policy except that the period of amortization shall be the lease term.</P>
                  <P>(e) The accounting accorded the lease shall be subject to the same considerations as other obligations in classifying them with current and noncurrent liabilities in the classified balance sheet. Leases that meet the criteria requiring capitalization shall be recorded in those accounts that provide for carrier operating property or property used in other than carrier operations, as appropriate. The accounts shall segregate the amounts pertaining to capital leases.</P>
                  <P>(f) If the lease qualifies as an operating lease it should be accounted for by charging the rent to expense over the lease term. The rental expense should be recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term unless another method is more representative of the use and the benefits derived.</P>
                  <P>(g) The criteria specified in paragraph (a) should be applied to all leases regardless of the relationship between the lessor and the lessee unless it is clear that the terms of the lease transaction have been significantly affected by their relationship. In this situation, the accounting should be modified to recognize economic substance rather than legal form.</P>
                  <P>(h) In the case of subsidiary companies or companies under common control whose principal business activity is leasing property or facilities to the carrier, the carrier is encouraged to request special authority to file consolidated or combined financial statements. If the carrier does not wish to file consolidated or combined financial statements, capitalization of the lease will be required if the lease meets the criteria that would require capitalization.</P>

                  <P>(a) The accounting for freight train car repair costs shall agree with the applicable instructions and texts of accounts in 49 CFR Part 1201 relating to the equipment repair process (see Note A).</P>
                  <P>(b) Railroads may assign either actual costs, standard costs, or a combination of both to the accounting process. Standard costs, if used, shall recognize the differences in performing repairs on various types of equipment, and the differences related to specific repair facilites. Standard costs shall be based on adequate operational data which are reviewed at least annually. The resulting variances (price, efficiency, capacity, etc.) shall be reasonably allocated back to the car types to derive the amounts reported in Form R-1.</P>
                  <P>(c) Railroads shall report repair costs by the freight train car types shown in Schedule 415 of Form R-1. In assigning repair costs, railroads may use either one of the following methodologies:</P>
                  <EXTRACT>
                    <HD SOURCE="HD2">Level I: Job Order Cost System</HD>
                    <P>Railroads may use a job order cost system for assigning repair costs to the car types for freight train cars. Under this methodology, railroads shall directly match direct labor and materials with the specific unit of equipment that was repaired. Actual costs, standard costs, or a combination of both may be used as stated above.</P>
                    <HD SOURCE="HD2">Level II: Alternative Repair Costs Methodology</HD>
                    <P>Railroads not using the job order cost system shall report freight train car repair costs by using the methodology described below:</P>
                  </EXTRACT>
                  
                  <P>(1) The repair costs relating to heavy, program, or project repairs of freight train cars shall be directly assigned to the car types repaired by using actual or standard costs. A heavy repair is defined as a repair that is relatively so material in cost, repair time, or physical damage that management's involvement in the determination of the repair to be made is necessary and relatively greater than usual. Program or project repairs are those repairs which are performed under a predetermined plan where estimates costs, time periods, and car types to be repaired are identified.</P>

                  <P>(2) The repair costs relating to light and running repairs of system cars <PRTPAGE P="38"/>shall be allocated to the car types by using the Association of American Railroads' Car Repair Billing System (CRBS) as the process for distributing light and running repairs. The CRBS will be the tracking system for recording the number of repairs, the car types and types of repairs. Then by applying the CRBS standard costs to the particular repairs, standard costs relationships by car type can be developed and used to distribute actual light and running repair cost pools to the car types.</P>
                  <P>(3) Railroads shall match repair costs billed by and paid to foreign roads with the car types that were repaired. Foreign billings for light and running repairs are usually conducted through CRBS, and therefore, the car types can be identified. For heavy off-line repairs, car type identification is possible because system management is generally involved with the authorization of such heavy repairs and car identification numbers are generally included in the billing process.</P>
                  <P>(4) Repair costs relating to foreign freight train cars shall also be reported by car types. However, a separate breakdown between foreign and system repair costs is not required for Board reporting purpose. Car type identification for light and running repairs to foreign cars can be obtained from CRBS tapes. The cost of heavy repairs to foreign cars should be accumulated by car types. The resulting expense credits from foreign railroads should be assigned to the car types to which they relate.</P>
                  <P>(5) Railroads shall match any resulting expense credits with the car types to which they relate. This can occur, for example, when a railroad is charged with the repair costs of system cars, but the responsibility of the repair ultimately rests with and is paid by a foreign road.</P>
                  <P>(d) Railroads shall submit to the Board any repair cost by car type methodology which does not agree with item (c) above. The Board shall review the methodology and determine if it is acceptable for reporting purposes.</P>
                  <P>(e) Railroads may submit justification and supporting documents requesting waiver from provisions required by this instruction. This provision is intended to provide relief for those smaller Class I railroads that might be unduly burdened by the cost of developing and maintaining the required system. Waivers shall be directed to the Board's Accounting and Valuation Board.</P>

                  <P>(f) Equipment repair cost records, including the allocation methods used, shall be maintained and made available to the Board upon request.

The amount of the write-down shall be accounted for as realized loss by a charge to account 551, <E T="03">Other Income Charges,</E> and a credit to account 723, <E T="03">Reserve for Adjustment of Investment in Securities.</E> The new cost basis shall not be changed for subsequent recoveries in value.</P>

                  <P>(b)(1) For financial statement purposes the carrier shall follow the principles of equity accounting for (1) all investments in corporate joint ventures (see definition 21(c)), and (2) all investments in voting stock of affiliated companies giving the carrier the ability to significantly influence the operating and financial policies of an <PRTPAGE P="44"/>investee (see definition 21(b)). For purposes of this instruction an investment of 20 percent or more of the outstanding voting stock of an investee will indicate the ability to exercise significant influence over an investee in the absence of evidence to the contrary.</P>
                  <P>(2) Since the equity method is not to be effected by entries in the books of accounts but is to apply only in financial reports to the Board, the carrier shall establish worksheet or memorandum accounts. Three basic worksheet or memorandum accounts are needed:</P>
                  <P>(i) An investment account to include (1) equity in the undistributed earnings or losses of the investee since the date of acquisition (see definition 21(g)); (2) accumulated amortization of the difference between cost and net assets at date of acquisition (see (b)(3) below); and other adjustments for disposition or writedown of investments.</P>
                  <P>(ii) An income account to include (1) the investor's share of the investee's undistributed profits or losses for each reporting period subsequent to acquisition of the investment except that in the year of acquisition such amount shall be determined from the date of acquisition; (2) amortization for the reporting period of the difference between cost and net assets at date of acquisition. This account shall be closed at year-end to the retained earnings memorandum account discussed in paragraph (iii) below.</P>
                  <P>(iii) A retained earnings account to include (1) equity in the undistributed earnings or losses of the investee since the date of acquisition; (2) accumulated amortization of the difference between cost and net assets acquired at date of acquisition (see (b)(3) below).</P>
                  <P>(iv) Other memorandum accounts will be needed for such adjustments as gains and losses on disposition of investments, recognition of impairments in value, the investor's share of extraordinary and prior period adjustments reported in the investee's financial statements (see instruction 1-2(d)), and provision for deferred taxes where it is reasonable to assume that undistributed earnings of an investee will be transferred to the investor in a taxable distribution. These memorandum accounts shall be closed at year-end to the retained earnings memorandum account discussed in paragraph (iii) above.</P>
                  <P>(3) The carrier shall retain the following information for each investee in support of the worksheet or memorandum accounts:</P>
                  <P>(i) Original cost of investment.</P>
                  <P>(ii) Equity in net assets of investee at date of acquisition.</P>
                  <P>(iii) Allocation of difference between cost and equity in net assets, namely, to specific assets of investee or to goodwill.</P>
                  <P>(iv) Accumulated amortization of difference between cost and equity in net assets.</P>
                  <P>(v) Unamortized balance of difference between cost and equity in net assets.</P>
                  <P>(vi) Equity in undistributed earnings/losses for each year since date of acquisition.</P>
                  <P>(vii) Dividends received since date of acquisition if determinable.</P>
                  <P>(viii) Proceeds from sale of investments.</P>
                  <P>(4) Any difference between the investor's cost and its share of the net assets of the investee at date of acquisition shall be allocated to specific assets of the investee to the extent the difference is attributable to them. When the difference is allocated to depreciable or amortizable assets, depreciation and amortization (through the investment and income memorandum accounts) should absorb the difference over the remaining life of the related assets. If the difference is not related to specific accounts, it should be considered goodwill and amortized over a reasonable period not to exceed 40 years. For investments made prior to November 1, 1970, amortization of goodwill is not required in the absence of evidence that the goodwill has a limited term of existence.</P>
                  <P>(5) The financial statements of the investee that are used for equity accounting should be timely. If the accounting year of the investee differs from that of the investor then the most recent available financial statements may be used. The lag in reporting should be consistent from period to period.</P>

                  <P>(6) Material profits or losses on transactions between the investor and <PRTPAGE P="45"/>investee shall be eliminated until realized by either company as if the two were consolidated.</P>
                  <P>(7) A transaction of the investee of a capital nature that affects the investor's share of the investee's stockholder's equity should be reported in the financial statements as if the two were consolidated.</P>
                  <P>(8) The investor shall deduct any dividends applicable to outstanding cumulative preferred stock whether or not declared, and any other dividends declared when computing its share of undistributed earnings or losses.</P>
                  <P>(9) The investor shall suspend application of the equity method when the investment (including the investment memorandum account) together with any net advances made to the investee is reduced to zero. Additional losses shall not be provided for unless the investor has guaranteed obligations of the investee or is otherwise committed to provide further financial support for the investee. If the investee subsequently reports net income the investor shall resume applying the equity method at such time as its share of that net income equals the share of net losses not recognized during the period of suspension.</P>
                  <P>(10) When the investor's voting stock interest falls below the level of ownership described in paragraph (b)(1) of this instruction, the investment no longer qualifies for the equity method. Should dividends received on the investment in subsequent periods exceed the investor's share of earnings for such periods, the investment memorandum and income memorandum accounts shall be reduced by the excess amount.</P>
                  <P>(11) When the level of ownership of an investment increases to that described in paragraph (b)(1) of this instruction, the equity method shall be applied. The memorandum accounts for the investment, income (for current year's equity in undistributed earnings less amoritzation), and retained earnings (for prior years' equity in undistributed earnings less amortization) shall be adjusted retroactively on a step-by-step basis determining the equity in net assets at date of acquisition, amortization adjustment, and equity in undistributed earnings or losses at each level of ownership. Where small purchases are made over a period of time and then a purhase is made which qualifies the investment for the equity method, the date of latest purchase may be used as date of acquisition.</P>
                  <P>(12) Information having significance with respect to the investor's ownership in investees shall be disclosed in notes to financial statements of annual reports filed with the Board in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.</P>
                  <P>(c) When securities with a fixed maturity date are purchased at a discount (i.e., when total cost including brokerage fees, taxes, commissions, etc., is less than par), such discounts may be amortized over the remaining life of the securities through periodic debits to the account in which the securities are carried (preferably coincident with entries recording interest accruals) and credits to the same account in which interest income is credited. No debits shall be made in respect to discounts upon securities held as investments or in special funds if there is reason to believe that such securities will be disposed of by redemption or otherwise at less than par or will not be paid at date of maturity. When securities with a fixed maturity date are purchased at a premium (i.e., when the total cost including brokerage fees, taxes, commissions, etc., is in excess of par), such premium may be amortized over the remaining life of the securities through periodic credits to the account in which the securities are carried (preferably coincident with entries recording interest accruals) and debits to the same accounts in which the interest income is recorded.</P>
                  <NOTE>
                    <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
                    <P>The carrier shall follow generally accepted accounting principles where an interpretation of the rules for equity accounting is needed or obtain an interpretation from its public accountant or the Board.</P>

Related debt expense shall also be charged to account 548 on a proportional and consistent basis. The amounts for the respective debit balances for discount and expenses applicable to a particular issue of obligations may be charged directly to account 548 at time of issue when the aggregate of such amounts does not appreciably affect the accounts. The method of apportioning debt discount, issue costs, and premium to accounts 517 and 548 shall be the <E T="03">interest method,</E> where the effective interest rate on the date of issuance is applied to the carrying value (debt, less related discount, and issue cost, plus related premium of each specific issue to the beginning of any given period.) However, other methods of amortization may be used if the results obtained are not materially different from those which would result from the interest method.</P>

                  <P>(c) When any funded debt which has been actually issued to bona fide holders for value is reacquired by the accounting company, that proportion of the balance remaining in accounts containing discount, expense and premium on funded debt for the subclass of the security reacquired applicable to the portion reacquired shall be credited or charged thereto, as appropriate, and concurrently charged or credited to account 519, <E T="03">Miscellaneous income,</E> account 551, <E T="03">Miscellaneous income charges</E>; or to account 570, <E T="03">Extraordinary items,</E> as appropriate, in accordance with the text of these accounts. Such proportion shall be based upon the ratio of the par value of the security reacquired to the par value of all the securities of the subclass actually outstanding immediately before such reacquirement. Gains and losses from extinguishment of debt (excluding debt maturing serially) which is acquired to satisfy sinking fund requirements, shall not be recorded as extraordinary items regardless of amount, but shall be included in accounts 519 and 551, as appropriate. Such gains and losses shall be separately disclosed in reports to this Board.</P>

                  <P>6-2 <E T="03">Material and stationery store expenses.</E> (a) To clearing accounts called <E T="03">Material store expenses</E> and <E T="03">Stationery store expenses</E> shall be charged expenses <PRTPAGE P="48"/>in connection with purchasing, handling and storing material and stationery in and distributing it from the company's storehouses. Including the pay of officers and employees in the purchasing and store departments and their traveling, office, and other expenses; also expenses, including wages, fuel, and supplies, of operating switching locomotives when exclusively assigned to the service of switching at material storehouses. (Expenses of incidental switching at material yards by locomotives in regular switching service shall be charged to the appropriate transportation accounts.) The pay and expenses of men employed in purchasing or inspecting a single class of material, such as ties, shall be added as store expenses to the cost of that particular material.</P>
                  <P>(b) The total amount of storehouse expenses charged to these accounts shall be distributed among the accounts to which material and stationery has been charged, in proportion to the amounts charged to each account for the items issued, except that the amount representing the purchasing department expenses shall be apportioned on the value of the items issued which were purchased by that department. To avoid monthly fluctuations in the ratio of store expenses to the value of material and stationery purchased or issued, carriers may make a monthly apportionment on the basis of fair percentage rates, provided the store expense accounts are adjusted and closed out at the end of each year.</P>
                  <P>6-3 <E T="03">Shop expenses.</E> (a) To a clearing account entitled <E T="03">Shop expenses</E> shall be charged items of expense at shops, enginehouses, repair tracks, and other places where mechanical work is performed, not assignable directly to specific accounts. Such expenses shall be apportioned among the various accounts affected. The basis of distribution shall be the relative proportion which the total amount of charges to <E T="03">Shop expenses</E> bears to the total of the directly distributed labor. To avoid monthly fluctuations in the ratio of shop expenses to the total of distributed labor, carriers are permitted to make the monthly apportionment on the basis of a percentage of the distributed labor, provided the shop expense account is adjusted and closed out at the end of the year.</P>
                  <P>(b) The expenses assignable to this account shall include the pay of foremen (who exercise supervision over all departments), their clerks, and other employees engaged in general work in and about shops, cost of heat, light and power; cost of small tools and supplies and water and power purchased; also cost of removal of snow and ice from transfer tables and shop yards, and other incidental shop expenses. To this account shall be charged expenses, including wages, fuel and supplies, of operating switching locomotives when exclusively assigned to switching service at shops (the expenses of incidental switching at shops by locomotives in transportation switching service shall be charged to appropriate transportation accounts).</P>

To this account shall be charged cost of the land in excess of its estimated value after the gravel, sand, or stone has been removed (credit to the property account in which the cost of the land is included); payments for right to enter upon and remove ballast from land not owned by the carrier; cost of sinking test holes; and costs preparatory to opening the pit or quarry. To this account shall be charged also the cost, in excess of the estimated salvage value, of rails and fastenings, ties, other material and labor used in constructing tracks to and in the gravel pit or quarry (the estimated salvage being carried in an appropriate suspense account); cost of labor and train service employed in producing, quarrying, and loading ballast, including the cost of operation, repairs, and depreciation of power shovels and other machines and machinery; pay and expenses of watchmen; cost of explosives and hand tools, and miscellaneous expenses; and cost of installing, operating and maintaining signals and interlockers at gravel pits.</P>

                  <P>(b) Credit to the clearing account shall be made each month to cover the <PRTPAGE P="49"/>cost of ballast material produced during the month. The cost of production shall include the expenses directly assignable to the monthly output plus a proportion of the expenses not directly assignable, such as cost of land, tracks, machinery, and interlockers. This latter amount shall be computed upon the basis of the ratio which the monthly output bears to the total estimated yardage to be taken from the pit. When any portion of the product of such pits or quarries is sold, the cost thereof shall be credited to this clearing account and any related profit shall be credited to account 110, <E T="03">Incidental.</E>

                  <P>(b) When the power from such a plant is properly chargeable to more than one account, the expenses of maintaining and operating the plant shall be included in clearing account designated <E T="03">Power plant operations.</E> The expense of maintenance shall be cleared from that account to the appropriate maintenance accounts. The expenses of operation shall be apportioned to the appropriate accounts upon the basis of quantity of power used for the various purposes.</P>

                  <P>(c) When a part of the power produced by a power plant is sold and the remainder is used in the carrier's own operations, the cost of maintaining and operating the plant shall be charged to a clearing account. The expense of maintenance shall be cleared from that account to the appropriate maintenance accounts. The proportion of the expenses of operation assignable to the power sold, on the basis of ratio of quantity of power sold to total quantity of power produced, shall be credited to this clearing account and any related profit shall be credited to account 110, <E T="03">Incidental.</E> The remainder of the cost of operation shall be distributed to the appropriate expense accounts for the carrier's own operations.</P>

                  <HD SOURCE="HD5">Specialized Services Operations Subactivity—(XX-34-XX)</HD>
                  <P>(4) <E T="03">Specialized Services Operations</E> subactivity of the Transportation activity refers to operating services which are specialized in nature and in cost characteristics, including all of those so designated by the Board. The purpose of segregating the cost of such services is primarily to preclude distortion of general costs applicable to the Train Operations and Yard Operations subactivities. Secondarily, further breakout of the costs of operating individual specialized services can be provided in less detail than the full range of natural expense accounts, in reports used for recurring cost analysis purposes pertaining to each type of specialized service.</P>
                  <P>The designated specialized services operations are as follows:</P>
                  <P>(a) <E T="03">TOFC/COFC Operations</E> refers to the function of operating rail-to-ground or water and ground or water-to-rail transfer facilities for handling trailers or containers, including related storage; and the highway movement of trailers or containers within a terminal area for purposes of pick-up, delivery, or interchange.</P>
                  <P>The service includes loading, tie-down, and/or unloading flat cars or dollies and piggyback trailers to or from highway tractors; moving trailers, dollies, or containers within the facility; servicing, cleaning, and fueling (but not repairing or maintaining) facility equipment; operating storage areas; and casualties, claims, and insurance relating to the facility.</P>
                  <P>TOFC/COFC Operations do not include Plan V or other arrangements, where there is a division of revenues between the rail and motor carrier. They do not include switching services performed within the facility by yard or road crews. They also do not include the functions of the Way and Structures, Equipment, and General and Administrative activities, or the Train, Yard, Train and Yard Common, or Administrative Support Operations subactivities.</P>
                  <P>(b) <E T="03">Floating Operations</E> refers to operations of water vessels and equipment in revenue service. They include the operation of carferries, tugs, barges, <PRTPAGE P="96"/>lighterage, and all other forms of water craft.</P>
                  <P>Floating operations exclude operations includable in the Administrative Support Operations subactivity, and the switching transfer of cars between general yards or trains and the facility or a dedicated yard serving the facility, or switching within the dedicated supporting terminal facility when performed by yard crews. They also do not include costs appropriate to the Way and Structures, Equipment, or General and Administrative activities.</P>
                  <P>Floating operations should be classified by line and terminal operations. The distribution should be made based on the nature of the operation and not the facility or equipment. When the service occurs between distinct terminals, the operation should be considered a line operation. When the service is conducted within a general terminal or harbor area, the operation should be considered a terminal operation.</P>
                  <P>(c) <E T="03">Coal Terminal Operations and Ore Terminal Operations</E> refers to operations of rail-to-water or water-to-rail transloading facilities for coal or for ores, including related storage, blending, and other processing or handling at the facility.

                  <P>These terminal operations do not include costs appropriate to the Way and Structures, Equipment, or General and Administrative activities. They also do not include costs appropriate to the Train Operations, Yard Operations, Train and Yard Operations Common, or Administrative Support Services Operations subactivities. Switching transfer of cars between general yards or trains and the facility or a dedicated yard serving the facility and switching within the dedicated supporting terminal facility when performed by yard crews should be charged to the Yard Operations subactivity.</P>
                  <P>(d) <E T="03">Other Marine Terminal Operations</E> refers to the operations of marine terminals other than those for which a separate designated specialized service operation category is provided.</P>

                  <HD SOURCE="HD5">Administrative Support Operations Subactivity—(XX-35-XX)</HD>
                  <P>(5) <E T="03">Administrative Support Operations</E> subactivity refers to operations providing direct administrative support to the overall Transportation activity. It includes administrative support for the Common, and the Specialized Services Operations subactivities. The administrative support operations includes receiving and processing customer orders, requesting cars, preparing waybills, rating shipments, billing customers, collecting customer receivables in the ordinary course of business (not to include treasury, legal, general accounting, revenue accounting, or credit operations, all of which are chargeable to the General and Administrative activity), billing and recording demurrage, reporting interchanges, reporting advances, and the initial reporting and summarization of input documents for purposes of cash collection and accounting. Any operations beyond the initial summarization and reporting of input data are assignable <PRTPAGE P="97"/>to the General and Administrative activity except for those otherwise included in the definition of this subactivity.</P>
                  <P>Carrier staff, administrative, or clerical operations related to operating or transportation department general administration should not be charged to this subactivity. The Administrative Support Operations subactivity may be performed at local stations, regional offices, or even at the general offices; however, the location of the operation performance does not affect its nature. The operations included in this subactivity should reasonably correlate to the quantity of shipments or to the quantity of carloadings.</P>
                  <HD SOURCE="HD5">General and Administrative Activity—(XX-60-XX)</HD>
                  <P>(D) <E T="03">General and Administrative</E> activity refers to the providing of overall administration or other general support for carrier operations.

                <P>Section 205(e)(1)(A) of the 3R Act directs the office to issue regulations which will permit the collection and publication by the Consolidated Rail Corp. (ConRail), or by profitable railroads of information necessary to determine accurately the revenues attributable, avoidable costs, and service units of light-density lines scheduled for abandonment. This accurate information is intended to facilitate the determination of the revenues and avoidable costs in abandonment proceedings and in potential offers of subsidy. This information is intended to be compatible with the Regional Subsidy Standards, for those lines which were not conveyed to ConRail under the final system plan and with the National Subsidy Standards (49 CFR Part 1152, Subpart D), for all other lines. The purpose of the Branch Line Accounting System regulations is to specify an accounting system for the collection and publication of this information.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Lines for which data collection is required.</E> The railroad shall collect data on all branch lines which meet the criteria listed in paragraphs 1 through 4 below. The data to be collected are specified in section 920(b).</P>
                <P>(1) Branch lines in categories (1), (2), and (3) on the System Diagram Map include, respectively, lines for which a carrier intends to file an abandonment application within three years, lines which the carrier has under study and are potentially subject to abandonment, and lines for which an abandonment application is pending before the Board. The collection of data on such lines shall commence on the first day of the month after the line has been designated in one of the categories and will continue so long as the branch line is retained in one of these categories. The assignment and apportionment methodology set forth in Part 1152, Subchapter B (National Subsidy Standards), shall be applied.</P>
                <P>(2) For branch lines operated under an order directing service, under section 304(d)(3) of the 3R Act, data shall be collected from the effective date of the order until the order is withdrawn.</P>
                <P>(3) For branch lines operated under a rail service continuation agreement under section 1a(6)(a) of the IC Act, data shall be collected from the effective date of the agreement until the termination of the agreement. The assignment and apportionment methodology set forth in Part 1152, Subchapter B (National Subsidy Standards), shall be applied.</P>
                <P>(4) For branch lines operated under a rail service continuation agreement under section 304 of the 3R Act, data collection shall commence on the effective date of the agreement and shall continue until the termination date of the agreement.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Data to be collected.</E> The data collected shall include the items of revenue, expense, and service units which are specified in 49 CFR 1152, as described in the account texts listed in section 950.

                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The railroad shall file on or before June 30 of each calendar year the certification included in these regulations as Appendix I. The railroad shall include a description of each branch line using the format set forth in Appendix I of these regulations. The description of each branch line requires the same data as that submitted under 49 CFR 1152.11. This section prescribes the branch line information required in conjunction with the system diagram maps specifying the line's designation, states and counties traversed, delineation of mileposts, and location of agency and terminal stations.</P>

                <P>The Uniform System of Accounts for Railroad Companies (49 CFR part 1201) requires that carriers assign directly to freight service or to passenger service, including allied services, the expenses, taxes, and purchased services incurred solely for the benefit of either freight or passenger service.</P>

                <P>The Uniform System of Accounts also requires that carriers assign to common expense accounts the remaining expenses, taxes and purchased services which are not solely related to either freight or passenger service.

                <P>When the separation of common expense accounts between freight and passenger services is based upon special tests or service unit factors, such tests shall be made at sufficiently frequent intervals to represent actual operating conditions.

                <SUBJECT>Operating expense account number notation.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) The operating expense account numbers consist of a six-digit coding structure divided into three two-digit groups. The first two-digit group denotes natural expenses; the second <PRTPAGE P="176"/>group denotes activities/subactivities for freight, passenger or common service; and the third group signifies applicable function assignment.</P>
                <GPH DEEP="22" SPAN="1">
                  <GID>ec03mr91.050</GID>
                </GPH>
                <P>(b) For reporting purposes, four natural expense categories are utilized. The categories are: salaries and wages (account 11-XX-XX); material, tools, supplies, fuels and lubricants (account 21-XX-XX); purchased services (accounts 31-XX-XX to 41-XX-XX, inclusive); and general (accounts 61-XX-XX to 65-XX-XX, inclusive, 51-XX-XX, 52-XX-XX, 53-XX-XX and 12-XX-XX).</P>

                <P>(c) The symbol “XX” in the first two-digit group is used throughout the separation instructions to denote more than one natural expense associated with the same activity/subactivity-function account structure. For reporting purposes, the natural expense account numbers represented by “XX” include:

                <P>(d) The “30” natural expense designation indicates a summation of specific purchased service accounts that are reported in total rather than individually. The specific accounts under the way and structures activity except for administration functions include 39-1X-XX, repairs billed by others, Dr.; 40-1X-XX, repairs billed to others, cr.; and 41-1X-XX, other purchased services. For the equipment activity excluding administration functions, the “30” designation denotes the summation of 39-2X-XX and 41-2X-XX.</P>
                <P>(e) The “41” natural expense designation (other purchased services) is the purchased service category of the “XX” code for the following:</P>
                <P>(1) Way and structures activity administration—function accounts,</P>
                <P>(2) Equipment activity administration—function accounts,</P>
                <P>(3) Transportation activity expense accounts, and</P>
                <P>(4) General and administration activity expense accounts.</P>
                <P>(f) The “61” general natural expense designation is applicable to all accounts with the “XX” symbol except transportation, train and yards accounts (XX-(33/43/53)-XX).</P>
                <P>(g) The natural expense account number “50” is used throughout the separation instructions to indicate the summation of accounts 52-XX-XX, Other casualties, and 53-XX-XX, Insurance, that are reported as one item, “Casualties and Insurance,” (50-XX-XX).</P>
                <P>(h) The number “98” in the function account group (last two digits) is used in the separation rules to designate the summation of a natural expense consisting of more than one functional assignment that is reported as one item. This includes Repairs Billed to Others, Cr.—Equipment (40-2X-XX). For example, the locomotive subactivity contains accounts 40-(21/24/26)-40, 40-(21/24/26)-41, and 40-(21/24/26)-48 which are treated as 40-(21/24/26)-98.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Instructions for separation.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Certain instructions for separating common expense accounts (dependent accounts) between freight and passenger services base the allocation on the proportional freight/passenger separation of other common expense accounts (independent accounts). The dependent account is frequently identified by an “XX” symbol in the natural expense position (first two digits) with corresponding independent accounts also identified by the “XX” natural expense symbol. Unless otherwise stated, the applicable natural expense associated with “XX” symbol shall be the same for both the dependent and independent accounts.</P>
                <P>(b) To illustrate, § 1242.10 provides instructions for separating common Way and Structures, Administration—Track accounts (dependent accounts) designated by XX-19-02. The separation is based on certain other common Way and Structures accounts including Roadway—Running, XX-17-10, and Roadway—Switching, XX-18-10.</P>

                <P>(c) As § 1242.05 states, the “XX” symbol denotes the following natural expenses for Way and Structures administration functions:
                </P>

                </EXTRACT>
                
                <FP>These natural expenses shall be individually applied to the separation rules in § 1242.10. In each case, the independent accounts providing the basis for freight/passenger separation of the dependent account shall have the same natural expense designation. For example, the basis of separating account 11-19-02, Salaries and Wages, Way and Structures, Administration—Track, would be based on certain independent accounts including 11-17/18-10, Salaries and Wages, Way and Structures, Running/Switching, Repair and Maintenance, Roadway.</FP>

              <P>(a) Effective July 1, 1981 and thereafter, unless otherwise ordered, each railroad as defined in § 1244.1 above is required to file waybill sample information for all line-haul revenue waybills terminated on its lines if it terminates at least 4,500 revenue carloads in any of the three preceding years, or if it terminates at least 5% of the revenue carloads terminating in any state in any of the three preceding years. A railroad required to file waybill sample information under this section shall herein be referred to as <E T="03">subject railroad.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(b) Waybill terminations shall include all line-haul revenue movements terminating for waybilling purposes on the subject railroad's line whether the lading is destined for the terminating station as denoted on the waybill or the shipment is being rebilled or forwarded to the ultimate destination by another railroad or another mode of transportation (e.g., lake cargo, inbound transit, or other rebilled movements).</P>
              <P>(c) Each subject railroad shall also file the required waybill sample information for all of its railroad subsidiaries.</P>
              <P>(d) Each subject railroad shall also file the required waybill sample information for any other railroad for which it performs revenue billing and/or interline settlements under special agreement.</P>
              <P>(e) The surviving corporate entity of railroads (subject to the Interstate Commerce Act) who have merged or reorganized shall be required to report waybill sample information if its predecessor railroad or any of its predecessor railroads were required to report under this section.</P>
              <P>(f) In order to determine the number of carloads terminated in each state, railroads not otherwise submitting waybill information must report annually the number of carloads terminated by state for the last calendar year. These reports shall be submitted by March 1 of the year following the report year.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Transition.</E> This final rule will apply to all subject waybills which are in the subject railroad's audit month of July 1981 and all audit months thereafter.

              <P>(a) Subject railroads shall file waybill sample information in one of the following two ways. (1) Authenticated copies of a sample of audited revenue waybills—the manual system (paragraph (b) of this section). (2) A computer tape containing specified information from a sample of waybills—the computerized system (paragraph (c) of this section).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">The Manual System.</E> (1) The sample of subject waybills shall be as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) All waybills with less than 6 carloads per waybill whose serial numbers are 1 or end in 01,</P>
              <P>(ii) All waybills with 6 to 25 carloads per waybill whose serial numbers end in 1; and,</P>
              <P>(iii) All waybills with 26 or more carloads per waybill whose serial numbers end in 1 or 7.</P>
              <P>(2) The expected sampling rates for the manual system are as follows:</P>

              <SUBJECT>Procedures for the release of waybill data.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The procedures for the release of waybill data identify five classes of users of the STB Waybill Sample, define the waybill information or data that each class of users may obtain, and set forth the applicable requirements for the data's release. They also formalize notice and protest procedures for the possible release of waybill data to other users to protect against the inappropriate release of confidential data. The Director of the Office of Economics shall be responsible for releasing waybill data in accordance with these procedures.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Class of user, available data, and applicable release requirements</E>—(1) <E T="03">Railroads.</E> Each requesting railroad may obtain any waybill record from the STB Waybill Sample covering traffic that originated, terminated, or was bridged by that railroad. The railroad shall not have access to waybill data pertaining to traffic in which it did not participate. Also, it must meet all STB and legal requirements concerning release of shipper information in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 11904(a).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Federal agencies.</E> Each requesting Federal agency (including quasi-governmental agencies) may obtain any waybill record from the STB Waybill Sample subject to the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(i) The Federal agency shall make the information contained in the STB Waybill Sample available only to its employees or those contractors working on the particular project or study requiring the waybill data.</P>
              <P>(ii) The Federal agency will ensure that railroads and shippers are afforded the same privilege and protection against disclosure of the waybill data as the Board provides.</P>
              <P>(iii) The Federal agency will not release any data to the public unless the data elements are aggregated to contain at least three shippers and to prevent identification of an individual railroad.</P>
              <P>(iv) The Federal agency will refer any requests for waybill data and accompanying documentation to the STB for processing and will so inform the requesting party of such referral to the Board.</P>
              <P>(v) The Federal agency must sign an agreement annually with the Board agreeing to these restrictions.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">States.</E> Each requesting State may obtain any waybill record pertaining to traffic that was originated, terminated, interchanged in, or that passed through its State subject to the same requirements imposed on federal agencies under paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (v) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Transportation practitioners, consulting firms, and law firms</E>—<E T="03">specific proceedings.</E> Transportation practitioners, consulting firms and law firms may use data from the STB Waybill Sample in preparing verified statements to be submitted in formal proceedings before the STB and/or State Boards (Board) subject to the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(i) The STB Waybill Sample is the only single source of the data or obtaining the data from other sources is burdensome or costly, and the data is relevant to issues pending before the Board.</P>
              <P>(ii) The requestor submits to the STB a written waybill request that complies with § 1244.9(e).</P>
              <P>(iii) All waybill data must be returned to the STB, and the firm must not keep any copies.</P>

              <P>(iv) A transportation practitioner, consulting firm, or law firm must submit any evidence drawn from the STB <PRTPAGE P="192"/>Waybill Sample to the Board only unless the evidence is aggregated to the level of at least three shippers and will prevent the identification of an individual railroad. Nonaggregated evidence submitted to the Board will be made part of the public record only if the Board finds that it does not reveal competitively sensitive data. However, evidence found to be sensitive may be provided to counsel or other independent representatives for other parties subject to the usual and customary protective order issued by the Board or appropriate authorized official.</P>
              <P>(v) For each Board proceeding, a firm must sign a confidentiality agreement with the STB agreeing to the above restrictions before any data will be released. This agreement will permit use of the released data for a period of one year from the date the agreement is signed by the user. If the data is required for an additional period of time because a proceeding is still pending before the Board, the firm must sign a new confidentiality agreement covering the data needed for each additional year the proceeding is opened.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Public use.</E> Nonconfidential waybill data may be obtained from the “Public Use Waybill File”. Reports produced from the Public Use Waybill File may be used, published, or released. The Public Use Waybill File contains the following nonconfidential items:</P>

              <P>(1) <E T="03">Notice of request for confidential waybill data.</E> Affected railroads and shippers will receive notice by <E T="04">Federal Register</E> Publication. If railroad <PRTPAGE P="193"/>specific or shipper specific data are requested, those parties will be given written notice of the request.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Form of notice.</E> The notice shall identify the parties requesting the data; describe the type of waybill data requested; and state the purpose for which the data is requested. The notice shall include a statement that parties seeking information concerning the filing of objections should refer to 49 CFR 1224.9, or contact the Surface Transportation Board's Office of Economics.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Objections to release.</E> (i) Objections to release of the confidential waybill data must be filed by the railroad and/or shipper with the Director, Office of Economics, Surface Transportation Board, Washington, DC, no later than 14 calendar days from publication of the notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) The objection shall identify the parties seeking the confidential waybill data, reiterate the purpose for which the data is sought, and state all grounds for objection to full or partial disclosure of the requested data.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Board determination.</E> (i) The Director of the Office of Economics will consider all objections in determining whether to release the requested waybill data. Each railroad or shipper who filed objections will be sent written notice of the Director's decision not less than 14 calendar days prior to the disclosure date.</P>
              <P>(ii) The Board reserves the right to deny the release of waybill data although no objections may be filed.</P>
              <P>(iii) Appeals must be filed with the Board within 10 days of the date of the Director's decision. Responses to appeals must be filed within 10 days thereafter (49 CFR 1011.6(b)). The filing of an appeal will automatically stay the effect of the Director's decision.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Content of waybill requests.</E> (1) All requestors under paragraphs (b)(4) and (c) of this section shall include the following information:</P>
              <P>(i) A complete and detailed explanation of the purpose for which the requested data are needed.</P>
              <P>(ii) A description of the specific waybill data or fields actually required (including pertinent geographic areas).</P>
              <P>(iii) A detailed justification as to why the specified waybill data are needed.</P>
              <P>(2) The waybill request shall be filed with the Director, Office of Economics, Surface Transportation Board, Washington, DC.</P>
              <P>(f) Aggregation of confidential shipper data.</P>

              <P>(2) To aggregate the waybill data to the level of three shippers, the three-FSAC Rule shall be used. Under this rule, there must be at least three different freight stations as identified by the Freight Station Accounting Code (FSAC) on one railroad or there must be at least two more FSAC's than there are railroads present in the waybill data being aggregated.</P>
              <P>(3) The three-FSAC Rule shall apply to every number and calculation publicly released.</P>
              <P>(4) The Director of Office of Economics will consider requests to apply an alternative aggregation method provided the requestor establishes that a particular project necessitates an alternative approach and that approach effectively protects the identity of individual shippers.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Complaint procedures.</E> (1) Complaints for alleged breaches of confidentiality or misuse of confidential waybill data must include the following:</P>

              <P>The rules governing the classification of railroad employees and reports of their service and compensation outlined in §§ 1245.3 and 1245.4 are required, and all Class I railroads within the scope of Section 11145 of the Interstate Commerce Act shall be governed by such rules in the preparation and submission of their annual and other periodic reports to the Surface Transportation Board in accordance with the forms adopted for such returns (§ 1245.2); and also with respect to any other matters covered by these rules.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Reports of railroad employees, service and compensation.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Each Class I railroad is required to file a Quarterly Report of Railroad Employees, Service, and Compensation, (Quarterly Wage Forms A &amp; B). In addition, such carriers shall also file an Annual Report of Railroad Employees, Service, and Compensation, (Annual Wage Forms A &amp; B) for each calendar year. Both reports shall be submitted, in paper or electronically, to the Office of Economics, Surface Transportation Board, Washington, DC. The quarterly report shall be submitted within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. The annual report shall be submitted within 45 days after the end of the reporting year.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Employees; definition, service hours, and compensation.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Definition of “employees”.</E> The word <E T="03">employees,</E> as used in this part, is intended to include every person in the service of the reporting carrier subject to its continuing authority to supervise and direct the manner of rendition of his service. Persons engaged to render only specifically defined service and not subject to the continuing authority of the carrier to supervise and control their acts, such as customhouse brokers, lawyers retained only for specific cases and not under general or continuing retainer, etc., are not employees in the meaning of the term used in this part.<PRTPAGE P="195"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Counting employees.</E> Since the number of employees fluctuates, carriers are required to classify and count all of their employees at twelve different times each year.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Joint employees.</E> Each person jointly employed shall, if carried on the payrolls of the several joint employers, be counted by each employer and represented in its return of number of employees by a fraction based on the number of employers reporting him; if a person, for example, is reportable by three employers, each should include him in its number of employees as one-third of an employee. When the entire compensation of a joint employee is shown on the payroll of a single joint employer and is paid to the employee by that employer such employee should, for the purpose of returns, be treated as if employed solely by such employer.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Service hours.</E> (1) The number of hours on duty, or held for duty, and the number of hours paid for are to be ascertained and recorded for every class of employee. For enginemen and trainmen, the actual number of miles run and miles paid for but not run are to be recorded, as well as the number of hours on duty and the number of hours paid for. (The service time of all classes of employees shall be recorded in hours instead of days or hours as heretofore.)</P>
              <P>(2) Whenever an employee works at more than one occupation, or in more than one class of service, both the number of hours worked and the compensation paid, should be separated and reported under the proper Reporting Divisions.</P>
              <P>(3) If an employee is paid a day's wage for a smaller number of hours than constitutes a day's work, the number of hours paid for as well as the actual number of hours the employee is on duty should be ascertained and recorded. Time allowed for meals, part holidays, holidays, absences on leave, vacations, etc., should be excluded from time actually worked, but if such time is paid for it should be appropriately reported as “Time paid for but not worked” on Form A or as a “constructive allowance” on Form B. These requirements apply to enginemen and trainmen paid on the basis of trips or of miles run, and to employees paid at piece rates, as well as to employees paid on hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or other time basis. Service hours for officers and employees who do not receive payment for overtime should be reported as the number of hours in each month at 8 hours per day contemplated for the position.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Compensation.</E> The compensation of employees as defined in the rules in this part is to be stated in such manner and detail as the forms adopted for periodical returns require.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 1245.4</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Forms required to be used.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The report of information to the Surface Transportation Board on railroad employees, service and compensation includes two forms. Form A relates to employees other than train and engine service employees. Form B relates to train and engine service employees.</P>

              <P>(b) With general reference to the statement of the compensation of employees in Forms A and B, it should be understood that the total compensation received by the employees in each Reporting Division, as well as the amount of work they perform, should be shown properly distributed under the prescribed column heads as indicated by the forms. It should be noted that if the work of an employee varies during a report period, his time and compensation should be apportioned accordingly. Amounts reported should be gross compensation paid.
              </P>

                  <E T="03">Illustrations.</E> (a) In the course of a month, an employee works as a Machinist, and as such earns $200 and he works also as a Gang Foreman and earns $130. The pay received by him in the occupation of Machinist with corresponding time should be included in returns for Division 61, “Machinists”, and his other pay and time as indicated should be included in returns for Division 53, “Gang Foremen and Gang Leaders”. (b) When an employee works at two or more of the occupations of engineer, fireman, conductor, and brakeman, his time and compensation should be assigned in accordance with the facts. For example, in a certain month an employee earns as a Through Freight Engineer $110, as a Local or Way Freight Engineer $140, as a Yard Engineer $100, and as a Local or Way Freight Fireman $75. The time and the compensation of this employee should be correspondingly distributed among Reporting <PRTPAGE P="196"/>Divisions 122, 123, 124, and 127 as they are respectively applicable, without regard to the predominance of the time worked or the amount earned by him in one occupation.</P>
              </EXTRACT>
              
              <P>(c) As elsewhere indicated, the statement of the number of employees in the service of a company with respect to Reporting Divisions depends upon the allocation of the individual employees as of the day of count.</P>
              <P>(d) The Reporting Divisions shown in Forms A and B following will also be used in connection with the employees' schedule in the annual reports of railroads of classes I and II to the Board. Railroads of class III and lessor companies shall report only the information required in the annual report forms prescribed for such companies.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The reporting period covers:</P>
              <P>(1) For § 1250.2(a)(1)-(9), 12:01 a.m. Saturday-11:59 p.m. Friday;</P>
              <P>(2) For § 1250.2(a)(10), the previous calendar month;</P>

              <P>(4) For § 1250.3(a)(1)-(2), 12:01 a.m. Saturday-11:59 p.m. Friday.</P>

              <P>(b) The data required under § 1250.2 and § 1250.3(a) must be reported to the Board via the method and in the form <PRTPAGE P="215"/>prescribed by the Board's Office of Public Assistance, Governmental Affairs, and Compliance (OPAGAC) by 5 p.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday of each week. In the event that a particular Wednesday is a Federal holiday or falls on a day when STB offices are closed for any other reason, then the data should be reported on the next business day when the offices are open.</P>
              <P>(c) Each reporting railroad shall provide an explanation of its methodology for deriving the data with its initial filing and an update if and when that methodology changes. This explanation should include the unit train definition that the railroad will use in its data reporting, which shall reflect its assignment of train codes in accordance with its normal business practices. If and when a railroad changes its definition of unit train it shall notify the Board of the change at the time it goes into effect in the form prescribed by OPAGAC.</P>
              <P>(d) Unless otherwise provided, the performance data, Chicago data and alert levels, narrative infrastructure reporting, and any methodologies or explanations of data collection reported to the Board under this part will be publicly available and posted on the Board's Web site.</P>

              <P>(1) System-average train speed for the overall system and for the following train types for the reporting week. (Train speed should be measured for line-haul movements between terminals. The average speed for each train type should be calculated by dividing total train-miles by total hours operated.)</P>
              <P>(i) Intermodal.</P>
              <P>(ii) Grain unit.</P>
              <P>(iii) Coal unit.</P>

              <P>(v) Crude oil unit.</P>
              <P>(vi) Ethanol unit.</P>
              <P>(vii) Manifest.</P>
              <P>(viii) System.</P>

              <P>(2) Weekly average terminal dwell time, measured in hours, excluding cars on run-through trains (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> cars that arrive at, and depart from, a terminal on the same through train), for the carrier's system and its 10 largest terminals in terms of railcars processed. (Terminal dwell is the average time a car resides at a specified terminal location expressed in hours.)</P>

              <P>(3) Weekly average cars on line by the following car types for the reporting week. (Each railroad shall average its daily on-line inventory of freight cars. Articulated cars should be counted as a single unit. Cars on private tracks (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> at a customer's facility) should be counted on the last railroad on which they were located. Maintenance-of-way cars and other cars in railroad service are to be excluded.)</P>
              <P>(i) Box.</P>
              <P>(ii) Covered hopper.</P>
              <P>(iii) Gondola.</P>
              <P>(iv) Intermodal.</P>
              <P>(v) Multilevel (Automotive).</P>

              <P>(ix) Total.</P>
              <P>(4) Weekly average dwell time at origin for the following train types: Grain unit, coal unit, automotive unit, crude oil unit, ethanol unit, and all other unit trains. (For the purposes of this data element, dwell time refers to the time period from release of a unit train at origin until actual movement by the receiving carrier.)</P>
              <P>(5) The weekly average number of trains holding per day sorted by train type (intermodal, grain unit, coal unit, automotive unit, crude oil unit, ethanol unit, other unit, and manifest) and by cause (crew, locomotive power, or other). (Railroads are instructed to run a same-time snapshot of trains holding each day, and then to calculate the average for the reporting period.)</P>

              <P>(6) The weekly average of loaded and empty cars, operating in normal movement and billed to an origin or destination, which have not moved in 48 hours <PRTPAGE P="216"/>or more sorted by service type (intermodal, grain, coal, crude oil, automotive, ethanol, fertilizer (the following Standard Transportation Commodity Codes (STCCs): 2871236, 2871235, 2871238, 2819454, 2812534, 2818426, 2819815, 2818170, 2871315, 2818142, 2818146, 2871244, 2819173, 2871313, and 2871451), and all other). In order to derive the averages for the reporting period, carriers should run a same-time snapshot each day of the reporting period, capturing cars that have not moved in 48 hours or more. The number of cars captured on the daily snapshot for each category should be added, and then divided by the number of days in the reporting period. In deriving this data, carriers should include cars in normal service anywhere on their system, but should not include cars placed at a customer facility; in constructive placement; placed for interchange to another carrier; in bad order status; in storage; or operating in railroad service (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> ballast).</P>
              <P>(7) The weekly total number of grain cars loaded and billed, reported by state, aggregated for the following STCCs: 01131 (barley), 01132 (corn), 01133 (oats), 01135 (rye), 01136 (sorghum grains), 01137 (wheat), 01139 (grain, not elsewhere classified), 01144 (soybeans), 01341 (beans, dry), 01342 (peas, dry), and 01343 (cowpeas, lentils, or lupines). “Total grain cars loaded and billed” includes cars in shuttle service; dedicated train service; reservation, lottery, open and other ordering systems; and private cars. Additionally, separately report the total cars loaded and billed in shuttle service (or dedicated train service), if any, versus total cars loaded and billed in all other ordering systems, including private cars.</P>
              <P>(8) For the aggregated STCCs listed in § 1250.2(a)(7), for railroad-owned or leased cars that will move in manifest service, each railroad shall report by state the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Running total of orders placed;</P>
              <P>(ii) The running total of orders filled;</P>
              <P>(iii) For orders which have not been filled, the number of orders that are 1-10 days past due and 11+ days past due, as measured from when the car was due for placement under the railroad's governing tariff.</P>
              <P>(9) Weekly average coal unit train loadings or carloadings versus planned loadings for the reporting week by coal production region. Railroads have the option to report unit train loadings or carloadings, but should be consistent week over week.</P>
              <P>(10) For Class I carriers operating a grain shuttle program, the average grain shuttle turns per month, for the total system and by region, versus planned turns per month, for the total system and by region. This data shall be included in the first weekly report of each month, covering the previous calendar month.</P>
              <P>(11) Weekly carloads originated and carloads received in interchange by 23 commodity categories, separated into two subgroups:</P>
              <P>(i) Twenty-two historical commodity categories.</P>
              <P>(A) Chemicals.</P>
              <P>(B) Coal.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Chicago terminal reporting.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Each Class I railroad operating at the Chicago gateway must jointly report the following performance data on a weekly basis for the reporting period, <PRTPAGE P="217"/>as defined in § 1250.1(a). The reports required under this section may be submitted by the Association of American Railroads (AAR).</P>
              <P>(1) Average daily car volume in the following Chicago area yards: Barr, Bensenville, Blue Island, Calumet, Cicero, Clearing, Corwith, Gibson, Kirk, Markham, and Proviso for the reporting week; and</P>
              <P>(2) Average daily number of trains held for delivery to Chicago sorted by receiving carrier for the reporting week. The average daily number should be derived by taking a same time snapshot each day of the reporting week, capturing the trains held for each railroad at that time, and then adding those snapshots together and dividing by the days in the reporting week.</P>
              <P>(i) For purposes of this request, “held for delivery” refers to a train staged by the delivering railroad short of its scheduled arrival at the Chicago gateway at the request of the receiving railroad, and that has missed its scheduled window for arrival.</P>
              <P>(ii) If Chicago terminal yards not identified in § 1250.2(b)(1) are included in the Chicago Transportation Coordination Office's (CTCO) assessment of the fluidity of the gateway for purposes of implementing service contingency measures, then the data requested in § 1250.2(b)(1) shall also be reported for those yards.</P>
              <P>(b) The Class I railroad members of the CTCO (or one Class I railroad member of the CTCO designated to file on behalf of all Class I railroad members, or AAR) must:</P>
              <P>(1) File a written notice with the Board when the CTCO changes its operating Alert Level status, within one business day of that change in status.</P>
              <P>(2) If the CTCO revises its protocol of service contingency measures, file with the Board a detailed explanation of the new protocol, including both triggers and countermeasures, within seven days of its adoption.</P>
              <P>(c) Reports under paragraph (b) of this section shall be reported to the Director of the Office of Public Assistance, Governmental Affairs and Compliance (OPAGAC) via the method and in the form prescribed by OPAGAC.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Rail infrastructure projects reporting.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Class I railroads shall submit annually a narrative report of significant rail infrastructure projects that will be commenced during the current calendar year, and a six-month update on those projects. The reports should briefly describe each project, its purpose, location (state/counties), and projected date of completion.</P>
              <P>(b) A “significant rail infrastructure project” is defined as a project with anticipated expenditures of $75 million or more over the life of the project.</P>
              <P>(c) The narrative report should be submitted no later than March 1 of each calendar year and the update no later than September 1 of each calendar year via email to the Board's Office of Public Assistance, Governmental Affairs and Compliance (OPAGAC) via the method and in the form prescribed by OPAGAC. In the event that March 1 or September 1 is a Federal holiday, weekend, or falls on a day when STB offices are closed for any other reason, then the data should be reported on the next business day when the offices are open.</P>

              <P>The Board does not have authority of its own to classify any of its internally generated documents. The only documents handled by the Board which are classified as confidential, secret, or top secret are those generated by Executive Branch Agencies with original classification authority.</P>

              <P>(a) Responsible Official. Primary responsibility for the handling of classified documents shall rest with the Assistant to the Director of the Office of <PRTPAGE P="219"/>Compliance and Consumer Assistance, who is also Emergency Coordinator for the Board. All documents bearing the terms “Top Secret,” “Secret,” and “Confidential” shall be delivered to the Emergency Coordinator or his/her alternate immediately upon receipt. The alternate is also an Assistant to the Director of the Office of Compliance and Consumer Assistance as set forth in § 1280.4(b) of the rules. All potential recipients of such documents shall be advised of the name of the Emergency Coordinator. In the event that the Emergency Coordinator or his/her alternate is not available to receive such documents, they shall be turned over to the Associate Director, Office of Compliance and Consumer Assistance, and secured, unopened, in the combination safe located in Room 5325 of the headquarters building until the Emergency Coordinator or alternate is available. All material not immediately deliverable to either the Emergency Coordinator, alternate, or the Associate Director, Office of Compliance and Consumer Assistance, shall be delivered at the earliest opportunity. Under no circumstances shall classified material that cannot be delivered to the Emergency Coordinator be stored other than in the designated safe in Room 5325 of the STB headquarters building.</P>
              <P>(b) The alternate to the Emergency Coordinator for the receipt and handling of documents mentioned in paragraph (a) of this section, shall be the other Assistant to the Director, Office of Compliance and Consumer Assistance.</P>
              <P>(c) Any person whose position requires access to classified information must execute Form SF #189.</P>
              <P>(d) Any contracts with media representatives by personnel with access to classified material and involving such material will be cleared through the Emergency Coordinator and more than one person shall be present during any briefing or interview.</P>

              <P>(a) Reproduction of classified material shall take place only when absolutely necessary, and in accordance with section 2001.46 of the Directive. Should copies be made, they are subject to the same controls as the original document. Records showing the number and distribution of copies shall be maintained by the Emergency Coordinator and the log stored with the original documents.</P>
              <P>(b) Any suspected or actual unauthorized disclosures of classified information shall be reported to the Emergency Coordinator or Alternate. An immediate investigation will be undertaken by the Emergency Coordinator or Alternate to establish all facts surrounding the disclosure. The Emergency Coordinator or Alternate shall ascertain the nature of the information disclosed and the extent to which it has been disseminated and will maintain records of disclosures as evaluated and investigated.</P>
              <P>(c) Any suspected or actual unauthorized disclosure of classified information will be reported as soon as possible to the Department of Justice and the Information Security Oversight Office.</P>
              <P>(d) Any unauthorized disclosure of classified information or any failure to cooperate with the investigation of unauthorized disclosures by an employee shall be cause for appropriate disciplinary or other remedial action as provided in the Board's Canons of Conduct, 49 CFR 1000.735-31.</P>

They shall also be required to review Executive Order 12356 and appropriate directives of the Information Security Oversight Office (ISOO).

              <P>(a) The provisions of this part address the requirements imposed on rail carriers by 49 U.S.C. 11101(b), 11101(c), 11101(d) and 11101(f).</P>
              <P>(b) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the provisions of this part apply to any common carriage transportation or service provided by a rail carrier subject to the jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board under 49 U.S.C. 10501.</P>
              <P>(c) The provisions of this part do not apply to any transportation or service provided by a rail carrier under a contract authorized under 49 U.S.C. 10709 or former 49 U.S.C. 10713 (repealed effective January 1, 1996).</P>
              <P>(d) The provisions of this part do not apply to any transportation or service provided by a rail carrier to the extent that such transportation or service is exempted from rate notice and disclosure requirements pursuant to an exemption issued under 49 U.S.C. 10502 or former 49 U.S.C. 10505 (repealed effective January 1, 1996).</P>
              <P>(e) For the purposes of this part, “service terms” means all classifications, rules, and practices that affect the rates, charges, or level of service for rail transportation.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Disclosure requirement for existing rates.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A rail carrier must disclose to any person, upon formal request, the specific rate(s) requested (or the basis for calculating the specific rate(s)), as well as all charges and service terms that may be applicable to transportation covered by the rate(s). For purposes of § 1300.4(a)(1) of this part, a formal request under this part is one that clearly notifies the railroad that the requester seeks not only immediate information but also notification of any future increases in the rate(s) involved or changes in pertinent service terms.</P>
              <P>(b) The information provided by a rail carrier under this section must be provided immediately. (It is expected that the response will be sent within hours, or at least by the next business day, in most situations.) Such information may be provided either in written or electronic form as agreed to by the parties. If the parties cannot agree, such information is to be provided in electronic (non-passive) form where both parties have the requisite capabilities; otherwise, it is to be provided in writing.</P>
              <P>(c) A rail carrier may, at its option, require that all requests submitted under this section be in written or electronic form, although the carrier may permit oral requests.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 1300.3</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Response to request for establishment of a new rate.</SUBJECT>

              <P>Where a shipper or a prospective shipper or person acting on behalf of a shipper or a prospective shipper requests that the carrier establish a rate in the absence of an existing rate for particular transportation, the carrier must promptly establish and provide to the requester a rate and applicable service terms. The information may be provided either in written or electronic form, as agreed to by the parties. If the parties cannot agree, such information is to be provided in electronic (non-passive) form where both parties have the requisite capabilities; otherwise, it is to be provided in writing. The response <PRTPAGE P="222"/>should be provided as soon as reasonably possible, but no later than 10 business days from receipt of the request. If a carrier determines that additional information is required from the requester before a rate or term can be established, the carrier must so notify the requester as soon as possible, but no later than 10 business days after receipt of the request. Once the additional information is received, the carrier must set the rate and related service terms, and relay them to the requester, as soon as reasonably possible, but no later than 10 business days from the receipt of the additional information. (However, the parties may agree to a different time period, in which case these time periods would not apply.) A rail carrier may, at its option, require that requests submitted under this section be in written or electronic form, although the carrier may permit oral requests.</P>

              <P>(a) A rail carrier may not increase any rates or charges, or change any service terms (except for changes that are equivalent to rate reductions), unless 20 days have expired after written or electronic notice has been provided to all persons who, within the previous 12 months:</P>
              <P>(1) Have formally requested under ;§ 1300.2 or § 1300.3 of this part the affected rates or service terms; or</P>
              <P>(2) Have made arrangements with the carrier for a future shipment that would be subject to the increased rates or changed service terms.</P>
              <P>(b) The notice required by this section may be in written or electronic form, as agreed to by the parties. If the parties cannot agree, the information is to be provided in electronic (non-passive) form where both parties have the requisite capabilities; otherwise, it is to be provided in writing.</P>
              <P>(c) For purposes of this section, a mailed notice is deemed “provided” on the date such notice is postmarked.</P>
              <P>(d) The notice required by this section must clearly identify the increases in rates or charges or the changes in service terms.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Additional publication requirement for agricultural products and fertilizer.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) With respect to transportation of agricultural products (including grain, as defined in 7 U.S.C. 75, and all products thereof) and fertilizer, a rail carrier shall publish, make available, and retain for public inspection its currently effective rates, schedules of rates, charges, and other service terms, and any scheduled changes to such rates, charges, and service terms. This requirement is in addition to the requirements imposed by §§ 1300.2, 1300.3, and 1300.4 of this part.</P>
              <P>(b) The information published under this section must include an accurate description of the services offered to the public; must provide the specific applicable rates (or the basis for calculating the specific applicable rates), charges, and service terms; and must be arranged in a way that allows for the determination of the exact rate, charges, and service terms applicable to any given shipment (or to any given group of shipments). Increases, reductions and other changes must be symbolized or highlighted in some way to facilitate ready identification of the changes, the nature of those changes and their effective dates.</P>

              <P>(c) A rail carrier must make the information available at offices where it normally keeps rate information. Access to the information at such offices must be provided to any person, without charge, during normal business hours. If a rail carrier is a Class I rail carrier, it must also make the information readily available online to any person without charge. Class I rail carriers may require persons accessing such information to register, but such registration requirements may not be overly burdensome, must provide timely access to the information, and cannot prevent specific types of persons from obtaining the information. Persons having difficulty accessing the information required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section may either send a written inquiry addressed to the Director, Office of Public Assistance, Governmental Affairs, and Compliance or telephone the Board's Office of Public Assistance, Governmental Affairs, and Compliance.<PRTPAGE P="223"/>
              </P>
              <P>(d) A rail carrier must also make the required publications available to all persons (hereinafter referred to as subscribers) who have subscribed to a publication service operated either by the rail carrier itself or by an agent acting at the rail carrier's direction. Such publications may be made available either in printed or in electronic form as agreed to by the parties. Any scheduled changes must be published in a manner that provides timely notice to subscribers. A rail carrier may impose reasonable charges for such publications. Publications may be limited to the specific information requested by the subscriber, and charges for such limited publications should be set accordingly.</P>

              <P>(b) The information provided by a pipeline carrier under this section must be provided immediately. (It is expected that the response will be sent within hours, or at the latest by the next business day, in most situations.) Such information may be provided either in writing or in electronic form, as agreed to by the parties.

              <P>Where a shipper or a prospective shipper, or a person acting on behalf of a shipper or a prospective shipper, requests that the carrier establish a rate in the absence of an existing rate for particular transportation, the carrier must promptly establish and provide to the requester a rate and applicable service terms. The information may be provided either in writing or in electronic form, as agreed to by the parties. If the parties cannot agree, such information is to be provided in electronic form where both parties have the requisite capabilities; otherwise, it is to be provided in writing. The response should be provided as soon as reasonably possible, but no later than 10 business days from receipt of the request. If a carrier determines that additional information is required from the requester before a rate or term can be established, the carrier must so notify the requester as soon as possible, but no later than 10 business days after receipt of the request. Once the additional information is received, the carrier must set the rate and related service terms, and relay them to the requester, as soon as possible, but no later than 10 business days. The time period for response set forth in this section will not apply when the parties agree to a different time period. A pipeline carrier may, at its option, require that requests submitted under this section be in writing or electronic form, or the carrier may permit oral requests.</P>

              <P>(a) The provisions of this part address the tariff requirements imposed by 49 U.S.C. 13702 on motor carriers and freight forwarders for the transportation of household goods, and the notice requirements with which such carriers must comply in order to be entitled to enforce the provisions of their tariffs against individuals whose shipments are subject to such tariffs.</P>
              <P>(b) The provisions of this part apply to all movements of household goods defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and to those movements of household goods defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section that are not provided under contracts entered into pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 14101(b) or former 49 U.S.C. 10702 (repealed January 1, 1996).</P>
              <P>(c) For the purposes of this part, the term <E T="03">household goods</E> means personal effects and property used or to be used in a dwelling, when a part of the equipment or supply of such dwelling, and similar property if the transportation of such effects or property is:</P>
              <P>(1) Arranged and paid for by the householder, including transportation of property from a factory or store when the property is purchased by the householder with intent to use in his or her dwelling; or</P>
              <P>(2) Arranged and paid for by another party.</P>
              <P>(d) For the purposes of this part <E T="03">service terms</E> means all classifications, rules, regulations and practices that affect the rates, charges, or level of service for movements of household goods.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Requirement to maintain tariffs.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Except when providing transportation for charitable purposes without charge, carriers subject to the Board's jurisdiction under Chapter 135 of Title 49 of the United States Code may provide transportation or service for movements of household goods only if the rates, and related rules and practices, for such transportation or service are contained in a published tariff that is in effect under this section. The carrier may not charge or receive a different compensation for the transportation or service than the rate specified in the tariff, whether by returning a part of that rate to a person, by giving a person a privilege, by allowing the use of a facility that affects the value of that transportation or service, or through another device. Tariffs shall be published in the English language and rates shall be stated in money of the United States.</P>
              <P>(b) Tariffs maintained pursuant to this part must be available for inspection by the Board, and must be provided to the Board promptly and free of charge, upon request, by mail or other delivery service.</P>

              <P>(c) A carrier that maintains a tariff pursuant to this part may not enforce the provisions of the tariff unless the <PRTPAGE P="226"/>carrier has given notice that the tariff is available for inspection in its bill of lading or by other actual notice to individuals whose shipments are subject to the tariff, as provided in § 1310.4 of this part.</P>
              <P>(d) The Board may invalidate a tariff prepared by or on behalf of a carrier under this part if that tariff violates 49 U.S.C. 13702 or the regulations contained in this part.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Contents of tariffs.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Tariffs prepared under this part must include an accurate description of the services offered to the public; must provide the specific applicable rates, charges and service terms; and must be arranged in a way that allows for the determination of the exact rate, charges and service terms applicable to any given shipment. Increases, reductions and other changes must be symbolized or highlighted in some way to facilitate ready identification of the changes and their effective dates.</P>
              <P>(b) All information necessary to determine applicable rates, charges and service terms for a given shipment need not be contained in a single tariff, but if multiple tariffs are used to convey that information, the tariff containing the rates must make specific reference to all other tariffs required to determine applicable rates, charges and service terms. The carrier(s) party to the rate(s) must participate in all of the tariffs so linked and all such tariffs must be made available to shippers upon reasonable request.</P>

              <P>(1) The bill of lading or other document must contain a conspicuous notice that the contract of carriage incorporates the terms of the carrier's tariffs; the carrier must give notice that its tariffs are available for inspection in its bill of lading or by other actual notice to individuals whose shipments are subject to such tariffs; and the carrier must make the full text of incorporated terms readily available for inspection by the shipper, free of charge, upon request. If such terms cannot be made available immediately, they must be made available promptly and free of charge by mail or other delivery service.</P>
              <P>(2) If the incorporated terms include any of the terms set forth in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (a)(2)(iii) of this section, the notice on the bill of lading or other document must indicate that such terms are included; the shipper must be provided with a brief summary of the principal features of such terms on or with the document; and the shipper must be able to obtain a more complete explanation of such terms upon request.</P>
              <P>(i) Limits on the carrier's liability for loss, damage, or delay of goods, including fragile or valuable goods.</P>
              <P>(ii) Claim restrictions, including time periods within which shippers or consignees must file a claim or bring an action against the carrier for its acts or omissions or those of its agents.</P>
              <P>(iii) Rights of the carrier to impose monetary penalties on shippers or consignees, increase the price of the transportation, or change any terms of the contract.</P>
              <P>(b) A carrier may not claim the benefit as against a shipper or consignee of, and a shipper or consignee shall not be bound by, any tariff term that is incorporated by reference under this section unless the carrier has complied with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) The disclosure requirements established by this section preempt any State requirements on the same subject, for tariff terms that are incorporated by reference into the bill of lading or other document embodying the contract of carriage for the transportation of household goods.</P>

              <P>(a) Each carrier shall maintain, at its principal office, a complete set of its effective tariffs and those to which it is a party.</P>

              <P>(b) Each carrier shall also maintain some or all of its tariffs at its other <PRTPAGE P="227"/>business offices, upon request. Carriers shall provide information regarding all locations where tariffs may be viewed.</P>
              <P>(c) At all points where tariffs are maintained, they shall be made available for inspection by any person during the carrier's normal business hours. The tariffs shall be accessible and readable. The carrier shall also display, in a conspicuous place in those locations, a notice, in large print, which contains a statement that the tariffs are available for public inspection.</P>
              <P>(d) At all other carrier business offices, the carrier shall display a notice advising the public of the location of the nearest available tariff. The notice shall be in large print and posted in a conspicuous place. In addition, the carrier shall, upon request, make its tariffs available at that location as soon as possible but not later than within 20 days, or provide the sought information orally if satisfactory to the requestor.</P>
              <P>(e) Any publication referred to in a tariff must be maintained with that tariff.</P>
              <P>(f) If any tariff maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section has not been used for a substantial length of time, the availability of that tariff, including its reissues, may be discontinued at that office until such time as it is again requested. It shall then be made available within 20 days.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Requirement for tariff.</E> Except when providing transportation for charitable purposes without charge, or when providing transportation or service described in § 1312.1(b), carriers subject to the Board's jurisdiction under 49 U.S.C. Chapter 135 may provide transportation or service described in § 1312.1(a) only if the rates, and related rules and practices, for such transportation or service are contained in a published tariff that is on file with the Board and in effect under this part.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Adherence to tariff.</E> The carrier may not charge or receive a different compensation for the transportation or service than the rate specified in the tariff, whether by returning a part of that rate to a person, giving a person a privilege, allowing the use of a facility that affects the value of that transportation or service, or another device.<PRTPAGE P="229"/>

              <P>(d) <E T="03">Effect of filing.</E> The tender of a tariff and its receipt and acceptance by the Board do not relieve a carrier of liability for violations of the Act, other laws, the Board's regulations, or any decision of the Board or a court, or have any effect on the rights of persons to file complaints for substantive violations of the Act or the Board's regulations.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Invalidation of tariffs.</E> Tariffs that violate section 13702 of the Act, or a regulation of the Board carrying out that section, may be invalidated by the Board. When a tariff is invalidated, the party that filed it will be furnished a written explanation of the reasons for such action. Tariffs issued in lieu of invalidated tariffs shall so state.</P>

              <P>Dear Director: I, [name of signor], certify that I am [title of office] of [name of water carrier], a water carrier operating in the noncontiguous domestic trade subject to the jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board, that [name of water carrier] is in compliance with the regulations at part 1312 for purposes of publishing, filing, and keeping its tariff electronically, and that it is in compliance with all other regulations at part 1312, except those specifically applicable to tariffs maintained in paper format.</P>

Notice shall be submitted by email to <E T="03">tariffs@stb.gov</E>. In the event of any outage, carriers are required to make alternative arrangements with the agency to ensure that the Board receives the tariffs in effect during the outage.</P>
              <P>(ii) A water carrier may establish reasonable registration requirements for purposes of public access to its current tariff and historical tariff information, such as requiring a user to provide his or her name and email address; however, such requirements may not limit tariff access to any particular group or class of users (such as shippers or potential shippers) or impose unreasonable burdens on the user, such as access fees or a showing of need.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Historical tariff information and archiving.</E> Tariffs kept on the internet by a water carrier must allow the Board and the public to retrieve historical versions, including all rates and applicable rules, for a period of not less than five years, beginning on the date when a carrier first electronically files its tariffs under these regulations.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Scope; definition of terms.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) This part addresses the provisions of 49 U.S.C. 10709 that require rail carriers to file with the Board a summary of each contract for the transportation of agricultural products (including grain, as defined in 7 U.S.C. 75 and products thereof) and that allow complaints to be filed with the Board regarding such contracts.</P>
              <P>(b) The provisions of this part do not apply to any transportation that is exempted from the Board's contract regulation pursuant to an exemption issued under 49 U.S.C. 10502 or former 49 U.S.C. 10505 (repealed effective January 1, 1996).</P>

              <P>(c) For purposes of this part, the term contract means an agreement, including any amendment thereto, entered into by one or more rail carriers and one or more purchasers of rail services to provide specified transportation of agricultural products (including grain, as defined in 7 U.S.C. 75 and products thereof) under specified rates and conditions. The term amendment includes contract modifications agreed to by the parties.<PRTPAGE P="235"/>
              </P>
              <P>(d) An amended contract is treated as a new contract under this part. Remedies are revived and review is again available, upon complaint.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Contract summary filing requirement.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Rail carriers subject to the jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board under 49 U.S.C. 10501 must promptly file with the Board a summary of each contract entered into for the transportation of agricultural products.</P>
              <P>(b) Contract summaries not in compliance with this part may be rejected by the Board. If a contract summary is rejected, it will be considered as not filed, and the carrier must promptly file a corrected contract summary to replace the rejected summary.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Board review; contract disapproval.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Board review. (1) No later than 30 days after a contract summary is filed, the Board may, on complaint, begin a proceeding to review such contract on the grounds described in § 1313.9.</P>
              <P>(2) If the Board begins a proceeding, it shall determine, within 30 days after the proceeding is commenced, whether the contract is in violation of 49 U.S.C. 10709.</P>
              <P>(b) Contract disapproval. If the Board finds that the contract is in violation of 49 U.S.C. 10709, it will:</P>
              <P>(1) Disapprove the contract; or</P>
              <P>(2) Where the Board finds unreasonable discrimination, in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 10709(g)(2)(B)(i), order the contracting carrier(s) to provide to the complainant(s) rates and service substantially similar to those contained in the contract at issue, with such differences in terms and conditions as are justified by the evidence.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Applicable rates/charges if a contract is disapproved.</E> If the Board disapproves a contract (or contract amendment), the appropriate non-contract rates/charges (or the contract provisions otherwise in effect) will be applicable.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Filing procedures and formats for contract summaries.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Filing of Summaries.</E> (1) Two copies of each contract summary, containing the applicable information specified in §§ 1313.6, 1313.7, or 1313.8, as appropriate, must be filed with the Board as soon as possible, but no longer than 7 days after the date of the contract (or contract amendment).</P>
              <P>(2) The outside envelope or wrapper containing one or more contract summaries must be prominently marked “Rail Contract Summary” and addressed to: Tariffs Branch, Surface Transportation Board, Washington, DC 20423.</P>
              <P>(3) A transmittal letter identifying the submitted publication(s), and the name and telephone number of a contact person, must accompany each filing of one or more contract summaries. Each transmittal letter shall clearly indicate in the upper left-hand corner thereof:</P>
              <P>(i) The assigned alpha code of the filing carrier;</P>
              <P>(ii) The number of summaries transmitted;</P>
              <P>(iii) The filing fee enclosed (pursuant to 49 CFR 1002.2(a)); and</P>
              <P>(iv) The transmittal number if the filer utilizes transmittal numbers.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Contract summary title page.</E> The title page of each contract summary must contain only the following information:</P>
              <P>(1) In the upper right corner, the contract summary number (see paragraph (c) of this section), followed by the amendment number if an amended contract summary.</P>
              <P>(2) In the center of the page, the filing carrier's name, followed by the words “CONTRACT SUMMARY” or “AMENDED CONTRACT SUMMARY”, as applicable, in large print.</P>
              <P>(3) Date of contract and its effective date.</P>
              <P>(4) In the center lower portion, the individual submitting the filing, and the name of the individual(s) for service of complaints (if not the same individual). If not otherwise noted, a complainant may rely on service to the individual submitting the filing.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Contract summary numbering system.</E> (1) The contract summary identification number must include the word “STB,” the standard carrier alphabetic code for the filing railroad (limited to four letters), the letter “C,” and a sequential number, with each separated <PRTPAGE P="236"/>by a hyphen. The following is an example: the 357th contract summary filed by the Conrail would have the following identification number: “STB-CR-C-357.”</P>
              <P>(2) At its option, the carrier may issue contract summaries with nonconsecutive numbers if it assigns blocks of numbers for specific uses. An index to the blocks of reserved numbers shall be filed with the Board.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Format requirements for contract summary information.</E> (1) The contract summary must enumerate and have each item required in §§ 1313.6, 1313.7 or 1313.8 of this part, as applicable, completed. When the item does not pertain to the contract, the term “Not Applicable” (“NA”) shall be used.</P>
              <P>(2) Changes in prior contract summaries must be underscored and must be followed by the words “addition,” “deletion,” “extension,” “cancellation,” or other appropriate descriptive phrase in parentheses. If the change to the contract is only in confidential matter, a statement to that effect must be made in the amended contract summary and must indicate the particular feature to which the change applies (i.e., rate, special feature, etc.). If “not applicable” is permitted in the original summary under §§ 1313.6 through 1313.8 of this part, the amended summary may use “not applicable” with a notation that a change pertained only to confidential data.</P>
              <P>(3) Amended contract summaries may not substitute phrases such as “not applicable” or “no change” where disclosure was required in the original contact summary (such as in the commodity description); amended contract summaries must set forth all required non-confidential terms in the contract, whether amended or not.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 1331.5</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Additional standards for retaining antitrust immunity by passenger bus industry rate bureaus.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Rate bureaus must comply with the terms of their agreements, as approved by the Board. Failure to do so will result in lack of immunity for that activity.</P>
              <P>(b) The bureaus are required to maintain detailed minutes of all meetings where immunized matters are discussed. The bureaus will be subject to withdrawal of their immunity for serious continuing violations of Board standards, and individual tariff publications will be subject to rejection, suspension, or investigation for improprieties in the rate bureau process.</P>
              <P>(c) Absent Board approval, no other changes may be made in any approved agreement.</P>
              <P>(d) For the purposes of the statute, the following definitions shall apply:</P>
              <P>(1) A <E T="03">general increase</E> is a proposed general adjustment of substantially all the rates published in a rate bureau's tariff(s).</P>
              <P>(2) A <E T="03">broad change in tariff structure</E> modifies in a relatively non-uniform fashion the relationship between most rates published in a rate bureau's tariff, and applies to a large area, either nationally or regionally.</P>
              <P>(3) An <E T="03">innovative fare</E> will be determined on a case-by-case basis; the Board will, on request, issue opinions on whether particular rate proposals may be regarded as innovative. Two examples of an innovative fare are:</P>
              <P>(i) A fare for unlimited passenger travel; and</P>
              <P>(ii) An experimental fare providing for transportation at the passenger's option over the line of one or more carriers.</P>
              <P>(4) A <E T="03">promotional fare</E> generally has three characteristics:</P>
              <P>(i) Limited duration;</P>
              <P>(ii) Attractive price or level of service quality; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Some added feature in addition to those normally offered.</P>

              <P>
                <E T="03">Demurrage</E> is a charge that both compensates rail carriers for the expenses incurred when rail cars are detained beyond a specified period of time (i.e., free time) for loading or unloading, and serves as a penalty for undue car detention to encourage the efficient use of rail cars in the rail network.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 1333.2</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Who may charge demurrage.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Demurrage shall be assessed by the serving rail carrier, i.e., the rail carrier providing rail cars to a shipper at an origin point or delivering them to a receiver at an end-point or intermediate destination. A serving carrier and its customers (including those to which it delivers rail cars at origin or destination) may enter into contracts pertaining to demurrage, but in the absence of such contracts, demurrage will be governed by the demurrage tariff of the serving carrier.</P>

              <P>Any person receiving rail cars from a rail carrier for loading or unloading who detains the cars beyond the period of free time set forth in the governing demurrage tariff may be held liable for demurrage if the carrier has provided that person with actual notice of the demurrage tariff providing for such liability prior to the placement of the rail cars. The notice required by this section shall be in written or electronic form.</P>

                <P>(e) TSA will not take legal enforcement action against a public transportation agency under subpart E unless it has provided the Notice of Noncompliance described in paragraph (d) of this section and the public transportation agency fails to correct the violation or propose an alternative means of compliance acceptable to TSA within the timeframe provided in the notice.</P>

If the ALJ denies the motion to dismiss the complaint for insufficiency, the respondent must file an answer not later than 20 days after service of the ALJ's denial of the motion.

                <P>(2) <E T="03">Motion to dismiss.</E> A party may file a motion to dismiss, specifying the grounds for dismissal. If an ALJ grants a motion to dismiss in part, a party may appeal the ALJ's ruling on the motion to dismiss under § 1503.631(b).</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Motion to dismiss a request for a hearing.</E> An agency attorney may file a motion to dismiss a request for a hearing as untimely instead of filing a complaint. If the motion to dismiss is not granted, the agency attorney must file the complaint and must serve a copy of the complaint on each party not later than 20 days after service of the ALJ's ruling or order on the motion to dismiss. If the motion to dismiss is granted and the proceedings are terminated without a hearing, the respondent may file an appeal pursuant to § 1503.657.

                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Motion to dismiss a complaint.</E> A respondent may file a motion to dismiss a complaint instead of filing an answer, on the ground that the complaint was not timely filed or on other grounds. If the ALJ does not grant the motion to dismiss, the respondent must file an answer and must serve a copy of the answer on each party not later than 30 days after service of the ALJ's ruling or order on the motion to dismiss. If the ALJ grants the motion to dismiss and the proceedings are terminated without a hearing, the agency attorney may file an appeal pursuant to § 1503.657.

                <P>(i) <E T="03">Complaint.</E> A respondent may file a motion requesting a more definite statement of the allegations contained in the complaint instead of filing an answer. If the ALJ grants the motion, the agency attorney must supply a more definite statement not later than 15 days after service of the ruling granting the motion. If the agency attorney fails to supply a more definite statement, the ALJ must strike the allegations in the complaint to which the motion is directed. If the ALJ denies the motion, the respondent must file an answer and must serve a copy of the answer on each party not later than 20 days after service of the order of denial.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Answer.</E> An agency attorney may file a motion requesting a more definite statement if an answer fails to respond clearly to the allegations in the complaint. If the ALJ grants the motion, the respondent must supply a more definite statement not later than 15 days after service of the ruling on the motion. If the respondent fails to supply a more definite statement, the ALJ must strike those statements in the answer to which the motion is directed. The respondent's failure to supply a more definite statement may be deemed an admission of unanswered allegations in the complaint.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Motion to strike.</E> Any party may move to strike any insufficient allegation or defense, or any redundant, immaterial, or irrelevant matter in a pleading.

A party may include with a motion for decision affidavits as well as any other evidence in support of the motion. The ALJ must grant a party's motion for decision if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions, affidavits, matters that the ALJ has officially noticed, or evidence introduced during the hearing show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the party making the motion is entitled to a decision as a matter of law. The party moving for decision has the burden of showing that there is no genuine issue of material fact.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">Motion for disqualification.</E> A party may file the motion at any time after the ALJ has been assigned to the proceedings but must make the motion before the ALJ files an initial decision in the proceedings.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Motion and supporting affidavit.</E> A party must state the grounds for disqualification, including, but not limited to, personal bias, pecuniary interest, or other factors supporting disqualification, in the motion for disqualification.

                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Decision on motion for disqualification.</E> The ALJ must render a decision on the motion for disqualification not later than 20 days after the motion has been filed. If the ALJ finds that the motion for disqualification and supporting affidavit show a basis for disqualification, the ALJ must withdraw from the proceedings immediately. If the ALJ finds that disqualification is not warranted, the ALJ must deny the motion and state the grounds for the denial on the record. If the ALJ fails to rule on a party's motion for disqualification within 20 days after the motion has been filed, the motion is deemed granted.</P>
                <P>(iv) <E T="03">Appeal.</E> A party may appeal the ALJ's denial of the motion for disqualification in accordance with § 1503.631(b).</P>

If the ALJ grants the request, the proceedings are stayed until the TSA decision maker issues a decision on the interlocutory appeal.

                <P>(c) <E T="03">Interlocutory appeals of right.</E> If a party notifies the ALJ of an interlocutory appeal of right, the proceedings are stayed until the TSA decision maker issues a decision on the interlocutory appeal. A party may file an interlocutory appeal, without the consent of the ALJ, before an initial decision has been entered in the following cases:</P>
                <P>(1) A ruling or order by the ALJ barring a person from the proceedings.</P>
                <P>(2) Failure of the ALJ to dismiss the proceedings in accordance with § 1503.623.</P>
                <P>(3) A ruling or order by the ALJ in violation of § 1503.607(b).</P>

                <P>(d) <E T="03">Procedure.</E> Not later than 10 days after the ALJ's decision forming the basis of an interlocutory appeal of right or not later than 10 days after the ALJ's decision granting an interlocutory appeal for cause, a party must file a notice of interlocutory appeal, with supporting documents, and the party must serve a copy of the notice and supporting documents on each party. Not later than 10 days after service of the appeal brief, a party must file a reply brief, if any, and the party must serve a copy of the reply brief on each party. The TSA decision maker must render a decision on the interlocutory appeal, on the record and as a part of the decision in the proceedings, within a reasonable time after receipt of the interlocutory appeal.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Frivolous appeals.</E> The TSA decision maker may reject frivolous, repetitive, or dilatory appeals, and may issue an order precluding one or more parties from making further interlocutory appeals in a proceeding in which there have been frivolous, repetitive, or dilatory interlocutory appeals.</P>

A party may discover facts known, or opinions held, by an expert who any other party expects to call to testify at the hearing. A party may not object to a discovery request on the basis that the information sought would not be admissible at the hearing if the information sought during discovery is reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Limiting discovery.</E> The ALJ must limit the frequency and extent of discovery permitted by this section if a party shows that—</P>

TSA may provide such information subject to such restrictions on further disclosure and such safeguarding requirements as TSA determines appropriate.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Confidential orders.</E> A party or person who has received a discovery request for information, other than SSI, that is related to a trade secret, confidential or sensitive material, competitive or commercial information, proprietary data, or information on research and development, may file a motion for a confidential order with the ALJ and must serve a copy of the motion for a confidential order on each party.</P>
                <P>(1) The party or person making the motion must show that the confidential order is necessary to protect the information from disclosure to the public.</P>
                <P>(2) If the ALJ determines that the requested material is not necessary to decide the case, the ALJ must preclude any inquiry into the matter by any party.</P>

                <P>(4) If the ALJ determines that the requested material is necessary to decide the case and that a confidential order is warranted, the ALJ must provide the following:</P>
                <P>(i) An opportunity for review of the document by the parties off the record.</P>

The party or person making the motion must show that the protective order is necessary to protect the party or the person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense. As part of the protective order, the ALJ may do the following:</P>

                <P>(k) <E T="03">Depositions.</E> The following rules apply to depositions taken pursuant to this section:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Form.</E> A deposition must be taken on the record and reduced to writing. The person being deposed must sign the deposition unless the parties agree to waive the requirement of a signature.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Administration of oaths.</E> Within the United States, or a territory or possession subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, a party must take a deposition before a person authorized to administer oaths by the laws of the United States or authorized by the law of the place where the examination is held. Outside the United States, a party will take a deposition in any manner allowed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 U.S.C. App.).</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Notice of deposition.</E> A party must serve a notice of deposition, stating the time and place of the deposition and the name and address of each person to be examined, on the person to be deposed, on the ALJ, on the Enforcement Docket Clerk, and on each party not later than 7 days before the deposition. A party may serve a notice of deposition less than 7 days before the deposition only with consent of the ALJ and for good cause shown. If a subpoena “duces tecum” is to be served on the person to be examined, the party must attach a copy of the subpoena duces tecum that describes the materials to be produced at the deposition to the notice of deposition.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Use of depositions.</E> A party may use any part or all of a deposition at a hearing authorized under this subpart only upon a showing of good cause. The deposition may be used against any party who was present or represented at the deposition or who had reasonable notice of the deposition.</P>
                <P>(l) <E T="03">Interrogatories.</E> A party, the party's attorney, or the party's representative may sign the party's responses to interrogatories. A party must answer each interrogatory separately and completely in writing. If a party objects to an interrogatory, the party must state the objection and the reasons for the objection. An opposing party may use any part or all of a party's responses to interrogatories at a hearing authorized under this subpart to the extent that the response is relevant, material, and not repetitious.</P>
                <P>(1) A party must not serve more than 30 interrogatories to each other party. Each subpart of an interrogatory will be counted as a separate interrogatory.</P>
                <P>(2) Before serving additional interrogatories on a party, a party must file a motion for leave to serve additional interrogatories on a party with the ALJ and must serve a copy on each party before serving additional interrogatories on a party. The ALJ may grant the motion only if the party shows good cause for the party's failure to inquire about the information previously and that the information cannot reasonably be obtained using less burdensome discovery methods or be obtained from other sources.</P>
                <P>(m) <E T="03">Requests for admission.</E> A party may serve a written request for admission of the truth of any matter within the scope of discovery under this section or the authenticity of any document described in the request. A party must set forth each request for admission separately. A party must serve copies of documents referenced in the request for admission unless the documents have been provided or are reasonably available for inspection and copying.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Time.</E> A party's failure to respond to a request for admission, in writing and signed by the attorney or the party, not later than 30 days after service of the request, is deemed an admission of the truth of the statement or statements contained in the request for admission. The ALJ may determine that a failure to respond to a request for admission is not deemed an admission of the truth if a party shows that the failure was due to circumstances beyond the control of the party or the party's attorney.<PRTPAGE P="267"/>
                </P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Response.</E> A party may object to a request for admission and must state the reasons for objection. A party may specifically deny the truth of the matter or describe the reasons why the party is unable to truthfully deny or admit the matter. If a party is unable to deny or admit the truth of the matter, the party must show that the party has made reasonable inquiry into the matter or that the information known to, or readily obtainable by, the party is insufficient to enable the party to admit or deny the matter. A party may admit or deny any part of the request for admission. If the ALJ determines that a response does not comply with the requirements of this rule or that the response is insufficient, the matter is deemed admitted.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Effect of admission.</E> Any matter admitted or deemed admitted under this section is conclusively established for the purpose of the hearing and appeal.</P>
                <P>(n) <E T="03">Motion to compel discovery.</E> A party may move to compel discovery if a person refuses to answer a question during a deposition, a party fails or refuses to answer an interrogatory, if a person gives an evasive or incomplete answer during a deposition or when responding to an interrogatory, or a party fails or refuses to produce documents or tangible items. During a deposition, the proponent of a question may complete the deposition or may adjourn the examination before moving to compel if a person refuses to answer.</P>
                <P>(o) <E T="03">Failure to comply with a discovery order or order to compel.</E> If a party fails to comply with a discovery order or an order to compel, the ALJ, limited to the extent of the party's failure to comply with the discovery order or motion to compel, may do the following:</P>
                <P>(1) Strike that portion of a party's pleadings.</P>
                <P>(2) Preclude prehearing or discovery motions by that party.</P>
                <P>(3) Preclude admission of that portion of a party's evidence at the hearing.</P>
                <P>(4) Preclude that portion of the testimony of that party's witnesses at the hearing.</P>

The applicant must describe, in detail, the basis for the application to quash or modify the subpoena including, but not limited to, a statement that the testimony, document, or tangible evidence is not relevant to the proceeding, that the subpoena is not reasonably tailored to the scope of the proceeding, or that the subpoena is unreasonable and oppressive. A motion to quash or modify the subpoena will stay the effect of the subpoena pending a decision by the ALJ on the motion.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Contents.</E> The ALJ may issue an initial decision after the conclusion of the hearing or after the submission of written posthearing briefs, if so ordered. In each oral or written decision, the ALJ must include findings of fact and conclusions of law, and the grounds supporting those findings and conclusions, upon all material issues of fact, the credibility of witnesses, the applicable law, any exercise of the ALJ's discretion, the amount of any civil penalty found appropriate by the ALJ, and a discussion of the basis for any order issued in the proceedings. The ALJ is not required to provide a written explanation for rulings on objections, procedural motions, and other matters not directly relevant to the substance of the initial decision. If the ALJ refers to any previous unreported or unpublished initial decision, the ALJ must make copies of that initial decision available to all parties and the TSA decision maker.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Written decision.</E> At the conclusion of the hearing, the ALJ may issue the initial decision and order orally on the record.

                <P>(d) <E T="03">Effect of initial decision.</E> An initial decision of an ALJ is persuasive authority in any other civil penalty action, unless appealed and reversed by the TSA decision maker or a court of competent jurisdiction.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Appeal from initial decision.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Notice of appeal.</E> Either party may appeal the initial decision, and any decision not previously appealed pursuant to § 1503.631, by filing a notice of appeal with the Enforcement Docket Clerk. A party must file the notice of appeal with USCG ALJ Docketing Center, ATTN: Enforcement Docket Clerk, 40 S. Gay Street, Room 412, Baltimore, Maryland 21202-4022. A party must file the notice of appeal not later than 10 <PRTPAGE P="270"/>days after entry of the oral initial decision on the record or service of the written initial decision on the parties and must serve a copy of the notice of appeal on each party. Upon filing of a notice of appeal, the effectiveness of the initial decision is stayed until a final decision and order of the TSA decision maker have been entered on the record.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Issues on appeal.</E> A party may appeal only the following issues:</P>
                <P>(1) Whether each finding of fact is supported by a preponderance of the evidence.</P>
                <P>(2) Whether each conclusion of law is made in accordance with applicable law, precedent, and public policy.</P>
                <P>(3) Whether the ALJ committed any prejudicial errors during the hearing that support the appeal.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Perfecting an appeal.</E> Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, a party must perfect an appeal, not later than 50 days after entry of the oral initial decision on the record or service of the written initial decision on the party, by filing an appeal brief with the Enforcement Docket Clerk.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Extension of time by agreement of the parties.</E> The parties may agree to extend the time for perfecting the appeal with the consent of the TSA decision maker. If the TSA decision maker grants an extension of time to perfect the appeal, the Enforcement Docket Clerk will serve a letter confirming the extension of time on each party.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Written motion for extension.</E> If the parties do not agree to an extension of time for perfecting an appeal, a party desiring an extension of time may file a written motion for an extension with the Enforcement Docket Clerk and must serve a copy of the motion on each party. The TSA decision maker may grant an extension if good cause for the extension is shown in the motion.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Appeal briefs.</E> A party must file the appeal brief with the Enforcement Docket Clerk and must serve a copy of the appeal brief on each party.</P>
                <P>(1) In the appeal brief, a party must set forth, in detail, the party's specific objections to the initial decision or rulings, the basis for the appeal, the reasons supporting the appeal, and the relief requested in the appeal. If, for the appeal, the party relies on evidence contained in the record for the appeal, the party must specifically refer in the appeal brief to the pertinent evidence contained in the transcript.</P>
                <P>(2) The TSA decision maker may dismiss an appeal, on the TSA decision maker's own initiative or upon motion of any other party, where a party has filed a notice of appeal but fails to perfect the appeal by timely filing an appeal brief.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Reply brief.</E> Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, any party may file a reply brief not later than 35 days after the appeal brief has been served on that party. The party filing the reply brief must serve a copy of the reply brief on each party. If the party relies on evidence contained in the record for the reply, the party must specifically refer to the pertinent evidence contained in the transcript in the reply brief.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Extension of time by agreement of the parties.</E> The parties may agree to extend the time for filing a reply brief with the consent of the TSA decision maker. If the TSA decision maker grants an extension of time to file the reply brief, the Enforcement Docket Clerk will serve a letter confirming the extension of time on each party.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Written motion for extension.</E> If the parties do not agree to an extension of time for filing a reply brief, a party desiring an extension of time may file a written motion for an extension and will serve a copy of the motion on each party. The TSA decision maker may grant an extension if good cause for the extension is shown in the motion.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Other briefs.</E> The TSA decision maker may allow any person to submit an amicus curiae brief in an appeal of an initial decision. A party may not file more than one appeal brief or reply brief. A party may petition the TSA decision maker, in writing, for leave to file an additional brief and must serve a copy of the petition on each party. The party may not file the additional brief with the petition. The TSA decision maker may grant leave to file an additional brief if the party demonstrates good cause for allowing additional argument on the appeal. The <PRTPAGE P="271"/>TSA decision maker will allow a reasonable time for the party to file the additional brief.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Number of copies.</E> A party must file the original appeal brief or the original reply brief, and two copies of the brief, with the Enforcement Docket Clerk.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Oral argument.</E> The TSA decision maker has sole discretion to permit oral argument on the appeal. On the TSA decision maker's own initiative or upon written motion by any party, the TSA decision maker may find that oral argument will contribute substantially to the development of the issues on appeal and may grant the parties an opportunity for oral argument.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Waiver of objections on appeal.</E> If a party fails to object to any alleged error regarding the proceedings in an appeal or a reply brief, the party waives any objection to the alleged error. The TSA decision maker is not required to consider any objection in an appeal brief or any argument in the reply brief if a party's objection is based on evidence contained in the record and the party does not specifically refer to the pertinent evidence from the record in the brief.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">The TSA decision maker's decision on appeal.</E> The TSA decision maker will review the briefs on appeal and the oral argument, if any, to determine if the ALJ committed prejudicial error in the proceedings or that the initial decision should be affirmed, modified, or reversed. The TSA decision maker may affirm, modify, or reverse the initial decision, make any necessary findings, or may remand the case for any proceedings that the TSA decision maker determines may be necessary.</P>
                <P>(1) The TSA decision maker may raise any issue, on the TSA decision maker's own initiative, that is required for proper disposition of the proceedings. The TSA decision maker will give the parties a reasonable opportunity to submit arguments on the new issues before making a decision on appeal. If an issue raised by the TSA decision maker requires the consideration of additional testimony or evidence, the TSA decision maker will remand the case to the ALJ for further proceedings and an initial decision related to that issue. If the TSA decision maker raises an issue that is solely an issue of law, or the issue was addressed at the hearing but was not raised by a party in the briefs on appeal, the TSA decision maker need not remand the case to the ALJ for further proceedings but has the discretion to do so.</P>
                <P>(2) The TSA decision maker will issue the final decision and order of the Administrator on appeal in writing and will serve a copy of the decision and order on each party. Unless a petition for review is filed pursuant to § 1503.659, a final decision and order of the Administrator will be considered an order assessing civil penalty if the TSA decision maker finds that an alleged violation occurred and a civil penalty is warranted.</P>
                <P>(3) A final decision and order of the Administrator after appeal is binding precedent in any other civil penalty action unless appealed and reversed by a court of competent jurisdiction.</P>

                <P>(d) <E T="03">Compromise.</E> If the person charged with a violation offers to compromise the civil penalty action for a specific amount, that person must send payment in a form and manner acceptable to TSA for that amount to the agency, made payable to the Transportation Security Administration, or make payment electronically through <E T="03">http://www.pay.gov.</E> The Chief Counsel or the Deputy Chief Counsel for Civil Enforcement may accept the payment or may refuse and return the payment. If the Administrator accepts the offer to compromise, the agency will send a letter to the person charged with the violation stating that the payment is accepted in full settlement of the civil penalty action and that the matter is closed.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Referral for prosecution and collection.</E> If the parties cannot agree to compromise the civil penalty action or the offer to compromise is rejected and the payment submitted in compromise is returned, the Administrator may refer the civil penalty action to the United States Attorney General, or the delegate of the Attorney General, to begin proceedings in a United States district court, pursuant to the authority in 49 U.S.C. 114 or 46305 to prosecute and collect the civil penalty.</P>

              <P>This part implements provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 (the Act) that permit TSA to exempt any system of records within the agency from certain <PRTPAGE P="275"/>requirements of the Act. The procedures governing access to, and correction of, records in a TSA system of records are set forth in 6 CFR part 5, subpart B.</P>
            </SECTION>

              <SECTNO>§ 1507.3</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Exemptions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The following TSA systems of records are exempt from certain provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j), (k), or both, as set forth in this section. During the course of normal agency functions, exempt materials from one system of records may become part of one or more other systems of records. To the extent that any portion of system of records becomes part of another Privacy Act system of records, TSA hereby claims the same exemptions as were claimed in the original primary system of which they are a part and claims any additional exemptions in accordance with this part.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Transportation Security Enforcement Record System (DHS/TSA 001).</E> The Transportation Security Enforcement Record System (TSERS) (DHS/TSA 001) enables TSA to maintain a system of records related to the screening of passengers and property and they may be used to identify, review, analyze, investigate, and prosecute violations or potential violations of criminal statutes and transportation security laws. Pursuant to exemptions (j)(2), (k)(1), and (k)(2) of the Privacy Act, DHS/TSA 001 is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(3), (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), and (f). Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the following reasons:</P>
              <P>(1) From subsection (c)(3) (Accounting for Disclosures) because release of the accounting of disclosures could alert the subject of an investigation of an actual or potential criminal, civil, or regulatory violation to the existence of the investigation and reveal investigative interest on the part of TSA, as well as the recipient agency. Disclosure of the accounting would therefore present a serious impediment to transportation security, law enforcement efforts, and efforts to preserve national security. Disclosure of the accounting would also permit the individual who is the subject of a record to impede the investigation and avoid detection or apprehension, which undermines the entire system.</P>
              <P>(2) From subsection (d) (Access to Records) because access to the records contained in this system of records could inform the subject of an investigation of an actual or potential criminal, civil, or regulatory violation to the existence of the investigation and reveal investigative interest on the part of TSA, as well as the recipient agency. Access to the records would permit the individual who is the subject of a record to impede the investigation and avoid detection or apprehension. Amendment of the records would interfere with ongoing investigations and law enforcement activities, and impose an impossible administrative burden by requiring investigations to be continuously reinvestigated. The information contained in the system may also include properly classified information, the release of which would pose a threat to national defense and/or foreign policy. In addition, permitting access and amendment to such information also could disclose sensitive security information, which could be detrimental to transportation security.</P>
              <P>(3) From subsection (e)(1) (Relevancy and Necessity of Information) because in the course of investigations into potential violations of transportation security laws, the accuracy of information obtained or introduced occasionally may be unclear or the information may not be strictly relevant or necessary to a specific investigation. In the interests of effective enforcement of transportation security laws, it is appropriate to retain all information that may aid in establishing patterns of unlawful activity.</P>
              <P>(4) From subsection (e)(3) (Privacy Act Statement) because disclosing the authority, purpose, routine uses, and potential consequences of not providing information could reveal the investigative interests of TSA, as well as the nature and scope of an investigation, the disclosure of which could enable individuals to circumvent agency regulations or statutes.</P>

              <P>(5) From subsections (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I) (Agency Requirements), and (f) (Agency Rules), because this system is exempt from the access provisions of subsection (d).<PRTPAGE P="276"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Transportation Workers Employment Investigations System (DHS/TSA 002).</E> The Transportation Workers Employment Investigations System (TWEI) (DHS/TSA 002) enables TSA to facilitate the performance of background checks on employees of transportation operators and others who are issued credentials or clearances by transportation operators, other than TSA employees. Pursuant to exemptions (k)(1) and (k)(2) of the Privacy Act, DHS/TSA 002 is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H) and (I), and (f). Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the following reasons:</P>
              <P>(1) From subsection (c)(3) (Accounting for Disclosures), because release of the accounting of disclosures could reveal investigative interest on the part of the recipient agency that obtained the record pursuant to a routine use. Disclosure of the accounting could therefore present a serious impediment to law enforcement efforts on the part of the recipient agency, as the individual who is the subject of a record would learn of third-agency investigate interests and thereby avoid detection or apprehension.</P>
              <P>(2) From subsection (d) (Access to Records), because access to the records contained in this system could reveal investigate techniques and procedures in the transportation workers employment investigation process, as well as the nature and scope of the employment investigation, the disclosure of which could enable individuals to circumvent agency regulations or statutes and obtain access to sensitive information and restricted areas in the transportation industry. The information contained in the system might include properly classified information, the release of which would pose a threat to national defense and/or foreign policy. In addition, permitting access and amendment to such information could reveal sensitive security information protected pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 114(s), the disclosure of which could be detrimental to the security of transportation.</P>
              <P>(3) From subsection (e)(1) (Relevancy and Necessity of Information), because third-agency records obtained or made available to TSA during the course of an employment investigation may occasionally contain information that is not strictly relevant or necessary to a specific employment investigation. In the interests of administering an effective and comprehensive transportation worker employment investigation program, it is appropriate and necessary for TSA to retain all such information that may aid in that process.</P>
              <P>(4) From subsections (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I) (Agency Requirements), and (f) (Agency Rules), because this system is exempt from the access provisions of subsection (d).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Personnel Background Investigation File System (DHS/TSA 004).</E> The Personnel Background Investigation File System (PBIFS) (DHS/TSA 004) enables TSA to maintain investigative and background material used to make suitability and eligibility determinations regarding current and former TSA employees, applicants for TSA employment, and TSA contract employees. Pursuant to exemptions (k)(1) and (k)(5) of the Privacy Act, the Personnel Background Investigation File System is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) (Accounting of Disclosures) and (d) (Access to Records). Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified because this system contains investigatory material compiled solely for determining suitability, eligibility, and qualifications for Federal civilian employment. To the extent that the disclosure of material would reveal any classified material or the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, or, prior to September 27, 1975, under an implied promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, the applicability of exemption (k)(5) will be required to honor promises of confidentiality should the data subject request access to or amendment of the record, or access to the accounting of disclosures of the record. Exemption (k)(1) will be required to protect any classified information that may be in this system.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Internal Investigation Record System (DHS/TSA 005).</E> The Internal Investigation Record System (IIRS) (DHS/TSA 005) contains records of internal <PRTPAGE P="277"/>investigations for all modes of transportation for which TSA has security-related duties. This system covers information regarding investigations of allegations or appearances of misconduct of current or former TSA employees or contractors and provides support for any adverse action that may occur as a result of the findings of the investigation. It is being modified to cover investigations of security-related incidents and reviews of TSA programs and operations. Pursuant to exemptions (j)(2), (k)(1), and (k)(2) of the Privacy Act, DHS/TSA 005 is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(3), (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), and (f). Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the following reasons:</P>
              <P>(1) From subsection (c)(3) (Accounting for Disclosures) because release of the accounting of disclosures could reveal investigative interest on the part of the recipient agency that obtained the record pursuant to a routine use. Disclosure of the accounting could, therefore, present a serious impediment to law enforcement efforts on the part of the recipient agency, as the individual who is the subject of a record would learn of third-agency investigative interests and thereby avoid detection or apprehension, as well as to TSA investigative efforts.</P>
              <P>(2) From subsection (d) (Access to Records) because access to the records contained in this system could reveal investigative techniques and procedures of the investigators, as well as the nature and scope of the investigation, the disclosure of which could enable individuals to circumvent agency regulations or statutes. The information contained in the system might include properly classified information, the release of which would pose a threat to national defense and/or foreign policy. In addition, permitting access and amendment to such records could reveal sensitive security information protected pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 114(s), the disclosure of which could be detrimental to the security of transportation.</P>
              <P>(3) From subsection (e)(1) (Relevancy and Necessity of Information) because third agency records obtained or made available to TSA during the course of an investigation may occasionally contain information that is not strictly relevant or necessary to a specific investigation. In the interests of administering an effective and comprehensive investigation program, it is appropriate and necessary for TSA to retain all such information that may aid in that process.</P>
              <P>(4) From subsection (e)(3) (Privacy Act Statement) because disclosing the authority, purpose, routine uses, and potential consequences of not providing information could reveal the targets of interests of the investigating office, as well as the nature and scope of an investigation, the disclosure of which could enable individuals to circumvent agency regulations or statutes.</P>
              <P>(5) From subsections (e)(4)(G), (H) and (I) (Agency Requirements), and (f) (Agency Rules), because this system is exempt from the access provisions of subsection (d).</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Correspondence and Matters Tracking Records (DHS/TSA 006).</E> The Correspondence and Matters Tracking Records (CMTR) (DHS/TSA 006) system allows TSA to manage, track, retrieve, and respond to incoming correspondence, inquiries, claims and other matters presented to TSA for disposition, and to monitor the assignment, disposition and status of such matters. This system covers information coming into TSA from individuals as well as information recorded by TSA employees in the performance of their duties. Pursuant to exemptions (k)(1) and (k)(2) of the Privacy Act, DHS/TSA 006 is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H) and (I), and (f). Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the following reasons:</P>

              <P>(1) From subsection (c)(3) (Accounting for Disclosures), because release of the accounting of disclosures could reveal investigative interest on the part of the recipient agency that obtained the record pursuant to a routine use. Disclosure of the accounting could therefore present a serious impediment to law enforcement efforts on the part of the recipient agency, as the individual who is the subject of a record <PRTPAGE P="278"/>would lean of third-agency investigative interests and thereby avoid detection or apprehension.</P>
              <P>(2) From subsection (d) (Access to Records), because access to the records contained in this system could reveal investigative interest on the part of TSA or other agency and the nature of that interest, the disclosure of which could enable individuals to circumvent agency regulations or statutes. The information contained in the system might include properly classified information, the release of which would pose a threat to national defense and/or foreign policy. In addition, permitting access and amendment to such information could reveal sensitive security information protected pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 114(s), the disclosure of which could be detrimental to transportation security.</P>
              <P>(3) From subsection (e)(1) (Relevancy and necessity of Information), because third-agency records obtained or made available to TSA during the course of an investigation may occasionally contain information that is not strictly relevant or necessary to a specific investigation. In the interests of administering an effective and comprehensive investigation program, it is appropriate and necessary for TSA to retain all such information that may aid in that process.</P>
              <P>(4) From subsections (e)(4)(G), (H) and (I) (Agency Requirements), and (f) (Agency rules), because this system is exempt from the access provisions of subsection (d).</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Freedom of Information and Privacy Act Records (DHS/TSA 007).</E> The Freedom of Information and Privacy Act (FOIA/PA) Records System (DHS/TSA 007) system enables TSA to maintain records that will assist in processing access requests and administrative appeals under FOIA and access and amendments requests and appeals under the PA; participate in associated litigation; and assist TSA in carrying out any other responsibilities under FOIA/PA. Pursuant to exemptions (k)(1) and (k)(2) of the Privacy Act, Freedom of Information and Privacy Act Records are exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H) and (I), and (f). Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the following reasons:</P>
              <P>(1) From subsection (c)(3) (Accounting for Disclosures), because release of the accounting of disclosures could reveal investigative interest on the part of the recipient agency that obtained the record pursuant to a routine use. Disclosure of the accounting could therefore present a serious impediment to law enforcement efforts on the part of the recipient agency, as the individual who is the subject of a record would learn of third-agency investigative interests and thereby avoid detection or apprehension.</P>
              <P>(2) From subsection (d) (Access to Records), because access to the records contained in this system could reveal investigative interest on the part of TSA or other agency and the nature of that interest, the disclosure of which could enable individuals to circumvent agency regulations or statutes. The information contained in the system might include properly classified information, the release of which would pose a threat to national defense and/or foreign policy. In addition, permitting access and amendment to such information could reveal sensitive security information protected pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 114(s), the disclosure of which would be detrimental to transportation security.</P>
              <P>(3) From subsection (e)(1) (Relevancy and necessity of Information), because third-agency records obtained or made available to TSA during the course of an investigation may occasionally contain information that is not strictly relevant or necessary to a specific investigation. In the interests of administering an effective and comprehensive investigation program, it is appropriate and necessary for TSA to retain all such information that may aid in that process.</P>
              <P>(4) From subsections (e)(4)(G), (H) and (I) (Agency Requirements), and (f) (Agency Rules), because this system is exempt from the access provisions of subsection (d).</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">General Legal Records System (DHS/TSA 009).</E> The General Legal Records (GLR) System (DHS/TSA 009) enables <PRTPAGE P="279"/>TSA to maintain records that will assist attorneys to perform their functions within the office of Chief Counsel, to include providing legal advice, responding to claims filed by employees and others, and assisting in litigation and in the settlement of claims. Pursuant to exemptions (k)(1) and (k)(2) of the Privacy Act, DHS/TSA 009 is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H) and (I), and (f). Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the following reasons:</P>
              <P>(1) From subsection (c)(3) (Accounting for Disclosures), because release of the accounting of disclosures could reveal investigative interest on the part of the recipient agency that obtained the record pursuant to a routine use. Disclosure of the accounting could therefore present a serious impediment to law enforcement efforts on the part of the recipient agency, as the individual who is the subject of a record would learn of third-agency investigative interests and thereby avoid detection or apprehension.</P>
              <P>(2) From subsection (d) (Access to Records), because access to the records contained in this system could reveal investigative interest on the part of TSA or other agency and the nature of that interest, the disclosure of which would enable individuals to circumvent agency regulations or statutes. The information contained in the system might include properly classified information, the release of which would pose a threat to national defense and/or foreign policy. In addition, permitting access and amendment to such information could reveal sensitive security information protected pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 114(s), the disclosure of which could be detrimental to transportation security.</P>
              <P>(3) From subsection (e)(1) (Relevancy and Necessity of Information), because third-agency records obtained or made available to TSA during the course of an investigation may occasionally contain information that is not strictly relevant or necessary to a specific investigation. In the interests of administering an effective and comprehensive investigation program, it is appropriate and necessary for TSA to retain all such information that may aid in that process.</P>
              <P>(4) From subsections (e)(4)(G), (H) and (I) (Agency Requirements), and (f) (Agency Rules), because this system is exempt from the access provisions of subsections (d).</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Federal Flight Deck Officer Records System (DHS/TSA 013).</E> The Federal Flight Deck Officer Record System (FFDORS) (DHS/TSA 013) enables TSA to maintain a system of records documenting the application, selection, training, and requalification of pilots deputized by TSA to perform the duties of a Federal Flight Deck Officer (FFDO). Pursuant to exemptions (k)(1), (k)(2), and (k)(6) of the Privacy Act, DHS/TSA 013 is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), and (e)(1). Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the following reasons:</P>

              <P>(1) From (c)(3) (Accounting of Certain Disclosures) and (d) (Access to Records), because access to the accounting of disclosures in this system could reveal the identity of a confidential source that provided information during the background check process. Without the ability to protect the identity of a confidential source, the agency's ability to gather pertinent information about candidates for the program may be limited. In addition, the system might contain information that is properly classified, the release of which would pose a threat to national security and/or foreign policy, or information the disclosure of which could be detrimental to the security of transportation pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 114(s). Finally, the agency must be able to protect against access to testing or examination material as release of this material could compromise the effectiveness of the testing and examination procedure itself. The examination material contained in this system is so similar in form and content to the examination material used in the selection process for TSA security screeners, or potential selection processes that TSA may utilize in the future, that release of the material would compromise the objectivity or fairness of the testing or examination process of those TSA employees.<PRTPAGE P="280"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) From (e)(1) (Relevancy and Necessity of Information), because information obtained or made available to TSA from other agencies and other sources during the evaluation of an individual's suitability for an FFDO position may occasionally include information that is not strictly relevant or necessary to the specific determination regarding that individual. In the interests of effective program administration, it is appropriate and necessary for TSA to collect all such information that may aid in the FFDO selection process.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Registered Traveler Operations Files (DHS/TSA 015).</E> The purpose of this system is to pre-screen and positively identify volunteer travelers using advanced identification technologies and conduct a security threat assessment to ensure that the volunteer does not pose a security threat. This system may expedite the pre-boarding process for the traveler and improve the allocation of TSA's security resources on individuals who may pose a security threat. Pursuant to exemptions (k)(1) and (k)(2) of the Privacy Act, DHS/TSA 015 is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H) and (I), and (f). Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the following reasons:</P>
              <P>(1) From subsection (c)(3) (Accounting for Disclosures) because release of the accounting of disclosures could alert the subject of heightened security concerns relating to an actual or potential criminal, civil, or regulatory violation to the existence of an investigative interest on the part of the Department of Homeland Security or another Federal law enforcement or other recipient agency. Disclosure of the accounting would therefore present a serious impediment to transportation security law enforcement efforts and efforts to preserve national security. Disclosure of the accounting would also permit the individual who is the subject of a record to impede the program suitability determination, which undermines the entire system.</P>
              <P>(2) From subsection (d) (Access to Records) because access to some of the records contained in this system of records could permit the individual who is the subject of a record to impede the program suitability determination. Amendment of the records would interfere with ongoing security assessment investigations and program suitability determinations and impose an impossible administrative burden by requiring such investigations to be continuously reinvestigated. The information contained in the system may also include classified information, the release of which would pose a threat to national defense and/or foreign policy. In addition, permitting access and amendment to such information also could disclose sensitive security information protected pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 114(s) and 49 CFR part 1520, the disclosure of which could be detrimental to transportation security.</P>
              <P>(3) From subsection (e)(1) (Relevancy and Necessity of Information) because in the course of screening applicants for program suitability, TSA must be able to review information from a variety of sources. What information is relevant and necessary may not always be apparent until after the evaluation is completed. In the interests of transportation security, it is appropriate to include a broad range of information that may aid in determining an applicant's suitability for the Registered Traveler program.</P>
              <P>(4) From subsections (e)(4)(G), (H) and (I) (Agency Requirements), and (f) (Agency Rules), because this system is exempt from the access and amendment provisions of subsection (d).</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Transportation Security Intelligence Service (TSIS) Operations Files.</E> Transportation Security Intelligence Service Operations Files (TSIS) (DHS/TSA 011) enables TSA to maintain a system of records related to intelligence gathering activities used to identify, review, analyze, investigate, and prevent violations or potential violations of transportation security laws. This system also contains records relating to determinations about individuals' qualifications, eligibility, or suitability for access to classified information. Pursuant to exemptions (j)(2), (k)(1), (k)(2), and (k)(5) of the Privacy Act, DHS/TSA 011 is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), and (f). Exemptions from particular subsections are justified for the following reasons:<PRTPAGE P="281"/>
              </P>
              <P>(1) From subsection (c)(3) (Accounting for Disclosures) because release of the accounting of disclosures could alert the subject of intelligence gather operations and reveal investigative interest on the part of the Transportation Security Administration, as well as the recipient agency. Disclosure of the accounting would therefore present a serious impediment to transportation security law enforcement efforts and efforts to preserve national security. Disclosure of the accounting would also permit the individual who is the subject of a record to impede operations and avoid detection and apprehension, which undermined the entire system. Disclosure of the accounting may also reveal the existence of information that is classified or sensitive security information, the release of which would be detrimental to the security of transportation.</P>
              <P>(2) From subsection (d) (Access to Records) because access to the records contained in this system of records could inform the subject of intelligence gathering operations and reveal investigative interest on the part of the Transportation Security Administration. Access to the records would permit the individual who is the subject of a record to impede operations and possibly avoid detection or apprehension. Amendment of the records would interfere with ongoing intelligence and law enforcement activities and impose an impossible administrative burden by requiring investigations to be continually reinvestigated. The information contained in the system may also include properly classified information, the release of which would pose a threat to national defense and/or foreign policy. In addition, permitting access and amendment to such information also could disclose sensitive security information, which could be detrimental to transportation security if released. This system may also include information necessary to make a determination as to an individual's qualifications, eligibility, or suitability for access to classified information, the release of which would reveal the identity of a source who received an express or implied assurance that their identity would not be revealed to the subject of the record.</P>
              <P>(3) From subsection (e)(1) (Relevancy and Necessity of Information) because in the course of gathering and analyzing information about potential threats to transportation security, the accuracy of information obtained or introduced occasionally may be unclear or the information may not be strictly relevant or necessary to a specific operation. In the interests of transportation security, it is appropriate to retain all information that may aid in identifying threats to transportation security and establishing other patterns of unlawful activity.</P>
              <P>(4) From subsections (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I) (Agency Requirements), and (f) (Agency Rules), because this system is exempt from the access and amendment provisions of subsection (d).</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Secure Flight Records.</E> (1) Secure Flight Records (DHS/TSA 019) enables TSA to maintain a system of records related to watch list matching applied to air passengers and to non-traveling individuals authorized to enter an airport sterile area. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) and (k)(2), TSA is claiming the following exemptions for certain records within the Secure Flight Records system: 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) and (4); (d)(1), (2), (3), and (4); (e)(1), (2), (3), (4)(G) through (I), (5), and (8); (f), and (g).</P>
              <P>(2) In addition to records under the control of TSA, the Secure Flight system of records may include records originating from systems of records of other law enforcement and intelligence agencies which may be exempt from certain provisions of the Privacy Act. However, TSA does not assert exemption to any provisions of the Privacy Act with respect to information submitted by or on behalf of individual passengers or non-travelers in the course of making a reservation or seeking access to a secured area under the Secure Flight program.</P>

              <P>(3) To the extent the Secure Flight system contains records originating from other systems of records, TSA will rely on the exemptions claimed for those records in the originating system of records. Exemptions for certain records within the Secure Flight Records system from particular subsections of the Privacy Act are justified for the following reasons:<PRTPAGE P="282"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) From subsection (c)(3) (Accounting for Disclosures) because giving a record subject access to the accounting of disclosures from records concerning him or her could reveal investigative interest on the part of the recipient agency that obtained the record pursuant to a routine use. Disclosure of the accounting could therefore present a serious impediment to law enforcement efforts on the part of the recipient agency because the individual who is the subject of the record would learn of third agency investigative interests and could take steps to evade detection or apprehension. Disclosure of the accounting also could reveal the details of watch list matching measures under the Secure Flight program, as well as capabilities and vulnerabilities of the watch list matching process, the release of which could permit an individual to evade future detection and thereby impede efforts to ensure transportation security.</P>
              <P>(ii) From subsection (c)(4) because portions of this system are exempt from the access and amendment provisions of subsection (d).</P>
              <P>(iii) From subsections (d)(1), (2), (3), and (4) because these provisions concern individual access to and amendment of certain records contained in this system, including law enforcement counterterrorism, investigatory and intelligence records. Compliance with these provisions could alert the subject of an investigation of the fact and nature of the investigation, and/or the investigative interest of intelligence or law enforcement agencies; compromise sensitive information related to national security; interfere with the overall law enforcement process by leading to the destruction of evidence, improper influencing of witnesses, fabrication of testimony, and/or flight of the subject; identify a confidential source or disclose information which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of another's personal privacy; reveal a sensitive investigative or intelligence technique; or constitute a potential danger to the health or safety of law enforcement personnel, confidential informants, and witnesses. Amendment of these records would interfere with ongoing counterterrorism, law enforcement, or intelligence investigations and analysis activities and impose an impossible administrative burden by requiring investigations, analyses, and reports to be continuously reinvestigated and revised.</P>
              <P>(iv) From subsection (e)(1) because it is not always possible for TSA or other agencies to know in advance what information is both relevant and necessary for it to complete an identity comparison between aviation passengers or certain non-travelers and a known or suspected terrorist. In addition, because TSA and other agencies may not always know what information about an encounter with a known or suspected terrorist will be relevant to law enforcement for the purpose of conducting an operational response.</P>
              <P>(v) From subsection (e)(2) because application of this provision could present a serious impediment to counterterrorism, law enforcement, or intelligence efforts in that it would put the subject of an investigation, study or analysis on notice of that fact, thereby permitting the subject to engage in conduct designed to frustrate or impede that activity. The nature of counterterrorism, law enforcement, or intelligence investigations is such that vital information about an individual frequently can be obtained only from other persons who are familiar with such individual and his/her activities. In such investigations, it is not feasible to rely upon information furnished by the individual concerning his own activities.</P>
              <P>(vi) From subsection (e)(3), to the extent that this subsection is interpreted to require TSA to provide notice to an individual if TSA or another agency receives or collects information about that individual during an investigation or from a third party. Should the subsection be so interpreted, exemption from this provision is necessary to avoid impeding counterterrorism, law enforcement, or intelligence efforts by putting the subject of an investigation, study or analysis on notice of that fact, thereby permitting the subject to engage in conduct intended to frustrate or impede that activity.</P>

              <P>(vii) From subsections (e)(4)(G) and (H) (Agency Requirements) and (f) (Agency Rules), because this system is <PRTPAGE P="283"/>exempt from the access provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(d).</P>
              <P>(viii) From subsection (e)(5) because many of the records in this system coming from other system of records are derived from other domestic and foreign agency record systems and therefore it is not possible for TSA to ensure their compliance with this provision, however, TSA has implemented internal quality assurance procedures to ensure that data used in the watch list matching process is as thorough, accurate, and current as possible. In addition, in the collection of information for law enforcement, counterterrorism, and intelligence purposes, it is impossible to determine in advance what information is accurate, relevant, timely, and complete. With the passage of time, seemingly irrelevant or untimely information may acquire new significance as further investigation brings new details to light. The restrictions imposed by (e)(5) would limit the ability of those agencies' trained investigators and intelligence analysts to exercise their judgment in conducting investigations and impede the development of intelligence necessary for effective law enforcement and counterterrorism efforts. However, TSA has implemented internal quality assurance procedures to ensure that the data used in the watch list matching process is as thorough, accurate, and current as possible.</P>
              <P>(ix) From subsection (e)(8) because to require individual notice of disclosure of information due to compulsory legal process would pose an impossible administrative burden on TSA and other agencies and could alert the subjects of counterterrorism, law enforcement, or intelligence investigations to the fact of those investigations when not previously known.</P>
              <P>(x) From subsection (f) (Agency Rules) because portions of this system are exempt from the access and amendment provisions of subsection (d).</P>
              <P>(xi) From subsection (g) to the extent that the system is exempt from other specific subsections of the Privacy Act.</P>

              <P>When filling out this form, the responding air carrier or foreign air carrier shall include all costs incurred in calendar year 2000 by that air carrier for the screening of passengers and property. Costs are those attributed to the screening of passengers and property in the United States for both flights within the United States and flights from the United States to foreign destinations. Reported costs must be consistent with the air carrier's financial accounting information reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.</P>
              <P>Where actual costs of screening passengers and property cannot be directly identified through an air carrier's accounting system, the air carrier shall use an appropriate alternate cost assignment methodology. Documentation that explains and supports the assignment methodology used, the applicable pool and the allocation basis must be made available upon request. For costs related to capitalized property, please report the associated depreciation expense incurred during calendar year 2000. Capitalization policy must also be made available upon request.</P>
              <P>To the extent necessary, the reporting air carrier may aggregate those specific costs that have been incurred but cannot be stated in the detailed cost categories requested by this form. However, all of the costs identified by this form must be included in the total calculations. In addition, explanations regarding costs that have been aggregated need to be provided. Costs reported in Appendix A do not need to include costs that may have been incurred for a position higher than those of the air carrier's director of security (or equivalent). Costs incurred for higher positions, such as those of the air carrier's chief executive officer, do not need to be included.</P>
              <P>When including cost information on acquired and/or merged air carriers, the successor air carrier must specify the names of all of such entities whose calendar year 2000 passenger and property screening costs are included in that air carrier's submission as Appendix A.</P>
              <P>The costs listed below are to be in US dollars, rounded to the nearest dollar. Place a zero in the appropriate box to indicate cost categories in which the air carrier did not incur costs for passenger and property screening in calendar year 2000.</P>

              <P>(1) <E T="03">Initiating an appeal.</E> An applicant initiates an appeal by submitting a written reply to TSA, a written request for materials from TSA, or by requesting an extension of time in accordance with § 1515.5(f). If the applicant does not initiate an appeal within 60 days of receipt, the Initial Determination of Threat Assessment becomes a Final Determination of Threat Assessment.</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Final Determination of Threat Assessment.</E> (1) If the Assistant Administrator concludes that an HME or TWIC applicant does not meet the standards described in 49 CFR 1572.103, 1572.105, or 1572.109, TSA serves a Final Determination of Threat Assessment upon the applicant. In addition—</P>
              <P>(i) In the case of an HME, TSA serves a Final Determination of Threat Assessment on the licensing State.</P>
              <P>(ii) In the case of a TWIC, TSA serves a Final Determination of Threat Assessment on the Coast Guard.</P>

              </P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Withdrawal of Initial Determination.</E> If the Assistant Administrator or Assistant Secretary concludes that the applicant does not pose a security threat, TSA serves a Withdrawal of the Initial Determination upon the applicant, and the applicant's employer where applicable.</P>

              <P>(f) <E T="03">Extension of time.</E> TSA may grant an applicant an extension of time of the limits for good cause shown. An applicant's request for an extension of time must be in writing and be received by TSA within a reasonable time before the due date to be extended; or an applicant may request an extension after the expiration of a due date by sending a written request describing why the failure to file within the time limits was excusable. TSA may grant itself an extension of time for good cause.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Judicial review.</E> For purposes of judicial review, the Final Determination of Threat Assessment constitutes a final TSA order of the determination that the applicant does not meet the standards for a security threat assessment, in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 46110. The Final Determination is not a final TSA order to grant or deny a waiver, the procedures for which are in 49 CFR 1515.7 and 1515.11.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Appeal of immediate revocation.</E> If TSA directs an immediate revocation, the applicant may appeal this determination by following the appeal procedures described in paragraph (b) of this section. This applies—</P>
              <P>(1) If TSA directs a State to revoke an HME pursuant to 49 CFR 1572.13(a).</P>
              <P>(2) If TSA invalidates a TWIC by issuing an Initial Determination of Threat Assessment and Immediate Revocation pursuant to 49 CFR 1572.21(d)(3).</P>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Security background check.</E> Prior to providing SSI to a person under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, TSA or the Coast Guard may require the individual or, in the case of an entity, the individuals representing the entity, and their counsel, to undergo and satisfy, in the judgment of TSA or the Coast Guard, a security background check.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Other conditional disclosure.</E> TSA may authorize a conditional disclosure of specific records or information that constitute SSI upon the written determination by TSA that disclosure of such records or information, subject to such limitations and restrictions as TSA may prescribe, would not be detrimental to transportation security.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Obligation to protect information.</E> When an individual receives SSI pursuant to paragraph (d) or (e) of this section that individual becomes a covered person under § 1520.7 and is subject to the obligations of a covered person under this part.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">No release under FOIA.</E> When TSA discloses SSI pursuant to paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section, TSA makes the disclosure for the sole purpose described in that paragraph.

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Fees for security threat assessment.</E> (1) TSA routinely establishes and collects fees to conduct the security threat assessment process. These fees apply to all entities requesting a security threat assessment. TSA reviews the amount of the fee periodically, at least once every two years, to determine the current cost of conducting security threat assessments. TSA determines fee amounts and any necessary revisions to the fee amounts based on current costs, using a method of analysis consistent with widely accepted accounting principles and practices, and calculated in accordance with the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 9701 and other applicable Federal law.</P>

                <P>(2) TSA will publish fee amounts and any revisions to the fee amounts as a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>

                <P>(1) <E T="03">Notice of proposed withdrawal of approval.</E> TSA will serve a Notice of Proposed Withdrawal of Approval, which notifies the holder of the security program, in writing, of the facts, charges, and applicable law, regulation, or order that form the basis of the determination.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Security program holder's reply.</E> The holder of the security program may respond to the Notice of Proposed Withdrawal of Approval no later than 15 calendar days after receipt of the withdrawal by providing the designated official, in writing, with any material facts, arguments, applicable law, and regulation.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">TSA review.</E> The designated official will consider all information available, including any relevant material or information submitted by the holder of the security program, before either issuing a Withdrawal of Approval of the security program or rescinding the Notice of Proposed Withdrawal of Approval. If TSA issues a Withdrawal of Approval, it becomes effective upon receipt by the holder of the security program, or 15 calendar days after service, whichever occurs first.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Petition for reconsideration.</E> The holder of the security program may petition TSA to reconsider its Withdrawal of Approval by serving a petition for consideration no later than 15 calendar days after the holder of the security program receives the Withdrawal of Approval. The holder of the security program must serve the Petition for Reconsideration on the designated official. Submission of a Petition for Reconsideration will not stay the Withdrawal of Approval. The holder of the security program may request the designated official to stay the Withdrawal of Approval pending review of and decision on the Petition.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Assistant Secretary's review.</E> The designated official transmits the Petition together with all pertinent information to the Assistant Secretary for reconsideration. The Assistant Secretary will dispose of the Petition within 15 calendar days of receipt by either directing the designated official to rescind the Withdrawal of Approval or by affirming the Withdrawal of Approval. The decision of the Assistant Secretary constitutes a final agency order subject to judicial review in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 46110.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">Emergency withdrawal.</E> If TSA finds that there is an emergency with respect to aviation security requiring immediate action that makes the procedures in this section contrary to the public interest, the designated official may issue an Emergency Withdrawal of Approval of a security program without first issuing a Notice of Proposed Withdrawal of Approval. The Emergency Withdrawal would be effective on the date that the holder of the security program receives the emergency withdrawal. In such a case, the designated official will send the holder of the security program a brief statement of the facts, charges, applicable law, regulation, or order that forms the basis for the Emergency Withdrawal. The holder of the security program may submit a Petition for Reconsideration under the procedures in paragraphs (b)(4) through (b)(5) of this section; however, this petition will not stay the effective date of the Emergency Withdrawal.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Service of documents for withdrawal of approval of security program proceedings.</E> Service may be accomplished by personal delivery, certified mail, or express courier. Documents served on the holder of a security program will be served at its official place of business as designated in its application for approval or its security program. Documents served on TSA must be served to the address noted in the Notice of Withdrawal of Approval or Withdrawal of Approval, whichever is applicable.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Certificate of service.</E> An individual may attach a certificate of service to a document tendered for filing. A certificate of service must consist of a statement, dated and signed by the person filing the document, that the document <PRTPAGE P="327"/>was personally delivered, served by certified mail on a specific date, or served by express courier on a specific date.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Date of service.</E> The date of service is—</P>
                <P>(i) The date of personal delivery;</P>
                <P>(ii) If served by certified mail, the mailing date shown on the certificate of service, the date shown on the postmark if there is no certificate of service, or other mailing date shown by other evidence if there is no certificate of service or postmark; or</P>
                <P>(iii) If served by express courier, the service date shown on the certificate of service, or by other evidence if there is no certificate of service.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Extension of time.</E> TSA may grant an extension of time to the limits set forth in this section for good cause shown. A security program holder must submit a request for an extension of time in writing, and TSA must receive it at least two days before the due date in order to be considered. TSA may grant itself an extension of time for good cause.</P>

                <P>(a) Each airport operator must designate one or more Airport Security Coordinator(s) (ASC) in its security program.</P>

                <P>(b) The airport operator must ensure that one or more ASCs:<PRTPAGE P="328"/>
                </P>
                <P>(1) Serve as the airport operator's primary and immediate contact for security-related activities and communications with TSA. Any individual designated as an ASC may perform other duties in addition to those described in this paragraph (b).</P>
                <P>(2) Is available to TSA on a 24-hour basis.</P>
                <P>(3) Review with sufficient frequency all security-related functions to ensure that all are effective and in compliance with this part, its security program, and applicable Security Directives.</P>
                <P>(4) Immediately initiate corrective action for any instance of non-compliance with this part, its security program, and applicable Security Directives.</P>

                <P>(6) Serve as the contact to receive notification from individuals applying for unescorted access of their intent to seek correction of their criminal history record with the FBI.</P>
                <P>(c) After July 17, 2003, no airport operator may use, nor may it designate any person as, an ASC unless that individual has completed subject matter training, as specified in its security program, to prepare the individual to assume the duties of the position. The airport operator must maintain ASC training documentation until at least 180 days after the withdrawal of an individual's designation as an ASC.</P>
                <P>(d) An individual's satisfactory completion of initial ASC training required under paragraph (c) of this section satisfies that requirement for all future ASC designations for that individual, except for site specific information, unless there has been a two or more year break in service as an active and designated ASC.</P>

Such requests will be processed as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) The designated official, within 30 days after receiving the proposed security program, will either approve the program or give the airport operator written notice to modify the program to comply with the applicable requirements of this part.</P>
                <P>(2) The airport operator may either submit a modified security program to the designated official for approval, or petition the Administrator to reconsider the notice to modify within 30 days of receiving a notice to modify. A petition for reconsideration must be filed with the designated official.</P>

                <P>(3) The designated official, upon receipt of a petition for reconsideration, either amends or withdraws the notice, or transmits the petition, together with any pertinent information, to the Administrator for reconsideration. The Administrator disposes of the petition <PRTPAGE P="331"/>within 30 days of receipt by either directing the designated official to withdraw or amend the notice to modify, or by affirming the notice to modify.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Amendment requested by an airport operator.</E> Except as provided in § 1542.103(c), an airport operator may submit a request to the designated official to amend its security program, as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) The request for an amendment must be filed with the designated official at least 45 days before the date it proposes for the amendment to become effective, unless a shorter period is allowed by the designated official.</P>
                <P>(2) Within 30 days after receiving a proposed amendment, the designated official, in writing, either approves or denies the request to amend.</P>
                <P>(3) An amendment to a security program may be approved if the designated official determines that safety and the public interest will allow it, and the proposed amendment provides the level of security required under this part.</P>
                <P>(4) Within 30 days after receiving a denial, the airport operator may petition the Administrator to reconsider the denial.</P>
                <P>(5) Upon receipt of a petition for reconsideration, the designated official either approves the request to amend or transmits the petition within 30 days of receipt, together with any pertinent information, to the Administrator for reconsideration. The Administrator disposes of the petition within 30 days of receipt by either directing the designated official to approve the amendment or affirming the denial.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Amendment by TSA.</E> If safety and the public interest require an amendment, the designated official may amend a security program as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) The designated official sends to the airport operator a notice, in writing, of the proposed amendment, fixing a period of not less than 30 days within which the airport operator may submit written information, views, and arguments on the amendment.</P>
                <P>(2) After considering all relevant material, the designated official notifies the airport operator of any amendment adopted or rescinds the notice. If the amendment is adopted, it becomes effective not less than 30 days after the airport operator receives the notice of amendment, unless the airport operator petitions the Administrator to reconsider no later than 15 days before the effective date of the amendment. The airport operator must send the petition for reconsideration to the designated official. A timely petition for reconsideration stays the effective date of the amendment.</P>
                <P>(3) Upon receipt of a petition for reconsideration, the designated official either amends or withdraws the notice, or transmits the petition, together with any pertinent information to the Administrator for reconsideration. The Administrator disposes of the petition within 30 days of receipt by either directing the designated official to withdraw or amend the amendment, or by affirming the amendment.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Emergency amendments.</E> Notwithstanding paragraph (c) of this section, if the designated official finds that there is an emergency requiring immediate action with respect to safety and security in air transportation or in air commerce that makes procedures in this section contrary to the public interest, the designated official may issue an amendment, effective without stay on the date the airport operator receives the notice of it. In such a case, the designated official must incorporate in the notice a brief statement of the reasons and findings for the amendment to be adopted. The airport operator may file a petition for reconsideration under paragraph (c) of this section; however, this does not stay the effective date of the emergency amendment.</P>

                <P>(1) The designated official notifies the aircraft operator, in writing, of the proposed amendment, fixing a period of not less than 30 days within which the aircraft operator may submit written information, views, and arguments on the amendment.</P>
                <P>(2) After considering all relevant material, the designated official notifies the aircraft operator of any amendment adopted or rescinds the notice. If the amendment is adopted, it becomes effective not less than 30 days after the aircraft operator receives the notice of amendment, unless the aircraft operator petitions the Administrator to reconsider no later than 15 days before the effective date of the amendment. The aircraft operator must send the petition for reconsideration to the designated official. A timely petition for reconsideration stays the effective date of the amendment.</P>
                <P>(3) Upon receipt of a petition for reconsideration, the designated official either amends or withdraws the notice or transmits the petition, together with any pertinent information, to the Administrator for reconsideration.

                <P>(d) <E T="03">Emergency amendments.</E> If the designated official finds that there is an emergency requiring immediate action with respect to safety in air transportation or in air commerce that makes procedures in this section contrary to the public interest, the designated official may issue an amendment, without the prior notice and comment procedures in paragraph (c) of this section, effective without stay on the date the aircraft operator receives notice of it. In such a case, the designated official will incorporate in the notice a brief statement of the reasons and findings for the amendment to be adopted. The aircraft operator may file a petition for reconsideration under paragraph (c) of this section; however, this does not stay the effective date of the emergency amendment.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Initial acceptance of security program.</E> Unless otherwise authorized by TSA, each foreign air carrier required to have a security program by this part must submit its proposed program to TSA at least 90 days before the intended date of passenger operations. TSA will notify the foreign air carrier of the security program's acceptability, or the need to modify the proposed security program for it to be acceptable under this part, within 30 days after receiving the proposed security program. The foreign air carrier may petition TSA to reconsider the notice to modify the security program within 30 days after receiving a notice to modify.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Amendment requested by a foreign air carrier.</E> A foreign air carrier may submit a request to TSA to amend its accepted security program as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) The proposed amendment must be filed with the designated official at least 45 calendar days before the date it proposes for the amendment to become effective, unless a shorter period is allowed by the designated official.</P>
                <P>(2) Within 30 calendar days after receiving a proposed amendment, the designated official, in writing, either approves or denies the request to amend.</P>
                <P>(3) An amendment to a foreign air carrier security program may be approved if the designated official determines that safety and the public interest will allow it, and the proposed amendment provides the level of security required under this part.</P>
                <P>(4) Within 45 calendar days after receiving a denial, the foreign air carrier may petition the Administrator to reconsider the denial. A petition for reconsideration must be filed with the designated official.</P>
                <P>(5) Upon receipt of a petition for reconsideration, the designated official either approves the request to amend or transmits the petition, together with any pertinent information, to the Administrator for reconsideration. The Administrator disposes of the petition within 30 calendar days of receipt by either directing the designated official to approve the amendment, or affirming the denial.</P>
                <P>(6) Any foreign air carrier may submit a group proposal for an amendment that is on behalf of it and other aircraft operators that co-sign the proposal.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Amendment by TSA.</E> If the safety and the public interest require an amendment, the designated official may amend an accepted security program as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) The designated official notifies the foreign air carrier, in writing, of the proposed amendment, fixing a period of not less than 45 calendar days within which the foreign air carrier may submit written information, views, and arguments on the amendment.</P>

                <P>(2) After considering all relevant material, the designated official notifies the foreign air carrier of any amendment adopted or rescinds the notice. If the amendment is adopted, it becomes effective not less than 30 calendar days after the foreign air carrier receives the notice of amendment, unless the foreign air carrier petitions the Administrator to reconsider no later than 15 <PRTPAGE P="374"/>calendar days before the effective date of the amendment. The foreign air carrier must send the petition for reconsideration to the designated official. A timely petition for reconsideration stays the effective date of the amendment.</P>
                <P>(3) Upon receipt of a petition for reconsideration, the designated official either amends or withdraws the notice or transmits the petition, together with any pertinent information, to the Administrator for reconsideration. The Administrator disposes of the petition within 30 calendar days of receipt by either directing the designated official to withdraw or amend the amendment, or by affirming the amendment.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Emergency amendments.</E> If the designated official finds that there is an emergency requiring immediate action with respect to safety in air transportation or in air commerce that makes procedures in this section contrary to the public interest, the designated official may issue an amendment, without the prior notice and comment procedures in paragraph (c) of this section, effective without stay on the date the foreign air carrier receives notice of it. In such a case, the designated official will incorporate in the notice a brief statement of the reasons and findings for the amendment to be adopted. The foreign air carrier may file a petition for reconsideration under paragraph (c) of this section; however, this does not stay the effectiveness of the emergency amendment.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Use of X-ray systems.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">TSA authorization required.</E> No foreign air carrier may use any X-ray system within the United States to screen accessible property or checked baggage, unless specifically authorized under its security program. No foreign air carrier may use such a system in a manner contrary to its security program. TSA authorizes foreign air carriers to use X-ray systems for inspecting accessible property or checked baggage under a security program if the foreign air carrier shows that—</P>
                <P>(1) The system meets the standards for cabinet X-ray systems primarily for the inspection of baggage issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and published in 21 CFR 1020.40;</P>
                <P>(2) A program for initial and recurrent training of operators of the system is established, which includes training in radiation safety, the efficient use of X-ray systems, and the identification of weapons, explosives, and incendiaries; and</P>
                <P>(3) The system meets the imaging requirements set forth in its security program using the step wedge specified in American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) Standard F792-88 (Reapproved 1993). This standard is incorporated by reference in paragraph (g) of this section.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Annual radiation survey.</E> No foreign air carrier may use any X-ray system unless, within the preceding 12 calendar months, a radiation survey is conducted that shows that the system meets the applicable performance standards in 21 CFR 1020.40.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Radiation survey after installation or moving.</E> No foreign air carrier may use any X-ray system after the system has been installed at a screening point or after the system has been moved unless a radiation survey is conducted which shows that the system meets the applicable performance standards in 21 CFR 1020.40. A radiation survey is not required for an X-ray system that is designed and constructed as a mobile unit and the foreign air carrier shows that it can be moved without altering its performance.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Defect notice or modification order.</E> No foreign air carrier may use any X-ray system that is not in full compliance with any defect notice or modification order issued for that system by the FDA, unless the FDA has advised <PRTPAGE P="377"/>TSA that the defect or failure to comply does not create a significant risk of injury, including genetic injury, to any person.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Signs and inspection of photographic equipment and film.</E> (1) At locations at which a foreign air carrier uses an X-ray system to inspect accessible property the foreign air carrier must ensure that a sign is posted in a conspicuous place at the screening checkpoint.</P>
                <P>(2) At locations at which a foreign air carrier or TSA uses an X-ray system to inspect checked baggage the foreign air carrier must ensure that a sign is posted in a conspicuous place where the foreign air carrier accepts checked baggage.</P>
                <P>(3) The signs required under this paragraph must notify individuals that such items are being inspected by an X-ray and advise them to remove all X-ray, scientific, and high-speed film from accessible property and checked baggage before inspection. This sign must also advise individuals that they may request that an inspection be made of their photographic equipment and film packages without exposure to an X-ray system. If the X-ray system exposes any accessible property or checked baggage to more than one milliroentgen during the inspection, the sign must advise individuals to remove film of all kinds from their articles before inspection.</P>
                <P>(4) If requested by individuals, their photographic equipment and film packages must be inspected without exposure to an X-ray system.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Radiation survey verification after installation or moving.</E> Each foreign air carrier must maintain at least one copy of the results of the most recent radiation survey conducted under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section and must make it available for inspection upon request by TSA at each of the following locations—</P>
                <P>(1) The foreign air carrier's principal business office; and</P>
                <P>(2) The place where the X-ray system is in operation.</P>

Each indirect air carrier that does not currently hold a security program under part 1548, and that offers cargo to an aircraft operator operating under a full all-cargo program or a comparable operation by a foreign air carrier must comply with this section not later than December 1, 2006.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">General requirements.</E> (1) The security program must provide for the security of the aircraft, as well as that of persons and property traveling in air transportation against acts of criminal violence and air piracy and against the introduction into the aircraft of any unauthorized person, and any unauthorized explosive, incendiary, and other destructive substance or item as provided in the indirect air carrier's security program. This requirement applies—</P>
              <P>(i) From the time the indirect air carrier accepts the cargo to the time it transfers the cargo to an entity that is not an employee or agent of the indirect air carrier;</P>
              <P>(ii) While the cargo is stored, en route, or otherwise being handled by an employee or agent of the indirect air carrier; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Regardless of whether the indirect air carrier has or ever had physical possession of the cargo.</P>
              <P>(2) The indirect air carrier must ensure that its employees and agents carry out the requirements of this chapter and the indirect air carrier's security program.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Content.</E> Each security program under this part must—</P>
              <P>(1) Be designed to prevent or deter the introduction of any unauthorized person, and any unauthorized explosive, incendiary, and other destructive substance or item onto an aircraft.</P>

              <P>(2) Have accessible a complete copy, or the pertinent portions of its security program, or appropriate implementing instructions, at each office where cargo is accepted. An electronic version is adequate.</P>
              <P>(3) Make a copy of the security program available for inspection upon the request of TSA.</P>

              <P>(4) Restrict the distribution, disclosure, and availability of information contained in its security program to persons with a need to know, as described in part 1520 of this chapter.<PRTPAGE P="383"/>

              <EXTRACT>
                <P>[Name of indirect air carrier] (hereinafter “the IAC”) has adopted and is currently carrying out a security program in accordance with the Transportation Security Regulations as originally approved on [Insert date of TSA initial approval]. In accordance with TSA regulations, the IAC has notified TSA of any new or changed information required for the IAC's initial security program. If new or changed information is being submitted to TSA as part of this application for reapproval, that information is stated in this filing.</P>
                <P>The IAC understands that intentional falsification of certification to an air carrier or to TSA may be subject to both civil and criminal penalties under 49 CFR 1540 and 1548 and 18 U.S.C. 1001. Failure to notify TSA of any new or changed information required for initial approval of the IAC's security program in a timely fashion and in a form acceptable to TSA may result in withdrawal by TSA of approval of the IAC's security program.</P>
              </EXTRACT>
              
              <P>(3) TSA will renew approval of the security program if TSA determines that—</P>

              <P>(ii) The renewal of its security program is not contrary to the interests of security and the public interest.</P>
              <P>(4) If TSA determines that the indirect air carrier meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, it will renew the indirect air carrier's security program. The security program will remain effective until the end of the calendar month one year after the month it was renewed.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Amendment requested by an indirect air carrier or applicant.</E> An indirect air carrier or applicant may file a request for an amendment to its security program with the TSA designated official at least 45 calendar days before the date it proposes for the amendment to become effective, unless the designated official allows a shorter period. Any indirect air carrier may submit a group proposal for an amendment that is on behalf of it and other indirect air carriers that co-sign the proposal.</P>
              <P>(1) Within 30 calendar days after receiving a proposed amendment, the designated official, in writing, either approves or denies the request to amend.</P>
              <P>(2) An amendment to an indirect air carrier security program may be approved, if the designated official determines that safety and the public interest will allow it, and if the proposed amendment provides the level of security required under this part.</P>
              <P>(3) Within 30 calendar days after receiving a denial of the proposed amendment, the indirect air carrier may petition TSA to reconsider the denial. A petition for reconsideration must be filed with the designated official.</P>
              <P>(4) Upon receipt of a petition for reconsideration, the designated official either approves the request to amend or transmits the petition, together with any pertinent information, to the TSA for reconsideration. TSA will dispose of the petition within 30 calendar days of receipt by either directing the designated official to approve the amendment or by affirming the denial.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Amendment by TSA.</E> TSA may amend a security program in the interest of safety and the public interest, as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) TSA notifies the indirect air carrier, in writing, of the proposed amendment, fixing a period of not less than 30 calendar days within which the indirect air carrier may submit written information, views, and arguments on the amendment.</P>

              <P>(2) After considering all relevant material, the designated official notifies the indirect air carrier of any amendment adopted or rescinds the notice of amendment. If the amendment is adopted, it becomes effective not less than 30 calendar days after the indirect air carrier receives the notice of amendment, unless the indirect air carrier disagrees with the proposed amendment and petitions the TSA to reconsider, no later than 15 calendar <PRTPAGE P="385"/>days before the effective date of the amendment. The indirect air carrier must send the petition for reconsideration to the designated official. A timely petition for reconsideration stays the effective date of the amendment.</P>
              <P>(3) Upon receipt of a petition for reconsideration, the designated official either amends or withdraws the notice of amendment, or transmits the petition, together with any pertinent information, to TSA for reconsideration. TSA disposes of the petition within 30 calendar days of receipt, either by directing the designated official to withdraw or amend the notice of amendment, or by affirming the notice of amendment.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Emergency Amendments.</E> (1) If TSA finds that there is an emergency requiring immediate action, with respect to aviation security that makes procedures in this section contrary to the public interest, the designated official may issue an emergency amendment, without the prior notice and comment procedures described in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) The emergency amendment is effective without stay on the date the indirect air carrier receives notification. TSA will incorporate in the notification a brief statement of the reasons and findings for the emergency amendment to be adopted.</P>
              <P>(3) The indirect air carrier may file a petition for reconsideration with the TSA no later than 15 calendar days after TSA issued the emergency amendment. The indirect air carrier must send the petition for reconsideration to the designated official; however, the filing does not stay the effective date of the emergency amendment.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Withdrawal of approval of a security program.</E> Section 1540.301 includes procedures for withdrawal of approval of a security program.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Service of documents for withdrawal of approval of security program proceedings.</E> Service may be accomplished by personal delivery, certified mail, or express courier. Documents served on an indirect air carrier will be served at the indirect air carrier's official place of business as designated in its application for approval or its security program. Documents served on TSA must be served to the address noted in the notice of withdrawal of approval or withdrawal of approval, whichever is applicable.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Certificate of service.</E> An individual may attach a certificate of service to a document tendered for filing. A certificate of service must consist of a statement, dated and signed by the person filing the document, that the document was personally delivered, served by certified mail on a specific date, or served by express courier on a specific date.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Date of service.</E> The date of service will be—</P>

              <P>(h) <E T="03">Extension of time.</E> TSA may grant an extension of time of the limits set forth in this section for good cause shown. An indirect air carrier's request for an extension of time must be in writing and be received by TSA at least 2 days before the due date to be extended.

Failure to notify TSA of any new or changed information required for initial approval of the CCSF's security program in a timely fashion and in a form acceptable to TSA may result in withdrawal by TSA of approval of the CCSF's security program.</P>
                </EXTRACT>
                
                <P>(4) TSA will renew approval of the security program if TSA determines that—</P>
                <P>(i) The CCSF has met the requirements of this chapter, its security program, and any Security Directive; and</P>
                <P>(ii) The renewal of its security program is not contrary to the interests of security and the public interest.</P>
                <P>(5) If TSA determines that the certified cargo screening facility meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, it will renew the certified cargo screening facility's security program and certification. The security program and certification will remain effective until the end of the calendar month three years after the month it was renewed.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Amendment requested by a certified cargo screening entity or applicant.</E> A certified cargo screening facility or applicant may file a request for an <PRTPAGE P="392"/>amendment to its security program with the TSA designated official at least 45 calendar days before the date it proposes for the amendment to become effective, unless the designated official allows a shorter period. Any certified cargo screening facility may submit to TSA a group proposal for an amendment that is on behalf of it and other certified cargo screening facilities that co-sign the proposal.</P>
                <P>(1) Within 30 calendar days after receiving a proposed amendment, the designated official, in writing, either approves or denies the request to amend.</P>
                <P>(2) TSA may approve an amendment to a certified cargo screening facility's security program, if the TSA designated official determines that safety and the public interest will allow it, and if the proposed amendment provides the level of security required under this part.</P>
                <P>(3) Within 30 calendar days after receiving a denial of the proposed amendment, the certified cargo screening facility may petition TSA to reconsider the denial. The CCSF must file the Petition for Reconsideration with the designated official.</P>
                <P>(4) Upon receipt of a Petition for Reconsideration, the designated official either approves the request to amend or transmits the petition, together with any pertinent information, to TSA for reconsideration. TSA will dispose of the petition within 30 calendar days of receipt by either directing the designated official to approve the amendment or by affirming the denial.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Amendment by TSA.</E> TSA may amend a security program in the interest of safety and the public interest, as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) TSA notifies the certified cargo screening facility, in writing, of the proposed amendment, fixing a period of not less than 30 calendar days within which the certified cargo screening facility may submit written information, views, and arguments on the amendment.</P>
                <P>(2) After considering all relevant material, the designated official notifies the certified cargo screening facility of any amendment adopted or rescinds the notice of amendment. If the amendment is adopted, it becomes effective not less than 30 calendar days after the certified cargo screening facility receives the notice of amendment, unless the certified cargo screening facility disagrees with the proposed amendment and petitions the TSA to reconsider, no later than 15 calendar days before the effective date of the amendment. The certified cargo screening facility must send the petition for reconsideration to the designated official. A timely Petition for Reconsideration stays the effective date of the amendment.</P>
                <P>(3) Upon receipt of a Petition for Reconsideration, the designated official either amends or withdraws the notice of amendment, or transmits the Petition, together with any pertinent information, to TSA for reconsideration. TSA disposes of the Petition within 30 calendar days of receipt, either by directing the designated official to withdraw or amend the notice of amendment, or by affirming the notice of amendment.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Emergency amendments.</E> (1) If TSA finds that there is an emergency requiring immediate action, with respect to aviation security that makes procedures in this section contrary to the public interest, the designated official may issue an emergency amendment, without the prior notice and comment procedures described in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
                <P>(2) The emergency amendment is effective without stay on the date the certified cargo screening facility receives notification. TSA will incorporate in the notification a brief statement of the reasons and findings for the emergency amendment to be adopted.</P>
                <P>(3) The certified cargo screening facility may file a Petition for Reconsideration with the TSA no later than 15 calendar days after TSA issued the emergency amendment. The certified cargo screening facility must send the Petition for Reconsideration to the designated official; however, the filing does not stay the effective date of the emergency amendment.</P>

The repair station verifies the employee's employment history for the most recent 5-year period via telephone, email, or in writing. If the information is verified telephonically, the repair station must record the date of the communication and with whom the information was verified. If there is a gap in employment of six months or longer, without a satisfactory explanation of the gap, employment history is not verified. The repair station must retain employment history verification records for at least 180 days after the individual's employment ends. The repair station must maintain these records electronically or in hardcopy, and provide them to TSA upon request.</P>
                <P>(ii) Confirm an employee holds an airman certificate issued by the Federal Aviation Administration.</P>
                <P>(iii) Confirm an employee of a repair station located within the United States has obtained a security threat assessment or comparable security threat assessment pursuant to part 1540, subpart C of this chapter, such as by holding a SIDA identification media issued by an airport operator that holds a complete program under 49 CFR part 1542.</P>

                <P>(iv) Confirm an employee of a repair station located outside the United <PRTPAGE P="405"/>States has successfully completed a security threat assessment commensurate to a security threat assessment described in part 1540, subpart C of this chapter.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Denial of transport or sterile area access; designation for enhanced screening.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> (1) This section applies to each covered aircraft operator beginning on the date that TSA assumes the watch list matching function for the passengers and non-traveling individuals to whom that covered aircraft operator issues a boarding pass or other authorization to enter a sterile area. TSA will provide prior written notification to the covered aircraft operator no later than 60 days before the date on which it will assume the watch list matching function from that covered aircraft operator.<PRTPAGE P="412"/>
                </P>
                <P>(2) Prior to the date that TSA assumes the watch list matching function from a covered aircraft operator, the covered aircraft operator must comply with existing watch list matching procedures for passengers and non-traveling individuals, including denial of transport or sterile area access or designation for enhanced screening for individuals identified by the covered aircraft operator or TSA.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Watch list matching results.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a covered aircraft operator must not issue a boarding pass or other authorization to enter a sterile area to a passenger or a non-traveling individual, and must not allow that individual to board an aircraft or enter a sterile area, until TSA informs the covered aircraft operator of the results of watch list matching for that passenger or non-traveling individual, in response to the covered aircraft operator's most recent SFPD submission for that passenger or non-traveling individual.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Denial of boarding pass.</E> If TSA sends a covered aircraft operator a boarding pass printing result that says the passenger or non-traveling individual must be placed on inhibited status, the covered aircraft operator must not issue a boarding pass or other authorization to enter a sterile area to that individual and must not allow that individual to board an aircraft or enter a sterile area.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Selection for enhanced screening.</E> If TSA sends a covered aircraft operator a boarding pass printing result that says the passenger has been selected for enhanced screening at a security checkpoint, the covered aircraft operator may issue a boarding pass to that individual and must identify the individual for enhanced screening, in accordance with procedures approved by TSA. The covered aircraft operator must place a code on the boarding pass that meets the requirements described in the Consolidated User Guide. If TSA sends a covered aircraft operator a boarding pass printing result that says the non-traveling individual has been selected for enhanced screening at a security checkpoint, the covered aircraft operator must not issue an authorization to enter a sterile area to that individual.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Cleared for boarding or entry into a sterile area.</E> If TSA sends a covered aircraft operator a boarding pass printing result that instructs a covered aircraft operator that a passenger or non-traveling individual is cleared, the covered aircraft operator may issue a boarding pass or other authorization to enter a sterile area to that individual, unless required under another TSA requirement to identify the passenger or non-traveling individual for enhanced screening or to deny entry into the sterile area. The covered aircraft operator must place a code on the boarding pass or authorization to enter the sterile area that meets the requirements described in the Consolidated User Guide.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Override by a covered aircraft operator.</E> No covered aircraft operator may override a TSA boarding pass printing result that instructs a covered aircraft operator to place a passenger or non-traveling individual in an inhibited status or to identify a passenger or non-traveling individual for enhanced screening, unless explicitly authorized by TSA to do so.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Updated SFPD from covered aircraft operator.</E> When a covered aircraft operator sends updated SFPD to TSA under § 1560.101(d) for a passenger or non-traveling individual for whom TSA has already issued a boarding pass printing result, all previous TSA results concerning the passenger or non-traveling individual are voided. The covered aircraft operator may not issue a boarding pass or grant authorization to enter a sterile area until it receives an updated result from TSA authorizing the issuance of a boarding pass or authorization to enter a sterile area. Upon receiving an updated result from TSA, the covered aircraft operator must acknowledge receipt of the updated result, comply with the updated result, and disregard all previous boarding pass printing results.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">Updated boarding pass printing results from TSA.</E> After TSA sends a covered aircraft operator a result under paragraph (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of this section, TSA may receive additional information concerning the passenger or non-traveling individual and may send an updated boarding pass printing result concerning that passenger or <PRTPAGE P="413"/>non-traveling individual to the covered aircraft operator. Upon receiving an updated boarding pass printing result from TSA, the covered aircraft operator must acknowledge receipt of the updated result, comply with the updated result, and disregard all previous results.</P>
                <P>(7) <E T="03">Boarding pass issuance for covered flights to or overflying the United States.</E> Covered aircraft operators may permit another aircraft operator to issue a boarding pass for a covered flight departing from a foreign location to the United States or overflying the United States without regard to the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(6) of this section provided that—</P>
                <P>(i) Before allowing the individual to board the aircraft for a covered flight, the covered aircraft operator confirms that it has received a boarding pass printing result from DHS for individuals who are issued boarding passes under paragraph (b)(7) of this section;</P>
                <P>(ii) Before allowing the individual to board an aircraft for a covered flight, the covered aircraft operator applies the measures in its security program to prevent an individual for whom DHS has returned an inhibited status boarding pass printing result under paragraph (b)(1) of this section from boarding the aircraft; and</P>
                <P>(iii) The covered aircraft operator applies the measures in its security program, as provided in 49 CFR part 1544, subpart B or 49 CFR part 1546, subpart B, to ensure that an individual for whom DHS returns a Selectee result under paragraph (b)(2) of this section undergoes enhanced screening pursuant to the covered aircraft operator's security program prior to that individual boarding the aircraft.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Request for identification</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> If TSA has not informed the covered aircraft operator of the results of watch list matching for an individual by the time the individual attempts to check in, or informs the covered aircraft operator that an individual has been placed in inhibited status, the aircraft operator must request from the individual a verifying identity document pursuant to procedures in its security program., as provided in 49 CFR part 1544, subpart B or 49 CFR part 1546, subpart B. The individual must present a verifying identity document to the covered aircraft operator at the airport.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Transmission of Updated Secure Flight Passenger Data.</E> Upon reviewing a passenger's verifying identity document, the covered aircraft operator must transmit the SFPD elements from the individual's verifying identity document to TSA.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Provision of Passenger Resolution Information.</E> If requested by TSA, the covered aircraft operator must also provide to TSA the individual's Passenger Resolution Information as specified by TSA.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Exception for minors.</E> If a covered aircraft operator is required to obtain information from an individual's verifying identity document under this paragraph (c), and the individual is younger than 18 years of age and does not have a verifying identity document, TSA may, on a case-by-case basis, authorize the minor or an adult accompanying the minor to state the individual's full name and date of birth in lieu of providing a verifying identity document.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Failure to obtain identification.</E> If a passenger or non-traveling individual does not present a verifying identity document when requested by the covered aircraft operator, in order to comply with paragraph (c) of this section, the covered aircraft operator must not issue a boarding pass or give authorization to enter a sterile area to that individual and must not allow that individual to board an aircraft or enter a sterile area, unless otherwise authorized by TSA.</P>

                <P>(1) TSA notifies each covered aircraft operator in writing of a proposed AOIP, fixing a period of not less than 30 days within which the covered aircraft operator may submit written information, views, and arguments on the proposed AOIP.</P>
                <P>(2) After considering all relevant material, TSA's designated official notifies each covered aircraft operator of its AOIP. The AOIP becomes effective not less than 30 days after the covered aircraft operator receives the notice of its AOIP, unless the covered aircraft operator petitions the Assistant Secretary or designated official to reconsider no later than 15 days before the effective date of the AOIP. The covered aircraft operator must send the petition for reconsideration to the designated official. A timely petition for reconsideration stays the effective date of the AOIP.</P>
                <P>(3) Upon receipt of a petition for reconsideration, the designated official either amends the AOIP or transmits the petition, together with any pertinent information, to the Assistant Secretary or designee for reconsideration. The Assistant Secretary or designee disposes of the petition within 30 days of receipt by either directing the designated official to withdraw or amend the AOIP, or by affirming the AOIP.</P>
                <P>(4) TSA may, at its discretion, grant extensions to any schedule deadlines, on its own initiative or upon the request of a covered aircraft operator.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Incorporation into Security Program.</E> Once an AOIP is approved, the AOIP becomes part of the covered aircraft operator's security program as described in 49 CFR part 1544, subpart B, or 49 CFR part 1546, subpart B, as appropriate, and any amendments will be made in accordance with the procedures in those subparts.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Handling of Aircraft Operator Implementation Plan (AOIP).</E> An AOIP contains sensitive security information (SSI) and must be handled and protected in accordance with 49 CFR part 1520.</P>

                <P>(3) TSA will notify the public when a comparability determination is made.</P>
                <P>(4) An applicant, who has completed a security threat assessment that is determined to be comparable under this section to the threat assessment described in this part, must complete the enrollment process and provide biometric information to obtain a TWIC, if the applicant seeks unescorted access to a secure area of a vessel or facility. The applicant must pay the fee listed in 49 CFR 1572.503 for information collection/credential issuance.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Procedures for collection by States.</SUBJECT>
                <P>This section describes the procedures that a State, which collects fingerprints and applicant information under 49 CFR part 1572; and the procedures an individual who applies to obtain or renew an HME, for a CDL in that State, must follow for collection and transmission of the Threat Assessment Fee and the FBI Fee.</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Imposition of fees.</E> (1) An individual who applies to obtain or renew an HME, or the individuals' employer, must remit to the State the Threat Assessment Fee and the FBI Fee, in a form and manner approved by TSA and the State, when the individual submits the application for the HME to the State.</P>

                <P>(2) TSA shall publish the Threat Assessment Fee described in this subpart for an individual who applies to obtain or renew and HME as a Notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> TSA reviews the amount of the fees periodically, at least once every two years, to determine the current cost of conducting security threat assessments. Fee amounts and any necessary revisions to the fee amounts shall be determined by current costs, using a method of analysis consistent with widely accepted accounting principles and practices, and calculated in accordance with the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 9701 and other applicable Federal law.</P>
                <P>(3) The FBI Fee required for the FBI to process fingerprint identification records and name checks required under 49 CFR part 1572 is determined by the FBI under Public Law 101-515. If the FBI amends this fee, the individual must remit the amended fee.</P>

                <P>(3) Nothing in this subpart prevents a State from collecting any other fees that a State may impose on an individual who applies to obtain or renew an HME.</P>

                </P>

A State holds neither legal nor equitable interest in the Threat Assessment Fees, except for the right to retain any accrued interest on the principal amounts collected pursuant to this section.</P>
                <P>(3) A State must account for Threat Assessment Fees separately, but may commingle such fees with other sources of revenue.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Remittance of fees.</E> (1) TSA will generate and provide an invoice to a State on a monthly basis. The invoice will indicate the total fee dollars (number of applicants times the Threat Assessment Fee) that are due for the month.</P>

                <P>(3) TSA accepts Threat Assessment Fees only from a State, not from an individual applicant for an HME.</P>
                <P>(4) A State may retain any interest that accrues on the principal amounts collected between the date of collection and the date the Threat Assessment Fee is remitted to TSA, in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</P>
                <P>(5) A State may not retain any portion of the Threat Assessment Fee to offset the costs of collecting, handling, or remitting Threat Assessment Fees.</P>
                <P>(6) Threat Assessment Fees, remitted to TSA by a State, must be in U.S. currency, drawn on a U.S. bank, and made payable to the “Transportation Security Administration.”</P>
                <P>(7) Threat Assessment Fees must be remitted by check, money order, wire, or any other payment method acceptable to TSA.</P>
                <P>(8) TSA will not issue any refunds of Threat Assessment Fees.</P>
                <P>(9) If a State does not remit the Threat Assessment Fees for any month, TSA may decline to process any HME applications from that State.</P>
